ConfidentialPROTOCOL SUMMARY
Protocol Number: 20210034
Protocol Title: An Open Label, Two-Arm Study in Subjects with Chorioretinal Vascular 
Disease to Evaluate ABP 938 and Aflibercept (Eylea®) in a Prefilled Syringe.
Sponsor: Amgen Inc.
Study Phase: Phase 3B
Indication: Chorioretinal vascular disease (CVD)
Study Sites: Approximately 4 sites in the United States (US).
Rationale: Amgen is developing ABP 938 as a biosimilar candidate to Eylea® (aflibercept). To 
administer ABP 938 as an intravitreal (IVT) injection, Amgen has also developed a prefilled 
syringe (PFS). The study will investigate whether the ABP 938 PFS can be used effectively and 
safely by retina specialists to administer t he 2 mg dose of study drug, when descriptively 
compared to the US-licensed aflibercept PFS.
Objectives/Endpoints:
Objectives Endpoints
Primary
The primary objective for this study is to 
assess the ability of retina specialists to 
successfully administer, via an IVT injection,
a 2 mg dose of ABP 938, using the ABP 938 
PFS, compared to a 2 mg dose of aflibercept 
using the aflibercept PFS.The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of IVT injections successfully 
administered to subjects with CVD by retina 
specialists, utilizing the ABP 938 PFS or 
aflibercept PFS.
Secondary
The secondary objective is to assess the safety of ABP 938 administered to subjects with CVD via an IVT injection, using the ABP 
938 PFS compared to aflibercept 
administered using the aflibercept PFS.The secondary endpoint for the study is the incidence of ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) in the 
study eye, and non-ocular SAEs until the 
end of study visit (Day 28 visit).
Study Design: This is an open label, two-arm, randomized, multi-site study within the US in 
adult subjects with CVD, including neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD), 
diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), or 
diabetic retinopathy (DR). Randomization will be stratified by retina specialist.
The study consists of a screening visit (Day -1), a baseline visit (Day 1) and an end of study 
visit (Day 28 ± 7 days). The screening and baseline visit may be combined into one visit (Day 1).
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 8 of 61
ConfidentialStudy Procedures: After providing informed consen t, subjects will be screened.  After 
screening assessments are completed and if subjec t eligibility is confirmed, the s ubject will be 
enrolled into the study and randomized to either receive a single IVT injection of ABP 938 in a 
PFS or a single injection of aflibercept in a PFS and followed for safety events.
The use of the PFS will be evaluated by the ability of retina specialists to successfully administer 
the investigational product (IP) (test or reference product) 2 mg in PFS via IVT injections to subjects.
After completion of the IVT injection, the inves tigator will prov ide their assessment to report 
whether the injection was successfully administered or not.Safety procedures for the study eye will include Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) by 
ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP), and indirect ophthalmo scopy and spectral domain- optical coherence 
Tomography (SD-OCT).
Study Duration: The study duration for each subject will be approximately 28 days (± 7 days) 
excluding screening and the study will end for subjects when they complete the end of study 
visit assessments.
The start of the study will be the date on which the first subject provides informed consent, 
and the end of the study will be when the last subject has completed the assessments for the 
end of study visit. Whenever possible, all procedures listed under the end of study visit should be completed for subjects who are prematurely discontinued.
Planned Number of Subjects: Approximately 48 adult male or female subjects with a 
minimum of 32 subjects in the ABP 938 PFS arm and a minimum of 16 subjects in the 
aflibercept PFS arm (randomization ratio 2:1).
Target Population: Subjects aged ≥ 18 years old with treatment-naïve or previously treated
neovascular (wet) AMD, DME, macular edema following RVO, or DR in the study eye, in 
whom treatment (IVT) with aflibercept is indicated.

ConfidentialStatistical Methods: All analyses for this study will be summarized descriptively. The Full 
Analysis Set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects and will be analyzed according to 
randomized treatment. This analysis set will be used for summaries of the primary endpoint. 
The number and percentage of injections successfully administered utilizing the PFS will be 
provided descriptively separately by randomized treatment group. Percentages will be based 
upon the number of subjects in the FAS for each treatment group. The estimated primary 
endpoint success rate for each treatment group will be calculated by the average of each 
retina specialists’ individual success rate.
The Safety Analysis Set will include all randomized subjects who receive the IP and will be 
analyzed according to the actual treatment received. This analysis set will be used for 
summaries of safety data. All reported AEs will be assigned the system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities as of the time of 
analysis and graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. The 
number and percentage of subjects experiencing any ocular treatment emergent AEs 
(TEAEs) and serious treatment emergent adverse events (TE-SAEs) in the study eye, and 
non-ocular SAEs will be summarized descriptively and separately by actual treatment 
received.
Statistical Hypothesis: No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be conducted.

Confidential1 Introduction and Rationale
1.1 Background
1.1.1 Disease
Chorioretinal vascular disease (CVD) constitutes the most common causes of moderate and 
severe vision loss in developed countries. These commonly include neovascular (wet) 
age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema 
following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and diabetic retinopathy (DR).(1)
AMD is a leading cause of blindness for people over the age of 65 in the United States (US). In the neovascular (wet or exudative) form of AMD, choroidal neovascular membranes disrupt 
the normal architecture of retina and adjacent tissues leading to retinal edema, submacular 
hemorrhage, as well as debilitating atrophy and scarring.
(2)
The use of intravitreal (IVT) anti-vascular endothelia l growth factor (VEGF) therapy is currently 
the standard of care for CVD. The anti- VEGF agents inhibit choroidal neovascularization 
growth and fluid leakage, which enable visual improvement.(3)
1.1.2 Amgen Test Product Background
Amgen is developing ABP 938 as a biosimilar candidate to Eylea®(aflibercept). ABP 938
belongs to the pharmacologic class of VEGF inhibitor s and acts as a soluble decoy receptor 
that binds VEGF type A (VEGF-A), placental growth factor (PlGF), and to a lesser extent 
VEGF type B (VEGF-B), and thereby prevents binding and activation of VEGF receptor 1 
(VEGFR1) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2).
1.1.3 Nonclinical Studies
A detailed summary of analytical and nonclinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).
1.1.4 Clinical Studies
A detailed description of the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ABP 938 is 
provided in the IB. A Phase 3 study to assess effectiveness and safety of ABP 938 compared 
to aflibercept in subjects with neovascular (wet) AMD is currently ongoing.
1.1.5 Non-Amgen Reference Product
Aflibercept belongs to the pharmacologic class of VEGF inhibitors. In the US, it is approved 
for indicated IVT administration in the treatment of neovascular (wet) AMD, macular edema 
following RVO, DME, and DR.(4)In the EU, aflibercept is approved for the treatment of the 
above indications with the exception of DR, and is also approved for the treatment of myopic 
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 19 of 61
Confidentialchoroidal neovascularization (CNV).(5)Regeneron has developed a single dose prefilled 
syringe (PFS) for administration of aflibercept as an IVT injection.
1.2 Study Rationale
Amgen is developing ABP 938 as a biosimilar candidate to aflibercept. In an ongoing 
comparative clinical study ABP 938 is provided and used as a sterile aqueous solution for 
injection in single-use glass vials. Each vial used in that study provides a usable amount to 
deliver a single dose of 2 mg aflibercept in a volume of 50 μ L. To administer ABP 938 as an 
IVT injection, Amgen has also developed a PF S. The study will invest igate whether the 
ABP 938 PFS can be used effectively and safely by retina specialists, to administer the 2 mg 
dose of study drug, when descriptively compared to the US-licensed aflibercept PFS.
1.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment
ABP 938 is a biosimilar candidate to a reference product, aflibercept, for which the benefit-risk 
profile, following IVT administration for appr oved indications is well unde rstood. A Phase 3 
study to assess effectiveness and safety of ABP 938 compared to aflibercept in subjects with neovascular (wet) AMD is currently ongoing.
The 2 mg dose of both study drugs and administration via PFS in this study is consistent with 
the Eylea
®prescribing information for subjects with CVD.
More detailed information about the known and expected benefits, risks, and reasonably expected AEs of ABP 938 and aflibercept can be found in the ABP 938 IB, and in the Eylea
® 
United States Prescribing Information (USPI), August 2022, respectively.(4)
Considering the measures taken to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, the 
potential risks identified in association with ABP 938 are justified by the anticipated benefits 
that may be afforded to subjects with CVD.
Amgen closely monitors the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic around the 
world. As part of this effort, Amgen performs a rigorous assessment, considering the study 
design, subject safety, public health risk, benefit-risk assessment, as well as the burden on 
country healthcare systems. Decisions are made on a study-by-study and country-by-country 
basis to minimize risk to subjects and avoid undue burden on healthcare facilities.
Subjects who display symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infections or who have tested 
positive for COVID-19 should contact the invest igator to ensure appropriate care as well as 
documentation and management of study assessments.Amgen considers that it is important to continue the proposed development of ABP 938 in this 
study in order to advance potential therapy options for subjects as rapidly as possible, while

Confidentialbalancing this with appropriate measures to monitor and mitigate the potential impact of 
COVID-19.
Study sites and subjects should follow the most recent local and institutional guidelines, as 
applicable, for the prevention of COVID-19 infection including COVID vaccinations. Based on 
general best practices for vaccination of immunocompromised individuals, it is recommended 
that the course of COVID-19 vaccinations is completed at least 2 weeks before study 
enrollment, or as per local guidance.
2 Objectives and Endpoints

Primary
The primary objective for this study is to assess 
the ability of retina specialists to successfully 
administer, via an IVT injection, a 2 mg dose of 
ABP 938, using the ABP 938 PFS, compared to 
a 2 mg dose of aflibercept using the aflibercept PFS.The primary endpoint for the study is the 
proportion of IVT injections successfully 
administered to subjects with CVD by 
retina specialists, utilizing the ABP 938 
PFS or aflibercept PFS.
Secondary
The secondary objective is to assess the safety 
of ABP 938 administered to subjects with CVD via an IVT injection, using the ABP 938 PFS 
compared to aflibercept administered using the 
aflibercept PFS.The secondary endpoint for the study is the incidence of ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs) in the study eye, and non-ocular 
SAEs until the end of study visit (Day 28 
visit).
3 Study Plan
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is an open label, two-arm, randomized, mult i-site study within the US in adult subjects
with CVD. Approximately 48 adult male or female subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1
to receive either a single IVT injection of ABP 938 in a PFS or a single injection of aflibercept 
in a PFS. Randomization will be stratified by retina specialist.
The study design is outlined in Figure 1 , and the visit schedule and planned assessments at 
each visit are detailed in Table 1 .
The study consists of a screening visit (Day -1), a baseline visit (Day 1) and an end of study 
visit (Day 28 ± 7 days).

Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 21 of 61
ConfidentialAt the screening visit (Day -1), the invest igator will obt ain signed informed c onsent from the 
subject before any study procedures or assessments are performed. Once subject eligibility 
is confirmed the subject will be enrolled into the st udy. At this visit, the subject will undergo 
ocular safety procedures including the Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) scale, intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect ophthalmoscopy, and spectral domain 
optical-coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
At the baseline visit (Day 1), the subject will be random ized to receive a single IVT injection 
of either ABP 938 or aflibercept (open label) in a PFS administered by a retina specialist. Only 
one eye will be selected as the study eye. IOP will be measured, and indirect ophthalmoscopy 
will be performed before and after IP administration. The screening and baseline visit may be 
combined into one visit (Day 1).
At the end of study visit (Day 28 ± 7 days), the ocular safety procedures performed at the 
screening visit will be repeated.
AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until the end of study 
visit.
The method of assigning subjects to treatment is discussed in Section 6.2.
No interim analyses are planned.
3.2 Discussion of Study Design
This is an open label, randomized study intended to assess if a PFS can be used effectively 
and safely by retina specialists to administer ABP 938. ABP 938 is intended to be developed 
as a biosimilar candidate to aflibercept which has been approved in many countries as an IVT 
injection for CVD. The dose of ABP 938 is the same as the reference product aflibercept. The 
secondary objective of the study is to assess ocular safety in the study eye and non-ocular SAEs.
3.3 End of Study
3.3.1 End of Study Definition
Primary completion/end of study: The primary completion date/end of study is the date when 
the last subject has completed the assessments for the end of study visit.
If the study concludes prior to the primary completion/end of study date originally planned in 
the protocol (i.e., early termination of the study), then the primary completion/end of study will 
be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the 
study (i.e., last subject last visit).

4.3 Subject Enrollment
Before subjects participate in any study-specific assessments/procedures, Amgen requires a 
copy of the site’s written IRB approval of the protocol and ICF.
The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative must personally sign and date 
the IRB and Amgen approved informed consent before the commencement of study-specific 
procedures.
A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all 
eligibility criteria. The investigator is to doc ument the decision and date, in the subject’s 
medical records.
Each subject will receive a unique 11-digit subject identification number obtained from the 
interactive web response system (IXRS). This  will be assigned at t he screening visit before

 Confidential  
    any study procedures are performed. The investigator will keep a record (the subject 
screening log) that includes limited information about the potential candidates (such as date of screening) for subjects who entered screening. The number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. The unique 11-digit subject identification numbers will be assigned in sequential order for each site in the format 934XXXXX###, where “934XXXXX” refers to the site number, and ### refers to the sequential subject ordering as each subject at a site is entered into the IXRS system (i.e., 93412345001). If a subject withdraws from study participation, his/her unique identification number cannot be re-used for another subject. 
The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study 
and must not be changed after initial assignment. This number will be different from the randomization number assigned for the study. 
4.4 Screen Failures 
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study but who 
do not meet did not meet entrance criteria required for participation and are not subsequently entered in the study. Data for subjects who fail screening will not be collected in the electronic data capture (EDC) system. Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) will not be rescreened. 
4.5 Premature Discontinuation 
Subjects have the right to withdraw from protocol procedures, or the study as a whole at any 
time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institution. 
4.5.1 Premature Discontinuation of Investigational Products 
Subjects or their legally acceptable representative can decline to receive IP or undergo 
procedures but continue participation in the study. If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the possibilities for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments (see Table 1 ) includ ing different options of follow-up (e.g., in person, by phone/mail, through 
family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treating physicians, from the review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints, AEs, and device-related events and must document this decision in the subject’s medical records. 
Subjects who have discontinued prior to or after receiving IP should not be automatically 
removed from the study. Whenever safe and feasible, it is imperative that subjects remain on-study to ensure safety surveillance and/or collection of outcome data.

ConfidentialReasons for early removal from study or procedural assessments may include any of the 
following:
∀Decision by Amgen.
∀Lost to follow-up.
∀Death.
∀AE.
∀Subject request.
∀Pregnancy.
At the time of premature discontinuation, the subject should complete the assessments indicated at the end of study visit; see Table 1 .
The study site will ma ke every effort to ensure that subjects who receive ABP 938 or 
aflibercept, and subsequently prematurely discontinue the study complete the end of study 
visit.
4.5.2 Premature Discontinuation from the Study
Participation in the study is strictly voluntary. A subject has the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time for any reason, without any reprisal.
The investigator has the right to terminate participation of a subject for any of the following 
reasons:
∀Difficulties conducting ophthalmic procedures.
∀Violation of the protocol.
∀Severe AEs or SAEs.
∀Any other reason relating to the subject's safety or integrity of the study data.
If a subject is withdrawn from the study, the study monitor/Amgen will be informed 
immediately. Withdrawal of consent for a study means that the subject does not wish to receive IP or undergo procedures, and/or the subject does not wish to or is unable to continue 
further study participation. If there is a medi cal reason for withdrawal , the subject will remain 
under the supervision of the investigator until satisfactory health has returned.
If the subject withdraws consent for disclosure of further information, then Amgen may retain 
and continue to use any collected data before such a withdrawal of consent. Where permitted, 
publicly available data can be included after withdrawal of consent.

 Confidential  
    Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing prematurely from a 
study, the investigator should make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject's rights. 
At the time of premature study discontinuation, the investigator should make every effort to 
ensure the subject completes the assessments indicated at the end of study visit; see  Table 1. 
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study cannot subsequently rejoin the study. For details on the discontinuation of study sites or the study as a whole, see Section 14. 
4.5.3 Lost to Follow-up 
A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he/she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the study site for a required 
study visit: 
x The study site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible, counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
x Before a subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator (or designee) must make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 2 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). 
x Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
x For subjects who are lost to follow-up, the investigator can search publicly available 
records, where permitted, to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the data set(s) produced as an outcome of the study is/are as comprehensive as possible.

Confidential6.6 Overdose
The ABP 938 and aflibercept PFS are designed to deliver a single dose of 2 mg drug in a 
volume of 0.05 mL, therefore, the chances of overdose with a single IVT injection are minimal.
Overdosing of ABP 938 and aflibercept may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case 
of overdose, intraocular pressure should be monitored and, if deemed necessary by the 
investigator, adequate treatment should be initiated.

The IP must not be used for any purpose other than that defined in this protocol. All supplies 
of IP will be accounted for in accordance with GCP.
The pharmacist or (designee) should maintain accurate records of all IP supplies received 
during the study. These records should include the dates and amounts of IP that were 
received at the study site, dispensed, and destroyed on site following guidance in the 
pharmacy manual. The records should include dates, quantities, lot numbers, expiration 
dates, and subject numbers. If errors or damage to the IP shipments occur, the investigator 
should contact Amgen (or its designee) immediately. Copies of the IP accountability records 
will be provided by each investigator for inclusion in the trial master file (TMF) after database 
lock. The study monitor will periodically check IP supplies held by the investigator or 
pharmacist to verify accountability of the IP used.
The investigator (or designee) will adm inister the IP only to the identified subjects in this study, 
according to the procedures described in this study protocol. Investigators should maintain 
records that adequately document that the s ubjects were provided the dose specified by the 
protocol and reconcile all IP received from Amgen (or designee).
After the end of the study, all unused IP and all medication containers should be destroyed at 
the study site and complete documentation will be returned to Amgen.
7 Adverse Events
7.1 Definitions
7.1.1 Adverse Events
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject. The event does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the IP. The investigator is responsible for ensuring 
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 33 of 61
Confidentialthat any AEs observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the 
subject’s medical records as well as in the eCRF.
The definition of AEs includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening 
indicates that a pre-existing medical condition (e.g., diabetes, migraine headaches, and gout) 
has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an association with a 
significantly worse outcome. In the case of worsening of a pre-existing condition, the start 
date of the event is the date when the first signs of worsening were observed. A pre-existing condition that has not worsened during the study or involves an intervention such as elective 
cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on-study is not considered an AE.
Note: an AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) in the investigator’s opinion, is
temporally associated with the use of a treatment, combination product, medical device or 
procedure.
7.1.1.1 Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
Events that meet the AE definition are as follows:
∀Any abnormal or worsening ocular safety result that is considered clinically significant 
in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
∀Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
∀New conditions det ected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.
∀Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming 
intent. Such overdoses are to be reported regardless of sequelae.
7.1.1.2 Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition
Events not meeting the AE definition include:
∀Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
∀Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 34 of 61
Confidential∀Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria:
∀Fatal.
∀Life-threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death).
∀Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.
∀Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.
∀Congenital anomaly/birth defect.
∀Other medically important serious event.
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: an AE is life-threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence 
of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug-induced hepatitis 
can be fatal. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in 
a more severe form, might have caused death.
Hospitalization: an AE requiring hospitalization should be considered as an SAE.
Hospitalization for elective surgery, or for procedures planned prior to the subject providing 
informed consent, or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., elective 
surgery for a pre-existing condition that has  not worsened) should not be considered AEs or 
SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported as an AE, either 'serious' or 'nonseri ous' according to the usual criteria. An AE would 
meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (e.g., overnight stay). When in doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred 
or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are an AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious 
criteria, the event is serious.
Disability/incapacity: an AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience results in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject’s ability to carry out normal life 
functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.

ConfidentialOther medically important serious event: If an investigator considers an event to be clinically 
important, but it does not meet any of the ser ious criteria, the event could be classified as a 
SAE under the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, drug-induced liver injury, 
or events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.
7.1.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
A suspected unexpected serious adverse r eaction (SUSAR) is defined as an untoward and 
unintended response to a IP, which is not lis ted in the applicable produc t information, and 
meets one of the following serious criteria: results in death, is life-threatening, requires 
hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; and is assessed as causally 
related to the IP.
7.1.4 Other Abnormal Assessments
Where applicable, the investigator is re sponsible for reviewing ot her assessments and 
determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically 
significant change from the subject’s baseline values. Where applicable, clinical sequelae are 
to be recorded as the AE. In addition, abnormal assessments that are associated with signs 
and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE as described in Sections 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 .
7.1.5 Events of Interest 
The adverse events of interest (EOIs) will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) 
and will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as part of safety monitoring. There are no additional 
expedited reporting requirements for EOIs, beyond what is defined for any AE report that qualifies to be expedited as part of regulatory reporting rules for IPs.
7.1.6 Adverse Device Effects
The detection and documentation procedures for adverse device effects described in this 
protocol apply to all ABP 938 and aflibercept PFSs provided for use in the study.
An adverse device effect is any AE related to the use of a combination product or medical 
device. Adverse device effects include AEs resulting from insufficient or inadequate 
instructions for use, AEs resulting from any malfunction of the device, or AEs resulting from 
use error or from intentional misuse of the device.
In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for 
the detection and documentation of any adverse device effects that occur during the study 
with such devices.

ConfidentialAll adverse device effects are to be repor ted as AEs following the sa me reporting periods and 
procedures.
Product complaints are described in Section 6.1.4 .
7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events
7.2.1 Severity
The terms serious and severe are not synonym ous. The general term “severe” is often used 
to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as a grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as 
serious, which is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or ability 
to function (see Section 7.1.2 ). A severe AE (classified as grades 3 or 4) does not necessarily 
need to be considered serious. For example, a white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less 
than 2000/mm3is considered grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered serious.
Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.
The investigator will make an a ssessment of severity for each AE and SAE reported during 
the study using the CTCAE, version 5.0.
7.2.2 Causality
∀The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between the IP and each 
occurrence of an AE/SAE.
∀Relatedness means that there are facts or reasons to support a relationship between the IP and the event.
∀The investigator will use their clinical judgment to determine the relationship.
∀Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relations hip of the event to study treatment 
administration will be considered and investigated.
∀The investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.
∀For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
∀There may be situations in which a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report. Howev er, it is very important that the 
investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial 
transmission of the SAE data.
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 37 of 61
Confidential∀The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up 
information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
∀The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.
∀A causal relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there 
a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP?”.
7.3 Documenting and Reporting Adverse Events
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs observed by the investigator or 
reported by the subject that occur from the s igning of the ICF until the end of study visit using 
the applicable eCRF Adverse Event Summary page.
Occurrence of AEs may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject; discovered as a result 
of general, non-leading verbal questioning by the study staff; or determined by physical 
examination or other safety assessments.
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the respons ibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
The investigator must assign the following AE attributes:
∀AE diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms).
∀Dates of onset and resolution.
∀Severity.
∀Assessment of relatedness to the IP, or devices.
∀Action taken.
The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject should be removed 
from treatment due to an AE. A subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative, can 
also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an AE. If the subject withdraws consent, the 
subject is encouraged to undergo, at a minimum, an end of study assessment.
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all documentation (e.g., hospital notes, 
laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to an AE. Wherever possible, the investigator’s diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, will be documented as the 
AE.

ConfidentialIt is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records 
to sponsor/responsible contract research organization (CRO) in lieu of completion of the Event 
eCRF page.
If specifically requested, the investigator may need to provide additional follow-up information, 
such as discharge summaries, medical records, or extracts from the medical records. In this 
case, all subject identifiers, with the exc eption of the subject num ber, will be blinded on the 
copies of the medical records before submission to Amgen.
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs after the subject’s conclusion of 
study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including death, at any 
time after a subject has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to 
be reasonably related to the IP or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify 
Amgen.
7.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
The SAE must be reported to Amgen, or its designee, within 24 hours following the 
investigator’s knowledge of the event using the paper Serious Adverse Event Report Form.
The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to Amgen within 24 hours of it being 
available.
The SAE can be reported by faxing a completed paper Serious Adverse Event Fax Cover 
Sheet and Serious Adverse Event Report Form at the number provided below.

In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form sent by overnight mail or 
courier service.
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and 
sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated reporting time frames. The 
investigator may be asked to provide additional follow-up information, which may include a 
discharge summary or extracts from the medical record. Information provided about the SAE 
must be consistent with that recorded on the applicable eCRF (e.g., Adverse Event Summary 
eCRF).

ConfidentialIf a subject is permanently withdrawn from study because of an SAE, this information must be 
submitted to Amgen, or its designee.
Investigators will receive notification of related SAE reports sent to regulatory authorities in 
accordance with local requirements.
Determination of expectedness for Amgen products will be based on the IB for the IP and the 
regional prescribing information for products being studied for an approved use.
Expectedness assessments are to be made for all IPs (Amgen and non-Amgen) using the 
appropriate reference safety information per local regulatory reporting requirements. SUSARs
reported for subjects receiving a non-Amgen IP are to be expedited according to local 
requirements.
Amgen, or its designee, reports SAEs and/or SUSARs as required to regulatory authorities, 
investigators/institutions, and IRBs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to 
local regulations and GCPs.
The investigator is to notify the appropriate IRB of SAEs occurring at the study site and other 
AE reports received from Amgen, in accordance with local procedures and statutes.
After the protocol-required reporting period defined above, the investigator does not need to 
actively monitor subjects for SAEs. However, if the investigator becomes aware of a SAE after 
this protocol-required reporting period, the inv estigator will r eport the event to Amgen within 
24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. SAEs reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical study
cases for the purposes of expedited reporting.
7.5 Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrence.
7.6 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow-up
During the study AEs, EOIs and SAEs should be followed proactively by the investigator until 
the event resolves, or the condition stabilizes to  a level acceptable to the investigator, until 
the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow-up. At the time the 
subject’s study participation ends, all related SAEs should be evaluated for resolution.
7.7 Safety Reporting Oversight
In accordance with ICH GCP, Amgen (or designee) will inform investigators of “findings that 
could affect adversely the safety of subjects, im pact the conduct of the study, or alter the IRB’s 
approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.”

safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from Amgen will file it along with the IB 
and will notify the IRB, if appropriate, according to local requirements.
Prompt notification by the investigator to Amgen of SAEs is essential so that legal obligations 
and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a study treatment 
under clinical investigation are met. Amgen has a legal responsibility to notify both the local 
regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about  the safety of a study treatment under 
clinical investigation. Individual safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.

The primary endpoint of the number of su ccessful IP injections with the PFS will be 
summarized using the FAS based on observed data. The number and percentage of injections 
successfully administered utilizing the PFS will be provided descriptively for separately by 
randomized treatment group. P ercentages will be based upon the number of subjects in the 
FAS for each treatment group. The estimated primary endpoint success rate for each treatment group will be calculated by the average of each retina specialists’ individual success 
rate. The variance of this estimator will be calculated as:
   ( )=
∑ (    ̅)   
   
 (    )
where   is the proportion of successfully IVT injections administered for the i-th retina 
specialist and  ̅is the average of proportions of successfully administered IVT injections
across all retina specialists, K is the total number of retina specialists. T-distribution with (K-1) 
degrees of freedom will be used to  calculate any corresponding confidence interval. No formal 
statistical comparisons will be performed between the two treatment groups. Missing data will not be imputed.
8.5.2 Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints of ocular treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and serious 
TEAEs (TE-SAEs) in the study eye and non-o cular TE-SAEs will be summarized with 
qualitative descriptive statistics for all subjects and separately by actual treatment received 
using the Safety Analysis Set.

10 Records Management
All clinical study information should be collected, handled, and stored in a way that allows its 
accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification. This principle applies to all records 
referenced in this protocol, irrespective of the type of media used.
An eCRF will be used to store and transmit subject information. The eCRF must be reviewed 
and electronically signed and dated by the investigator on an ongoing basis throughout the 
study. The investigator is responsible for verifying that the data entries are accurate and 
correct by signing the eCRF.
Access to the eCRF will be strictly password protected and limited to personnel directly 
participating in the study. Data should be entered into the eCRF completely by authorized site 
personnel (e.g., investigators and the study coordinators). The eCRF must be completed as 
soon as possible after any subject evaluation or communication. If data are to be changed 
due to erroneous input or other reason, an electronic audit trail will track these changes. The 
eCRFs and computers that store them must be accessible to study monitors and other 
regulatory auditors. Changes to the eCRF will be electronically tracked.
During each study visit, the investigator will maintain progress notes in the subject’s medical 
records to document all significant observations. At a minimum, these notes are to contain:
∀The date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the study schedule.
∀General condition and status remarks by the subject, including any significant medical 
findings. The severity, frequency, duration, and resolution of any reported AE, and the investigator's assessment as to whether or not the reported AE is related to the IP.
∀Changes (including dosages) in concomitant medications/therapies or procedures.

Information from medical records (progress notes) and other source documents should be 
promptly entered into the appropriate section of the eCRF.
Changes to information in medical records (progress notes) and other source documents are 
to be initialed and dated on the day the change is made by the investigator (or designee). If 
the reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change is to be written 
adjacent to the change.
The ICON data management department will write a data management plan, which will be 
finalized prior to performing any data validation.
10.1 Source Documentation
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a clinical 
investigation. They are the original records in which raw data are first collected. Source 
documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress notes), computer 
printouts, screening logs, and drug dispensing/accountability logs, etc.
The investigator/site personnel should maintain adequate and accurate source documents 
and study records that include all pertinent observations on each of the study site’s study 
subjects. Source data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, 
and complete. Changes to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original 
entry, and should be explained if necessary (e.g., through an audit trail).
All source documents from this study are to be maintained by the investigator and made 
available for inspection by authorized persons. The investigator will provide direct access to 
source documents/data for study-related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspections. Amgen should verify that each subject has consented, in writing, to direct access 
to his/her original medical records for study-related monitoring, audit, IRB review, and regulatory inspection. The original signed ICF for each subject shall be filed with records kept

agreement with Amgen. Amgen is responsible for informing the investigator when these 
documents need no longer be retained.
The investigator is not to dispose of any re cords relevant to this study without written 
permission from Amgen and is to provide Amgen the opportunity to collect such records. The 
investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard copy source 
documents of all observations and data generated during this study. Such documentation is 
subject to inspection by Amgen, its representatives, and regulatory authorities.
If an investigator moves, withdraws from a study, or retires, the responsibility for maintaining 
the records may be transferred to another person who will accept responsibility. Notice of 
transfer must be made to and agreed by Amgen.
11 Auditing and Monitoring
Auditing
Amgen or its representative may conduct audits at the sites including, but not limited to, drug 
supply, presence of required docum ents, the info rmed consent process, and comparison of 
eCRFs with source documents. All medical records (progress notes) must be available for the 
audit. The investigator must agree to participate with audits conducted at a convenient time 
in a reasonable manner.
Government regulatory authorities may also inspect the site during or after the study. The 
investigator (or designee) should contact Amgen/CRO immediately if this occurs.
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 49 of 61
ConfidentialThe purpose of an audit is to assess whether ethics, regulatory, and quality requirements are 
being fulfilled.
Monitoring
Sponsor-assigned monitors will conduc t regular site visits at the site for the purpose of 
monitoring various aspects of the study, such as assessing subject enrollment, compliance 
with protocol procedures, completeness and accuracy of data entered into the eCRFs, 
verification of eCRF data against original source documents, and occurrence of AEs. The 
investigator must agree to sponsor-authorized personnel having direct access to the clinical 
(or associated) files and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) to ensure 
compliance with applicable regulations, and the inv estigator will assist with Amgen’s
monitoring activities.
Quality control will occur at each stage of data handling to ensure that  all data are reliable and 
have been processed correctly. Amgen should ensure oversight of any study-related duties 
and functions carried out on its behalf, including study-related duties and functions that are 
subcontracted to another party by Amgen’s contracted CRO(s).
The eCRFs should be completed in a timely manner and on an ongoing basis to allow regular 
review by the study monitor.
Details describing the strategy, responsibilities, and requirements of the study monitoring are 
provided in the clinical management plan.
11.1 Risk and Quality Tolerance Limits
Perceived risks and quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be identified and documented before 
the start of the study.
Amgen will review risk control measures periodically to ascertain whether the implemented 
quality management activities remain effective and relevant. The quality management 
approach and any important deviations from the predefined QTLs (and remedial actions 
adopted) will be described in the clinical study report.
11.2 Protocol Adherence and Deviations
The investigator and site personnel should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol 
and should use continuous vigilance to identify and report protocol deviations.
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the study design or 
procedures defined in the protocol that may be on the part of the investigator, site personnel, 
or the subject.
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 50 of 61
ConfidentialImportant protocol deviations are a subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact 
the completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect 
a subject's rights, safety, or well-being. For example, important protocol deviations may 
include enrolling subjects in violation of key eligibility criteria designed to ensure a specific 
subject population or failing to collect data necessary to interpret primary endpoints, as this 
may compromise the scientific value of the study.
The investigator should not implement any deviation from the protocol without agreement from 
Amgen and prior review and approval from the IRB of an amendment, except where 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a study subject, or when the change involves 
only logistical or administrative aspects of the study, such as a change in a monitor or 
telephone number.
In the event of an important protocol deviation, the investigator will discuss the deviation with 
Amgen’s medical monitor and will come to an agreement as to whether the subject should be 
withdrawn from the study due to the important protocol deviation.
12 Amendments
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to study subjects, may 
be made only by Amgen. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to subjects should be implemented immediately.
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written 
amendment must be submitted to the IRB, and the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Amgen will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for approval.
The current version of the ICF will require similar modification if the IRB, investigator, and/or 
sponsor, judge the amendment to the protocol to substantially change the study design and/or 
increase the potential risk to the subject and/or impact the subject's involvement as a study 
subject. In such cases, the ICF will be renewed for enrolled subjects before their continued 
participation in the study.
13 Study Report and Publications
Amgen is responsible for preparing and providing the appropriate regulatory authorities with 
the CSR according to the applicable regulatory requirements. Amgen should ensure that the 
CSR meets the standards of the ICH Guideline for Structure and Content of Clinical Study 
Reports (ICH E3).
To coordinate dissemination of data from this  study, Amgen may facilitate the formation of a 
publication committee consisting of several investigators and appropriate Amgen staff, the 
governance and responsibilities of which are set forth in a Publication Charter. The committee 
Sponsor Name: Amgen Inc.
Protocol Number: 20210034
Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 51 of 61
Confidentialis expected to solicit input and assistance from other investigators and to collaborate with 
authors and Amgen staff, as appropriate, as defined in the Publication Charter. Membership 
on the committee (both for investigators and Amgen staff) does not guarantee authorship. The 
criteria described below are to be met for every publication.
Authorship of any publications resulting from this study will be determined on the basis of the 
Uniform Requirement for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals International 
Committee of Medical Journal Editors Recommendations for the Conduct of Reporting, 
Editing, and Publications of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which states: Authorship 
credit is to be based on: (1) substantial contributions to conception and design, acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data; (2) drafting the article or revising it critically for 
important intellectual content; (3) final approval of the version to be published; and (4) 
agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to 
the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.
Authors need to meet conditions 1, 2, 3, and 4.
When a large, multi-site group has conducted the work, the group is to identify the individuals 
who accept direct responsibility for the manuscript. These individuals must fully meet the 
criteria for authorship defined above. Acquisition of funding, collection of data, or general 
supervision of the research group, alone, does  not justify authorship. All persons designated 
as authors must qualify for authorship, and all those who qualify are to be listed. Each author must have participated sufficiently in the work to take public responsibility for appropriate 
portions of the content. All publications (e.g., manuscripts, abstracts, oral/slide presentations, 
book chapters) based on this study must be submitted to Amgen for review. The Clinical Trial 
Agreement among the institution, investigator, and Amgen will detail the procedures for, and 
timing of, Amgen’s review of publications.
14 Study Start and Termination
The study start date is the date on which the first subject provides informed consent.
The end of the study date is the date when the last subject has completed the assessments 
for the end of study visit.
If the study concludes prior to the end of study date originally planned in the protocol (i.e., 
early termination of the study), then the end of study will be the date when the last subject is 
assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (i.e., last subject last visit).
Both Amgen and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study or the participation 
in the study at an investigator’s site at any time. In terminating the study, Amgen and the 
investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ 
interests.

Version and Date: Version 1.0, 19 Oct 2022 Page 52 of 61
ConfidentialIf the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, Amgen/investigators/site 
personnel should promptly inform the study subjects and should assure appropriate therapy 
and follow-up for the subjects. Where required by the applicable regulatory requirements, the 
IRB should be informed promptly and be provided with a detailed written explanation of the 
termination or suspension.
If the investigator terminates or suspends a study without prior agreement of Amgen, the 
investigator should inform the site personnel. The investigator/site personnel should promptly 
inform Amgen and the IRB. The investigato r/site personnel should also provide Amgen and 
the IRB a detailed written explanation of the termination or suspension.
15 Confidentiality
All information generated in this study is considered confidential and must not be disclosed to 
any person or entity not directly involved with the study unless prior written consent is gained 
from Amgen. However, authorized regulatory officials, IRB personnel, Amgen and its 
authorized representatives are allowed full access to the records.
All study subjects must be informed that their personal study-related data will be used by 
Amgen in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the subject, who will be required to gi ve consent for their data to be used as 
described in the ICF. The subjects must be informed that their medical records may be examined by auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by Amgen, by appropriate IRB 
members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.
Identification of subjects and eCRFs shall be by unique subject identification numbers (such 
as screening or randomization number only). All personal identifiers according to applicable 
regulations (e.g., name, phone number) must be redacted permanently by the study site 
personnel and replaced with the subject’s unique identification number in all records and data before transfer to Amgen (or designee).
All personal details will be treated as confidential by the investigator and staff at ICON.

Confidential17.3 Appendix III - Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy and 
Lactation Information
Study-specific contraception requirements for male and female subjects of childbearing 
potential are outlined in Section 4.2.
Male and female subjects of child bearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling and be advised of the risk to the fetus if they become pregnant or father a child
during the study.
Definition of Females of Childbearing Potential
A female is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopausal unless 
permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy.
Females In The Following Categories Are Not Considered Females Of Childbearing 
Potential:
∀Premenopausal female with one of the following criteria met:
oDocumented hysterectomy.
oDocumented bilateral salpingectomy.
oDocumented bilateral oophorectomy.
Note: Site personnel documentation from the following sources is acceptable: 1) review 
of subject’s medical records; 2) subject’s medical examination; or 3) subject’s medical 
history interview.
∀Premenarchal female.
∀Post-menopausal female as defined in the following:
oA post-menopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. A high follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
post-menopausal range may be used to confirm a post-menopausal state in women 
not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, 
in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.
oFemales on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of post-menopausal status before study enrollment.

ConfidentialContraception Methods for Female Subjects
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods
Note: Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
∀Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal, or transdermal).
∀Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral, injectable, implantable).
∀Intrauterine device.
∀Intrauterine hormonal-releasing system.

female subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success).
∀Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the
entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual 
abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred 
and usual lifestyle of the subject).

Confidential∀Male or female condom with or without spermicide.
∀Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide.
∀Double barrier method: the male uses a condom and the female may choose either a cap, 
diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (a female condom is not an option due to the risk 
of tearing when both partners use a condom).
Contraception Methods for Male Subjects
∀Sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk associated with the IP; the reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated 
in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject).
∀Use a condom while on-study and for 3 months after IP administration.
The female partner should consider using an acceptable method of effective contraception 
such as: hormonal, intrauterine device, intrauterine hormonal-releasing system, female barrier method (diaphragm, cap, sponge).
Note: If the male’s sole female partner is of non-childbearing potential or has had a bilateral 
tubal ligation/occlusion, he is not required to use additional forms of contraception during the 
study.
Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for [Male and] Female Subjects
Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical studies include:
∀Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods).
∀Withdrawal (coitus interruptus).
∀Spermicides only.
∀Lactational amenorrhea method.
Collection of Pregnancy Information
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant
∀The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who 
becomes pregnant during the study until the end of study visit.
∀Information will be collected on the Pregnancy Notif ication Form. The form must be 
submitted to Amgen or its designee within 24 hours of learning of a subject’s 
pregnancy.

∀Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to Amgen or its designee, regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.
∀While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or developmental delay, fetal death, or 
suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will be r eported as an AE or SAE. Note 
that an elective termination with no info rmation on a fetal congenital malformation or 
maternal complication is generally not considered an AE, but still must be reported to 
Amgen or its designee as a pregnancy exposure case.
∀If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a 
SAE (e.g., female subject experiences a spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal 
death or there is a fetal or neonatal c ongenital anomaly) the investigator will report the 
event as a SAE.
∀Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-study pregnancy which is considered 
reasonably related to the study treatment by  the investigat or, will be reported to Amgen

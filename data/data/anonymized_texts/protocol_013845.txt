Alcon – Business Use Only  3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study Rationale and Purpose  
 
 
 
 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate biocompatibility  of an investigational contact lens 
compar ed to marketed contact lens es (PureVision /Biofinity ) which have been pre -
cycled in OPTI -FREE RepleniSH multi -purpose disinfect ing solution  (RepleniSH)  and/or 
Biotrue multi -purpose solution  (Biotrue) . The primary endpoint  (average % area of corneal 
staining) was  selected to fulfil l the primary objective of the study.  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
RepleniSH was chosen as a representative solution containing the Polyquarterium -1 
preservative and Biotrue  was chosen as a representa tive solution containing the 
polyaminopropyl biguanide (PHMB) preservative.   
 
 
 
 
3.2 Trial Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate corneal staining observed after 2 hours of 
wear with LID018869 against  both PureVision , pre-cycled with Biotrue, and 
Biofinity  lenses, pre -cycled with RepleniSH.

Alcon – Business Use Only  3.3 Risks and Benefits  
 
 
 There is no intended clinical benefit to 
the subject. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are features consistent with s uccessful contact lens wear.  
Based upon non -clinical testing, the new contact lens in development  is assessed to be non -
toxic and biocompatible for on -eye use.  
A summary of the known potential risks and benefits associated with the new contact lens in 
development can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
 
 
 
 
. 
The site personnel will educate subjects on proper hygiene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to 
wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming. The site pe rsonnel will also advise the 
subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prompt follow -up of symptoms, such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or hyperemia.  
3.4 Subject Population  
The study population includes approximately 36 volunteer subjects to be enrolled at 
approximately 2 sites, with approximately 18-36 subjects enrolled per site. The study 
population will consist of subjects with normal eyes (other than the need for optical 
correction for refractive ametropia ) and who are adapted, existing wearers of soft contact 
lenses in both eyes . 
Subjects must be screened according to the full list of inclusion/exclusion criteria in Section  1 
of this protocol.  
Rescreening of subjects after screen failure is not allowed in this study.

the opinion of the Investigator, their continued participation poses a risk to their health. 
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced ( i.e., their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used).  
Should a subject exhibit any clinically relevant signs, symptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly could be associated with suspected sensitivity or intolerance  to one 
of the study treatments, the Investigator must document those observations on an AE Form.  
Any subject who exits early from the study (excluding screen failures) must undergo all 
procedures outlined at Visit 4, as applicable . 
The Investigator must document the reason for study or treatment discontinuation in the

Alcon – Business Use Only  Malfunction  Failure of an investigational medical device to perform in 
accordance with its intended purpose when used in accordance 
with the instructions for use or clinical investigation plan (CIP), or 
investigator ’s brochure (IB).  
Non-serious Adverse 
Event  Adverse event  that doe s not meet the criteria for a serious adverse 
event . 
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect 
(SADE)  Adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the consequences 
characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)  Adverse event  that led to any of the following:  
• Death.  
• A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either 
resulted in:  
a) a life -threatening illness or injury.  
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
b) any potentially sight -threatening event or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function.  
c) in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.  
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition,

problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard  questions:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit? ” 
Additionally, c hanges  in any protocol -specific parameters  and/or questionnaires evaluated 
durin g the study are to be reviewed by the Investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter  or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the Investigator, is to be reported as an AE , as applicable . 
These clinically relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality.   
7.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent . Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study ( i.e., before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History source.

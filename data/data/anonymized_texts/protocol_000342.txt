STUDY  
RATIONALE  The recent identification of frequent mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase  1 (IDH1) 
and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 ( IDH2) genes in human cancers including acute myeloid 
leukemia  (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome  (MDS) has provided novel therapeutic 
targets in these diseases (Mardis  et al. 2009 ; Cairns and Mak 2013 ). IDH mutation -specific 
inhibitors have been shown to reduce aberrantly elevated levels of the oncometabolite (R)-
2-hydroxyglutarate  (2-HG), resulting in antitumor efficacy in preclinical models 
(Rohle  et al. 2013 ; Saha  et al. 2014) . Inhibition of mutated IDH1 has recently demonstrated 
efficacy in AML and initial proof- of-concept in MDS patients  (Fan et al. 2015 ; de Botton 
et al. 2015 ; DiNardo et al. 2018).  
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML and glioma result in abnormal hypermethylation of 
histones and DNA and suppression of normal cellular differentiation. Treatment with the 
hypomethylating agent azacitidine causes tumor growth inhibition in a patient -derived 
IDH1 -mutated glioma model by reducing DNA methylation and inducing glial 
differentiation (Borodovsky  et al. 2013). Ta ken together, these data support the 
combination of FT -2102 and azacitidine in the treatment of patients with AML harboring 
IDH1 mutations.  
Low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) is considered a standard of care (SOC) treatment option for 
AML patients ≥ 60 years who a re not candidates for intensive therapy. In a xenograft 
model, the combination of an IDH1 inhibitor with short duration low dose cytarabine 
decreased the bone marrow tumor burden better than either treatment alone (Yen et al. 2013 ). The combination of FT -2102 with LDAC in patients harboring an IDH1 
mutation might result in additive clinical benefit.

Health -related QOL of patient s as assessed by a patient- reported questionnaire  
STUDY DESIGN  This is a multicenter, open -label Phase 1/2 study of FT -2102 administered orally to 
patients with AML or MDS. Patients will be given FT -2102 daily in continuous 28 -day 
cycles, alone or in combination with azacitidine or low dose cytarabine until treatment 
discontinuation.  
This study is comprised of 3 stages: a Phase 1 dose -escalation stage, a Phase 1 Dose -
expansion stage, and a Phase 2 stage.  
Phase 1 Dose -escalation  Stage:  
Dose escalation will be initiated using FT -2102 as a single agent in patients with AML or 
MDS harboring an IDH1 -R132 mutation, as determined by local mutation testing. It is 
planned that doses of 150 and 300 mg FT -2102 once daily (QD) will be teste d. Twice daily 
(BID) dosing and/or dosing with food to improve on bioavailability may be explored when indicated.  
On the initial schedule (Schedule  1), FT -2102 will be given orally QD in continuous 
28-day cycles. An alternative schedule (Schedule 2) of FT -2102 administered orally BID
may be initiated based upon observed PK and clinical observations.
This study will utilize a 3+3 dose escalation design, whereby three patients will be treated 
and if a DLT occurs, then the cohort will be expanded to six patien ts to determine a non -
tolerated dose and MTD. The dose -escalation portion of the study will allow dose increases 
of up to 50% between cohorts above the 300  mg total daily dose level until the MTD or an 
MED is determined. Initiation of Schedule  2 will occur  following analysis of PK/PD 
parameters and clinical observations, and may be independent of an MTD in Schedule 1. 
Dose escalation will stop if an intolerable dose is identified.  
During the course of dose escalation, a parallel escalation arm will be initiated for  
FT-2102 in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML or MDS harboring an 
IDH1 -R132 mutation. Dose escalation in the azacitidine combination will initiate 
following determination of a pharmacodynamically active dose of FT -2102 (single -agen t 
[SA] schedule). The starting dose of FT -2102 in the combination agent is a dose level at 
which ≤ Grade  2 toxicities (i.e., no Grade 3 or higher toxicities) were observed when FT -
2102 was administered as a single agent. This escalation will also enroll pa tients on a 3+3 
design, whereby three patients will be treated and if one DLT occurs, then the cohort will 
be expanded to six patients; if more than one DLT occurs, escalation will stop at that dose 
level (or schedule).  
Phase 1 Dose -expansion Stage:  
Once t he MTD or MED has been identified for the SA or azacitidine combination cohorts, 
up to 14 additional patients may be enrolled in up to 2 expansion cohorts each of SA  
FT-2102 or in combination with azacitidine in selected populations of patients with 
AML/MDS harboring IDH1- R132 mutations . These dose- expansion cohorts will evaluate 
FT-2102 or the combination at doses of FT -2102 ≤ MTD/MED to 1) further define the 
safety profile of SA FT -2102 or the azacitidine combination and 2) to provide an initial 
assessme nt of antileukemic or antimyelodysplastic activity . From these dose expansion 
cohorts, a recommended Phase 2  dose (RP2D) of FT -2102 as a single agent or in 
combination  with azacitidine  will be selected for subsequent evaluation in Phase 2 .

August 20, 2020 After dose -expansion is complete for FT -2102 as a single agent and FT -2102 in 
combination with azacitidine, a cohort of 6 patients with AML harboring IDH1 mutation 
will be treated with FT -2102 in com bination with cytarabine  20 mg BID for 10 days, and 
then cytarabine will be stopped for 18 days. FT -2102 will be given in accordance with 
dosing schedule × 28 days out of 28 days .  
The starting dose of FT -2102 will be the 150 mg BID dose . Further dose -escalation of FT -
2102 in combination with LDAC will not occur beyond 150 mg BID.  
If > 1 DLTs are observed at the 150 mg BID dose  in combination with cytarabine, a lower 
dose level may be explored.  
Recommended Phase 2 dose  
FT-2102 150 mg BID is the RP2D  confirmed for single -agent and azacitidine combination 
treatment.  
Phase 2:   
Phase 2 cohorts may include  the following : 
Cohort 1 (SA FT -2102) : approximately 173 evaluable patients with R/ R AML. To account 
for potential discordance between local and central mutation testing, approximately 
190 patients may be enrolled into this cohort.  
Cohort 2 (SA FT -2102) : approximately 53 patients with AML in morphologic CR/CRi 
after prior therapy (+/ - hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [HSCT ]) with residual 
IDH1-R132 mutation (≥ 0.01%) detected in the bone marrow.  
Cohort 3 (SA FT -2102) : approximately 20 patients with R/R AML/MDS that  have  been 
previously treated with FT-2102. Patients who undergo HSCT on- study then relapse post -
HSCT are allowed in this cohort.  
Cohort 4 (FT -2102 in combination with azacitidine): approximately 20 patients with R/R 
AML/MDS that are naïve to prior hypomethylating therapy and IDH1 inhibitor therapy.  
Cohort 5 (FT -2102 in combination with azacitidine): approximately 20 patients with R/R 
AML/MDS that have inadequately responded to or have progressed on prior 
hypomethylating therapy.  
Cohort 6 (FT -2102 in combi nation with azacitidine) : approximately 44 patients with R/R 
AML/MDS who have been previously treated with SA FT-2102  as their last therapy prior 
to study enrollment. The actual number of patients in this cohort may be larger, since 
patients from the FT-2102 SA cohorts of this study are allowed to be enrolled in Cohort 6 
after their disease progression.  
Cohort 7 (SA FT -2102):  approximately 54 treatment naïve AML patients for whom 
standard treatments are contraindicated . 
Cohort 8 (FT -2102 in combination with azacitidine):  approximately 28 t reatment naïve 
AML patients who are candidates for azacitidine first line treatment . 
Safety will be assessed throughout the study. Safety variables assessed will include AEs, 
concomitant medications, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, physical 
examination findings, and ECG readings (see manual for details of Holter monitoring procedures).  
Efficacy/determination of clinical benefit will be based on investigator’s assessment using disease- specific criter ia, i.e., derived from the IWG/modified IWG criteria for AML 
(2003)  and MDS (2006).

August 20, 2020 Plasma concentrations of FT -2102 will be determined by validated and sensitive 
bioanalytical methods. The PD bio marker is the change in 2 -HG levels in plasma.  
Assessment of the presence and frequency of cancer -associated mutations and/or genetic 
alterations will be performed at a central laboratory.  
Health -related QOL of patient s will be assessed by the EuroQol -5D (EQ-5D-5L). 
The study Schedule of Events are provided in Appendix 1  and Appendix 2 . 
DURATION  It is estimated that this study will last approximately 48 months. The total duration of study 
treatment for each patient is expected to  be approximately 26 weeks.  Study drug will b e 
taken orally and daily (either QD or BID) in 28 -day continuous cycles from Day 1 until 
treatment discontinuation  criteria are met.  
Study treatment should be discontinued if any of the following events occur:  
•Unacceptable AE or failure to tolerate study therapy
•Delay in dosing of > 28 days, without approval of Sponsor
•Treatment failure  (i.e., progression or relapse)  (see Section  4.3, Table 3  for
definition)
•Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT)
•Withdrawal of consent (no further study participation)
•Patient decision to discontinue study treatment
•Discretion of the Investigator
•Major protocol violation
•Pregnancy
•Lost to follow -up
•Death
•Termination of the study by Sponsor
Patients will be followed for safety after treatment discontinuation (last dose of study drug) 
to monitor for AEs for 28 days, or until resolution or stabilization of AEs, except for 
patients who withdraw consent.  
Patients who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression/relapse  or withdraw al 
of consent will continue to be followed for response until pro gression /relapse  occurs.  
Patients  who achieve an adeq uate response to study treatment  and meet other criteria 
required to undergo HSCT may proceed to HSCT after discontinuation of study treatment  
and will be followed on study for disease evaluation and any new HSCT  conditioning or 
other new antineoplastic therapies received until disease relapse, death, withdrawal of 
consent, lost to follow -up, or end of study . Additional detail on follow -up for patients who 
undergo HSCT is provided in Section 4. 
Patients participating in Phase 1 may be followed for survival for up to 12 months from 
C1D1 or for 28 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).  
Patients participating in Phase 2 may be followed for survival for up to 36 months from 
C1D1 or for 28 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).  
PLANNED TOTAL 
SAMPLE SIZE  Phase 1: Approximately 110 patients may be enrolled in the dose -escalation and 
dose-expansion stages.  
Phase 2: Approximately 429 patients may be enrolled in the 8 proposed Phase 2 cohorts.

August 20, 2020 dThe starting dose of FT -2102 in the combination agent is a dose level at which ≤  Grade  2 
toxicities (i.e., no Grade 3 or higher toxicities) were observed when FT -2102 was administered 
as a single agent.  
eAfter dose -expansion is  complete for FT -2102 as a single agent and FT-2102 in combination 
with azacitidine, a cohort of 6 patients with AML harboring IDH1 mutation will be treated 
with FT-2102 in combination with cytarabine  20 mg BID for 10 days, and then cytarabine will 
be stopped for 18 days. FT-2102 will be given in accordance with dosing schedule × 28 days 
out of 28  days. 
If the PK analysis indicates that absorption/bioavailability of FT -2102 dosed either QD or 
BID does not increase with increasing dose levels, dose escalation of FT -2102 in the 
presence of food will be explored. The starting dose of FT -2102 dose -escalation in the 
presence of food will be a QD dose intended to approximate the FT -2102 exposures 
already achieved in the clinic and found to be tolerable. Intra- patient dose escalation/dose 
adjustment w ithin this initial dosing cohort may be considered if the observed exposures 
fall below the predicted target range.  
The DLT dose level is defined as the lowest dose level at which DLT is experienced in two 
or more patients at the same dose level. The MTD i s the highest dose level that does not 
meet the DLT dose level definition. The MED is defined as the highest dose level evaluated when an MTD is not defined.  
Dose escalation will utilize a 3+ 3 design to define a MTD/MED in one or more selected schedules.  For the 3+3 dose escalation design, three patients will be treated at the current 
dose level. The first cohort of patients will initiate treatment at dose level 1. If no patient experiences a DLT during the Cycle 1 28-day post- dose DLT monitoring period, 
subsequent dose escalation will proceed as described in the previous table.  
Dose escalation in the azacitidine combination will initiate following determination of the pharmacodynamically active dose of FT -2102 (single -agent schedule).  
The starting dose of FT -2102 in the combination agent is a dose level at which ≤ Grade  2 
toxicities (i.e., no Grade 3 or higher toxicities) were observed when FT -2102 was 
administered as a single agent. This escalation will also enroll patients on a 3+3 design, whereby three  patients will be treated and if a DLT occurs, then the cohort will be 
expanded to up to six patients.  
After dose -expansion is complete for FT -2102 as a single agent and FT -2102 in 
combination with azacitidine, a cohort of 6 patients with AML harboring IDH1 mutation will be treated with FT -2102 in combination with cytarabine.  The starting dose of FT -2102 
will be the 150 mg BID dose. Further dose -escalati on of FT -2102 in combination with 
LDAC will not occur beyond 150 mg BID.  
If > 1 DLTs are observed at the  150 mg BID dose in combination with cytarabine, a lower 
dose level may be explored.  The dose -escalation portion of the study will allow dose 
increases of up to 50% between cohorts above the 300 mg total daily dose level until the MTD or a MED is determine d. Additional intermediate dose levels may be explored as 
clinically indicated. After discussion between the Investigators and Sponsor, it may be recommended that additional patients be enrolled in one or more cohorts.  
Patient entry and dose escalation will be based upon occurrence of DLTs in all patients at each dose level. Adverse events will be reviewed with the Investigators and the medical 
monitor at specific timepoint s during the conduct of the study. A review will be performed 
in the dose -escalation portion of the protocol prior to the opening of a new dose level and 
to discontinue dose escalation if the MTD has been reached.

August 20, 2020 In the 3+3 portion of the dose -escalation phase, three patients will be enrolled in each 
cohort.  
•A patient will not be enrolled  at the next higher dose level until all patients at the
current dose level have completed the 28- day DLT monitoring period.
•If one of the initial three patients has a DLT before the end of Cycle  1, the cohort
will be expanded to up to six patients. If five of a total of six patients complete the
full Cycle without a DLT, escalation may continue.

DATA 
EVALUATION Standardized electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be constructed for the study. Weekly -twice a 
month conference calls with each site will be put in place during Phase  1. 
Monthly conference calls with each site will be put in place during Phase 2. All sites will be monitored approximately every 4- 8 weeks, depending on enrollment.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODOLOGY  Sample Size Considerations : 
Dose-e scalation stage sample sizes are determined per traditional 3+3 design.  The number 
of patients in  the dose-expansion stage is based on safety considerations.  
Phase 2 sample sizes are as described below.  
Cohort 1 is based on a group sequential design with one futility interim analysis at the time of ~33% of patients and one efficacy interim analysis at the time of ~66% of patients 
completing the first response assessments. A total of 173 evaluable pat ients will have 90% 
power on a 1-sided 2. 5% significance level.

FT-2102 Protocol No. 2102 -HEM -101 (Amendment 6)  
Page 16 of 114 
Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 Cohort 2 is based on a Simon’s 2 -stage design for a 4 -month RFS rate. Overall, 
53 patients, with a futility interim at 11 evaluable patients completing the first response 
assessment, will have approximately 80% power on a 1 -sided 2. 5% significan ce level.  
Cohorts 3, 4, and 5 are designed by controlling the lower limit of the 85% confidence 
internal for the estimated rate of r esponse to be at least 10% or more. A total of 20 
evaluable patients is anticipated to be enrolled in order to estimat e the response rate to this 
degree.  
Cohort 6 is based on a Simon’s 2 -stage design for a response rate. With approximately 
44 evaluable pat ients and a futility interim at 14 evaluable patients completing the first 
response assessment, the cohort would have 80% power on a 1 -sided test with a 
significance level  of 5%.  
Cohort 7  uses a Simon’s 2 -stage design to test whether the response rate of patients 
receiving FT -2102 is greater than 25%. Seventeen (17) patients will be enrolled into stage 
1, and 37 into Stage 2, for a total of 54 evaluable patients. Assuming the response rate of FT-2102 treated patients is 45%, this design has 80% power on a 1-sided test using a 2.5% 
significance level.  
Cohort 8  uses a Simon’s 2 -stage design to test whether the response rate of patients 
receiving FT -2102 is greater than 25%. Seven (7) patients will be enrolled into stage 1, and 
21 into Stage 2, for a total of 28 evaluable patients. Assuming the response rate of FT -2102 
+ azacitidine treated patients is 55%, this design has 80% power on a 1 -sided test using a
2.5% significance level.
Analysis Populations:
 
DLT- Evaluable Set  will include all Phase 1 patients  who enrolled in the dose escalation  
cohorts and who have received at least one dose of FT -2102 and completed at least 75% of 
doses in the first cycle during the DLT evaluation period or have discontinued / interrupted 
due to adverse events meeting the DLT evaluation criteria. This set will be used for D LT 
analyses only, unless otherwise specified.  
Safety Analysis Set  will include all patients who have received at least one dose of study 
drug (FT -2102, azacitidine, or cytarabine). All safety analyses will be based on the Safety 
Set unless otherwise specified. Patients will be analyzed under the first dose level received 
by the patient. 
Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  will include all patients who were enrolled in the study and 
received at least one dose of FT -2102.  This analysis set will be used for efficacy analy ses. 
Patients will be analyzed under the assigned dose.  
Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Set  will include all patients in Phase 2 Cohort 1  with confirmed 
IDH1 -R132 (by central lab) who have received the first dose of FT -2102 at least 6 months 
prior to the analysis cutoff date  or who have died, progressed, or discontinued study 
participation . This analysis set is the primary set for Phase 2, Cohort 1 efficacy evaluation.  
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set  is a subset of patients in the EE set, excluding patients who 
have  protocol violations that could impact the evaluation of the efficacy of FT -2102. Some 
violations that would result in exclusion from the PP Analysis Set are: not meeting all 
inclusion/ exclusion criteria for a particular cohort, having received chemotherapy not per 
protocol, received starting dose of FT -2102 other than 150 mg BID , not having at least one 
post-baseline response assessment . The full list of protocol violations will be reviewed on a 
de-identified basis by the medical, data management, and statistical leads prior to locking 
the database, and membership in the PP Analysis Set will be documented and determined based on that review.

August 20, 2020 PK Analysis Set  consists of patients for whom it is possible to calculate at least one 
primary PK paramete r (e.g. C max, AUC last and AUC inf) and who do not have any major 
protocol deviations thought to influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
excretion of the FT -2102.  
PD Analysis Set consists of a ll patients who have received at least one dose of  FT-2102 
and have completed at least one PD assessment. The PD Analysis Set will be used for PK/PD -related analyses unless otherwise specified.  
Efficacy Analyses : 
The analyses of response  will be based on disease -specific criteria derived by the 
investigator from the IWG/  modified IWG criteria for AML (2003 ) and MDS (2006).    
The primary efficacy endpoint for all Phase 2 cohorts except for Cohort 2 is t he complete 
response rate (CR + CRh) , which  will be tabulated by study phase , cohort,  and dose based 
on the best overall response. Phase 2 Cohort 1 will test the complete response rate  using a 
1-sided exact binomial test for one proportion, with a 2.5% significance level. Other Phase 
2 cohor ts have different hypothesis tests, further described in Section 9.2.2 . Additionally, 
the ORR will be calculated for each cohort, presented with the corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals, based on exact binomial methods . Number and percentage of patients 
within other response categories will also be presented by dose/dosing schedule and vis it.  
The primary efficacy endpoint for Phase 2 Cohort 2 is 4-month  RFS, further described in 
Section 9.2.4.3 .   
Analyses of DOR, TTR, EFS , RFS, and OS will be based on Kaplan- Meier methods for 
each cohor t; the median time will be tabulated along with the 95% confidence intervals.  
Safety Analyses: 
 All safety analyses will be descriptive in nature and based on the Safety Set.
 
Number of DLTs, based on the DLT -Evaluable Set, will be summarized by dose level.  
Safety data, including adverse events, safety laboratory values, vital signs, physical examination findings, and ECG results, will be based on the Safety Set, summarized by study stage and phase and by dose, and listed in the individual data listings as appropriate. 
 
For selected safety parameters, National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events ( MedDRA version 19.1) grades and the corresponding shift from 
baseline grade may be evaluated, based on the Safety Set, if available data p ermit.   
Additional efficacy and safety analyses will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.

August 20, 2020 1 BACKGROUND  
This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical 
activity  of the novel anticancer drug FT -2102 (olutasidenib), administered to patients with 
relapsed or refractory acu te myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). FT-
2102 is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable, small- molecule inhibitor of mutated isocitrate 
dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) being developed by Forma  Therapeutics, Inc. and is intended for the 
treatment of patients harboring IDH1 mutations, in both hematologic and solid tumors.  
The presence
 of mutations at codon 132 in IDH1 imparts a neomorphic activity to the enzyme, 
resulting in the production of the “oncometabolite” (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG), which has 
pleotropic roles in tumorigenesis. Studies in genetically engineered mouse models and models derived from cancer patient samples support the hypothesis that mutated IDH1  produces 2- HG, 
the downstream effects of which cause epigenetic changes th at consequently block the proper 
differentiation of progenitor cells and lead to cancer. These data support the therapeutic rationale 
that inhibition of mutated IDH1 will lower (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2- HG) levels  and restore 
normal cellular differentiatio n. 
The promising pr
eclinical data for FT-2102 support its rapid progression into human AML and 
MDS trials . Additional studies in patients with hematologic malignancies are planned and studies 
in patients with solid tumors, including central nervous system (CNS) tumors, that harbor an IDH1 mutation, have been initiated. 
1.1 Pharmacology  
The metabolic enzyme IDH1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). In both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, IDH1 mutations lead to aberrant accumulation of 2- HG. 2 -HG has been proposed to act as an “oncometabolite” that 
has pleotropic effects on tumorigenesis.  Excess production of 2-HG has been shown to inhibit 
α-KG-dependent enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation, collagen synthesis, and cell 
signaling, thereby leading to a block in normal differentiation of progenitor cells and the subsequent
 development  of cancer  (Gross et al . 2010; Cairns and Mak 2013; Losman  et al. 2013 ). 
Therefore, inhibition of mutated IDH1 in tumor cells and the concomitant decrease in 2- HG 
production is expected to restore normal cellular differentiation  and  provide  therapeutic  benefit  in
IDH1 -mutated  cancers.  Clinical proof-of- concept for this rationale has recently been achieved for 
an IDH1 inhibitor in patients with IDH1 -mutated AML  (Fan et al . 2015 ; de Botton et al. 2015).  
1.2 Toxicokinetics  
The toxicokinetics of FT-2102 were determined in rats and monkeys following repeat oral twice 
daily ( BID) dosing for 28 consecutive days and for 3 months. Minimal or no dose accumulation 
was evident in either species. No gender differences w ere seen in monkeys; however, in rats, 
FT-2102 exposure (as measured by maximum plasma concentration [C max] and area under the 
concentration curve [AUC]) was greater in females than in males in both the 1-month  and 
3-month study. In both species, exposure increased with increasing dose in a less thanproportional manner across the dose range evaluated.

August 20, 2020 1.3 Enzyme- Mediated Drug -Drug Interaction Potential  
FT-2102 metabolism is mediated primarily by Cytochrome P450 (CYP). Based on a clinical 
drug- drug interaction study (2102- HVS -103) inhibition of CYP3A4 does not impact the PK of 
FT 2102; however, induction of CYP3A4 significantly reduces FT 2102 systemic exposure.  
In vitro , FT-2102 showed non- significant, competitive inhibition of the major drug metabolizing 
CYP enzymes, CYP s 1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 and weak inhibition of CYP2C8. No 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 wa s seen.  CYP inhibition- mediated clinical DDIs  are not 
expected. 
Based on in vitro  results, FT -2102 exhibits CYP3A4 induction potential and may impact the PK 
of co- administered sensitive CYP3A4 substrates through increased clearance.   
1.4 Toxicology 
A series of studies have been conducted to develop a toxicology profile for FT-2102. The 
program was comprised of single- and re peat-dose exploratory toxicology studies and definitive 
1-month and 3 -month toxicology studies conducted in two mammalian species (rat and monkey)
using BID dosing of FT-2102 to support the most frequent envisioned dosing schedule in humanclinical trials.  In addition, dose-range finding and pivotal embryo- fetal developmental (EFD)
toxicology studies have been completed in rats.
In the definitive 1-month toxicity study conducted in rats, the no- observed -adverse- effect level 
(NOAEL) for FT -2102 was considered to be 450 mg/kg/day (225 mg/kg/dose BID), the highest 
dose administered. Systemic exposure
 (Cmax and  AUC 0-12 hr) at the NOAEL  on Day  28 was
16,700  ng/mL  and  107,000  hr·ng/mL, respectively, in males and 25,000 ng/mL and 
185,000 hr·ng/mL, respectively, in females. Target organs identified histopathologically in the 
rat included the liver (centrilobular hypertrophy) and thyroid gland (follicular-cell hypertrophy). The thyroid effects noted in FT-2102- treated rats are considered secondary to the effects noted 
on the liver and represent a rat -specific mechanism that may not be relevant to human risk. In the 
1-month monkey toxicity study, the highest non- severely toxic dose (HNSTD) of FT -2102 was
considered to be 50 mg/kg/day, and the NOAEL was considered to be 30 mg/kg/day(15 mg/kg/dose BID). Combined- sex systemic exposure (C
max and area under the concentration
curve to the last time point [AUC Tlast]) at the NOAEL on Day 28 was 2,490 ng/mL and
23,600 hr·ng/mL, respectively. Noteworthy histopathological findings in monkeys treated withFT-2102 included multinucleated cells in the sinusoids of the liver and atrophy of the intestinaltract. Following the recovery period, intestinal changes were completely reversible, whereasmultinucleated cells in  the liver were decreased in severity indicating recovery.
In the pivotal 3 -month toxicity study conducted in rat, the NOAEL when dosed BID by oral 
gavage for 3 months was 100 mg/kg/dose (200 mg/kg/day). Systemic exposure (C
max and 
AUC 0-12) at the NOAEL o n Day 91 was 16,400 ng/mL and 116,000 ng·h/mL, respectively, for 
males, and 30,200 ng/mL and 236,000 ng·h/mL, respectively, for females. Findings included minimal, reversible clinical pathology changes and minimal to slight microscopic findings and organ weight changes in the kidney, liver, and thyroid (and higher adrenal weights and lower thymus weights with no microscopic findings). In the pivotal 3-month toxicity study in monkey, the HNSTD for FT -2102 when dosed BID by oral gavage for 3 months was  50 mg/kg/day

August 20, 2020 (25 mg/kg/dose); and the no-observed- effect -level (NOEL) was 30  mg/kg/day (15 mg/kg/dose). 
At 30 mg/kg/day, this corresponded to combined sex Day 88 C max and AUC 0-24 values 
of 3,210 ng/mL and 48,400 ng·h/mL, respectively. At doses >30 mg/kg/day, clinical pathology 
findings consistent with hepatobiliary injury and impaired biliary function were observed. Microscopic findings in the liver were consistent with the clinical pathology findings. Pathology findings were either completely or partially recove red at the end of the 1-month recovery period, 
suggesting signs of reversibility.  
In a neutral red uptake phototoxicity assay conducted in BALB/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts, FT-2102 demonstrated phototoxic potential. FT-2102 was found to be negative in the core battery of three pivotal genotoxicity assays that included in vitro bacterial Ames, in vitro micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes, and in the in vivo rat micronucleus assay. 
Dose -range finding and pivotal EFD toxicity studies were conducted in the rat. In the pivotal 
EFD study, the NOAELs were considered to be 250 mg/kg BID for maternal toxicity and 
250 mg/kg BID for fetal toxicity (corresponding to an AUC
0-24 of 406,000 hr·ng/mL and a 
Cmax(0 -24) of 25,300 ng/mL). No FT-2102- related effects on reproduct ive performance or cesarean 
section parameters were observed. No FT -2102- related fetal external or visceral variations or 
malformations were observed.  
1.5 Clinical Rationale  
The recent identification of frequent mutations in the IDH1 and isocitrate dehydrogen ase 2 
(IDH2 ) genes in human cancers including AML and MDS has provided novel therapeutic targets 
in these diseases (Mardis et  al. 2009 ; Cairns and Mak  2013) . IDH mutation -specific inhibitors 
have been shown to reduce aberrantly elevated levels of the oncometabolite 2 -HG, resulting in 
antitumor efficacy in preclinical models (Rohle et  al. 2013; Saha et al . 2014) . Inhibition of 
mutated IDH1 has recently demonstrated efficacy in AML and initial proof-of-concept in MDS  
(Fan et al. 2015; de Botton et al. 2015; DiNardo et al. 2018 ). 
 
IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML and glioma result in abnormal hypermethylation of histones and DNA and suppression of normal cellular differentiation.   Treatment with the hypomethylating agent azacitidine causes tumor growth inhibition in a patient -derived IDH1 -mutated  glioma model by reducing DNA methylation and inducing glial 
differentiation (Borodovsky et  al. 2013) . Taken together, these data support the combination of 
FT-2102 and azacitidine in the treatment of patients with AML harboring IDH1 mutations. Low dose cytarabine (LDAC) is considered a standard of care (SOC)  treatment option  for AML 
patients ≥ 60 years who are not candidates for intensive therapy. In a xenograft model, the 
combination of an IDH1 inhibitor with short duration low- dose cytarabine decreased the bone 
marrow tumor burden better than either treatment alone (Yen et al . 2013 ). The c ombination of 
FT-2102 with LDAC in the subset of those patients harboring IDH1 mutation might result in additive clinical benefit.

Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 1.5.1 Recommended Phase 2 Dose Selection and Rationale  
Once the maximal tolerated dose (MTD ) or maximal evaluated dose (MED ) has been identified 
for the single -agent or combination cohorts, selected populations of patients with AML/MDS 
harboring IDH 1-R132 mutations will be  enrolled  to confirm a recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D). Up to 14 additional patients may be enrolled into each dose-expansion cohort to 
confirm and further characterize the safety and clinical activity of FT -2102 as a single agent or in 
combination with azacitidine. Up to five dose-expansion cohorts may be enrolled at the potential 
RP2D; two each for single- agent (SA) FT-2102 and in combination with azacitidine and  one 
cohort for FT -2102 in combination with cytarabine.  
From these
 dose -expansion cohorts, a n RP2D of FT-2102 as a single agent or in combination 
will be selected for subs equent evaluation in Phase 2 studies. 
A Sponsor review of available safety data  in March 2018 (for single agent), and in June 2018 
(for azacitidine combination), including a review of all AEs reported in patients treated with the 
150 mg BID dose in the expansion cohorts, indicated that the safety profile was consistent with that of patients treated in dose escalation; no new safety signals were observed in the expansion cohorts. Based on this review and with agreement by participating investigators, FT- 2102 
150 mg BID was declared the RP2D for further evaluation  both as single agent and in 
combination with azacitidine .

August 20, 2020 4 STUDY DESIGN  
This Phase 1 /2 study will utilize a  multicenter, open -label , dose- escalation design to evaluate the 
safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of FT-2102 administered orally to patients with AML or MDS.   
 
Patients will be given FT -2102 daily (QD or BID) in continuous 28- day cycles, alone or in  
combination with azacitidine (admin istered at the dose of 75 mg/m2 for 7 days IV/ SC per every 
28-day cycle) or LDAC (administered  at the dose of 20 mg BID  SC for 10 days every 28-day 
cycle) until treatment discontinuation. The term “study drug” will refer to either FT -2102, 
azacitidine or cytarabine .  
 Patients who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression/relapse or withdrawal of consent will continue to be followed for response until progression/relapse occurs. 
Patients  who achieve an adeq uate response to study treatment and meet other criteria required to 
undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT ) may proceed to HSCT after 
discontinuation of study treatment and will be followed on study for disease evaluation and any 
new HSCT  conditioning or other new antineoplast ic therapies received until disease relapse, 
death, withdrawal of consent, lost to follow -up, or end of study. 
If a patient discontinues study drug to undergo HSCT, but is then deemed ineligible for HSCT, the patient may restart study drug with Medical Mon itor approval . 
Patients who undergo HSCT and then have persistent/recurrent IDH1- mutant (IDH1m) positive 
disease may be eligible to restart treatment with FT -2102 by re-enrolling in the appropriate 
Phase 2 cohort with Medical Monitor approval: 
• Re-enroll ment into Cohort 3 if morphologic relapse/progression  
Patients  who relapse post- HSCT and elect not to restart FT-2102 treatment will enter the overall 
survival follow -up period. 
Patients participating in Phase 1 may be followed for survival for up to 12 months from C1D1 or for 28 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).

4.1.1 Single -Agent (SA) Dose Escalation (C omplete)  
Dose -escalation will be initiated using SA FT -2102 in patients with AML or MDS harboring an 
IDH1 -R132 mutation, as determined by local mutation testing. FT- 2102 will be given orally QD 
(Schedule 1 ) in continuous 28- day cycles at the dose levels proposed in Table 1. It is planned 
that, at a minimum, doses of 150 mg and 300 mg FT- 2102 QD will be tested. Dose increases of 
up to 50% between cohorts is allowed above the 300 mg total daily dose level until t he MTD or 
MED is determined. Additional intermediate dose levels may be explored as clinically indicated. 
A BID dose schedule (Schedule 2)  may be evaluated as indicated. The starting dose in Schedule 
2 will be calculated from the evaluated dose level on Schedule 1 . Actual dose level escalations 
for both schedules will be determined by PK/PD parameters and clinical observations.

a Due to a 24-hour PK collection on Cycle 1 Day 2 (C1D2), the second dose of FT -2102 should not be administered on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 ( C1D1). 
 In vitro solubility studies of FT -2102 simulating the fed or fasted state indicate that absorption 
may be increased up to 3 -fold if FT -2102 is administered with food. If the observed exposure of 
FT-2012 QD and/or BID in dose- escalation indicates absorption in the faste d state may be 
limited, a dose escalation of FT -2102 in the fed state may be evaluated. The starting QD dose of 
FT-2102 in the fed state will be 3-fold lower than a QD dose evaluated in the fasted state found to be safe and tolerable. Dose escalation in the fed state will continue until the MTD or MED i s 
determined. Intra -patient dose escalation within t he first dosing cohort may be allowed in 
Cycle  1, if the FT -2102 concentration at steady state ( Css) is below the intended exposure range.  
 The dose- escalat ion stage  will utilize a 3+3  design whereby three evaluable patients will be 
treated at each dose level.  The first cohort of patients will initiate treatment at Dose Level 1.  
 
• A patient will not be enrolled at the next higher dose level until all patients at the current 
dose level have completed the 28 -day dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) monitoring period.

August 20, 2020 •If one of the initial three patients has a DLT before the end of Cycle 1, the cohort will be
expanded to up to six patients. If five of a total of six patients complete the full Cycle without
a DLT, escalation may continue.
•For a given cohort, once two or more patients have a DLT, further enrollment/treatment for
that cohort will halt, as will dose -escalation. The dose level at which two or more of up to
six patients have a DLT will be considered to be at least one dose level above the MTD.
•The next lower dose will then be more fully evaluated by treating a total of up to six  patients.
If two or more patients have a DLT at this lower dose level, de -escalation will continue until
a dose level is identified at which zero or one of a total of six patients has a DLT. This willbe identified as the MTD.
•Dose -escalat ion may also stop before an intolerable dose level is identified when continuous
PD inhibition is demonstrated.
A DLT is def
ined below in Section 4.1.3. The DLT dose level is defined as the lowest dose level 
at which DLT is experienced in two or more patients within a cohort of ≤ 6 patients. The MTD is 
the highest dose level that does not me et the DLT dose level definition.  The MED is the highest 
dose evaluated in the setting whe n dose escalation is stopped before an MTD is identified.  
Patient e
ntry and dose- escalation will be based upon occurrence of DLTs in all patients at each 
dose level. Adverse events will be reviewed with the Investigators and the Medical Monitor at 
specific timepoints during the conduct of the study. A review will be performed in the 
dose-escalation stage of the protocol prior to the opening of a new dose level and to discontinue 
dose- escalation if the MTD has been reached.  
A minimum of six 
evaluable patients will be required to confirm the MTD or the MED before 
proceeding to the dose-expansion phase for SA FT-2102. 
Patients will
 be monitored for safety while on stud y treatment and for up to 28 days after 
treatment discontinuation (last dose of study drug) to monitor, or until resolution or stabilization of AEs, except for patients who withdraw consent.  
Patients part
icipating in the Phase 1 dose- escalation may be fo llowed for survival for up to 12 
months from C1D1 or for 28 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).  
4.1.2 FT-2102 + Azacitidine ( Combination) D ose-Escalation (C omplete) 
During the course of SA dose- escalation, a parallel escalation arm will  be initiated for FT -2102 
in combination with azacitidine in patients with AML or MDS harboring an IDH1 -R132 
mutation. FT- 2102 will be given orally QD in continuous 28-day cycles as shown in  Table 2. 
The starting dose of FT-2102 in the combination arm will be a dose level at which ≤ Grade 2 toxicities (i.e., no Grade 3 or higher toxicities) were observed when FT-2102 was administered as a single agent.  A BID dosing schedule and/or dosing in a fed state may be explored , as 
indicated.

Note: The starting dose in Schedule 2 will be calculated from the projected dose level on Schedule 1. Actual dose level 
escalations for both schedules will be determined by PK/PD parameters and clinical observations.  
a Schedule 1 is QD dosing of FT -2102 on a  28-day schedule.  
b Schedule 2 is BID dosing of FT -2102 on a 28-day schedule.   
Note: With BID schedule, due to a 24-hour PK collection on Cycle 1 Day 2 (C1D2), the second dose of FT -2102 should not 
be administered on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1).  
With the excep tion of C1D1 and C2D1, when PK sampling is performed, it is recommended that 
FT-2102 should be administered first on the days when both are given. Azacitidine will be 
administered per SOC.  The recommended dosing schedule for azacitidine is daily × 7 days 
consecutively (via subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion), but a 48-hour dose interruption for weekends or holidays is allowed. Azacit idine is to be administered beginning on 
Cycle 1 Day 1 and then Day 1 of each subsequent 28-day treatment cycle.  Alternate schedules 
for the start of azacitidine administration (e.g., beginning on Day 8 of each treatment cycle) may be evaluated when clinically indicated. 
This escalation will also enroll patients on a 3+3 design, whereby three patient s will be treated 
and if one DLT occurs, then the cohort will be expanded to six patients;
 if more than one DLT 
occurs, escalation will stop at that dose level (or schedule). Patients who are unable or unwilling 
to continue treatment with azacitidine after  the first treatment cycle may continue participation in 
the study taking FT-2102 alone, at the discretion of the investigator. 
Patient entry and dose- escalation will be based upon occurrence of DLTs in all patients at each 
dose level. Adverse events will be reviewed with the Investigators and the Medical Monitor at 
specific timepoints during the conduct of the study. A review will be performed in the 
dose-escalation stage of the protocol prior to the opening of a new dose level and to discontinue dose- escalation if the MTD has been reached.  
A minimum of six evaluable patients will be required to confirm the MTD or the MED before proceeding to the dose-expansion phase for the combination arm.

4.1.3 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity 
A dose- limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any AE  occurring in Cycle 1 that fulfills one or 
more of the following criteria . Toxicities will be graded and documented according to the NCI 
CTCAE, version 4.03 guidelines (see  Appendix 4) : 
 
• Nonhematological Grade 3 or greater toxicity that is unrelated to underlying disease, 
occurring in Cycle 1 with the following exceptions: 
o Alopecia 
o Grade  3 nausea, vomiting, diarrhea  or rash lasting less than 72 hours (with optimal 
medical management)  
o Grade 3 QTcF prolongation that is < 40 msec increase over baseline in a patient with 
a bundle branch block (BBB) 
o Grade 3 or 4 toxicity determined to be a sign or symptom of differentiation syndrome 
that resolves/responds to treatment interventions to < Grade 3 within 7 days (see Section 5.5.1)  
• Any Grade 3 non-hematologic laboratory finding, unrelated to underlying disease, 
occurring in Cycle 1 
• Hematologic Grade 4 toxicity as defined by CTCAE on Day 42, in the absence of disease 
• Inability to tolerate a minimum of 75% of FT -2102 scheduled doses during Cycle 1 due to 
an AE.  This applies to patients who have their dose held due to AEs per  Section  6.8.1.  
 
All patients will be monitored for bone marrow function throughout the study, but these findings may not be considered a DLT unless they fulfill the above criteria. A DLT is defined within the 28 days of Cycle  1. However, the sponsor will evaluate all safety 
data, on an ongoing basis, beyond Cycle 1 for determination of an appropriate dose for Phase 2 or later trials.  
 
4.1.4 Phase 1 Dose -Expansion Stage 
The following expansion cohorts are proposed: 
1. SA FT-2102 at the MTD or MED in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) AML or MDS  
 
2. SA FT-2102 at a dose less th an the MTD or MED (only if MTD or MED > 150 mg QD) in 
patients with R/R AML or MDS

prior anti -AML/MDS therapy
4. Combination FT- 2102 (MTD or MED) + azacitidine in patients with AML or MDS that is
R/R to prior anti -AML/MDS therapy (including hypomethylating therapies)
Patients will continue to be monitored for safety while on study trea tment and for up to 28 days 
after treatment discontinuation (last dose of study drug) or until resolution or stabilization of 
AEs, except for patients who withdraw consent. Patients will also be monitored for evidence of antileukemic or antimyelodysplastic activity (Section 4.3).  
Patients par
ticipating in the dose-expansion cohorts may  be followed for survival for up to 12 
months from C1D1 or for 28 days after treatment discontinuation (whichever is longer).   
FT-2102 in combination with cytarabine: 
After dose -expa
nsion is complete for FT -2102 as a single agent and FT-2102 in combination 
with azacitidine, a cohort of 6 patients with AML harboring IDH1 mutation will be treated with 
FT-2102 in combination with cytarabine 20 mg BID for 10 days, and then cytarabine will be stopped for 18 days. FT-2102 will be given in accordance with dosing schedule × 28 days out of 
28 days. The starting dose of FT-2102 will be 150 mg BID. Further dose- escalation of FT -2102 
in combination with cytarabine will not occur beyond 150 mg BID.  
If ≥ 1 DLTs are observed at the 150 mg BID dose in combination with cytarabine, a lower dose 
level of FT -2102 may be explored. 
4.2 Phase 2 Stage  
Specific populations of patients with AML/MDS harboring IDH 1-R132 mutations will be 
enrolled to further characterize t he safety and efficacy of FT -2102 at the RP2D  in Phase 2 
cohorts. Only 1 dose level of FT-2102 as SA and 1 dose level of FT-2102 in combination with 
azaci tidine will be evaluated in the proposed Phase 2 cohorts. 
FT-2102 150 mg BID is the RP2D (see Section 1.5.1) . This RP2D has been confirmed for SA  
and azacitidine  combination treatment.  
Phase 2 cohort
s may include the following: 
Single -Agent Cohorts: 
Cohort 1 (SA FT-2102) : approximately 173 evaluable patients with R/R AML.  To account for 
discordance between local and central mutation testing, approximately 190 patients may be enrolled into this cohort to obtain 173 evaluable patie nts. 
Cohort 2 (SA FT-2102) : approximately 53 patients with AML in morphologic CR/CRi after 
prior therapy (+/ - HSCT ) with residual IDH 1-R132 mutation (≥ 0.01%) detected in the bone 
marrow .

are allowed in this cohort . 
 
Azacitidine Combination Cohorts: 
Cohort 4 (FT-2102 in combination with azacitidine) : approximately  20 patients with R/R 
AML/MDS that is naïve to prior hypomethylating thera py and IDH1 inhibitor therapy. 
Cohort 5 (FT-2102 in combination with azacitidine): approximately  20 patients with R/R 
AML/MDS that have inadequately responded to or have progressed  on prior hypomethylating 
therapy. 
Cohort 6 (FT-2102 in combination with azacitidine) : approximately  44 patients with  R/R 
AML/MDS that have been previously treated with SA FT-2102 as their last therapy prior to 
study enrollment. The actual number of patients  in this cohort may be larger, since patients from 
the FT-2102 SA cohorts of this study are allowed to be enrolled in Cohort 6 after their disease 
progression. 
 Treatment Naïve Cohorts:  
Cohort 7 (SA FT-2102): Approximately 54 t reatment naïve AML patients for whom standard 
treatments are contraindicated . 
Cohort 8 (FT-2102 in combination with azacitidine): Approximately 28 t reatment naïve AML 
patients who are candidates for azacitidine as a first line treatment . 
 
Note for Phase 2 Cohort 7 and Phase 2 Cohort 8: Treatment naïve is defined as no prior 
treatment for AML. Patients may have received a prior treatment for another hematologic malignancy.  
 
Patients will be monitored for safety while on study treatment and for up to 28 days after 
treatment discontinuation (last dose of study drug) or until resolution or stabilization of AEs, except for patients who withdraw consent.  
 
4.3 Response Assessment  
All patients participating in this study will undergo response assessments through evaluation of 
clinical findings and bone marrow/peripheral blood cell counts and morphology. C riteria to 
guide the investigator’s assessment of response are defined in  Table 3  below and Appendix 7 and 
Appendix 8.  
Bone marrow for response assessment is required at:  
• C2D1 if no peripheral blasts; otherwise , at C3D1 , regardless of peripheral blast count

relapse/progression
•For patients with MDS, to be performed as clinically indicated
•When progressive disease is suspected
•The s ame assessment frequency should carry on post- HSCT
•For Phase 2 Cohort 2 only: bone marrow assessment should be done at C2D1, C4D1,
C6D1, and only if relapse is suspected  thereafter
Response criteria are derived from the International Working Group ( IWG ) response criteria for 
AML (2003)  and MDS ( 2006) where applicable; refer also to  Stein et al. 2017. 
In general, HSCT is not considered an event in time to event analyses. Patients who stop 
treatment with FT -2102 to have HSCT will continue to be monitored for duration of response. 
HSCT is not considered an anti- leukemia therapy for purposes of analyses described herein.

Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 Doses of FT -2102 tha
t are omitted for AEs or for any other reason should not be replaced or 
made up at the end of the dosing period. 
When adminis
tered in combination with azacitidine, w ith the exception of C1D1 and C2D1 
(when PK sampling is performed) , it is recommended that FT -2102 should be administered first 
on the days when both FT-2102 and azacitidine are given. 
The site pers
onnel will train the patients and their  caregiver s on procedures for drug 
administration. The pharmacist or study nurse will provide the patients with the correct amount 
of drug for the subsequent dosing period. Patients will be supplied with the correct amount of capsules for the number of doses t o be taken prior to the next scheduled visit. 
5.2.2 Azacitidine  
Unreconstituted vials of azacitidine must be stored according to storage conditions provided in 
the VIDAZA® package insert . 
Please see pharma
cy manual for reconstitution guidelines.

August 20, 2020 5.4 Concomitant Medications  
5.4.1 Allowed Medications  
Concomitant medications can be administered at the Investigator’s discre tion according to 
standard practi ce during the treatment period. Necessary supportive measures for optimal 
medical care will be given throughout the study.  
 Patients who enroll in the study with leukocytosis at baseline or develop leukocytosis after initiation of therapy may receive hydroxyurea. Suggested guidelines for administering hydroxyurea are as follows:  
• For a WBC 10 – 50 x 10
9/L consider administering hydroxyurea 500 mg four times a day 
• For a WBC >  50 x 109/L consider administering hydroxyure a 1000 mg four times a day 
• Hydroxyurea should be tapered/discontinued when WBC count is < 10 x109/L 
 Patients who enroll in the study requiring CNS prophylaxis due to prior CNS involvement and remain asymptomatic may receive intrathecal chemotherapy at the  discretion of the investigator.  
Patients may receive premedication for nausea and/or vomiting at the discretion of the investigator.  
 Patients may receive antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis at the discretion of the investigator.  All concomitant medic ations and supportive therapy administered, starting the first day prior to 
the first dose and until 28  days after the last dose of FT-2102, must be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF  page. 
 
5.4.1.1  Concomitant Medications to Use with Caution  
Co-administration of FT -2102 with strong CYP3A4 inducers significantly reduces FT-2102 
systemic exposure, therefore co -administration is not recommended and investigators should 
consider alternative medications.  
FT-2102 exhibits CYP3A4 induction potential in vitro and may impact the PK of co-administered sensitive CYP3A4 substrates through increased clearance. Medications that are 
sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 should not be used while taking FT-2102. 
If the patient’s clinical condition requires a medicatio n of concern, please discuss with the 
Medical Monitor. Refer to  Appendix 9  for a list of strong CYP3A4 inducers and sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrates .

August 20, 2020 5.4.2 Prohibited Medications  
No other investigational medicinal products will be allowed during this study . 
5.4.3 Anticancer Therapy  
No concomitant anticancer therapy with the exceptions ( hydroxyurea or CNS prophylaxis) noted 
above, will be allowed during this study. 
5.5 Precautions  
5.5.1 Differentiation Syndrome 
Differentiation syndrome has been observed in patients participating in this ongoing study and 
has also been reported in patients with AML/MDS receiving other therap ies targeting IDH1 /2 
mutation s (Birendra et al. 2016; Fathi et al. 2018)  or receiving azacitidine (Laufer and Roberts 
2015).  
Differentiation syndrome can be defined by the presence of any of the following symptoms: 
unexplained fever, cough, fast weight gain  of more tha n 10 pounds  (5 kg) within a week, bone 
pain, dizziness or feeling lightheaded , respiratory distress or shortness of breath, interstitial 
pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusion, swelling of arms & legs and swelling 
around the neck, groin or underarm with or without hyperleukocytosis (Frankel et al. 1992; 
Montesinos et al. 2009 ). No single sign or symptom may be considered per se as diagnostic of 
the syndrome. However, given the life- threatening character of a full -blown (overt) syndrome, it 
is recommended that the prophylactic and therapeutic measures indicated below are undertaken at the earliest manifestations of suspected differentiation s yndrome (e.g., unexplained respiratory 
distress).  
•Temporary discontinuation of FT- 2102 (and azacitidine where indicated) for a minimum of
three  days;
•Prompt initiation of dexamethasone, 10 mg/12 hrs IV until disappearance of symptoms and
signs, and for a minimum of three  days;
•Furosemide , supportive measures and hemodynamic monitoring when clinically required.
As soon as the s
ymptoms and the patient’s clinical condition improve, and after a minimum of 
three  days, treatment with FT -2102 may be resu med. In case of reappearance of symptoms, 
FT-2102 should again be held. Resumption of FT -2102, if indicated, should be reduced one dose 
level for a minimum of the first 7 days after the disappearance of the differentiation syndrome. 
Thereafter, in absence of worsening of the previous toxicity, FT-2102 can be resumed at full 
dosage. 
Where indic
ated, as soon as the symptoms and the patient’s clinical condition improve, and after 
a minimum of 3 days, treatment with azacitidine may be reinstituted at ≤ standard dosing and/or delayed further at the investigator’s discretion.  No dose modifications are required for LDAC.

Forma Therapeutics, Inc.    
August 20, 2020 5.5.2 Leukocytosis  
Rapid myeloid proliferation, presenting as leukocytosis has been observed with other IDH 
inhibitors in the absence of clinical mani festations of differentiation syndrome. In the absence of 
differentiation syndrome, and unless clinically indicated, leukocytosis does not require dose interruption and should be managed by hydroxyurea as per  Section 5.4.1.  
 
5.5.3 Hepatic Injury  
Adverse events potentially associated with hepatic dysfunction have been reported in 
approximately 20% of patients receiving FT-2102 to date. As such, adverse events potentially associated with liver injury have been identified as Adverse Events of S pecial Interest (A ESI). 
AESI , as defined in Section 7.2.4, r egardless if serious or non -serious, must be reported to Forma  
Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of event  as described in 
Section  7.2.4. 
Patients should be monitored for any new or unusual symptoms suggestive of liver injury unrelated to the patient’s primary malignancy. Symptoms may include anorexia, nausea, fatigue, right upper abdominal discomfort or vomiting, dark urine or jaundice. In the event of the development of any new clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic dysfunction, the following clinical investigation is recommended with additional action based upon the patient’s clinical 
presentation and at the treating investigator’s discretion.  
a. Evaluation of international normalized ratio/prothrombin time (INR/PT) , albumin, total  
bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, amylase, lipase, AST , ALT, gamma glutamyl 
transpeptidase,  complete blood count with differential and alkaline phosphatase 
If there is evidence of new liver injury, the following actions should occur:  
a. Report the AE per Section 7.2.4 
b. Consider obtaining FT-2102 serum levels if aberrant dosing is suspected 
c. Obtain tests for viral and other infectious etiologies of hepatitis (including hepatitis A, B, C, D and E) and tests for autoimmune hepatitis 
d. Consider diagnostic imaging (hepatic ultrasound or MRI) and hepatic biopsy if the patient’s clinical status permits  
e. Obtain detailed history of symptoms and concurrent or prior disease, concomitant medications including herbal and dietary supplements, alcohol use, recreational drugs (e.g., cannabidiol or tetrahydrocannabinol) and special diets 
f. Review medical history to include non -alcoholic steatohepatitis (fatty liver), 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, alcoholism or autoimmune disease  
g. Evaluate and discontinue if feasible, all hepatic injury -inducing concomitant medications 
(prescription and over- the-counter) and other hepatic injury-inducing agents (e.g., 
ethanol) 
h. Consider gastrointestinal or hepatology consult

Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 i.Frequent monitoring of A ST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, INR /PT, and total
bilirubin should be initiated. Frequency would be, at minimum, twice per week until
asymptomatic and the patient has returned to baseline or Grade 1 toxicity.
Restarting 
FT-2102 after suspected liv er injury:  
a. Once the AE returns to Grade 0 -1 or baseline, resume treatment with FT-2102 at 150 mg
once daily (see Table 8).
b. For the next 28 days, while reduced dosing at 150 mg once daily, AST, ALT and total
bilirubin should be monitored at minimum twice per week for the first 2 weeks and then
weekly if no recurr ence of elevations are observed.
c.If the AE recurs at 150 mg once daily, the patient will be discontinued from study
treatment (see  Section  6.8.2).
d. If after a minimum of 28 days of 150 mg once daily, the AST, ALT and total bilirubin
have not elevated to Grade 2 or greater and no other symptoms, then FT-2102 may be re-
escalated to the dose level prior to event.
e.Frequent monitoring (at least twice per week) is required upon re- escalation, and may be
decreased after patient has been on the escalated dose for at least 28 days without an
increase in the AST, ALT and total bilirubin.
Patients  on active treatment with FT -2102 should be informed to promptly notify study staff if 
they develop any clinical symptoms of jaundice and to avoid personal habits (excessive ethanol 
consumption, over- the-counter hepatic injurious medications, herbal medica tions [e.g., 
cannabidiol or comparable products]) that may cause additional risk of hepatic injury. 
5.5.4 Phototoxicity 
A phototoxic potential was demonstrated for FT-2102 in a standard in vitro  assay system. Until 
the photosafety of FT-2102 has been adequately demonstrated in vivo , phototoxicity  risks in the 
clinical setting will be managed by the use of light -protective measures. Patients  should be 
instructed to avoid extensive sun exposure, phototherapy, or use of a tanning salon within a prudent amount of tim e prior to and following trial participation.  
5.6 Childbearing Potential  
For all patient s of childbearing potential , all methods of contraception, including abstinence, 
must be in use from the time of consent through the final study visit, and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Patient s who are not sexually active during the Screening Period must 
agree to t he contraceptive requirements if they become sexually active with a partner of the 
opposite sex during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Unique situations that may not fall within these specifications may be discussed with the Fo rma Therapeutics 
Medical Monitor on an individual basis.  
Female patient s will be considered of childbearing potential after the onset of their first 
menstrual period. Female patients who are documented as being of nonchildbearing potential

August 20, 2020 (postmenopausal or having undergone surgical sterilization) are exempt from this requirement. 
Female patient s will be considered postmenopausal if they have had 12 months of consecutive 
spontaneous amenorrhea or less than 12 months of consecutive spontaneous amenorrhea and a serum FSH level > 40 mIU/mL at Screening. Female patients will be considered surgically 
sterile if they are post -hysterectomy, 6 months post- surgical bilateral oophorectomy, or 6 months  
post- tubal ligation.  
 
5.6.1 Contraception Guidelines 
Acceptable method s of contraception under this protocol are listed below.  Periodic abstinence 
(calendar, symptothermal, postovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method are not acceptable methods of contraception. 
Male patient s who can father a child must agree to use one highly effective method of 
contraception, which includes: 
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient.  
• If a male patient  confirms that his female partner(s) is not of childbearing potential (i.e., 
postmenopausal or post-surgical sterilization, as defined above) or is using a highly 
effective method of contraception, this is acceptable as the only means of contraception.  
 Examples of highly effective methods of contraception for male patient s’ female 
partner(s) include:
 
o  Hormonal contraceptives  
o  Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 
Male patients with documented infertility or surgical sterilization (performed at least six months 
before the first dose of study drug) are exempt from the contraception requirement. Infertility may be documented through examination of a semen specimen or by demonstra tion of the 
absence of the vas deferens on ultrasound before the first dose of study drug (Day 1).  
Female patient s who are considered of childbearing potential must agree to use a highly 
effective method of contraception, which may include:  
• IUD 
• Abstinence: abstinence can be used, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the patient. 
• If a female patient  confirms that her male partner(s) has been confirmed to be clinically 
sterile, this method is acceptable as the only means of contraception .
 
 
Hormonal contraceptives are not considered an effective method of birth control for female 
patient s participating in this study. Male condoms with female condoms should not be used 
together.

If the patien
t had any of these assessments within the previous 2 weeks (4 we eks for bone 
marrow aspirate or biopsy), then these assessments need not be repeated.  
6.1.24  Safety Follow -up Visit/Interview  
All AEs will be followed for 28 days after administration of last dose of study drug or until 
resolution or stabilization  as documented by physical examination or appropriate laboratory 
results. If subsequent anticancer therapy is initiated earlier , this visit or contact should occur 
before the initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. The data should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF page. 
6.1.25  Disease Response Follow -up 
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than treatment failure  and have not 
withdrawn consent from overall study participation, should continue to be followed for disease response assessments until the time of disease progression /relapse  or the initiation of a new 
treatment regimen . Patients who have stopped FT-2102 treatment for HSCT should continue to 
be followed until disease progression/ relapse. This information should be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. 
6.1.26  Survival Follow -up 
After a patient discontinues or completes study treatment, the study site may be requested to 
contact the patient approximately every 3  months to collect survival status and data pertaining to 
any other alternative anti -neoplastic therapy. Patients  enrolled in the Phase 1 dose- escalation/

August 20, 2020 dose-expansion stages may have survival follow-up performed for up to 12 months from C1D1 
or 28 days after administration of last dose of drug (whichever is longer). Patients enrolled in the 
Phase 2 cohorts may have survival follow-up for up to 36 months from C1D1 or 28 days after 
administration of last study drug (whichever is longer).  
6.2 Safety  
Safety variables to be assessed include: AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs measurements, physical examination findings, and ECG readings ( see manu al for details of Holter monitoring 
procedures). 
6.2.1 Data Monitoring Committee 
Close monitoring of serious safety events as they are reported is conducted by the medical 
monitor. Serious and non- serious adverse event review is conducted regularly by the medica l 
monitor through monthly listing review. Safety events are also reviewed  during regular study 
conduct meetings between the medical monitor, the clinical team, pharmacovigilance , and the 
participating investigators .  
These study -conduct meetings during the Phase 1 component of this trial include bi -weekly 
internal review meetings to monitor study progress/safety events and bi- weekly teleconferences 
with investigators . For the Phase 2 component of the trial monthly meetings with investigators 
are held .  
Periodic safety reviews by Forma’s internal DMC, consisting of the clinical study team, 
pharmacovigilance, and medical monitors not directly involved in the conduct of Study 2102-HEM -101, also occur.  
This internal DMC meets at least bi -annually to review safety listings and on an ad hoc basis in 
response to new safety signals to rapidly assess overall risk to  participants . The outcome of these 
internal DMC meetings, when relevant, is quickly communicated to study investigators so they may share current risk information with their patients and collect updated informed consent 
forms, if appropriate.  
6.3 Bone Marrow Aspirate and/or Biopsy  
A bone marrow aspirate for clinical purposes should be obtained from each patient prior to 
initiating study treatment (baseline) and while on treatment at the time of response assessment  
(as per  Section 4.3).  
 Bone marrow materials prepared according to the guidelines in the laboratory manual will meet 
specifications to enable central testing (where indicated) for mutational analysis (including 
confirmation of presence of IDH 1-R132 mutation). Bone marrow biopsy may be used for on-
study disease assessment  when bone marrow aspirate is a dry tap .

6.6 Mutational Analysis 
Note:  As of Protocol Version 7/ Amendment 6, samples for mutational analysi s are no longer 
being collected . 
 
Bone marrow aspirate and p eripheral blood samples for exploratory assessments of 
cancer -associated mutations and/or genetic alterations will be collected as follows:  
 A bone marrow aspirate sample will be collected during the Screening period, prior to Cycle 1 
Day 1 . If the patient had a bone marrow aspirate performed within 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 and 
there is sufficient sample available for analysis, it does not need to be repeated.  
At any time while on treatment, if a patient undergoes a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy sample collection for response assessment, material will be requested for cancer -associated mutations 
analysis (refer to  Section 4.3 and Secti on 6.3 for timepoint details). 
 Peripheral blood sample s will be collected at Screening and at each timepoint that a bone 
marrow aspirate or biopsy is obtained.   
 See the laboratory manual provided for details of the specific analyses and instructions on 
collecting and processing of the se samples.

confirmation of IDH1m by the central assay is mandatory for efficacy evaluable (EE) population 
definition, and not an exploratory  assessment.    
6.7 Outcome Research Assessment  
Note:  As of Protocol Version 7/ Amendment 6, quality of life assessments are no longer being 
performed . 
Throughout the cl
inical trial period, patient s will be asked about their quality of life via the 
Quality of Life questionnaires EQ -5D-5L.  
The EQ -5D-5L is
 a standardized instrument developed by the EuroQol Group to describe and 
value health related quality of life. The instrument comprises the following five dimensions: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is 
rated by the patient s on a 5 point scale as having ‘no problems’ (a score of 1), ‘slight problems (a 
score of 2), ‘moderate problems’, (a score of 3), ‘severe problems’, (a score of 4) and ‘extreme problems’, (a score of 5) based on descriptive examples: the scores are not intended to be summed. Present overall state of health is also to be rated on a vertical visual analogue scale (approximately 20cm in length) from 0 to 100 (the higher the number the better quality of life. 
The EQ -5D- 5L w
ill be performed at screening  (any time prior to first dose) and then monthly on 
Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 4 (completed prior to all other D1 procedures) for all Phase 2 patients. 
Patients shou
ld self -complete the EQ -5D- 5L and return to the site. Data will then be entered into 
the patient’s eCRF.  
6.8 Dose Modifications   
6.8.1 FT-2102 Dose Modifications  
Patients participating in the dose- escalation stage who are receiving a dose of FT -2102 that is 
one level below an established safe dose may be considered for intrapatient dose escalation if 
they have not experienced a protocol-defined dose limiting toxicity at the lower dose level, and pending a consultation between the Investigators and Medical Monitor. 
If a patient has an AE
 that is  judged by the Investigator as related to study drug (i.e., assessed as 
unrelated to the underlying disease, intercurrent il lness, or concomitant medications) , then dose 
modifications can be made according to the guidelines in Table 6. Dose modification guidelines 
for liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are presented in  Table 7. Dose reduction guidelines 
are presented in  Table 8. 
Deviations from these guidelines (e.g., drug interruption for a Grade 2 pleural effusion) may 
occur if agreed upon by the Principal Investigator and Medical Monitor. There should be no attempt to make up doses omitted due to toxicity.

August 20, 2020 6.8.2 FT-2102 Recommended Dose Reductions  
A dose may be withheld up to 28 days (up to 14 days for Cycle 1 only) for toxicity. Doses 
withheld for > 28 days (> 14 days for Cycle 1 only) may result in discontinuation from the study, unless approved by the medical monitor.  
In the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the study: Dose reductions in Cycle 1 are allowed only 
after a DLT and not below the 150 mg QD.  
Recommended dose reductions for all AEs including those associated with LFT abnormalities 
are outlined in Table 8.  
Table 8 Recommended FT -2102 Dose Reduction Levels 
Starting Dose  Reduction Level -1 
150 mg BIDa 150 mg QD 
a.Patients currently treated with 100 mg BID can further reduce to 150 mg QD if clinically indicated.
Patients who have a dose reduction due to toxicity may be eligible for a dose increase back to the 
initial dose if the following criteria are met:  
1.Patient has recovered to baseline levels from the toxicity which caused the dose reduction
2.Patient has tolerated the lower treatment dose for > 1 week  (or at least 28 days for liver
function test abnormality  AEs)
Any patient who requires a dose reduction > 1 level below starting dose will be discontinued 
from the study.  Patients who d iscontinue treatment must be monitored per study procedure and 
assessment schedule, unless they withdraw consent.  
6.8.3 Azacitidine Dose Modifications  
Patients enrolled in the combination arm of azacitidine + FT -2102 will be treated at a stable 
azacitidine dose of 75 mg/m2/day for 7 days consecutively (via subcutaneous injection or 
intravenous infusion), but a 48-hour dose interruption for weekends or holidays is allowed. 
Azacitidine is to be administered beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 and then Day 1 of each subsequent 
28-day treatment cycle. Alternate schedules for the start of azacitidine administration (e.g.,
beginning on Day 8 of each treatment cycle) is accepted when clinically indicated at the
investigator’s discretion.
Patients who are unable or unwilling to c ontinue treatment with azacitidine after the first 
treatment cycle  may continue participation in the study taking FT-2102 alone, at the discretion of 
the investigator. During Cycle 1, in dose escalation cohorts only, patients who do not receive at 
least 75 % of their scheduled dose due to drug toxicity (dose hold) will have that counted towards 
the criteria for a DLT.  
Azacitidine 
dose adjustment may be more or less conservative per investigator’s discretion 
according to the local institutional guidelines.

Renal Toxicity  
If unexplained reductions in serum bicarbonate levels to < 20 mEq/L occur, the dosage should be 
reduced by 50% on the next course. Similarly, if unexplained elevations of BUN or serum creatinine occur, the next cycle should be delayed until values return to normal or baseline and 
the dose should be reduced by 50% on the next treatment course. In addition, the laboratory parameters that resulted in the dose delay or reduction should be rechecked twice weekly until they return to baseline or grade 1 level, whichever is worse.  
6.8.4 Cytarabine 
Patients enrolled in the Phase 1 combination cohort of cytarabine  + FT- 2102 will be treated at a 
flat dose of 20 mg BID of cytarabine  given subcutaneously (SC) for 10 days every 28-day cycle. 
Cytarabine  dosing delays and interruptions for adverse events are allowed at the Investigator’s 
discretion.  
Patients who are unable or unwilling to continue treatment with LDAC after the first treatment cycle may continue participation in the study taking FT-2102 alone, at the discretion of the investigator. During Cycle 1, patients who do not receive their scheduled dose due to drug toxicity ( resulting in dose hold) will have that counted towards the criteria for a DLT.

7.1 Adverse Events Definitions  
The Investigator will monitor the occurrence of AEs during the course of the study and for 
28 days after the administration of the last dose of study drug.  
The following definitions of terms are guided by the International Council on Harmonisation and 
the United States Code of Federal Regulations and are included here verbatim.  
Adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product that do es not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  
Serious Adverse Event is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: Death, 
a life -threatening event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitaliza tion, a 
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events  that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject  and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Life-threatening  refers to any adverse event that places the patient or subject , in the view of the 
Investigator , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred ( i.e., it does not include a 
reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).  
Associated with the use of the drug means that there is a reasonable possibility that the 
experience (event) may have been caused by the drug. 
Unexpected adverse event means any adverse event, the specificity or severity of which is not 
consistent with th ose listed in  the current Investigator's Brochure (IB). 
7.2 Reporting of Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Events 
Refer to  Section 6.2.1 for a summary of ongoing safety review during the study, including 
review of any new S uspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (S USARs ). 
Serious AEs (SAEs)  will be collected from the time the patient sign s the informed consent form 
until 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or until the initiation of an investigational agent or 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, whichever comes first, and as per  Section 7.2.3. Serious AEs  will be 
collecte d on the Adverse Event eCRF from the time of first dose of study drug until 28 days after 
the last dose of study drug, or until the initiation of an investigational agent or cytotoxic chemotherapy, whichever comes first.

FT-2102 Protocol No. 2102 -HEM -101 (Amendment 6)  
Page 77 of 114 
Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), as defined in Section  7.2.4, should be collected on 
the AESI Form from the time of first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study 
drug and reported to Forma  Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of 
event. 
Non-serious adverse events will be collected and reported on the Adverse Event eCRF  from the 
time of the first dose of study drug until 28 days after the last dose of study drug, or until the 
initiation of an investigational agent or cytotoxic chemotherapy, whichever comes first.  
Patients withdrawn from the study because of AEs will be followed by the Investigator until the 
outcome is determined . When appropriate, additional written reports and documentation will be 
provided. 
All AEs beginning after the last exposure of study drug must be reported to the Sponsor or its 
designee if the onset of the AE was within 28 days of the last exposure to study drug. All AEs, 
whether serious or nonserious, that are judged by the Investigator to be at least possibly related 
to study drug administration must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee regardless of how much time has elapsed since the last exposure to stud y drug (i.e., beyond 28 days of the last 
exposure to study drug). 
7.2.2 Laboratory Abnormalities 
To the extent possible, all new or worsening laboratory abnormalities observed during the course of the study will be included under a reported AE describing a clini cal syndrome ( e.g., elevated 
blood urea nitrogen and creatinine in the setting of an AE of “renal failure” or elevated ALT/AST in the setting of an AE of “hepatitis”). In these cases ( e.g., an AE of renal failure), the 
laboratory abnormality itself (e.g., elevated creatinine) does not need to be recorded as an AE.  
An abnormal la
boratory value that is not already associated with an AE (e.g., symptoms or 
diagnosis) is to be recorded as an AE only if an action on the study drug or concomitant medication  is ma de as a result of the abnormality, if intervention or management of the 
abnormality is required , or at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Patients experiencing laboratory abnormalities will be assessed and appropriate evaluations performed until all parameters have returned to baseline levels, or are consistent with the patient’s then -current physical condition. 
7.2.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Instructions for reporting Serious Adverse Events are found on Page 4.  
A written repo
rt of all SAEs and deaths that occur between the signing of the ICF  and 28 days 
after administration of the last dose must be submitted to the IRB/EC  and Forma  Therapeutics 
Pharmacovigilance. All SAEs must be reported to Forma  Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 
24 hours for a determination of expedited reporting to the relevant regulatory health authority, as 
CONFIDENTIAL
FT-2102 Protocol No. 2102 -HEM -101 (Amendment 6)  
Page 78 of 114 
Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 described in Section 7.5. In all SAE reports, the Investigator will advise whether or not the SAE 
is judged to be related to study drug administration.  
Serious AEs
 and deaths that occur more than 28 days after administration of the last dose and are 
not reasonably associated with study drug do not require reporting per the instructions given 
below. All SAEs that are judged by the Investigator to be at least possibly related to study drug administration must be reported to the Sponsor or its designee regardless of how much time has 
elapsed since the last exposure to study drug. All nonserious AEs must be communicated to the 
appropriate IRB/EC and/or reported in accordance with local laws and regulations. 
7.2.4 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
As described in Section 5.5.3, adverse events potentially associated with liver injury have been 
identified as A ESI. These AESI (regardless if serious or non -serious) include the following : 
a. All events of Grade 2 or higher elevations in ALT, AST , or total bilirubin  in patients with
normal LFTs at baseline ; in patients with elevated LFTs at baseline, one G rade shift or
higher in ALT, AST, or total bilirubin ;
b. Any hepatic adverse event, e.g., acu te hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, cholestasis, or
hepatic insufficiency
AESI occurring from time of first dose through 28 days after last dose must be reported as 
outlined below: 
a.Report to Forma  Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of knowledge of event
b.If the event meets both AESI and SAE criteria, complete both the SAE and AESI form
c.If the event is non-serious, complete the AESI form alone
Relevant forms (AESI, SAE, or both) should be submitted via fax (+1-617-321- 4111) or email 
(safety@formatherapeutics.com ) to Forma  Therapeutics Pharmacovigilance.  
7.2.5 Reporting of Pregnancies 
If a patient, or the female partner (s) of a male study patient, becomes pregnant during the course 
of the study, the Investigator or site personnel must notify Forma  Therapeutics 
Pharmacovigilance (see  Page 4  for contact details) within 24 hours of the Investigator or site 
personnel becoming aware of the pregnancy. If an SAE occurs in conjunction with the pregnancy, then the reporting time frame for an SAE (within 24 hours) must be met.  
The Sponsor’s r
epresentative will provide instructions on how to collect pregnancy information 
as per the pregnancy reporting guidelines. The pregnancy reporting period begins upon administration of the first dose of FT -2102, and pregnancies will be reported until 90 days after 
the last dose of FT-2102. A final Pregnancy Report Form should be completed w hen outcome of 
the pregnancy is known. Any follow-up information on the outcome of the pregnancy should be forwarded to the Sponsor.

7.2.6 Disease Progression  
If progression of the underlying disease (i.e. , the condition being treated with study drug) might 
be reasonably anticipated given the nature and severity of the underlying disease, then 
progression of the underlying disease per se will not constitute an AE . However, if the 
progression of the underlying disease meets the criterion for “serious” categorization of AEs (e.g., the underlying disease results in death or hospitalization), then the progression of underlying disease should be reported as an SAE (See S ection  
7.2.3).  
 
7.2.7 Overdoses 
Overdoses during the course of the study (whether symptomatic or not) should be reported by the 
Investigator or qualified designee as a protocol violation within 24 hours of the Investigator or 
qualified designee first becoming aware of the overdose. If an overdose results in an AE, the eCRF AE page should be completed, and source documents included. If the overdose results in an SAE, then SAE reporting should be followed using the specific eCRF pages with overdose information entered in the narrative section . All available clinical information relevant to 
overdose, including signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, and therapeutic measures or treatments administered, should be summarized and discussed.  The overdose should also be 
captured on the appropriate FT-2102 exposure eCRF.  
7.3 Classification of Adverse Events by Severity 
The severity refers to the intensity of the AE . The Investigator must categorize the severity of 
each AE according to the NCI CTCAE v ersion  4.03 (see Appendix 4) . CTCAE guidelines can be 
referenced at the  following website: http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. 
 For any term that is not spe cifically listed in the CTCAE scale, intensity will be assigned a grade 
of one through five  using the following CTCAE guidelines: 
 Grade 1 : Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  Grade 2 : Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
 Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation of hos pitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living  
 Grade 4 : Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
 Grade 5 : Death related to AE

August 20, 2020 7.4 Classification of Adverse Events by Relationship to Study  
Drug Administration  
The relationship of each AE to the study drug administration will be assessed by the Investigator ; 
after careful consideration of all relevant factors such as (but not limited to ) the underlying study 
indication, coexisting disease, concomitant medication, relevant history, pattern of the AE, 
temporal relationship to the study medication and dechallenge or rechallenge according to the 
following guidelines: 
YES  (possible, probably, or definitely related): there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply:  
•The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence fr om administration of study drug
•The event could not be reasonab ly attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’s
clinical state, environment, or toxic factors or other modes of thera py, administered to the
patient
•The event follows a known pattern of response to study drug
•The event disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the study drug. In
some situations, an AE will not disappear or decrease in intensity upon discontinuation of
the study drug despite other clear indications of relatedness
NO (unlike
ly, probably not related, or definitely not related): There is no reasonable possibility 
that the study drug caused the event; one or more of the following criteria apply: 
•The event does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fr om administration of study
drug
•The event could be reasonably attributed to the known characteristics of the patient’sclinical state, concurrent illness, environment, or toxic factor or other modes of therapyadministered to the patient
•The event does not follow a known pattern of response to study drug
•The event does not disappear or decrease on cessation or reduction in dose of the studydrug, and it does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re- administered
7.5 Adverse Events Qualifying for Reporting to Regulatory Authorities  
The AEs that  are serio us and unexpected, and assessed as related to study drug, will be reported 
to the regulatory authorities by Forma  Therapeutics, Inc. in accordance with local regulations . 
Serious, unexpected, and study drug- related events are to be reported to the regulatory authorities 
within 15 calendar days of initial notification to Forma  Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee. If the 
AE is serious, unexpected, and related to study drug and is fatal or life threatening, the event will 
also be reported to the regulatory authorities within seven  calendar days.

DISCONTINUATION  
8.1 Study or Study Site Termination  
If the Investigator, the Sponsor or Sponsor ’s Study Director or appropriate regulatory officials 
discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that 
the study center should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation among the Sponsor, Investigator, and Study Monitor. Criteria that may be considered when 
determining a potential termination of the study would be unacceptable toxicity and/or an 
unfavorable risk -benefit profile.  
Study termination and follow-up will be performed in compliance with the conditions set forth in 
the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) sixth efficacy publication (E6) on Good 
Clinical Practice, Section 4.12, ICH E6 4.13, ICH E6 5.20, and ICH E6 5.21, with appropriate 
notification of the FDA and all IRB’s /EC’s  having approved the study protocol and ICF. 
8.2 Treatment and Study Discontinuation 
8.2.1 Treatment Discontinuation  
Study treatment discontinuation occurs when a patient  is no longer receiving any study drug (FT-
2102, azacitidine, or cytarabine, as applicable). Treatment discontinuation is not necessarily 
accompanied by discontinuation from the study, as discussed in Section 8.2.2. 
A patient should be discontinued from study treatment if, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
doing so is medically necessary, or if it is the wish of the patient. Reasons for discontinuation 
from study treatment may include any of the following: 
•Unacceptable AE or failure to tolerate study therapy
•Delay in dosing of > 28 days, without approval of Sponsor
•Treatment failure (i.e., progression or relapse) (see Section  4.3, Table 3  for definition)
•Hematopoietic s tem cell transplant  (HSCT)
•Withdrawal of consent (no further study participation)
•Patient decision to discontinue study treatment
•Discretion of the Investigator
•Major protocol violation
•Pregnancy
•Lost to follow -up
•Death
•Termination of the study by Sponsor
All AEs lea
ding to the discontinuation of study drug will be followed for 28 days after 
administration of last dose of study drug or until resolution or stabilization as documented by physical examination or appropriate laboratory results.

ANALYSIS  
9.1 Data Recording and CRF Processing 
In place of recording patient data on paper CRFs, which will not be used in this study, site 
personnel are responsible for entering such data into t he Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system. 
This system has been validated and is compliant with FDA, ICH, and European Union (EU) 
regulations and guidelines and with Department of Health and Human Services 21 CFR Part 11 
rules for electronic records and elec tronic signatures. No data will be requested other than what 
is routinely written on paper CRFs. 
An audit may be performed at any time during or after completion of the clinical study by 
Sponsor personnel or their designee. All study-related documentation must be made available to the designated auditor. 
9.2 Statistical Analysis  
9.2.1 General  Considerations  
Unless otherwise specified, continuous endpoints will be summarized with n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min), and maximum (max). If the measurements in the 
source (raw) data are integers, then the corresponding mean and median will be presented to 1 decimal place and the SD to 2 decimal places; if the measurements are obtained to 1 decimal place, then the mean and median will be presented to 2 decimal places and the SD to 3 decimal places; and so forth. Minimum and maximum will be displayed as reported in the source (raw) data. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each timepoint and 
summarized descriptively . For ca tegorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts 
and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place unless otherwise specified.  
All analyses and summary outputs will be generated using SAS® version 9.3 (or higher). 
All patient data, including those derived, will be presented in the patient data listings; listings 
will display for all patients, regardless of whether or not they received study drug. In general, the 
patient data listings will be sorted by treatment (dose levels) , patient number and assessment visit 
and date (and time, if applicable) . The summary tables will be presented descriptively overall 
and by treatment group.  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the last non- missing measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
9.2.2 Sample Size 
Sample size calculations are based on the primary objectives for each study cohort.

August 20, 2020 9.2.2.1   Phase 1  
The primary objective for Phase 1  in this study is to evaluate DLT or identify MTD/MED and 
recommend a dose for Phase 2. Within the Phase 1 portion of the study, the Dose -Escalation 
Stage  is based on a traditional 3+3 design to avoid selection of a dose going forward in 
development that causes a treatment -limiting toxicity in more than 17% of patients. At each dose 
level, 3 patients will be enrolled ; if < 1/3 DLTs are identified, the dose will be escalated to the 
next dose level . If 1 DLT is identified, 3  additional patients  will be added to the same dose level. 
If 1/6 DLT is identified, the study will be escalated to the next dose level. Otherwise, the MTD 
will be identified as the dose lower than the dose with > 1/6 DLTs.  
 
The total number of patients who will be enrolled in the dose- escalation stage will depend on the 
number of DLTs observed within each dose cohort. It is anticipated that, at a minimum, doses of 150 mg and 300 mg FT-2102 QD will be tested as a single agent and in combination with azacit idine . If 6 patients are treated at each dose level, approximately 24 patients will be treated 
in the dose- escalation stage . 
 During the Phase 1 Dose -Expansion Stage, each of the non-LDAC cohorts would have 
14 patients.  With  20 patients treated (at least 6  from the dose-escalation stage, 14 from  
dose-expansion) at the determined MTD/MED, the probability of observing at least 1 incidence 
is > 8 7% for adverse events of true incidence rate of ≥17%. For the LDAC cohort, the  selecti on 
of 6 patients is a minor variation of the traditional 3+3 design in order to identify the risk of 
LDAC for toxicities in more than 17% of patients . 
 
9.2.2.2  Phase 2 
The primary objective of Phase 2 is to evaluate the clinical activities of FT -2102 alone or in 
combination in patients with R/R AML or MDS and confirmed IDH1 mutation . 
 
Cohort 1 (patients with R/R AML harboring IDH 1-R132 mutations): A group sequential design 
is planned for this cohort  with two interim analyses and a final test. One hundred seventy t hree 
(173) patients provide 90% power to test the null hypothesis that the true complete response rate 
(CR + CRh) is 15% or less versus the one- sided alternative hypothesis that the true complete 
response rate is greater than 15%, with a 2.5% significance level  using a one -sided exact test for 
a binomial proportion, assuming the true response rate is 25% .  
 
Two interim analyses are planned, at approximately 33% and 67% of the information. O’Brien -
Fleming stopping boundaries will be used for both alpha and beta adjustments. At the first 
interim, if ≤ 6/58 responses are observed (or crude p- value ≥ 0.88), the trial may be stopped early 
for futility. The first interim analysis will be conducted on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) within Phase 2 Cohort 1. At the first interim analysis, the study is not intended to stop for efficacy . At 
the second interim analysis, if ≥ 28/115 responses are observed (or crude p- value is ≤ 0.0057), 
the trial may stop enrollment for efficacy  and if there are 20 or fewer responses  (or crude p- value 
is > 0.2718) the trial may be stopped for futility. The second interim analysis will be conducted

August 20, 2020 in the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Set within Phase 2 Cohort 1. In the event of an early stop for 
efficacy, all enrol led patients would remain on treatment and their long- term efficacy data, such 
as EFS and OS, will continue to be observed. 
If the study is not stopped early for efficacy or futility, at least 173 evaluable patient s are planned 
to be enrolled. A one- sided exact test will be performed. If the one -sided p -value is ≤ 0.0245, the 
null hypothesis (the response rate is ≤ 15%) will be rejected, and the alternative hypothesis that 
the response rate is > 15% will be accepted. If exactly 173 patient s are evaluable, this is 
equivalent to 36 or more responses observed. 
To account for 
potential discordance between central and local testing of the IDH1 -R132 
mutation, approximately 190 patients are planned to be enrolled into this cohort. 
Cohort 2 (patients with AML with persistent IDH 1-R132 mutation + bone marrow 
demonstrating morphologic CR/CRi after prior therapy +/ - HSCT ): A Simon optimal two -stage 
design will be used. The null hypothesis that the true 4-month RFS  rate is 80% will be tested 
against a one- sided alternative. In the first stage, 11 patients will be evaluated . If 9 or fewer of 
the first 1 1 patients are relapse-free at 4 months, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 42 
additional patients will be accrued, for a total of 53 patients . The null hypothesis will be rejected 
if 48 or more of these 53 patients are event -free at 4 months. This design yields a 1 -sided type I 
error rate of 0.0 25 and power of 80% when the true 4-month RFS  rate is 94%.  
Cohorts 3- 5 (patients with AML/MD S harboring IDH 1-R132 mutations that are R/R to prior 
IDH1 inhibitor therapy; or naïve to hypomethylating and ID H1m inhibitor treatments; or R/R to 
prior hypomethylating therapy):  A single- stage design with 20 patients will be used . If 4 or more 
complete r esponses are observed in these 20 patients, the lower bound of a one- sided 85% 
confidence interval based on an exact binomial distribution will be greater than 10%, thus supporting the hypothesis that the true complete response rate is greater than 10%. 
Cohort 6 (patients with AML/MDS harboring IDH 1-R132 mutations that are R/R to immediately 
prior SA IDH1 inhibitor therapy): A Simon’s optimal two -stage design will be used. The null 
hypothesis that the true complete response rate is 15% will be tested against a one-sided alternative. In the first stage, 1 4 patients will be evaluated. If there are 2 or fewer complete 
responses in the first 14 patients, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 30 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 44 patients. The null hypothesis will be rejected if 11 or more complete responses are observed in these 44 patients. This design yields a 1 -sided type I error rate of 0.05 
and power of 80% when the true complete response rate is 32%. The probability that the trial will be stopped at the end of the first stage if the true complete response rate is 10% is 0.65.  
Cohort 7 (t reatment naïve AML patients for whom standard treatments are contraindicated ): A 
Simon’s optimal two -stage design will be used. The null hypothesis t hat the true complete 
respons e rate is 25 % will be tested against a one- sided alternative. In the first stage, 1 7 patients 
will be evaluated. If there are 5  or fewer co mplete responses in the first 17 patients, the study 
will be stopped. Otherwise, 37 addi tional patients will be accrued for a total of 54  patients. The 
null hypothesis will be rejected if 20 or more complete re sponses are observed in these 54  
patients. This design yields a 1 -sided type I error rate of 0.0 25 and power of 80% when the true 
complete response rate is 45 %.

A Simon’s optimal two -stage design will be used. The null hypothesis that the true complete 
respons e rate is 25% will be tested agai nst a one -sided al ternative. In the first stage, 7  patients 
will be evaluated. If there are 2 or fewer complete responses in the first 7  patients, the study will 
be stopped. Otherwise, 21  additional patients will be accr ued for a total of 28 patients. The null

9.2.3 Analysis Sets 
DLT -Evaluable Set  will include all patients in dose escalation who have received at least one 
dose of FT-2102 and completed at least 75% of doses in the first cycle during the DLT 
evaluation period, or have discontinued due to adverse events meeting the DLT evaluation 
criteria. This set will be used for DLT analyses only, unless otherwise specified.  
Safety Analysis Set  will include all patients who have received at least one dose of study drug 
(FT-2102, azacitidine, or cytarabine). All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Set unless otherwise specified.  Patients will be analyzed under the first dose level received by the patient. 
Full Analysis Set  (FAS)  will include all patients who were enrolled in the study and received at 
least one do se of FT -2102. This analysis set will be used for efficacy analyses.  Patients will be 
analyzed under the assigned dose.  
Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Set  will include all patients in Phase 2 Cohort 1 with confirmed IDH 1-
R132 (by central  lab) who have received the first dose of FT-2102 at least 6 months prior to the 
analysis cutoff date or who have died, progressed, or discontinued study participation. This analysis set is the primary set for the Phase 2, Cohort 1 efficacy evaluation. Patients will be 
analyzed by assigned dose. 
Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set  is a subset of patients in the EE set, excluding patients who have 
protocol violations that could impact the evaluation of the efficacy of FT -2102. Some violations 
that would result in exclusion from the PP Analysis Set are: not meeting all inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria for a particular cohort, having received chemothera py not per protocol, received starting 
dose of FT-2102 other than 150 mg BID, not having at least one post- baseline response 
assessment . The full list of protocol violations will be reviewed on a de -identified basis by the 
medical, data management, and statistical leads prior to locking the database, and membership in 
the PP Analysis Set will be documented and determined based on that review. 
PK Analysis Set  consists of patients for whom it is possible to calculate at least one primary PK 
parameter (e.g. C
max, AUC last and AUC inf) and who do not have any major protocol deviations 
thought to influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of the FT-2102.

August 20, 2020 PD Analysis Set  consists of a ll pati ents who have received at least one dose of FT -2102 and have 
completed at least one PD assessment. The PD Analysis Set will be used for PK/PD -related 
analyses unless otherwise specified.  
9.2.4 Analysis of Clinical Data  
9.2.4.1  Demographic and Tumor Characteristics 
Baseline demographic and tumor characteristics will be s ummarized using descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, median, minimum, maximum, standard deviation [SD], standard error [SE] for 
continuous variables; n, percent for categorical variables) for each cohort using the cohort to which they were initially assigned, and all patients will be accounted for.  
9.2.4.2   Safety Analysis  
For DLT-evaluable patients, the summary of DLTs will be provided by dose/dosing schedule for patients in the Phase 1 dose- escalation stage.  All other safety analyses will be based on the 
Safety Set.  
For each stage, the safety and tolerability of FT -2102 will be assessed, as evaluated by adverse 
events, concomitant medication usage, changes from baseline in physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and ECG. Safety  data will be listed by  patient  and 
summarized descriptively .  
A treatment -emerg
ent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with onset on or after 
the start of study drug, or any worsening of a pre- existing medical condition/adverse event with 
onset on or after the start of study drug and until 28 days after the last dose. For each stage, all  
adverse events will be coded using MedDRA version 19.1 or higher and summarized by SOC and PT, for each treatment group. Multiple occurrences of an AE are counted only once per patient  per SOC and PT for summary tables. Causality of TEAEs (not related, related) and 
severity (NCI CTCAE version 4.03 or higher) will be summarized by treatment for each stage.  
Relationshi
p will be presented by study drug when applicable . All adverse events and serious 
adverse events (including those with onset or worsening before the start of study drug) will be listed.   
Safety laborato
ry, vital sign, ECG and physical examinations will be summarized by visit. The 
change from baseline will be presented along with  the by- visit sum maries. Shifts in laboratory 
grades, as well as QTcF shifts, will be tabulated. Assessment of changes in liver function tests 
will be conducted. Abnormal safety assessments will be flagged and separ ately presented . All 
safety data will be lis ted.

August 20, 2020 Assessment of differentiation syndrome will be conducted as per  Montesinos et al. 2009, 
searching for candidate cases of differentiation syndrome based on AE reports of dyspnea, 
pulmonary infiltrates, edema, weight gain, pleural effusion, renal failure, hypotension, 
pericardial effusion, and unexplained fever. Specific methods of identifying candidate cases will be fully described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
9.2.4.3  Antileukemic and Antimyelodysplas tic Activity 
All analysis in the section will be based on patients in the  EE Set  as the primary analysis, with 
additional analyses on the FAS, and in some cases the PP Set as supportive. 
Primary E
fficacy Endpoints and Hypot heses  
CR/ CRh Rate  
The primary efficacy endpoint for all Phase 2 cohorts, with the exception of Cohort 2, is the 
CR/CRh rate (defined as bone marrow blasts < 5% with complete (CR) or partial (C Rh) 
hematologic recovery; see  Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 for complete definition ). The 
CR/CRh rate will be calculated and presented  together with the Clopper- Pearson 95% 
confidence interval for each cohort.  
For Phase 2, C
ohort 1, to test the hypothesis that the complete response rate is greater than 
15%, a 1- sided exact test for a binomial proportion will be performed. If the exact 1 -sided p -
value is less than 0.023, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted. This is equivalent to at 
least 36 CR/CRh responses of 173 EE patients. 
For Phase 2, C
ohorts 3, 4, and 5 test the hypothesis that the 85% confidence interval for the 
complete response rate does not include 10%. If there are 5 or more complete responses of the 20 patients in these cohorts, the 85% confidence interval will be greater than 10%, and the alternative hypothesis that the response rate is greater than 10% will be accepted.  
Phase 2 Cohorts
 6, 7, and 8 are Simon 2-Stage designs and the primary efficacy endpoint 
will be evaluated via the number of CR/CRh responses stipulated in the design criteria described in Section 9.2.2. 
4-Month RFS
The primary endpoint for Phase 2 Cohort 2 is the 4-Month RFS. This will be evaluated by a Simon 2-Stage design described in Section 9.2.2,  testing the null hypothesis that the 
4-month RFS is < 80%. It is defined as the proportion of patient s who have not relapsed  or
died on or before their 4- month response evaluation. If a patient does not receive a disease
response assessment at their 4 -month visit but has a subsequent disease response assessment
on or after study day 120 that shows non-progression/ non- relapse, they will be evaluated as
having achieved 4- month RFS.

Forma Therapeutics, Inc.   
August 20, 2020 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
CRi, MLFS, Marrow CR, and PR definitions will be  derived from the IWG response criteria (see 
Section 4.3, Appendix 7 and Appendix 8) for AML  (2003) and MDS ( 2006) based on 
investigator’s assessment.  
Transfusion 
independence, defined as the proportion of patients who have received a packed red 
blood cell or platelet transfusion in the eight weeks prior to first dose of FT -2102 who have a 
28-day period during any point on study with no transfusion required. Additionally, the number
of patients who are transfusion independent for at least 56 consecutive days will also besummarized.  Percent of transfusion independence will be calculated based on the number of
patients who were transfusion dependent prior to first dose of FT-2102.
For each cohor
t, the number and percentage of the best overall response will be presented by 
response category and by treatment group. Other binomial endpoints including overall  response 
rate ( CR + CRh + CRi + MLFS + PR ) and rate of responses in the individual response category , 
will also be analyzed . Number and percentage of patients within each response category  will be 
presented by dose/dosing schedule and visit. Clopper- Pearson  95% confidence intervals will be 
provided along with the responses. 
Overall surviva
l for all cohorts at landmark timepoints will be analyzed.  
Time to eve
nt data will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier (KM) methods for each cohort. The 
median time will be tabulated along with the 95% Brookmeyer Crowley confidence intervals. 
The estimated probability of survival over time will be plotted as KM curves for each cohort (or 
by disease type and by treatment). 
Detailed consi
derations for all t ime to event variables are provided in the SAP. 
Additional e
fficacy analyses will be specified in the SAP.  
9.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed in patients  in the PK Analysis Set.  
Concentrati
on-time profiles will be constructed from the plasma samples obtained. Estimates of 
the AUC and slope of the terminal decay phase will be used to calculate values of the following PK parameters: t
1/2, CL/F, Tmax, and Vd/F . The plasma profiles will also be fitted by nonlinear 
regression analysis whenever possible. An analysis of variance or corresponding nonparametric statistical tests will be applied:  
•To compare mean values of PK  variables and parameters determined at different doses
and
•To identify the existence of trends in C
max and/or metabolite concentrations within
patients that may be suggestive of drug accumulation or alterations in PK behavior.

9.2.6 Pharmacodynamic Analysis  
Pharmacodynamic analysis will be performed in patients in the PK Analysis Set.  
 
All PD data will be presented i n tabular and/or graphical format and summarized descriptively . 
Absolute change from baseline and/or percentage change from baseline will be summarized by dose level. Patients in the dose expansion portion of this study will be considered a separate 
cohort for the purposes of these presentations.  
 
9.2.7 Genotypic Analysis  
All genotypic data will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format and summarized 
descriptively . Cancer -associated mutations  and/or genetic alterations will be correlated with 
responding and nonresponding patients. Patients in the dose expansion portion of this study will be considered a separate cohort for the purposes of these presentations.  
 
9.2.8 Quality of Life Analysis  
Quality of life , as assessed by the EQ -5D- 5L, will be analyzed for patients in the EE and FAS. 
EQ-5D-5L data will be summarized from the screening visit through cycle 4 for the FAS and EE 
Analysis sets (Phase 2). The number and percentage of patients reporting each score per 
dimension will be summarized, as well as the number reporting some problems on that dimension (score > 1). Also the change from baseline in the number reporting some problems in 
each dimension will be reported (raw and percent change). Additional analyses and t echniques 
for handli ng missing data will be described in the SAP. 
 
9.2.9 Interim Analysis  
Interim analyses will be performed for the Phase  2 Cohort 1 and in  other applicable Phase 2 
cohorts that use two- stage design s, at defined timepoints. These are described in  Section 9.2.2.2. 
As a result of these analyses, enrollment in a given cohort may be stopped early either for 
efficacy or futility.

Adapted from IW G Response Criteria (Cheson et al. 2003 ); see also  Stein et al. 2017.  
Response Category  Response criteria (no minimum duration required unless 
indicated)  
Morphologic 
leukemia free state 
(MLFS) • BM blasts <  5% (in aspirate with spicules and 200 nucleated 
cells)  
• No blasts with Auer rods 
• No extramedullary disease 
Morphologic 
complete remission (CR)  Same as MLFS, and:  
• ANC ≥  1000/µL 
• Platelets ≥  100,000/µL 
• Transfusion Independence  
Cytogenetic Complete 
Remission (CRc)  CR with no residual cytogenetic abnormalitiesa 
Molecular Complete 
Remission (CRm) CR with undetectable  IDH1m minimal residual disease (MRD) 
CR with incomplete 
hematologic recovery 
(CRi)  CR but with ANC <  1000/µL, or platelets <  100,000/µL  
CR with partial 
hematologic recovery 
(CRh)  < 5% BM blasts and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts 
(platelets > 50 x 109/L and ANC > 0.5 x 109/L) 
Partial remission (PR)  Reduction of BM blasts:  
• to a value between 5 % – 25%, if baseline was ≥ 50% 
• by 50% to a value >5%, if baseline was between 5% - 49% 
Persistence of Auer rods, even if BM blasts ≤ 5% 
Hema tologic values consistent with a CR:  
• ANC ≥ 1000/µL and 
• Platelets ≥ 100,000/µL 
Stable Disease (SD)  Failure to achieve at least a PR but not meeting criteria for 
progressive disease (PD) . SD for a period of 8 weeks or more 
indicates clinical benefit

indicated)  
Recurrence, 
Morphologic Relapse In patients who achieved CR, CRh, CRi, MLFS:  
• Reappearance of peripheral blasts, or  
• ≥ 5% BM blasts (if no peripheral blasts, may repeat BM 
assessment to distinguish relapse from BM regeneration)  
• Development of extramedullary disease  
Disease Progression  In patients with PR or SD:  
• For patients with 5% to 66% BM blasts at nadir, a >50% increase in BM blast count percentage from the nadir and percentage is ≥ 20%; and  
• For patients with ≥ 67% BM blasts  at nadir, a doubling of the 
nadir absolute peripheral blood blast count with a final absolute peripheral blood blast count >10 x 10
9/L 
• New extramedullary disease  
BM = bone marrow 
a Analysis by either conventional banded karyotyping or FISH is accepted

August 20, 2020 Appendix  8 Response Criteria for MDS  
Adapted from IWG Response Criteria for MDS (Cheson et al. 2006)  
Response Category  Response criteria (responses must last at least 4 wk s) 
Complete remission  
(CR)  • Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts with normal maturation of all 
cell lines* Persistent dysplasia will be noted* 
• Peripheral blood‡: 
o Hgb ≥ 11 g/dL 
o Platelets ≥ 100 × 109/L  
o Neutrophils ≥ 1.0 × 109/L  
o Blasts 0%  
Partial remission 
(PR)  All CR criteria if abnormal before treatment except:  
• Bone marrow blasts decreased by ≥ 50% over pretreatment but 
still > 5%  
• Cellularity and morphology not relevant 
Marrow CR  Bone marrow: ≤ 5% myeloblasts and decrease by ≥ 50% over 
pretreatment  
Peripheral blood: if HI responses, they will be noted in addition to marrow CR  
Stable disease (SD)  Failure to achieve at least PR, but no evidence of progression for 
> 8 wks  
Relapse after CR or 
PR At least 1 of the following:  
• Return to pretreatment bone marrow blast percentage 
• Decrement of ≥ 50% from maximum remission/response levels 
in granulocytes or platelets  
• Reduction in Hgb concentration by ≥ 1.5 g/dL or transfusion dependence

Disease progression 
(PD)  For patients with:  
• Less than 5% blasts: ≥ 50% increase in bl asts to > 5% blasts  
• 5%-10% blasts: ≥ 50% increase to > 10% blasts 
• 10%- 20% blasts: ≥ 50% increase to > 20% blasts 
• 20%- 30% blasts: ≥ 50% increase to > 30% blasts 
Any of the following: 
• At least 50% decrement from maximum remission/response in 
granulocytes or platelets  
• Reduction in Hgb by ≥ 2 g/dL 
• Transfusion dependence  
HI: hematologic improvement  
*Dysplastic changes should consider the normal range of dysplastic changes.  
‡ Transient cytopenias during repeated chemotherapy courses should not be considered as interrupting 
durability of response, as long as they recover to the improved counts of the previous course.

Relevant reduction of units of RBC transfusions by an absolute number of at least 4 RBC transfusions/8 wks compared with the 
pretreatment transfusion number in the previous 8 wks . Only RBC 
transfusions given for a Hgb of ≤ 9.0 g/dL pretreatment will count in 
the RBC transfusion response evaluation 
Platelet response 
(pretreatment, < 100 X 10
9/L) Absolute increase of ≥ 30 × 109/L for patients starting with 
≥ 20 × 109/L platelets

Progression or 
relapse after HI‡  At least 1 of the following:  
• At least 50% decrement from maximum response levels in granulocytes or platelets  
• Reduction in Hgb by ≥ 1.5 g/dL 
• Transfusion dependence  
*Pretreatment counts averages of at least 2 measurements (not inﬂuenced by transfusions) ≥ 1 week apart.  
‡In the absence of another explanation, such as acute infection, repeated courses of chemotherapy, gastrointestinal 
bleeding, hemolysis, and so forth. It is recommended that the 2 kinds of erythroid and platelet responses be reported overall as well as by the individual response pattern.

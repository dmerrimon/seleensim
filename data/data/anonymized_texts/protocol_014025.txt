•Explor e the effect of lemborexant on blood biomarkers potentially related to dementia, O SA 
and/or COPD
Study Design
In both the OSA and COPD Cohorts, this will be a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
2-period crossover study.  There will be 2 phases, Prerandomization and Randomization.  The 
Prerandomization Phase will last up to 21 days and will consist of the Screening Period and Baseline 
Period.  In the Randomization Phase subjects will be randomized i n treatment sequences A or B 
(OSA Cohort), or treatment sequences C or D (COPD Cohort) consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, 
each of 8 days duration, separated by a washout interval of at least 14 days, and a Follow -up Period 
of approximately 28days.  Approx imately 28days after the final study dose, there will be an end of 
study (EOS) Visit.
Prerandomization Phase: 
Screening Period
The Screening Period will begin no more than 21 days before the subject is randomized and during 
which informed consent will be obtained after the study has been fully explained to the subject and 
befor e the conduct of any screening procedures or assessments.  Subjects eligible for the COPD 
Cohort will then undergo screening spirometry between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (designated Visit 1A), 
Clinical Study Protocol
Incorpo rating Amendment 01E2006 -A001 -113
Eisai
FINAL (V2.0) :  13 Jul2020Confidential Page 6of 75which may be performed at the study site, or offsite, so long as a final report is available for review at 
the study site by Visit 2.  Spirometry will be performed based on Global Initiative for Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations.  
After at least 6 days of the initial Screening visit, (to allow subjects the opportunity to complete the 
sleep diary for at least 5 nights), subjects will return to the clinic for the second Screening Visit to 
undergo PSG.  For subjects being evaluated for the COPD Cohort, results of screening spirometry 
will also be reviewed.
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory.  
The mean habitual bedtime (MHB) will be calculated from the most recent 5 days of th e subject’s 
sleep diary.  This will be used to determine bedtime (“lights off”) . The PSG recording will begin at 
“lights off ”and will continue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The end of the 8 -hour PSG recording will 
be defined as waketime (“lights on”).  Subjects may leave the clinic after the investigator determines 
that it is safe for them to do so.
The PSG will be reviewed f or exclusion criteria related to OSA severity ( only mild for the OSA 
Cohort, and moderate to severe for the COPD Cohort), periodic limb movement disorder, and 
parasomnias.  The pulse oximetry recording will be reviewed for exclusion criteria related to oxy gen 
desaturation.
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will enter the Baseline Period.
Baseline Period
At the Baseline Period (1 day) eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic.  After completion of 
routine safety as sessments, inclu ding the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS ),blood 
samples will be collected for the exploratory biomarker  analyses ,including potentially related to 
dementia , COPD, and OSA -related biomarkers and then subjects will enter the Randomization Pha se.  
Randomization Phase 
In the Randomization Phase subjects will be randomized in treatment sequences A or B (OSA 
Cohort), or treatment sequences C or D (COPD Cohort) consisting of 2 Treatment Periods, 8 nights 
duration each: lembor exant 10 mg and plac ebo, with the treatments periods separated by a washout 
interval of at least 14 days.  Randomization will be stratified by age (adults ≥45 and <65 years, vs 
elderly ≥65 to 90 years).  A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized to ensure that, for e ach 
Cohort, 20 evaluable adult subjects and 10 evaluable elderly subjects complete the study.   Within 
each age stratum, subjects will be randomized to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio and 
enter Treatment Period 1.
Treatment Periods 1 and 2
Subjects will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory.  On Day 1, subjects will receive study drug 
immediately (within 5 minutes) before “lights off”.  The PSG recording will begin at “lights off” and 
will continue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The followi ng morning, a PK blood sample will be 
collected and vital signs assessed .  If SpO2 is <80% for ≥20% of TST during the first night of 
treatment, the subject must be early terminated. Continuing subjects will be provided with study 
medication to be administered for 6 consecutive nights at home and will be instructed to take the 
medication immediately (within 5 minutes) before bedtime and then subjects may lea ve the clinic 
after the inv estigator determines that it is safe for them to do so. 
On Day 5 (with a window of ±2 days to accommodate a weekend), the site will telephone the subject 
to assess adverse events (AEs) and record concomitant medications.  If any AE is clinically 
significa nt and requires follow -up, an Unscheduled Visit should be arranged as soon as possible.
Subjects will return to the clinic after 6 consecutive nights of administering study drug at home, 
subjects will return to the clinic and receive 8th  dose of study dru g at the sleep laboratory within 
5min before the lights off  and will remain overnig ht in the sleep laboratory.  A predose (trough) PK

be collected for PK a nd exploratory biomar ker assessments .  Routine safety assessments will also 
conducted.  Subjects may leave the clinic after the investigator determines that it is safe for them to 
do so.
After Treatment Period 1, there will be a washout interval of at leas t 14 days.  After the washout 
interval, subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment Period 2, which will follow the same schedule 
and procedures as did Treatment Period 1 , including re -review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, and
oxygen desaturatio n.  Ho wever, spirometry will only be performed during the Screening Period
(revised per Amendment 01) .  Upon completion of Treatment Period 2, the subject will be discharged 
from the clinic and enter the Follow -up Period.
At specified visits throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Randomization Phase, all subjects 
will undergo routine safety assessments, including 12 -lead ECG, physical examination, vital signs, 
weight, hematology, blood clinical chemistry analysis, urinalysis, reporting of AEs, and as sessment 
of suicidality.  At each clinic visit, subjects will also undergo a urine drug screen.
Follow -up Period
During the Follow -up Period (approximately 28days), subjects will not receive any treatment.  At the 
end of the Follow -up Period, subjects will return to the clinic for an EOS visit at which safety will be 
assessed. 
If subjects discontinue prematurely, they will undergo an Early Termination (ET) Visit and w ill then 
be followed for 28days, after which an EOS visit should be scheduled.
Number of Subjects
OSA Cohort : A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized in order to ensure that a total of 
30evaluable subjects complete the study (20 evaluable adult subjects [ ≥45 and <65 years] and 
10evaluable elderly subjects [ ≥65 to 90 years]).  Discontinued subjects may be replaced to ensure 
20adults and 10 elderly subjects complete both Treatment Periods. However, subjects who 
discontinue for a serious adverse drug reaction (SADR) cannot be replaced.
COPD Cohort : A sufficient number of subjects will be randomized in order to ensure that a total of 
30evaluable subjects complete the study (20 evaluable adult subjects ( ≥45 and <65 years) and 
10evaluable elderly subjects [ ≥65 to 90 years]).  Discontinued subjects may be replaced to ensure 
20adults and 10 elderly subjec ts complete both Treatment Periods. However, subjects who 
discontinue for a SADR cannot be replaced.

Assessments
Screening Assessments
The Sleep Diary will be completed within an hour of morning waketime on each morning of the 
Screening Period until the screening PSG.  This Sleep Diary will yield information on the MHB that 
will be used to determine eligibility, and to determine bedtime (lights off) in the clinic.   
Spirometry will be performed for subjects evaluated for the COPD Cohort as per GOLD 
recommendations.  Spirometry assesses the integrated mechanical function of the lung, chest wall, 
and respiratory muscles by measuring the total volume of air exhaled from a full lung to maximal 
expiration.  Spirometry is the most reproducible and reliable measurement of airflow limitation, and 
is required to establish the diagnosis of COPD based on the measurement of FEV1 and FVC. 
Spirometry is also used to classify COPD severity (GOLD 2019).
Efficacy Assessments

Pharmacokinetic Assessments
A single blood sample for plasma concentrations of lemborexant will be taken at predefined visits 
(see Schedule of Procedures/Assessments).  The time and date of the 2 most recent doses 
administered before each sample will be documented.

PSG
Each PSG recording will include an electrode montage with electroencephalography (EEG), 
electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), and ECG channels.  In addition, the montage 
will include channels for recording respiratory variables including pulse oximetry.  In addition, the 
screening PSG will include channels for assessment of symptoms of periodic limb movement 
disor der.
Trained PSG scorers will score PSG records in 30 -second epochs according to standard criteria.  At 
Screening Visit 2, the PSG wil l be used to calculate AHI and PLMAI for evaluation of eligibility 
criteria.  Subsequent PSGs will be used to determine:
•AHI:  the number of apneas and hypopneas divided by the TST (in minutes) and multiplied 
by 60 (min/hour) (ie, the average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep), as 
defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (respiratory safety/PD assessment)
•SpO2 level
•Desaturation: Decrease in the mean SpO2 of ≥3% (over the last 120 seconds) that lasts for at 
least 10 seconds (revised per Amendment 01)

≥3% per hour of sleep), as defined by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (revised per 
Amendment 01)   
Transmissive pulse oximetry is a noninvasiv e method for monitoring peripheral oxygen saturation 
(SpO2).  A sensor device is placed on a thin part of the subject’s body; in the present study, this will 
be a fingertip.  The device passes 2 wavelengths of light through the body part to a photodetector .  
This measures the changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing determination of the 
absorbance caused by the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle ,
and fat.  The reading of oxygen saturation by pulse oximet ry is not necessarily identical to the reading 
of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) from (invasive) analysis of arterial blood gas, but the two are
sufficiently correlated that pulse oximetry is valuable for measuring oxygen saturation in a clinical 
settin g, including in clinical trials.
Biomarker Assessments
Blood Biomarkers
Blood samples will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessment for the exploratory 
analyses of biomarkers potentially related to dementia , COPD, and OSA .
Pharmacogenomic Assessments
Not applicable 
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs; regular laboratory evaluation for 
hematology, blood chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and 
the perfo rmance of physical examinations.
C-SSRS
Suicidality will be assessed using the C -SSRS.  The C -SSRS assesses an individual’s degree of 
suicidality, including suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior .  
Bioanalytical Methods
Plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) will be measured using 
validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay method.

Pharmacodynamic Analyses
The following analyses will be performed on the PD Analysis Set for each cohort .
Analysis for the Primary Endpoint
OSA Cohort : Mean AHI will be analyzed on the PD analysis set using repeated measures analysis of 
variance ( ANOVA ), for Day 8 of each treatment period.  The model will include fixed effects for age 
group, sequence, period, and treatment, and a random effect for subject within sequence.  The 
following will be presented: Least square ( LS)means, difference in LS mean of lemborexant 10 mg 
compared to placebo, a 2-sided 90% CI (equivalent to a 1-sided upper 95% CI) for the true mean 
differ ence (lemborexant − placebo) in AHI.  If the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of the 
treatment difference of AHI is less than 5, this will provide evidence that the given dose of 
lemb orexant does not result in a clinically significant increase in AHI with moderate to severe OSA 
compared with placebo.   Further details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (revised per 
Amendment 01) .

COPD Cohort : Mean SpO2 will be analyzed on the PD analysis set using repeated measures 
ANOVA, of values on Day 1 of each treatment for subjects in the PD analysis set.  The model will 
include fixed effects for age gr oup, sequence, period, and treatment, and a random effect for subject

10 mg compared to placebo, a 2-sided 90% CI (equivalent to a 1-sided lower 95% CI) for the true 
mean differ ence (lemborexant − placebo) in SpO2.  If the lower bound of the 1-sided 95% CI of the 
treatment difference of SpO2 is greater than -2 (for active –placebo), this will provide evidence that 
the given dose of lemborexant does not result in a clinically significant decrease in SpO2 compared to 
placebo.   Further details will be provided i n the statistical analysi s plan (revised per Amendment 01) .
Analysis for the Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same model as the primary endpoint.  
Analysis for the Exploratory Endpoints
Summaries and plots of all endpoints may be produced for appropriate subgroups (eg, age group, sex, 
BMI, race).  Subgroup analyses will also be performed as appropriate on primary and all secondary 
endpoints.

Interim Analyses
No interim analysis is planned.
Sample Size Rationale
OSA Cohort : A mean difference between treatments in AHI >5 is considered clinically meaningful
in studies of the respiratory safety of sleep agents in OSA ( Kryger , et al., 2007, Sun, et el., 2016).  
The within -subject variance is assumed to be 25.34 for AHI for adult subjects (Sun, et al., 2016) and 
30.41 for AHI for elderly subjects (where the elderly within -subject variance is estimated from adult 
data +20%, Mitterling, et al, 2015; Lee, et al, 2016).  Assuming the tr ue difference in AHI 
(lemborexant –placebo) on Day 8 is as high as 1.5, a total of 30 subjects completing the study 
(20adult, 10 elderly), provides 82% power that the upper bound of the 90% CI for the treatment 
differ ence in AHI (lemborexant − placebo) on Day 8 would be less than 5.

COPD Cohort :
A 2% decrease in mean SpO2 during TST is considered a clinically meaningful change.  For the 
primary hypothesis (mean SpO2 during TST on Day 8), assuming a true within subject variance of 
1.07% for mean SpO2, a total of 30 subjects completing the crossover study, and significance level 
alpha 0.05, there is 0.95 probabil ity that the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the 
true mean difference in mean SpO2 (LEM -placebo) on Day 8 would be greater than 2 percent points, 
if the true difference is 1 percent point.  The true difference could be as low as 1.23% and the study 
still would have had 80% power to support the hypothesis.

Lemborexant (LEM) (1R,2S) -2-{[(2,4 -dimethylpyrimidin-5- yl)oxy]methyl} -2-(3-
fluorophenyl) -N-(5-fluoropy ridin-2-yl)cyclopropanecarboxamide), also known as E2006, is 
an orally -administered, novel compet itive dual orexin r eceptor antagoni st (DORA) that has 
been developed for the treatment of inso mnia and Irregular Sleep -Wake Rhyt hm Disorder 
(ISWRD).  
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a commo n sleep di sorder, characterized by  intermittent 
cessat ion of airflow because of part ial or com plete occl usion of the upper ai rway during
sleep. Repetitive collapse of the airway leads to sleep fragmentation, hypoxemia,
hypercapnia, marked swings in intrathoracic pressure, and increased sympathet ic act ivity.  
Clinically, OSA is defined by excessive day time sleepiness, loud snoring, witnessed apneas,
or awakenings due to gasping or choking, in addit ion to at least 5 obstructive respiratory
events per hour ( Epstein, et al., 2009 ). The frequency of apneas and hypopneic episodes per
hour of s leep is reported as an apnea hypopnea index ( AHI); this evaluat ion requires 
overnight polyso mnography (PSG). The International Classification o f Sleep Disorders 
(ICSD) ( American Academy o fSleep Medicine, 2014 ) defines the severit y of OSA 
according to the AHI: an AHI >5 to <15 is classed as mild, AHI ≥15 to <30 as moderate, 
and AHI ≥30 as severe.
Parti cularly relevant to the lemborexant program in inso mnia disorder is that OSA commonly 
coexists wi th insomnia; as many as 50% of subjects referred to a sleep clinic for sl eep apnea 
have inso mnia symptoms ( Krakow, et al., 2001). Also highly  relevant to the l emborexant 
programs in inso mnia disorder is the fact that the prevalence o f both OSA and inso mnia 
increases wit h increasing age. Regarding inso mnia, epide miologic surveys reveal that more 
than 50% of adults over the age of 65 y ears have som e form of chroni c sleep -related 
complaints ( Foley, et al ., 1995 ), which often manifest as complaint s of difficult y in falling 
asleep, and night -time awakenings ( Ford and Kamerow, 1989 ).
It has l ong been known that sleep is disturbed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmo nary 
disease (COPD). Insomnia is a comorbid condit ion in about 17% of patients with COPD. 
There are general concerns about administering sedative -hypn otics to pati ents wi th 
compromised respiratory  function, since tradit ional sedat ive-hypnoti cs that bind to the 
benzodiazepine receptor at the gamma amino but yric acid (GABA) -A complex (eg , 
tri-azolam, flurazepam) have the potential to cause depression of c entral  respi ratory  drive and 
decreased muscle tone in the upper airways . Research suggests that there may be differences 
among benzodi azepine receptor agonists with regard to respiratory  safet y. Consequently, the 
respi ratory  safety  of any new sleep -prom oting agen t shoul d be carefully  evaluated ( Sun, 
etal., 2015 ).
Orexin receptor antagonism represents a new approach to the treatment of insomnia .  Orexin 
receptor antagonists may  prom ote sleep by  select ively blocking the brain’s orexin -mediated 
wake system  thereby enabling the transit ion to sleep. Orexin neurons originate in the lateral 
hypothal amus and proj ect throughout the brain, including to respiratory  centers in the brain 
stem.  This suggests that orexin may  have a rol e in regul ating respir ation (Sun, et al .,2015 ).

FINAL (V2.0) :  13 Jul2020Confidential Page 26of 757.1 Compound Overview
Lemborexant (LEM) is a novel competit ive dual orexin receptor antagonist that is approved
for the treatm ent of  insomnia by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )and 
Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) andunder development for irregular 
sleep -wake rhy thm disorder.  The clinical development program established the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, and efficacy  (both short -and long -term) of LEM versus placebo in adult and 
elderly  subjects, including demonstration of respiratory  safet y in healt hy volunteers and 
subjects wi th mild OSA (E2006 -A001 -102; Study 102).
7.2 Clinical Experience
Study  102 was a randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, crossover study to ev aluate 
the respi ratory  safet y of LEM in adult and elderly  (≥65 to 90 y ears) healt hy subjects and 
adult and el derly  subjects wi th mild OSA.  In healthy adult and elderly subjects and subjects 
with mild OSA, com pared wi th placebo, LEM di d not decrease peripheral oxygen saturati on 
(SpO2) during total sleep time (TST) after a single dose of treatment, increase the proportion 
of subjects wi th at least 1 incident of desaturation (defined as SpO2 <90% for at least 
30seconds during TST compared to placebo, increas e the percentage of TST during which 
SpO2 was <90%; or increased the AHI after a single dose of treatment.  Study  102 concl uded 
LEM was well tolerated in healt hy adult and elderly subjects, as well as subjects with mild 
OSA.  The approved prescribing infor mation for LEM (Dayvigo®) states that: “In a study of 
patients w ith mild OSA ( AHI <15 events per hour of sleep), DAYVIGO did not increase the 
frequency of apneic events or cause oxygen desaturation. ”
7.3 Study Rationale
Per the DAYVIGO approval letter (20 Dec 2019) Eisai was tasked with specific 
Postmarket ing Requirements (PMR), including a request to conduct a randomized, 
doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled study  to eval uate the short -term respi ratory  safet y of LEM 
in subjects wi th moderate to severe OSA and in subjects wi th moderate to severe COPD
(PMR 3753 -1).  The fo llowing study  is proposed to fulfill this PMR .

9INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
In both the OSA and COPD Cohorts, this will be a randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, 2 -period crossover study .  There will be 2 phases, Prerandomization and 
Randomization.  The Prerando mizat ion Phase will last up to 21 days and will consist of the 
Screen ing Peri od and Baseline Period.  In the Randomizat ion Phase subjects will be 
rando mized in treatment sequences A or B (OSA Cohort), or treatment sequences C or D 
(COPD Cohort) consist ing of 2 Treatment Periods, each of 8 days duration, separated by  a 
washo ut interval o f at least 14 day s, and a Fo llow-up Peri od of  approximately 28 days.  
Twent y-eight day s after the final study  dose, there will be an end of study  (EOS) Vi sit.
At specified visits throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Rando mization Phas e, all 
subjects will undergo routine safet y assessments, including 12 -lead ECG, physical 
examinat ion, vital signs, weight, hematology , blood clinical  chemistry  analysis, urinalysis, 
reporting of AEs, and assessment of suicidalit y.  At each clinic visit, su bjects will also 
undergo a urine drug screen.
Approximately  75 subjects each will be screened for OSA and COPD cohorts in order to 
ensure that a total of 30 evaluable subjects complete the study  in each cohort (20 evaluable 
adult subjects [ ≥45 and <65 y ears] and 10 evaluable elderly subjects [ ≥65 to 90 y ears]).  
Discontinued subjects m ay be replaced to ensure 20 adults and 10 elderly subjects complete 
both Treatm ent Peri ods.  However, subjects who discontinue for a serious adverse drug 
reacti on (SADR) canno t be repl aced.

The Screening Period will begin no more than 21 days before the subject is rando mized and 
during which informed consent will be obtained after the study  has been fully explained to 
the subject and before the conduct of any screening proced ures or assessments.  Subjects 
eligible for the COPD C ohort will then undergo screening spirometry between Visit 1 and 
Visit 2 (desi gnated Visi t 1A), which m ay be performed at the study  site, or offsi te, so l ong as 
a final report is available for review at the study  site by Visi t 2.  Spi rometry will be 
perform ed based on Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
recommendat ions(Appendix 2 ).  
After at l east 6 days of the init ial Screening visit, (to allow subjects the opportunity  to 
complete the sl eep diary  for at l east 5 ni ghts), subjects w ill return to the clinic for the second 
Screening Visit to undergo PSG.  For subjects being evaluated for the COPD Cohort, results 
of screening spirometry will also be reviewed.
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibilit y criteria will remain overnight i n the sleep 
laboratory .  The m ean habi tual bedtime (MHB) will  be calculated from  the m ost recent 
5days of the subject’s sleep diary .  This will be used to determine bedtime (“lights off”) .  
The PSG recording will begin at lights off and will continue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The 
end of the 8- hour PSG recording will be defined as waketime (“lights on”).  Subjects may 
leave the clinic after the invest igator determines that it is safe for them to do so.
The PSG will be reviewed for exclusion criteria r elated to OSA severit y (only mild for the 
OSA Cohort ,and moderate to severe for the COPD Cohort), periodic limb movement 
disorder, and parasomnias.  The pulse oximetry  recording will be reviewed for exclusio n 
criteria rel ated to oxy gen desaturati on.
Subje cts who conti nue to m eet the eligibilit y criteria will enter the Baseline Period.
9.1.1.2 Baseline Period
At the Baseline Period (1 day ) eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinic.  After 
completion of routine safet y assessments , including the Columbia -Suici de Severi ty Rating 
Scale (C-SSRS ), blood samples will be co llected for the exploratory  analyses related to 
potenti al dementia , COPD, and OSA -related bi omarkers .  Subj ect will  then enter the

1 of the 2 treatment sequences in a 1:1 ratio and enter Treatment Period 1.
Subjects will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory . Bedtime (lights off) will be at the 
MHB that was used at the second Screening Visit (Visit 2). Subjects will receive study drug 
immediately  (within 5 minutes) before lights off.  The PSG recording wil l begin at lights off 
and will cont inue for 8 hours (until lights on).  The fo llowing m orning, a PK blood sample 
will be co llected and vital signs assessed, as indicated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 4).  
Subjects will be provided with study  medicati on to be administered for 6 consecut ive nights 
at hom e, and will be instructed to take the medicat ion immediately (within 5 minutes) before
bedtime.  Subjects will also be instructed on study restrict ions related to prohibited 
medicat ions/drugs, caffeine and alcoho l, and the prohibit ions regarding the use of continuous 
positive airway  pressure (CPAP) device or dental appliance.  If SpO2 <80% for ≥20% of 
TST during the first night of treatment, the subject must be early terminated. Subjects may  
leave the clinic after the invest igator determines that it is safe for them to do so. Subjects will 
be instructed to prompt ly contact study  physician in case of any new co mplaints or 
exacerbation of current symptoms.
On Day  5 (wi th a window of ±2 days to accommo date a weekend), the site will telephone the 
subject to assess AEs and record concomitant medications. If any AE is clinically significant 
and req uires follow-up, an Unscheduled Visit should be arranged as soon as possible.
After 6 consecutive nights of administering study  drug at hom e, subjects will return to the 
clinic and receive 8th  dose of study  drug at the sl eep l aboratory  within 5 min before the 
lights off and will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory . Subjects will undergo the same 
procedures as on Day  1 (including urine pregnancy test for female subjects of childbearing 
potenti al and urine drug test), in addit ion to whi ch, a bl ood sample for pre -dose (trough) PK 
will be taken wit hin 1 hour before dosing. The fo llowing morning, blood sample swill be

will be instructed on study  restri ctions related to prohibited medications/drugs, alcoho l and 
caffeine, an d the prohibi tions regarding the use of CPAP device or dental appliance. Subjects 
may leave the clinic after the investigator determines that it is safe for them to do so.
After Treatment Period 1, there will be a washout interval o f at least 14 day s.  Aft er the 
washout interval, subjects will return to the clinic for Treatment Period 2, which will fo llow 
the sam e schedule and procedures as did inTreatment Period 1 , including re -review of 
inclusio n and exclusio n criteria, and oxygen desaturati on.  However, spirometry will only  be 
perform ed during the Screening Period (revised per Amendment 01) .
At specified visits throughout the Prerandomization Phase and the Rando mization Phase, all

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
Dose Selection
The approved dose of LEM 10 mg was chosen based on the safet y and efficacy studies from 
the clinical development program.
Justification of the Endpoints
The primary  analysis in the OSA Cohort compares the mean AHI (assessed by  PSG) on the 
final night of LEM dosing with the AHI on the final night of placebo dosing.  The AHI is the 
index by  which OSA is di agnosed, i s used to categori ze the severit y of disea se, and is the 
standard primary endpo int in clinical studies of the safet y of drugs in patients with OSA; for 
example, this was used for LEM Study  102, suvorexant ( Sun, et al., 2016 ), ramelteon 
(Kryger, et al ., 2007 ),and eszopiclone ( Rosenberg, et al., 2007 ).  Like the study  of 
suvorexant, Study  113 will  use the m ean AHI at the end of each treatment period as the 
primary  endpoint, as LEM will have reached steady  state.
The primary  analysis in the COPD Cohort compares mean SpO2 over total sleep time (TST) 
on the final night of LEM dosing with mean SpO2 during TST on the final night of placebo 
dosing.  Specifically , a 2% decrease in m ean SpO2 during TST is considered a clinically 
meaningful change.  SpO2 measures hypoxia, which can serve as a proxy  for hy pove ntilation 
during sleep ( Piper and Yee, 2014 ).  In the ramelteon study  of subjects wi th moderate to 
severe COPD ( Kryger, et al ., 2009 ), the mean SpO2 during TST at baseline was 92.6%, thus 
a 2% or greater decrease fro m 92% coul d resul t in hypoxia (SpO2 <90% ).  Of note, this was 
also used as the primary endpo int in the suvorexant study  (Sun, et al., 2015 ).
Justification of the sample size for the OSA cohort
In the suvorexant study , 26 subjects wi th mild to moderate OSA were studied; in Study  102, 
30subjects with mild OSA were evaluated.  This was acceptable to FDA and PMDA.  Thus, 
the proposed sample size for Study  113 OSA is 30 (Sun, et al., 2016 ).

Eisai
FINAL (V2.0):  13 Jul2020Confidential Page 33of 75Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for the OSA and COPD Cohorts
The eligibilit y criteria in Study  113 are l argely  standard for safety  studi es in subjects , with 
particular cri teria that are standard for studies of sleep agents (exclusio n of significant 
periodic limb mo vement di sorder or parasomnias; certain restrict ionson habitual bedt ime).  
Insomnia disorder is not specifically excluded unless subjects habitually sleep less than 
5.5hours.  The screening PSG will be key for inclusion, since subjects tend to sleep less well 
in a sleep l aboratory  than at hom e.  This is i mportant since the AHI tends to be higher during 
REM sl eep, which is m ore frequent during the second half of the night, the time when elderly  
poor sleepers tend to be awake.
Of note, CPAP and oral devices will be prohibited throughout the study .  The study requi res 
uncorrected values for AHI.  The pheno menon of “CPAP washout” has been reported, in 
which, fo llowing cessation of CPAP use, AHI increases gradually  over days or weeks 
(Vroegop, et al., 2015 ).  Al though the existence of this pheno menon is not univ ersally  
accepted, there is no doub t that day time sleepiness increases when CPAP is stopped, and 
those patients with OSA will acco mmo date to the increased levels of sleepiness, but that 
takes time, and the duration varies among pat ients.  To avoid dosing wi th LEM (which m ay 
cause so mnolence during the day  in some subjects) against an unstable baseline of dayt ime 
sleepiness, Study  113 requi res that CPAP not be used fro m 2 weeks before the screening 
PSG until the end of the second treatment period.  This shoul d not i nterfere wi th the m edical  
care of OSA patients, or be a significant impediment to recruit ment; many pat ients do not 
tolerate CPAP, such that non -compliance rates are high, as stated above.  Further, the 
exclusio n criterion specifies that there must not be a requirement that subjects use CPAP 
during the study , thereby  excluding any for whom CPAP is a medical necessit y.  Whether 
subjects had been prescribed CPAP or other treatments for OSA in the past will be noted at 
Screening.
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for the COPD Cohort
The COPD cohort will include subjects with moderate to severe COPD and an AHI <15 
based on PSG.  A diagnosis o f mild OSA is permissible, as OSA is a co mmo n co-morbidity 
in patients with COPD, and high -level evidence for the be nefit of mild OSA treatment is 
sparse ( Gay, et al ., 2006 ).  Subjects will also be required to have a SpO2 during wakefulness 
greater than 90% (both supine and sitt ing), and a SpO2 during sleep ≥80% for at l east 75% of 
the recording period with no more than five cont inuous minutes less than 80% and with no 
SpO2 readings less than 70%.  These criteria are similar to the ramelteon study  in subjects 
with moderate to severe COPD ( Kryger, et al., 2009 ).  Subj ects who use continuous oxy gen 
therapy  (>16 hours per d ay) or who, in the opinio n of the invest igator, the removal o f oxygen 
therapy  coul d affect the subject’s safet y or interfere wi th the study  assessments, are also 
excluded, which also aligns with prior respiratory  safet y studi es in COPD.
9.3 Selection of Study Population
Subjects who do not meet all o f the inclusion criteria or who meet any  of the exclusio n 
criteria will not be eligible to receive study  drug.

9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
All rando mized subjects will r eceive lemborexant 10 mg or placebo for 8 nights in each 
treatm ent peri od per the randomizat ion scheme for OSA and COPD cohorts.  The Treatment 
Periods will be separated by  a washout interval of at least 14 days.
Subjects will receive the 1st dose of study treatm ent at the sl eep laboratory  within 5 min 
before the lights off and will remain overnight in the sleep laboratory .  Subjects will be 
provi ded wi th the study  medicat ion to be administered for 6 consecut ive nights at home, and 
will be instructed to tak e the medication immediately (within 5 minutes) before bedtime.  
After 6 consecutive nights of administering the study  drug at hom e, subjects will return to the

FINAL (V2.0):  13 Jul2020Confidential Page 44of 75Trained PSG scorers will score PSG records in 30 -second epochs according to standard 
criteria.  At Screening Visit 2, the PSG wil l be used to calculate AHI and PLMAI for 
evaluat ion of eligibilit y criteria.  Subsequent PSGs will be used to determine:
•AHI:  the number of apneas and hypopneas divided by  the TST (i n minutes) and 
multiplied by 60 (min/hour) (ie, the average number of a pneas and hypopneas per 
hour of sleep), as defined by the American Academy o f Sleep Medicine (respiratory  
safet y/PD assessment)
•SpO2 l evel
•Desaturati on:  Decrease in the mean SpO2 of ≥3% (over the last 120 seconds) that 
lasts for at least 10 seconds (revised per Amendment 01)
•ODI: (oxygen desaturati ons ≥3% ×60)/TST (i e,the average number of oxygen 
desaturations ≥3% per hour of sleep), as defined by the American Academy of Sleep 
Medicine (revised per Amendment 01)
Transmissive pulse oximetry  is a noninva sive method for monitoring SpO2.  A sensor device 
is placed on a thin part of the subject’s body; in the present study , this will be a fingertip.  
The device passes 2 wavelengths of light through the body  part to a photodetector.  This 
measures the changin g absorbance at each of the wavelengths, allowing determinat ion of the 
absorbance caused by  the pulsing arteri al blood al one, excl uding venous blood, skin, bone, 
muscle ,and fat.  The reading of oxy gen saturati on by  pulse oximetry  is not necessarily  
ident ical to the reading o f arteri al oxygen saturati on (SaO2) from  (invasive) analysis o f 
arteri al blood gas, but the two are sufficient ly correlated that pulse oximetry  is valuable for 
measuring oxygen saturation in a clinical setting, including in clinical tri als.
Blood Biomarkers
Blood sam ples will be collected as indicated in the Schedule of Assessment (Table 4)for the 
exploratory  analyses of bio markers potenti ally related to dem entia, COPD, and OSA.

lemborexant . 
The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study  are:
•Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease tem porally  associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not co nsidered related to the invest igational product (Note:  Every  sign or 
symptom  shoul d not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE)
•Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an exist ing disease 
•Any deterioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory  value or 
other clinical test ( eg, ECG or x -ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, 
or discontinuati on of  study  drug
•Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) not presen t 
pretreatm ent (Baseline)
•An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified 
laboratory  abnorm ality leads to any  type of intervent ion, withdrawal  of study  drug, or 
withhol ding of study  drug, whether prescribed in the protocol o r not
All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the s tudy ICF through the l ast visit.  Subject who fail scre ening primarily due to 
AE(s) must have the AE(s) leading to screen failure reported on the Screening Disposit ion 
CRF.  Seri ous AEs will be collected for 28 days after the last dose.
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they ar e considered to be 
part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they  consti tute 
an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment shoul d be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormalit y 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
It is the responsibilit y of the invest igator to re view the results of C-SSRS in all subjects and 
determine if any  resul t consti tutes an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be 
exercised in deciding whether an iso lated suicidali ty rating scale response should be 
classified as an AE .  (see Section 9.5.1.4.7 for a descript ion of the C -SSRS).
All AEs must be fo llowed for 28days after the subject’s last dose, or until reso lution, 
whichever comes first.  All serious adverse events ( SAEs )must be fo llowed to resol ution or, 
if reso lution is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.

Eisai
FINAL (V2.0):  13 Jul2020Confidential Page 46of 75Assessing Severity of Adverse Events
AEs will be graded on a 3 -point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definit ions are as fo llows:
Mild Discomf ort noti ced, but no disruption of normal daily  activi ty
Moderate Discomf ort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily  activi ty
Severe Incapacitat ing, with inabilit y to work or to perform normal daily  activity
The cri teria for assessing severit y are different than those used for seriousness ( see
Secti on9.5.1.4.2 for the definit ion of an SAE).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
•Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
•The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ionof study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
•Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
•The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of 
the event
•The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following questi on:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.
No (not related) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibilit y.
9.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
A SAE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence that at any  dose:
•Results in death

event as i t occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form or was allowed to con tinue, might have caused death)
•Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
•Results in persiste nt or si gnificant di sabili ty/incapaci ty
•Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study  drug)
Other important medical events that may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error.  These events associated with special situat ions are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be c onsidered as SAEs only if they  meet one of 
the above cri teria.  All AEs associ ated with special si tuations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely , to stabilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” ( ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion:
•Hospitalizations for respite care 
•Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol
•Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed post study  drug administration)
•Hospitalization for administration of study  drug or insertion of ac cess for 
administration of study  drug
•Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device ( eg, battery  replacement) that was 
in place before study  entry

9.5.1.4.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
Vital sign m easurements (i e, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory  rate [per minute], body  temperature [in centigrade]), and weight (kg) 
will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4) by a 
validated m ethod.  Bl ood press ure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been 
sitting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the same arm, 
preferably by  the same person.
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrently wit h PK or other blood samples, the v ital 
sign measurem ents will be performed before drawing blood samples in order to maximize the

The invest igator may wit hdraw the subject from the study  at any  time for safet y or 
administrative reasons.  A subject may  elect to discontinue the study  at any  time for any  
reason.  All subjects who discont inue the study are to complete the study ’s early 
discontinuat ion procedures indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments ( Table 4).
The invest igator will pro mptly explain to the subject invo lved t hat the study will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary  
measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be fo llowed up by 
mail, phone, or other means to gather informat ion such as the reason for failure to return, the 
status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs 
and symptoms.
Subjects who discont inue early fro m the study  will be discontinued for 1of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to fo llow-up, subject cho ice, withdrawal o f consent, or other.  In 
addition to the primary  reason, the subject may indicate 1or more of  secondary  reasons for 
discontinuat ion.  Study  disposi tion informat ion will be collected on the Subject Di sposi tion 
CRF.
9.5.6 Abuse or Diversion of Study Drug
During the study , the invest igator will report any concern about abuse or diversio n of study  
drugs by  com pleting the Abuse or Diversio n of Study  Drug CRF.
Adverse events associated with abuse or diversio n will be appropriately reported as AEs and 
monitored per Section 9.5.1.4.1 .  Abuse is always to be captured as an AE.
9.5.7 Confirmation of Medical Care by Another Physician
The invest igator will instruct subjects to inform sit e personnel when they  are pl anning to 
receive medical care by another physician.  At each visit, the investigator will ask the subject 
whether he/she has received medical care by another physician since the last visit or is 
planning to do so in the future.  When the subject is going to receive medica l care by  another 
physician, the investigator, with the consent of the subject, will inform the other physician 
that the subject is part icipating in the clinical study.

OSA Cohort :
A mean difference between treatments in AHI >5 is considered clinically meaningful in 
studi es of  the respi ratory  safety  of sleep agents in OSA ( Kryger, et al ., 2007 , Sun, et al.,
2016 ).  The within- subject variance is assumed to be 25.34 for AHI for adult subjects ( Sun, 
et al., 2016 ) and 30.41 for AHI for elderly subjects (where the elderly wit hin-subject variance 
is est imated from adult data +20%, Mitterling, et al, 2015 ; Lee, et al, 2016 ).  Assuming the 
true difference in AHI (lemborexant –placebo) on Day 8 is as high as 1.5, a total of 
30subjects complet ing the study (20 adult, 10 el derly ), provi des 82% power that the upper 
bound of the 90% CI for the treatment difference in AH I (lemborexant − placebo) on Day  8 
woul d be l ess than 5.

variance of 1.07% for mean SpO2, a total of 30 subjects complet ing the crossover study, and

Eisai
FINAL (V2.0) :  13Jul2020Confidential Page 69of 7511PROCEDURES AND INSTR UCTIO NS (ADMINISTRATIVE 
PROCEDURES)
11.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically  
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory  authori ties as well  as addi tional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs.  These requirements should in no way  prevent any  immediate acti on 
from being taken by  the investi gator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving the 
safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the investi gator determines that an immediate 
change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for safet y reaso ns to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical and the IRB for the site must be 
notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the healt h or regulatory  authori ty as requi red 
per local regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study  may not requi re 
submissio n to health or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB, but the health or regulatory  authori ty 
and IRB should be kept informed of such changes as required by local regulat ions.  In these 
cases, the sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to the IRB and the Competent Authorities 
detailing such changes.
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol
The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
11.3 Monitoring P rocedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s.  Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring pla n.  The investigator will 
allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory , and pharm acy facilities to assure 
compliance wi th GCP and l ocal regulatory  requi rements.  The CRFs and subject’s 
corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to b e fully available for 
review by  the sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence 
to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in accordance with local regulat ions.  All records at the 
site are subject to inspection by  the l ocal au diting agency and IRB review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to 
the following:
•Clinic, office, or hospital charts

•Correspondence regarding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or 
memoranda sent to the IRBs
•CRF co mponents ( eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by  subjects and 
serve as their own source
11.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as source document.  Any correction to entries made 
on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the 
individual making the correct is ident ified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
11.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  
The data collected by  electroni cPatient-Reported Outcome are also considered as source 
data.  
11.6 Retention of Records
The ci rcumstances of com pletion or ter minat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator is responsible for retaining all study  docum ents, including but not limited to the

docum ents ( eg, Form FDA 157 2for US si tes).  In addi tion, the sponsor will send a list of 
treatm ent codes by  study  subject to the invest igator after the clinical database for this study 
has been locked.  The site should plan to retain study  docum ents, as di rected by  the sponsor, 
forat least15 years fo llowing the com pletion of the study .
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the invest igator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of  perm anently retaining the study  records.
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to the routine monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent conducts audi ts of clinical research activit ies in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regul ations.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study  or 
after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
11.8 Hand ling of Study Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a designated pharmacist) by  
the sponsor.  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area ( eg, locked cabinet) 
and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug l abels.  The invest igator (or a 
designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which m ust be given to the sponsor 
at the end of the study .  An ac curate record of the date and amount of study  drug di spensed to 
each subject must be available for inspect ion at any t ime.  The CRA will visit the site and 
review these documents along with all other study  conduct docum ents at appropri ate 
intervals once st udy drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to d o so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form 
to the s ponsor’s CRA (or desi gnated contractor) or, when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.
11.9 Publication of Results
All manuscripts, abstracts, or other modes of presentation arising fro m the resul ts of the 
study  must be reviewed and approved in writ ing by the sponsor in advance of submissio n 
pursuant to the terms and condit ions set forth in the executed Clinical Trial Agreement 
between the sponsor/CRO and the inst itution/investi gator.  The review is aimed at protecti ng

FINAL (V2.0) :  13Jul2020Confidential Page 76of 75Appendix 2 GOLD Recommendations for Performing Spirometry
Preparati on
•Spirometers need calibrat ion on a regular basis
•Spirometers shoul d produce hard copy  or have a digi tal display  of the expiratory  curve 
to permit detection of technical errors or have an automat ic prompt to ident ify an 
unsatisfactory  test and the reason for it
•The supervisor of the test nee ds training in optimal technique and qualit y performance
•Maximal pat ient effort in performing the test is required to avoid underestimat ion of 
values and hence errors in diagnosis and management 
Bronchodilat ion
•Possible dosage protocols are 400 mcg short acting beta agonist, 160 mcg short acting 
anticholinergic, or the two combined.  Forced Expiratory Vo lume in 1 Second (FEV 1) 
shoul d be measured 10 to 15 minutes after short acting β2 agonist is given, or 30 to 
45minutes after a short acting ant icholinergi c or a combinat ion of both classes of 
drugs
Perform ance
•Spirometry shoul d be perform ed using techniques that meet published standard
•The expiratory  volume/time traces should be smooth and free from irregularit ies.  The 
pause between inspirat ion and expirat ion shoul d be <1 second
•The recording should go on long enough for a volume of plateau to be reached, which 
may take more than 15 seconds in severe disease
•Both forced vital capacit y (FVC) and FEV1 shoul d be the l argest value obtained fro m 
any of 3 technic ally satisfactory  curve and the FVC and FEV1 values in these 3 curves 
shoul d vary  by no m ore than 5% or 150 m L, whichever is greater
•The FEV 1and FVC ratio should be taken fro m technically acceptable curve with the 
largest sum of FVC and FEV 1
Evaluat ion
•Spirometry measurements are evaluated by  comparison of the resul ts wi th appropri ate 
reference values based on age, height, sex ,and race
•The presence of postbronchodilator FEV 1/FVC<0.70 confirms the presence of airflow 
limitation

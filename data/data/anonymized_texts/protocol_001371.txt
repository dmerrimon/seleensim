Brief Title: Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy  of AGN -242428 and 
AGN
-231868 in Participants with Dry  Eye Disease
Study Phase: 1/2a 
Study Rationale :
This is the first- in-human study  to evaluate the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics (PK), and 
exploratory  efficacy  of AGN -242428 and AGN -231868 administered through topical ocular 
instillation. Data collected from animal studies suggest that both inter ventions have a good safet y 
profile and the potential to reduce the signs and s ymptoms of dry eye disease ( DED )
. Data from 
this study  will guide the future development 
of either or both of these compounds for the 
treatment of DED.

5(± 1) minutes after thein-office ey e drop administration. Participants will be instructed to mark 
a vertical line on the anchored VAS that best captures their experience with the study eye drops. 
This is an overall evaluation, not per ey e. The questionnaire will include the following questions:
How comfortable are the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How soothing are the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How moistening/lubricating are the stud y eye drops in y oureyes?
How clear is y our vision with the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How much stickiness do y ou have with the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How much blur do you have with the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How much burning/stinging do y ou have with the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
How much discomfort do y ou have with the study  eye drops in y our ey es?
Each question will be accompanied by  the VAS scale. The assessment line length of the scale 
will be 100 mm and will be similar to the following depiction ( Figure 8-1).

following the sponsor ’s standard operating procedures. Extreme care and diligence will be taken 
to ensure no other individuals outside the bioanaly tical team will be unmasked. Only  blood 
samples collected from participants who received AGN- 242428 or AGN -231868 are to be
analyzed.
The exact postdose sample collection time in Stage 2 may  be adjusted based on PK data ( Tmax) 
from Stage 1. The sponsor’ s clinical pharmacology  representative will remain masked for the 
analysis of Stage 1 data to provide the recommendation for b lood sampling timepoint selection 
for Stage 2. The selected timepoints will remain the same for all intervention groups to retain 
masking. Any changes in the timing or addition of timepoints for any  planned study  assessments 
will ensure masking in Stage 2 and must be documented and approved by  the relevant study  team 
member and then archived in t he sponsor and site study  files but will not constitute a protocol 
amendment. 
8.4.2. Pharmacokinetic Blood Sampling Procedure
Required blood collection tubes, processing instructions, and storage instructions will be

979. Statistical Considerations
There will be an interim database lock at the end of Stage 1 and a final database lock after 
completion of Stage 2. Separate statistical anal ysis plans (SAPs) for each stage will be developed 
and finalized before the interim database lock for Stage 1 and before the final database lock for 
Stage 2 and will describe the participant populations to be included in the analy ses, and 
procedures for accounting for missing, unused, and spurious data. This section is a summary  of 
the planned statistical analy ses for this study . 
Separate PK anal ysis plans will be developed for each stage and finalized before the interim 
database lock for Stage 1 and before the final database lock for Stage 2. 
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses
No hy pothes is testing will be performed. 
9.2. Sample Size Determination
For Stages 1 and 2, t he sample size is not based on statistical considerations and is determined 
empirically .

111In addition, a potential Hy ’s Law case is also an AESI . Criteria for potential Hy ’s Law cases 
are as follows:
ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN AND
TBL ≥ 2 × ULN AND
Alkaline phosphatase < 2 × ULN
Study  site personnel must report every  participant who me ets these potential criteria. 
Typically , all 3 anal ytes will be obtained from the same sample, but they  may  come from 
multiple samples taken within a 24-hour period. This requirement applies from the time the 
participant signs the ICF for the stud y until the Exit visit or Early  Termination visit .
A laboratory  alert for potential Hy ’s Law cases will be in place and must notify  investigators 
and the sponsor immediately  when the above criteria have been met. A potential Hy ’s Law 
case must be reported as a SAE by completing an Adverse Event of Interest Abnormal L iver 
Function Reporting Form and sent to I R-Clinical -SAE@allergan.com (or faxed to the SAE fax 
number) as soon as possible (within 24 hours of learning of the potential Hy ’s Law case). The 
eCRF for potential Hy ’s Law cases must be completed within 7 calendar day s. Every  effort to 
determine the cause of the liver enzyme abnormalities must be made, and close monitoring 
should be initiated in conjunction with the MSP and in accordance with the FDA Guidance f or 
Industry, Drug -Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation, July 2009 .

114d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity
The term disability  means a su bstantial disruption of a person ’s ability  to conduct normal 
life functions.
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), which may interfere with or prevent every day life 
functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
f.Other situations:
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
participant or may  require medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually  be considered 
serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive intervention in 
an emergency  room or at home for al lergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.

used, and thus subject or patient is used instead of participant (as used elsewhere in this 
protocol ).These terms are interchangeable .  
CDISC Submission V alue CDISC Definition
Adverse event Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and

125Nonvasectomized m ale participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to 
remain abst inent from penile -vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of 
penile penetration for the duration of the study .
Female Participants
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they  agree to use a 
highl y effective method of contraception consistently  and correctly  as described in Table 10-2.
Table 10-2 Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependenta
Failure rate of < 1% per year when used consistently and correctly
Com bined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
Oral 
Intravaginal 
Transdermal 
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation
Oral 
Injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independenta
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated w ith inhibition of ovulation
IUD
IUS
Etonogestrel implant (ie, Nexplanon®)
Bilateral tubal occlusion (eg,Essure®, bilateral tubal ligation)
Intrauterine copper contraceptive (ie, ParaGard®)
Vasectom ized Partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male 
sexual partner of the WOCBP and the ab sence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective 
method of contraception should be used.
Sexual Abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant.
aTypical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent 
with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical studies.

5 1. OBJECTIVES 
 
 1.1 
Study Design 
 
The study is a randomized trial of the Jacki® recovery jacket garment versus usual care for post-discharge pain management in pati ents who had mastectomy and reconstructive 
surgery in one or both breasts.  
 1.2 
Primary Objectives 
 
1. Compare pain intensity on a 0-10 numeri c scale at the post-surgical follow-up 
clinic when all surgical drains are rem oved between usual care pain management 
(UC) and “Jacki” plus us ual care (Jacki) groups. 
 1.3 
Secondary Objectives 
 
1. Explore differences in health related quality of life (HRQOL) and breast 
symptoms between groups at the follow-up clinic. 
2. Evaluate at-home (from discharge to follow-up) pain patterns and pain 
management by group. 
3. Evaluate patient-reported Jacki usage frequencies in the intervention group. 
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Study Disease(s) and Health Setting 
 
Patients have mastectomy either in treatment for breast cancer or as prophylaxis, and may 
have reconstructive surgery at the same  time. In 2016, it is estimated that 246,660 new 
cases of invasive breast cancer  will be diagnosed in women in the U.S. along with 60,290 
cases of in situ breast cancer.1 Treatment options for early-stage breast cancer are 
generally breast conserving surgery with adj uvant radiation or mastectomy. An analysis 
of the National Cancer Da tabase published in 20152 found that national rates of 
mastectomy for early-stage breas t cancer rose from 34.3% in 1998, the first year in the 
study, to 37.8% in 2011, the last year, with much of the increase in th e last eight years. 
Rates of reconstructive surgery in patients  having mastectomy rose from 11.6% in 1998 
to 36.4% in 2011. During the same period, the rate of patients with unilateral breast 
cancer who elected contralate ral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) rose from 1.9% to 
11.2%,2 a trend that will likely continue3 despite lack of eviden ce favoring CPM outside a 
high risk setting.4 Rates of bilateral prophylactic ma stectomy (BPM) for those with no 
cancer diagnosis but genetic and/or family risk  are more difficult to estimate due to lack 
of cancer diagnosis and registry, but studies have estimated th ese surgeries may be in the 
hundreds to thousands per year in the U.S.5,6and expected to increase with increased 
awareness of genetic breast cancer a nd increased uptake of genetic testing.6

2.4 Rationale 
 
Patients who have mastectomy and reconstructive surgery often experience discomfort from not only the surgical incisions, but also from the drainage tubes inserted at the incision sites. 
The tubes and drainage receptacles are often diffi cult to manage when patients are discharged 
from the hospital, wearing typical clothing and returning to regul ar daily activities.  
 
Most women are able, at the time of mastectom y, to have breast reconstruction surgery to 
rebuild and contour breast sh ape. Post-operative care is more complex than mastectomy 
alone and requires an inpatient stay of two to four nights. The accumulation of fluid – a 
seroma  – is a frequent complicat ion following breast surgery a nd warrants the insertion of 
drainage tubes for prevention. In a review investigating techniques in the prevention and 
management of seromas after breast surger y, drains produced a significant reduction in 
seroma incidence.
7  The number of drains depends on th e type of surgery and preference of 
the surgeon and ranges from 2 for unilate ral and from 4 for bilateral mastectomy.8,9 Patients 
after mastectomy and breast reconstruction experience soreness in the chest, underarm and 
shoulder, as well as numbness at  the drainage site. Patients have reported the greatest 
discomfort at the drain inserti on sites. The number of drains after mastectomy has also been 
associated with increased pain in the post mastectomy patient, although the number of drains 
was not associated with the rate or number of seromas.8,10 If axillary lymph nodes are 
removed, patients may experience some numbne ss in the arm and also are at risk for 
lymphedema ,11 a build-up of lymph that causes swelli ng in the arm, hand, breast, underarm, 
chest, trunk and/or back.  Post-operative pain experienced by women undergoing mastectomy and breast reconstruction can contribute to limited range of motion in the upper body, resulting in worsening stiffness and edema that have a negative impact on qualit y of life (QOL) and activities of daily living 
(ADL). It is vital that early upper body exer cise and movement is performed to prevent 
lymphedema or swelling.
12 Increased activity can reduce the side effects of surgery, shorten 
recovery time, and ultimately improve long-term outcomes.13,14 This was demonstrated in a 
study of 35 post-operative mastectomy patients random ized to participate in an early physical 
rehabilitation program: participants in the pr ogram reported significant improvement in pain 
reduction and QOL.15 Consequently, studies have demons trated that inadequately managed 
pain in the acute post-operative period is one of the greatest  predictors of chronic pain 
syndromes in breast surgery patients.16-21

Traditional clothing options for women post mastectomy are undergarments such as post mastectomy camisoles, tank tops, and customi zed mastectomy bras. Camisoles are usually 
worn as nightwear or under loose fitting clothing until surgical drains are removed. The Jacki is a post mastectomy garment that was develo ped by a breast cancer survivor as a means to 
manage and hold the drainage system. The jacket is professionally manufactured, made with high quality material (cotton and Polartec® microfleece), and is suitable for business casual attire. Anecdotally-reported patie nt experiences suggest that use of the Jacki immediately 
after surgery is an early intervention that ma y reduce pain and prevent activity limitations 
over time.
22,23  The Jacki is unique as outer apparel that can be worn in the workplace, at 
social events, and during usual activity, and that allows full range of motion. The Jacki 
allows the patient to discreetly place drainage tubes in hidden and secure inside pockets that reduce the possibility of dislodgement and pul ling. Velcro sleeves allow for easy access 
when patients return for follow-up appointments that require taking blood pressure, IV 
access, injections and medical exams. In particular, women have described
24 how the Jacki 
has put them at ease when in public venues that otherwise would have created feelings of vulnerability and self-consciousness because of  body changes and functional limitations from 
surgery.  
 2.5 
Preliminary Data 
 
A preliminary survey study was conducted to expl ore self-reported pain intensity levels (just 
before discharge to ambulatory care) in pa tients post mastectomy in the Boston area. The 
sample (n=88) had a nearly equal distribution of age above and below 50 years; most were 
college educated and married/partnered. Of th e 88 participants, 39% reported moderate to 
severe pain intensity, 53% reported pain se veral times a week to constantly, and 34% 
reported pain intensity as fair to almost unbearable soon after surgery. Sixty percent of 
participants had received a bilateral mastect omy, and 43% of these had bilateral implant 
reconstruction. Mean scores on the 0-10 pain intensity scale were 5.26 (SD=2.28) for those 
who had bilateral mastectomy and 2.5 (SD= 2.13) for those having single mastectomy; 
participants who had reconstr uction at the time of surgery pain averaged 4.98 (SD=2.18).

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities 
 
The sample will be entirely women (although men ar e at risk for, or diagnosed with, breast 
cancer, they do not have reconstructive surg ery post mastectomy). English-speaking women 
of all races and ethnic groups are eligible and will be recruited for this trial. 
 
  4. 
REGISTRATION PROCEDURES 
  4.1 
General Guidelines for DF/HCC Institutions 
 
Institutions will register eligible participants  in the Clinical Trials Management System 
(CTMS) OnCore. Registrations must occur prior to the initiation of protocol therapy (i.e., 
discharge from the hospital). Any participant not registered to  the protocol within this 
timeframe will be considered ineligible and registration will be denied.  A member of the study team will complete th e protocol-specific eligibility checklist. 
  
4.2 
Registration Process for DF/HCC Institutions 
 
DF/HCC Standard Operating Procedure for Human Subject Research Titled Subject 
Protocol Registration (SOP #: REGIST-101A for Centra lized Registration) must be 
followed. Research staff at enrolling instit utions will fax the signed informed consent 
form and eligibility checklist to the protoc ol registrar at the Office of Data Quality 
(ODQ) at 617-632-2295, who will confirm e ligibility and complete centralized 
registration of the participant in OnCore.

 5.1 
Treatment Regimen 
 5.1.1 
Enrolling Sites and Study Entry 
 A sample of 130 women who have had or will have mastectomy with reconstruction will be 
recruited.   Screening will be conducted by a research team member using the clinical surgery and post-op 
schedule to identify eligible patients. A clinical ca re nurse or clinical rese arch associate who is a 
member of the research study team  will invite the participant to hear about the study, and if the 
patient agrees to participate, will consent th e participant. The research team member will 
complete the eligibility checklist.  The research team member will fax the consent form and eligibility checklist to the Office of Data Quality to register the participant and wi ll receive the participant’s randomized study group 
assignment. Participants will be randomly assigned  in blocks of random permuted size, stratified 
by site and unilateral vs bilateral mastectomy, to the usual care pain management (UC) or “Jacki” plus usual care (Jacki) groups.   The research team member will meet the participant in the hospital on the first day post-surgery (or second day, if the patient is too sick, has a su rgical complication, or is  in too much pain or 
distress to be approached the first day) to colle ct the baseline (T1) questionnaire and will provide 
the post-discharge daily diary quest ionnaires (T2) to the participant, answer questions, and make 
arrangements for collection of th e follow-up questionnaire (T3) with the participant at the clinic 
visit when all the post-surgical drains are rem oved. The research team member will telephone or 
email the participant at home the first or second day after discharge to re mind her to fill out the 
T2 daily questionnaire; if the participant has multiple follow-up visits before all drains are 
removed, the research team member may also te lephone, email or meet the participant at follow-
up visits to remind her to continue filling out  the T2 daily questionnaire until all drains are 
removed.  5.1.2 
Treatment Regimen 
 A clinical care nurse will provide  instruction to participants allo cated to the Jacki arm on safe 
and appropriate use of the Jacki (for example, how to put on the jacket and tuck drainage tubes 
into jacket pockets, and the need to remove drainage tubes from jacket pockets prior to removing 
the jacket). Participants in th e Jacki arm will be encouraged to  use the jacket at home between 
discharge and their follow-up c linic appointment; no minimum amount of use is required.  
 Participants in both groups will receive all usua l pain management including prescription of pain 
medications and instructions on pain manage ment post-discharge as standard of care. 
 
NCI Protocol #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-403  
Protocol Version Date: 11/13/2017 
 
10 The treatment period for participants in both ar ms is from discharge from the hospital post 
mastectomy until the follow-up clinic appointment at which all drains are removed, usually in 7-
14 days, sometimes as long as 28 or (rarely) 42 days. 
 
5.1.3 Instruments Measuring Study Outcomes 
 
Participants will complete study questionnaires  self-reporting pain, pain management, breast 
symptoms and health related qua lity of life at three time points (see section 10, Study Calendar). 
Questionnaires will be answered using pen and pa per in the hospital on th e first (or second) day 
post-surgery (T1), at home (T2), or in follow-up clinic after all drains  are removed (T3). If 
participants cannot answer the T3 questionnaire in clinic, a research coordinator will contact the participant to administer the questionnaire within 24 hours of the follow-up appointment via 
telephone interview or secure fi le exchange (using the Partners Biscom Delivery Server). 
Instruments are the following:  Demographic questionnaire (T1) The questionnaire includes age, language spoke n at home, ethnicity, race, marital status, 
education, and occupational status.   Pain Intensity Numeric Scale (PINS) (T1, T2, T3) The PINS measures pain intensity with a single item, on a 0-10 scale and is in common clinical 
use.   Pain Frequency and Pain Intensity Dist ress (Symptom Distress Scale) (T1, T3) 
Two items from the Symptom Distress Scale
25,26 measure pain frequency and pain intensity in 
the past week, on a 5-point scale.  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Inform ation System (PROMIS®) Pain Intensity (T1, 
T3) 
This 3-item instrument from the PROMIS item bank
27 measures pain intensity over the past 
week and right now, on a 5-point scale (PROMIS Item Bank v.1.0 – Pain Intensity – Short Form 
3a).  Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Inform ation System (PROMIS®) Pain Interference 
(T3) This 8-item instrument from the PROMIS item bank
27 measures the interference of pain with 
daily activities and social relations, on a 5-point scale (PROMIS Item Bank v.1.0 – Pain 
Interference – Short Form 8a).  Pain Management (T2) Participants will keep a daily pain diary be tween hospital discharge and follow-up clinic 
appointment (the T2 period) to document pain intensity, use of pain medications, and whether 
and how long they wear post mastectomy garments each day.  EORTC QLC-C30 (T3) 
NCI Protocol #: N/A 
DF/HCC Protocol #: 16-403  
Protocol Version Date: 11/13/2017 
 
11 The EORTC QLQ- C3028 is a 30-item questionnaire with 5 functional subscales, global health 
status quality of life subscale, and 9 symptom subscales/items. The time it takes to complete the 
questionnaire is approximately 11 minutes. The C30 has been used  in over 3000 clinical trials 
and in 81 languages.29 Authors of a recent meta-analysis30 of the C30 performance concluded 
that all subscales perform reliably except cognitiv e function, a 2-item subscale assessing memory 
and concentration. Raw scores for the QLQ-C30 ra nge from 0 to 100 and can be transformed and 
compared to reference values publis hed in the EORTC QLQ-C30 manual.  
 
EORTC QLQ-BR23 (T3) The QLQ-BR23 supplementary Breast Cancer Modul e is comprised of 23 questions in five 
multi-item scales to assess side effects of surg ery, arm and breast symptoms, body image, sexual 
functioning and future perspective. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient results for QLQ-BR23 have 
been reported at 0.873.
29 
 Medical Record Review (T1 and T3) A member of the study team will record clinical data, such as  cancer diagnosis (if any) and 
surgery details at T1 prior to the participant’ s hospital discharge, a nd documentation from the 
medical record of pain and pain management post- discharge  within 1 week after the T3 visit.

ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
7.1 Adverse Events 
 
7.1.1.1 Adverse Event List for the Jacki Recovery Jacket 
 The Jacki has not previously been studied, and no adverse events or serious adverse 
events have been reported to A Little Easi er Recovery® or at th e enrolling study sites, 
which have previously provided jacket s to some post-operative patients.  
 Potential adverse events include the following:  1.) A participant wearing the jacket may rem ove the jacket without first removing the 
drains from the pockets. This may cause pa in and/or the drains to be dislodged, 
which would require a trip to the hospital to have them re-inserted. It could also 
lead to a greater risk of infec tion at the site of the drains. 
2.) A participant wearing the jacket may beco me too warm in warm weather or may 
develop a skin reaction to the jacket, which is made of 50% cotton and 50% 
polyester.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
  13.1 
Study Design/Endpoints 
 
The study is a randomized trial of the Jacki recover jacket versus usual care for post-
discharge pain management in patients w ho received mastectomy with reconstructive 
surgery in one or both breasts. All particip ants will complete questionnaires measuring 
pain, pain management, breast symptoms, and health-related quali ty of life (Appendix 
A). Questionnaires will be completed at thr ee time points: pre-discharge (T1), at home 
over approximately 7-14 (up to 42) days (T2), and at follow-up clinic when all drains are removed (T3). Participants will receive usual pain management or the Jacki plus usual pain management post-discharge. Clinical data will be collected by a member of the 
research study team using a clinical data form.  
  13.2 
Sample Size, Accrual Ra te and Study Duration 
 
The primary objective of this study will be to  compare pain intensity (measured on the 0-
10 scale, PINS) at the follow-up clinic appoi ntment when all drains are removed (T3) 
between those randomized to UC or Jacki groups. A reduction of 1.0 on the PINS is 
thought to be clinically significant. With a sample size of 130 th ere is 80% power to 
detect a 1-point difference in PINS betw een UC and Jacki groups using a Wilcoxon rank 
sum test at the 2-sided 0.1 significance leve l assuming a standard deviation of 2.2 from

16 the preliminary study. The following table depi cts the impact on power if the standard 
deviation at the follow-up visits is  smaller or larger than estimated. 
 
Standard Deviatio n Powe r
1.8 91%
2.0 86%
2.2 80%
2.4 74%
2.6 68%
 
 With a projected 13% rate of attrition, a to tal of 149 participants enrolled will yield an 
analytic sample of 130 evaluable participan ts. This number of participants will be 
accrued and will complete data collection with in 10 months, based on clinical volume . 
 
 
Accrual Targets 
Ethnic Category  Sex/Gender
Females Males  Total
Hispanic or Latino 39 + 0 = 39 
Not Hispanic or Latino 91 + 0 = 91 
Ethnic Category: Total of all subjects 130 + 0 =  130
Racial Category  
American Indian or Alaskan Native 0 + 0 = 0 
Asian 6 + 0 = 6 
Black or African American 13 + 0 = 13 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islande r 0 + 0 = 0 
White 111 + 0 = 111 
Racial Category: Total of all subjects 130 + 0 =  130
  
No interim analyses are planned due to the short duration, minimal ri sk, and minimal burden 
of the study. There are no  early stopping rules. 
  13.3 
Stratification Factors 
 
Randomization will be stratified by enrolling hospital and unilateral vs bilateral mastectomy following a permuted block ra ndomization supplied by the statistician.

17 13.4 Interim Monitoring Plan 
 
Data and safety monitoring is described in section 12.  
 
13.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
 
All randomized patients will be included in all analyses. Minimal missing data is 
expected; therefore, in the event of missing data, no imputation will be performed. The analyzable sample for the primary endpoint includes participants who are randomized 
and have reported a pain score at T3 regard less of intervention use. The primary endpoint 
is pain intensity measured on the 0-10 scale at the follow-up clinic appointment (T3). The 
pain score will be summarized at each time point and plotted. The T3 pain score will be compared between UC and Jacki groups using a Wilcoxon rank sum test. Due to the nature of the pain measure (i.e., integers on a 0- 10 scale), there will be ties in pain score, 
and the number of ties could affect the pe rformance of the non-parametric test. 
Depending on the structure of the data, a t- test may be considered with a possible 
transformation. Assumptions will be  examined and a method selected prior to testing.     
 Additionally an analysis  of covariance (ANC OVA) approach may be considered. Factors 
that may be associated with the T3 pain sc ore (baseline score, time since discharge, 
unilateral vs bilateral mastectomy, number  of post-surgical drains, neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, axillary lymph node dissection, pain management at home with pain 
medication, and post mastectomy clothing) wi ll be assessed univariately and then 
adjusted in a multivariable model. The change  in pain over time will also be evaluated 
using linear mixed models.     
  
13.6 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
 
Other secondary endpoints include other pain measures, breast cancer symptoms, and 
HRQOL which will be measured  as described in sections 5 and 10. Scoring and handling 
of missing data will follow the user manual for the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23. Analyses conducted at the final time point will  be consistent with the analyses described 
in section 13.5. The change from discharge (T1)  to follow-up (T3) will also be evaluated 
for all secondary measures that are measured at both timepoints.

Efficacy will be established if a statistically significant difference of 1.0 or greater on the 
PINS is detected. 
  
14. 
PUBLICATION PLAN 
 
The results should be made public within 24 months of reaching the end of the study. The 
end of the study is the time point at which the la st data items are to be reported, or after the 
outcome data are sufficiently mature for analysis, as defined in the section on Sample Size, Accrual Rate and Study Duration. If a report is planned to be published in a peer-reviewed 
journal, then that initial release may be an abstract that meets the requirements of the International Committee of Medical  Journal Editors. A full report of the outcomes should be 
made public no later than three (3) years after the e nd of the study.

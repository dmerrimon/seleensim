 1.0 STUDY SYNOPSIS 
Name of Sponsor:  Nektar Therapeutics 
Name of Finished Product: NKTR-102 for Injection 
Name of Active Ingredient: NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
Title of Study: An Open-label, Multicenter, Extension Study of NKTR-102 in Subjects 
Previously Enrolled in NKTR-102 Studies 
Study Period: The estimated study duration is approximately 5 years.  The duration of treatment in this study is estimated to be approximately 2 years.  Subjects may 
continue to receive repeated cycles of study drug treatment until progression of 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal by subject, Investigator 
decision, lost to follow-up, or study is terminated by the Sponsor. 
Phase of Development: Phase 2 
Indication: Solid tumors  
Objectives: Primary Objective: 
• To provide access to NKTR-102 to  subjects who previously received 
NKTR-102 in a clinical trial and are without signs of disease progression 
since receiving NKTR-102.   
Secondary Objectives: 
• To evaluate the safety of continued exposure to NKTR-102. 
• To observe disease status and surv ival status in subjects receiving 
NKTR-102. 
• To evaluate the efficacy of NKTR-1 02 in subjects with advanced or 
metastatic solid tumors.   
Endpoints: • Incidence and duration of toxicities, with severity grading according to 
National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0.   
• Tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) version 1.1  
Number of Study Sites: Up to 100 study sites may participate in this study.   
Countries: Multi-national 
Number of Subjects (planned):  Up to 150 subjects may be enrolled in this study. 
Study Design: This is a multicenter, open-label, Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in subjects with 
solid tumors who received NKTR-102 in  a prior Nektar-sponsored clinical 
study.  Following completion of NKTR-102 treatment on a prior NKTR-102 clinical study, subjects will be assessed for eligibility.  The Sponsor must assess 
eligibility criteria prior to enrollment of all subjects.   
Eligible subjects will continue treatment with NKTR-102 at a dose of 
145 mg/m
2 or less in a q21d schedule.  Subjects who previously received a dose 
of NKTR-102 at <145 mg/m2 will continue at the lower dose in this study.  
Subjects who underwent dose reduction of NKTR-102 due to observed toxicity prior to participation in the Extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09) will not be

 re-escalated to the previous dose level upon resolution of the toxicity.  Dose 
escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted. 
Disease assessments for tumor response and progression will be performed as 
per local standard of care until diseas e progression.  Minimal disease evaluation 
data (best response and date of progre ssion) will be collected within this 
protocol.  Tumor measurements are not required; only an overall assessment of 
response or progression by the Investigator is required.  Subjects may continue 
to receive repeated cycles of NKTR-102 on  this protocol as long as there is 
evidence of disease control in the judgment of the Investigator or until there is 
unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent by the su bject, Investigator 
decision, subject non-compliance, lost to follow-up, or study is terminated by the Sponsor.  After discontinuation of NKTR-102, all subjects, except those who withdraw consent from further st udy follow-up, are to be followed for 
disease status (as applicable), subsequent  anti-cancer therapy, survival status, 
and resolution of toxicity attributable to study drug (with contact by phone, through a clinic visit, or through review  of medical records approximately every 
12 weeks (±4 weeks)).   
Concomitant Medications:  
Permitted Treatments
: 
• Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms. 
• Standard therapies for concurrent medical conditions, including antiemetic 
prophylaxis and early interventional antidiarrheal therapy. 
• Diarrhea is an expected toxicity of NKTR-102.  All subjects must receive 
optimal antidiarrheal therapy immedi ately after the FIRST episode of 
diarrhea or loose stool regardless of severity. 
• Premedication with antihistamine and/ or corticosteroid is allowed in 
subsequent cycles following occurrence of a self-limiting 
allergic/hypersensitivity reaction to  a prior infusion  of NKTR-102.  
Prohibited Treatments :  
• Any concurrent chemotherapy (other than NKTR-102), radiotherapy (with the exception of palliative radiation), biological therapy, hormonal agents 
used for the treatment of cancer, immunotherapy, or other systemic therapy 
for cancer; megestrol acetate for appetite stimulation may be used. 
• Other investigational agents within 28 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 or 
during the study. 
• Investigators must monitor subjects for use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inducers or inhibitors, as they may induce or inhibit irinotecan or SN38 metabolism.   Some of these agents are over-the-counter medications 
(e.g., St John’s Wort); subjects must provide a complete list of all 
concomitant medications as part of the screening process.   
Inclusion Criteria:  Subjects must meet the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment:   
1) Subject or subject’s legal representa tive must provide written informed 
consent
 
2) Subject is able and willing to comply with the study visit schedule and

 Disease Evaluation (per 
Standard of Care): Tumor assessments will be performed accord ing to local standard of care until 
disease progression.   
Statistical Methods: The primary objective will be measured by capturing AEs and SAEs using the data capture tools provided for this study.  
The primary endpoint of this study is to assess the incidence and duration of 
toxicities, with severity grading according to NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0.  
The incidence and duration of AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA preferred term, system organ class, severity grading by NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 criteria and relationship to study drug.  The maximum intensity and frequency of AEs will 
be summarized by treatment (dose level). 
Tumor response will be summarized by histological tumor type and tabulated 
using by-subject listings based on disease assessments from this protocol.   
NKTR-102 Dose Modification: NKTR-102 dose modifications are provided in Section 
6.7.   
Safety Monitoring: Clinical examinations including physical examinations and vital signs.  Local laboratory assessments including bone marrow, liver, and renal functions will 
be performed before each cycle of NKTR-102.  Other laboratory assessments 
can be performed at the investigator’s discretion.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 NKTR-102 
NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) is a long acting topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate that 
was engineered by attaching irinotecan molecules to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer using 
a biodegradable linker.  Irinotecan is releas ed from NKTR-102 following administration and 
further metabolized to the active metabolite,  7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), which 
causes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage through the inhibition of topoisomerase 1.   
The goal in designing NKTR-102 was to attenuate or  eliminate some of the limiting side effects 
of irinotecan while improving e fficacy by modifying the distribu tion of the agent within the 
body.  The size and structure of NKTR-102 results in  a marked alteration of the pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profile of SN38 derived from NKTR-102 co mpared with that following irinotecan:  the 
maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced  5- to 10-fold, and the apparent elimination 
half-life (t ½) of SN38 is increased from 2 days to a pproximately 40 days.  This altered profile 
leads to the prolonged exposure of the tumor to  active drug.  In addi tion, the large NKTR-102 
molecule does not freely pass out of intact va sculature, possibly accoun ting for relatively higher 
concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites in tumor tissues in in vivo animal 
models, where the local vasculature may be re latively more permeable.  A single dose of 
145 mg/m2 NKTR-102, the dose used in the Phase 3 me tastatic breast can cer (MBC) clinical 
study (BEACON trial), results in approximately  the same plasma exposure (area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve [AUC]) to SN38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but 
exposure is protracted, resulti ng in continuous exposure between  dosing cycles and a lower C max.  
NKTR-102 is therefore being developed as a ne w chemotherapeutic agent that may improve 
tolerability and patient outcome.   
2.1.1 Description of Nonclinical Studies 
Nonclinical experience is summarized in  the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
2.1.2 Clinical Experience with NKTR-102 
2.1.2.1 Phase 1 Study 06-IN-IR001 (Single-Agent NKTR-102) 
The NKTR-102 Phase 1 study, 06-IN-IR001, was open to patients with advanced solid tumors 
whose tumors had failed prior treatments or  those for which no sta ndard treatments were 
available.  The study evaluated three treatment schedules:  weekly for 3 weeks every 4 weeks 
(wx3 q4week), once every 14 days (q14d) and once every 21 days (q21d).  In all schedules, 
NKTR-102 was given as an intravenous  (IV) infusion over 90 minutes.

Nektar Therapeutics  Page 15 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 For each schedule, the objectives were:   
• To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D),  
• To characterize the safety and PK profile in subjects with refractory solid tumors, 
• To evaluate subjects for any ev idence of anti-tumor activity.   
This study has been completed and fi nal data are detailed in the IB. 
2.1.2.2 Phase 2 studies 
A Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR-05) of NKTR-102 in patients with meta static breast cancer 
(MBC) evaluating 2 treatment schedules (145 mg/m2 q14d and q21d; n = 70 patients with 
35 patients per treatment schedule) showed signi ficant antitumor activity.  The study showed the 
following activity in the 2 treatment schedules combined:   • ORR by RECIST version 1.0 in the intent-to- treat population was 29%, with 2 complete 
responses (3%) and 18 partia l responses (26%).   
• ORR was maintained in patients with advanced  or high-risk disease (ORR equal to 33% in 
patients who had received prior anthracycline, taxane, capecitabine; ORR in patients with 
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) was 33%).   
• Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 4.7 months and 10.3 months, respectively.   
The q21d schedule resulted in less Grade 3 or hi gher toxicity (68.6% for the q14d and 54.3% for 
the q21d schedule), fewer serious adverse even ts (SAEs) (51.4% for q14d schedule and 42.9% 
for q21d schedule), and slightly fewer patients discontinuing the study drug, but not necessarily 
exiting the study, due to an adverse even t (22.9% for q14d schedule and 20.0% for q21d 
schedule).  Two possible drug-relate d fatalities (acute renal failure and septic shock) occurred in 
patients treated with the q14d schedule and none  occurred in patients treated with the q21d 
schedule.  There were no observations of  Grade 4 diarrhea in the q21d schedule.   
Based on these findings, the 145 mg/m
2 q21d regimen was selected fo r continued investigation 
in the Phase 3 study in patients with MBC.  See the IB for additional information on the Phase 3 
study in patients with MBC.   
A Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR-04) of NKTR-102 in  patients with platinum resistant ovarian 
cancer (disease progressing within 6 months following last dose of platinum) evaluated 
2 treatment schedules (145 mg/m2 q14d and q21d; n = 71; 36 and 35 patients per treatment 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol)

 schedule).  Preliminary data indicated that  NKTR-102 produced a RECIST version 1.0 ORR 
(confirmed and unconfirmed) of 27% and 22% in the q14d and q21d schedules, respectively.  
The Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup response (confirmed and unconfirmed) was 47% in q14d 
and 41% in the q21d schedule ( Vergote et. al., 2010 ).  In those patients whose disease had 
progressed following both platinum (within 6 mo nths) and liposomal dox orubicin (n = 33), ORR 
equaled 21%, median PFS equaled 5.5 months and OS equaled 14.0 months in combined q14d 
and q21d schedules ( Garcia et. al., 2011 ).  Common related grad e 3/4 toxicities (q14d/q21d 
schedules) were diarrhea (22%/11%), dehydration (14%/6%), hypokalemi a (14%/6%), fatigue 
(6%/11%), nausea (14%/3%), and neutropenia (8%/9%) ( Vergote et. al., 2010 ).  Two 
treatment-related deaths were observed; one patient died due to pr e-renal azotemia (q14d 
schedule) and one patient died due to neutropenic se psis (q21d schedule).  The q21d schedule, 
overall, had a better toxicity profile, supporting further development using the q21d schedule.   
A randomized Phase 2 study (Protocol 08-PIR- 03) comparing single-agent NKTR-102 to 
single-agent irinotecan in 2nd-line KRAS-mutant metastatic colo rectal cancer ( CRC) patients was 
completed.  The final Clinical Study Report is not yet available.   
Combination studies have been completed (Pro tocol 07-PIR-02 with cetuximab and Protocol 
09-PIR-07 with 5-FU/leucovorin).   See the IB for additional information on these clinical 
studies.   
2.1.2.3 Clinical Pharmacokinetics of NKTR-102 
Clinical PK profiles are consistent with pr eclinical PK profiles with NKTR-102 infusions 
demonstrating greater and sustained exposure to SN38 than had been reported for irinotecan 
infusions.  Additionally, proportional increases in the area unde r the concentration-time curve 
(AUC) and maximum concentration (C max) were observed for NKTR-102, irinotecan, and SN38.   
The apparent elimination t ½ for SN38 after NKTR-102 administra tion is approximately 40 days, 
whereas after irinotecan administration, the SN38 t ½ has been reported as 29 to 47 hours (
Kehrer et al., 2000 ).  This greatly increased SN38 t ½ results in plasma SN38 concentrations that 
are significantly more sustained between doses than are possible with irinotecan.  Cumulative 
SN38 exposures, as indicated by AUC values, were 0.6 - 4.4 fold higher (mean 1.6, standard 
deviation 0.8) than those predicted for irinotecan ( Xie et al., 2002 ) when administered at 
equivalent doses and schedules.   
Interpatient variability in SN38 clearance and volu me of distribution is similar to that reported 
for SN38 following irinotecan administration.

 There has been no obvious correlation of toxicity or  SN38 PK parameters with age, race, gender, 
past or present smoking status, uridine diphos phate-glucuronosyl tran sferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) 
status, or baseline liver or renal function.  Further explor atory analyses are ongoing.   
2.1.2.4 NKTR-102 Safety Profile 
As of May 2015, 871 patients across all NKTR-102 clinical studies (com pleted and ongoing; 
single agent and combination therapy) have r eceived at least one dos e of NKTR-102.  See the 
current version of the IB for additional safety information.   
Observations across all studies (including safety data from ongoing studies) have been generally 
consistent with regard to the overall safety profile of NKTR-102.  Gastrointestinal toxicity, 
especially diarrhea, is the most common and clin ically significant toxicity.  Other frequently 
observed AEs include nausea, vomiting, fatigue , decreased appetite, abdominal pain, 
constipation, and dehydration.   Diarrhea and dehydration secondary  to diarrhea were the most common serious adverse events 
(SAEs) across all studies evaluating NKTR-102, occurring at frequencies of 9.5% and 4.1%, 
respectively.  Prolonged severe diarrhea with dehydration leading to pre-renal azotemia and 
subsequent acute renal insufficiency  has been fatal in 4 patients (1 patient in each of the Phase 2 
studies in metastatic colorect al, ovarian, and breast cancers and 1 patient in the Phase 3 
BEACON study).  Early onset ch olinergic-mediated diarrhea has been observed with NKTR-
102. Late-onset, severe diarrhea can occur and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed.  
The median time to onset of Grade 3 diarrh ea for NKTR-102 in the Phase 3 BEACON study was 
43 days (range 3 to 488 days).  Early, proactive,  and aggressive interven tion with anti-diarrheal 
therapy, IV hydration, and maintena nce of electrolyte balance had a significant favorable effect 
on the clinical course of events, preventing vo lume depletion and the development of renal 
failure.   Myelosuppression, especially neutropenia, can o ccur in patients receiving NKTR-102; however, 
data from clinical studies evaluating NKTR-102 suggest a lowe r frequency and severity of 
neutropenia with NKTR-102 than with irinotecan.  NKTR-102 administered at a dose level of 
145 mg/m
2 in a q21d schedule in the Phase 3 BEACON study resulted in an overall neutropenia 
incidence of 21.4%; about one-t hird of these (7.5%) was ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia.  The onset of 
neutropenia in the concomitant setting of se vere diarrhea and dehydration with fever and 
infection must be carefully monitored and proactively treated as it can potentially lead to neutropenic sepsis, whic h may be fatal.

2.1.2.5 Study Drug Discontinuation due to Adv erse Events and Physician Decision in 
Phase 3 BEACON (11-PIR-11) Study 
A summary of the most common TE AEs leading to study drug discont inuation (> 1 patient in the 
NKTR-102 treatment arm) is presented in Table 2 .  There was a higher overall incidence of 
TEAEs leading to discontinuation in the NKTR- 102 treatment arm (11.1%) compared with TPC 
(6.7%), and there was a higher incidence of di arrhea leading to discontinuation in the NKTR-102 
treatment arm (3.1%) compared with the TPC trea tment arm (0%).  The incidence of neuropathy 
leading to discontinuation was higher in the TPC treatment arm (2.2%) compared with the 
NKTR-102 treatment arm (0.2%).   
Strict protocol-mandated diarrhea management guidelines were implemented in the BEACON 
study, including requirements for removal of patients from the study due to diarrhea.  Guidelines 
were created based on the safety experience obtained in the prior phase 2 program where 
Grade ≥3 diarrhea occurred at a rate  of approximately 20% (see IB  for details).  Dose reductions 
were required to prevent the possibility of accumulation of active drug upon repeated dosing; 
occurrence of Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea was controlled by tem porary discontinuation of NKTR-102.  
The BEACON protocol mandate d discontinuation after the third occurrence of Grade ≥ 2 
diarrhea.  Because the incidence of Grade ≥ 3 diarrhea is less than 10% with the implementation 
of diarrhea management guidelines, and given that  the median time to resolution for all Grades 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol)

Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 of diarrhea was 1.5 days, any subsequent studies will not require treatmen t discontinuation after 
3 episodes of Grade ≥ 2 diarrhea.   
Also of importance, a greater proportion of pa tients were removed from NKTR-102 (2.8%) for 
neutropenia compared to TPC (0.2%),  despite the lower rate of Grade ≥3 neutropenia with 
NKTR-102 (9.6%) compared with that of TPC ( 30.6%).  The median time to onset of Grade ≥ 3 
neutropenia was 120 days on NKTR-102 compared with 16 days on TPC.  The significance of 
the difference in time to onset is that the cl inical decision to discontinue treatment due to 
neutropenia likely occurs at a much later tim e point for patients on NKTR-102, when there may 
be less clinical benefit to conti nue; this situation is quite differe nt from an appropriate response 
to the occurrence of early neutropenia (ie, wi th TPC), where dose delay is more common.

 A higher proportion of patients wa s withdrawn from treatment due to physician decision in the 
TPC arm (57/423; 13.5%) compared with the NK TR-102 arm (28/429; 6.5%).  Typical reasons 
for clinical progression included symptoms of un derlying disease such as increasing dyspnea, 
general deterioration, an d reduced performance status.  In the presence of clinical evidence 
suggesting progression, benefit/risk assessment may lead to discontinuation of treatments with 
less tolerable safety profiles (eg, TPC).   
The nature, scope, and severity of the safety findings to date with NKTR-102 are clinically 
manageable and consistent with findings commo n to treatments for patients with MBC.   
2.2 Study Rationale  
This study is designed to allo w an extension period of NK TR-102 therapy for subjects who 
previously received NKTR-102 during a clinic al study and are without signs of disease 
progression since receiving NKTR-102.   The estimated study duration is approximately 5 year s.  The duration of treatment in this study is 
estimated to be approximately 2 years.  Subject s may continue to receive repeated cycles of 
study drug treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal by 
subject, Investigator decision, lo st to follow-up, or study is termin ated by the Sponsor.  Since this 
trial may involve the longest exposure to NKTR-102 to date, it will allow for the collection of 
safety data, particularly serious adverse events  (SAEs) that may appear  only after long-term 
exposure to NKTR-102.

 4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Study Endpoint 
4.1.1 Endpoints 
• Incidence and duration of toxici ties, with severity grading according to NCI-CTCAE v 4.0.   
• Tumor response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.   
4.2 Study Design 
This is a multicenter, open-label , Phase 2 study of NKTR-102 in subjects with solid tumors who 
received NKTR-102 in a prior Nektar-sponsored  clinical study.  Fo llowing completion of 
NKTR-102 treatment on a prior NKTR-102 clinical study, subjects will be assessed for 
eligibility.  The Sponsor must assess eligibility criteria  prior to enrollment of all subjects.   
Eligible subjects will con tinue treatment with NKT R-102 at a dose of 145 mg/m2 or less in a 
q21d schedule as outlined in Section 6.5.  Subjects who previously received a dose of 
NKTR-102 at <145 mg/m2 will continue at the lower dose in this study.  Subjects who 
underwent dose reduction of NKTR-102 due to observ ed toxicity prior to participation in the 
Extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09) will not be re-escalated to the previous dose level upon resolution of the toxicity.  Dose escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted.   
NKTR-102 will be administered as an IV infusi on over approximately 90 minutes (± 15 minutes) 
on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle.  Disease assessments for tumor response and 
progression will be performed as per local sta ndard of care until disease progression.  Minimal 
disease evaluation data (best response and date of progression) will be collected within this 
protocol.  Tumor measurements are not required ; only an overall assessment of response or 
progression by the Investigator is re quired.  Subjects may continue to receive repeated cycles of 
NKTR-102 on this protocol as  long as there is evidence of dis ease control in the judgment of the 
Investigator or until there is unacceptable toxicity, death, withdr awal of consent by the subject, 
Investigator decision, subject non -compliance, lost to follow-up or study is terminated by the 
Sponsor.  After discontinuation of NKTR-102, all subjects, except those who withdraw consent 
from further study follow-up, are to be followed fo r disease status (as ap plicable), subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy, survival stat us, and resolution of toxicity attributable to study drug (with 
contact by phone, through a clinic  visit, or through review of  medical records approximately 
every 12 weeks (± 4 weeks).   A schematic of the study design is presented in 
Figure 1 .

 4.2.1 Administrative Structure 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 is sponsored by Nektar Therap eutics and will be administered and monitored 
by Nektar or designee.  Monitoring will occur at  each site on a periodic basis at Nektar’s 
discretion.  Monitors will perfor m verification of source documentation for study subjects.  Site 
Investigators will provide confirmation to Nektar th at the eligibility criteria have been met for 
each subject.  Nektar will then inform the study site  that the subject can be offered entry into the 
Extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09).   
4.3 Blinding 
This is an open-label study.   4.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
There will be no randomization or subject stratification.  Subj ects will retain their subject 
identification number from their original study.  Treatment with NKTR-102 will occur as 
described in Section 
6.5.   
4.5 Drug Accountability and Reconciliation 
NKTR-102 for Injection will be stored as per instructions provided in the pharmacy manual in a 
secured site with restricted access.   
Study drug accountability will be recorded by the site  pharmacist or designee and verified by the 
Sponsor’s designee at the Sponsor’s discre tion.  The pharmacist or designee will:   
• Maintain records of product delivery, lot numbe r, inventory, and destruction or return  
• Maintain temperature monitoring 
• Maintain up-to-date accountability of NKTR-102 for Injection in the drug accountability log  
• Document the use of NKTR-102 for Injection by each subject 
• Return or destroy unused NKTR-102 for Inje ction as per Sponso r’s instructions

 5.0 SELECTION OF STUDY POPULATION 
Before any protocol mandated procedure is initiated, each subject or subject’s legal 
representative will sign and date an IRB or IEC-approved informed consent form (ICF).   
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Each subject must meet the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment.   
1. Subject or subject’s legal re presentative must provide wr itten informed consent.   
2. Subject is able and willing to comply with  the study visit schedul e and procedures.   
3. Subjects must have received prior treatment with NKTR-102 in a Nektar-sponsored study.   
4. Subjects must be without signs of dis ease progression since receiving NKTR-102.   
5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at the predose visit of each cycle.   
6. Women of childbearing potenti al and men who agree to us e adequate contraception 
during study participation (at least two methods of contraception, one of which includes a 
barrier method [male condom] by the male pa rtner or abstinence) or a male who has 
undergone a vasectomy greater than 6 months  prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Appropriate 
contraception must be used for at least 8 m onths after the last dose of the study drug on 
this extension study.   
7. Subjects must meet requirements with re spect to hematopoietic function (hemoglobin 
>
 8.0 g/dL or 80 g/L; absolu te neutrophil count (ANC) >  1.5 X 109/L; platelets 
> 75 X 109/L).   
8. Subjects must be able to receive the first dose of NKTR-102 in the extension study within 
8 weeks after receiving thei r last dose of NKTR-102.   
5.2 Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects who meet any of the following criteria are ineligible for enrollment.

 2. Subjects with 2 dose reductions of NKTR-102 a nd have a toxicity that requires another 
dose reduction.   
3. Female subjects who are pregnant  or lactating, who plan to get pregnant, or who have a 
positive pregnancy test at screening or during participation in this study.   
5.3 Early Withdrawal/Discontinuation from Study 
Subjects may choose to discontinue/withdraw from study drug treatment or the study at any time, 
for any reason, and without prejudice to furthe r treatment.  A subject who withdraws consent 
from study participation will be asked to  state the level of withdrawal:   
1. Withdrawal from treatment only; and/or 
2. Withdrawal from contact during the post-tre atment period (for off-study data, such as 
subsequent anti-cancer th erapy or survival).   
In the event of withdrawal  of consent, the study staff and/or In vestigator must make every effort 
to ascertain the level of consent withdrawn.  An objective of this  study is to assess survival 
status, so site personnel must as certain if subjects will permit continued follow-up if consent is 
withdrawn.  The type of consen t withdrawal must be noted in source documents and CRF.   
Subjects may stop NKTR-102 treatment or be withdr awn from the study for any of the following 
reasons, but will be followed for safety until resolution or permanent sequelae of all toxicities 
attributable to NKTR-102 (see Section 9.5):   
• Progression of disease 
• Adverse Event (unacceptable toxicity) 
• Death 
• Non-compliance of the subject with  protocol-mandated procedures 
• Withdrawal of consent by subject 
• Physician (Investigator) Decision 
• Lost to Follow-Up 
• Study is terminated by the Sponsor

 5.3.1 Withdrawal Procedures 
In the event of a subject’s withdrawal from treatment, the Investigator will promptly notify 
Nektar Therapeutics and will make every effort to complete the End-of-Treatment assessments 
and ascertain if subjects will permit continued foll ow-up (i.e., for survival status, subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy, and disease status).  Before  a subject is considered “Lost to follow-up”, 
study personnel must attempt to contact the subject at least twi ce by phone and once by mail 
with documented receipt.  Study personnel may use public records to check for mortality for any subjects considered “Lost to follow-up” or who have withdrawn consent from the study, if 
permitted by applicable laws or regulations.

 6.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT( S)/STUDY MEDICATIONS 
6.1 Description and Formulation 
The drug substance NKTR-102 is a polymeric conjuga te prodrug of irinotecan with 3 essential 
components:  a relatively large polymer, a biod egradable linker, and an active agent.  In 
NKTR-102, irinotecan is attached to PEG via a releasable linker th at is hydrolyzed in vivo to 
deliver irinotecan, which is further metabolized to the active metabolite, SN38.  Table 3  
provides the nomenclature informa tion for drug substance NKTR-102.   
Table 3: Nomenclature 
Compound Number/Name: NKT R-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
Sponsor: Nektar Therapeutics 
Chemical classification: Topoisomerase 1 Inhibitor 
 
The investigational drug product NKTR-102 for Inject ion is formulated as a sterile lyophilized 
powder of NKTR-102 in lactate buffer at pH  3.5, intended for dilution with commercially 
available 5% Dextrose Injection (w/w%; D5W) or 0.9% Sodium Chlo ride for Injection before IV 
infusion.  The pH of the formulation is in the range of 3.2 to 4.2, and NKTR-102 for Injection 
storage condition is 2°C - 8°C, with  a shelf-life of 48 months.   
Both 5% Dextrose Injection and 0.9% Sodium Chlo ride for Injection will be locally sourced at 
each clinical study site.   
6.2 Packaging and Labeling 
NKTR-102 (drug substance) is light sensitiv e.  The lyophilized drug product NKTR-102 for 
Injection will be supplied in 25 mL Type 1 amber colored glass vials packaged in cartons of 
10 vials per carton.  Each vial contains l yophilized NKTR-102 equivalent to 100 mg of 
irinotecan.   
Each vial and carton will be labeled to comply with local regulations.   
6.3 Reconstitution and Handling 
NKTR-102 for Injection must be reconstituted with  D5W or 0.9% Sodium Chloride for Injection 
to a final concentration range of 0.2 to 1.6 mg/m L.  The reconstituted drug may be stored under 
ambient lighting conditions at room temperature (15 to 30 °C) for up to 6 hours prior to start of 
infusion.  Other drugs must not be added to the infusion solution.

 NKTR-102 for Injection must be ad ministered as an IV infusion over approximately 90 minutes 
(± 15 minutes).  Premedications ar e not required to be administered  prior to the initial infusion in 
this study, but may be used for an individual s ubject, as needed.  If a subject has reported 
symptoms (such as nausea and/or vomiting)  in the original study, prophylactic use of 
anti-emetics may be attempted.   
The instructions for reconstitution and administ ration of NKTR-102 for Injection are described 
in detail in the Pharmacy Binder.   
6.4 Treatment Assignment 
This is an open-label trial.  There will be no su bject randomization or stratif ication.  Subjects will 
retain the subject identification numbers assigned in the orig inal protocol.   
6.5 Dosage and Administration 
Body surface area (BSA) will be dete rmined before the start of each cycle, based on baseline 
height and most recent weight.  Body surface area may be calculated based on institutional 
guidelines.  NKTR-102 will be admi nistered as an IV infusion over 90 minutes (± 15 minutes).  
The recommended dose and sche dule of NKTR-102 is 145 mg/m2 q21d, with BSA capped at 2.4 
m2.  Subjects who were previously receiving the 145 mg/m2 dose will continue to receive this 
dose in this extension study in a q21d schedule.   
Subjects originally enrolled in  a clinical study in which a lower-than-recommended dose was 
administered (e.g., Protocol 12-102-13 in subjects  with impaired liver function) or was being 
administered after a dose reduction will continue to  receive that same dose in a q21d schedule in 
this study.  For Protocol 12-102-13 subjects with hepatic dysfunction, as defined in that study, 
will continue in this extension study (Protocol 11 -PIR-09) to receive the originally assigned dose 
from the 12-102-13 study in a q21d schedule.   
Subjects originally enrolled in  a clinical study in which a hi gher-than-recommended dose was 
being administered (e.g., Protocol 12-102-12 to  explore the effects of NKTR-102 on cardiac 
function) will receive the recomm ended dose of NKTR-102 of 145 mg/m2 in a q21d schedule in 
this extension study (Pro tocol 11-PIR-09).   
Subjects who underwent dose reduction of NKTR -102 due to observed toxicity prior to 
participation in the Extension study [Protocol 11-PIR -09] will not be re-escalated to the previous 
dose level upon resolution of the toxicity.   
Dose escalation for NKTR-102 is not permitted.

6.6 Duration of Treatment 
The estimated study duration is approximately 5 year s.  The duration of treatment in this study is 
estimated to be approximately 2 years.  Subject s may continue to receive repeated cycles of 
study drug treatment until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, death, withdrawal by 
subject, Investigator decision, lost to follo w-up, or study is terminated by the Sponsor.   
6.7 Dose Modifications and Delays 
All adverse events (AEs) will be assessed acco rding to the NCI-CTCAE version 4.0.  In the 
event of multiple toxicities, dose delays and m odifications should occur in accordance with the 
worst toxicity observed.   
Specific dose modifications for NKTR-102 w ill be made for diarrhea, dehydration, 
hematological, and other non-hematological toxic ities.  Dose delays may be permitted between 
cycles.   Prior to initiation of subsequent  NKTR-102 cycles, subjects must meet requirements with respect 
to hematopoietic function (hemoglobin >
 8.0 g/dL or 80 g/L; ANC >  1.5 X 109/L; platelets 
> 75 X 109/L).  Diarrhea must be fully resolved to NCI-CTCAE Grade 0 (a return to normal 
bowel movement habits) for at least 7 days with out supportive antidiarrheal measures prior to 
retreatment.  Any treatment-related non-hematologic toxicities must have resolved to baseline or 
Grade 1.   If the subject fails to meet the criteria for re-treatment, treatment  may be delayed, followed by an 
additional evaluation to determine feasibility of re treatment.  Initiation of subsequent doses may 
be delayed for a maximum of 28 days to allow rec overy from any toxicity to permit retreatment.  
Subjects whose treatment delays are ≥ 14 days but ≤ 28 days due to a drug-related toxicity must 
initiate their next treatment cycle with a dose reduction.  Subjects who require > 28 days delay 
due to unresolved toxicity must be withdrawn from treatment, unless, in the Investigator’s 
opinion, continuing in the study is of  benefit for the subject.  In this case, the continuation of 
treatment must be discussed w ith the Medical Monitor and the reason for continuation must be 
approved and documented.   Subjects from Protocol 12-102-13 with impaired liver functi on who are entering the extension 
study will receive the same dose as that received in the 12-1 02-13 study.  Investigators may 
choose to reduce the dose of NKTR-102 for either drug-related or non-drug related Grade 3 or 
higher liver dysfunction only after approva l from Nektar Medical Monitor.

 Supportive care may be implemented in order to  treat diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
myelosuppression, and/or other AEs.  Dose delays  may be implemented to permit recovery if a 
subject is demonstrating clinical benefit, but with repeat ed Grade 2 toxicities that would 
otherwise mandate withdrawal.   
Dose reductions may also be implemented for subjects who experience recurrent or specific 
severe toxicities (see Table 4 ).  NKTR-102 doses for an individual subject may be reduced by 
25 mg/m2 based on conditions listed in Table 4 .  Subjects should be discontinued from the study 
treatment if toxicity would indicate more th an 2 dose reductions.  Dose re-escalation for 
NKTR-102 is not permitted.   • For subjects entering this st udy at a starting dose of 145 mg/m

 6.8 Antidiarrheal Therapy 
Subjects may experience diarrhea foll owing administration of NKTR-102.   
To date, early-onset diarrhea  (occurring during or shortly after infusion of study drug) has rarely 
been seen with NKTR-102 administration.  It is usua lly transient and only infr equently severe.  It 
may be accompanied by symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, 
diaphoresis, flushing, and intestin al hyperperistalsis that can cau se abdominal cramping.  Early 
diarrhea and other cholinergic sy mptoms may be prevented or ameliorated by administration of 
atropine (0.25 to 1 mg subcutaneous or IV), however, routine pr ophylactic use of atropine is not 
recommended.   
Late onset diarrhea (occurring more than 24 hour s after the infusion) ca n be life-threatening, 
because it may be prolonged and may lead to de hydration, hypotension, and renal failure. In the 
BEACON study, 9.6% of patients reported Grade 3 diarrhea.  Among those patients, the median 
time to onset of Grade 2 or higher diarrhea wa s 40 days, and the median onset for Grade 3 
diarrhea was 43 days.  In addition, the median tim e to resolution of Grade 2 or higher diarrhea 
was 3.5 days and the median time to resolution of Grade 3 diarrhea was 6 days.  There were no 
incidents of Grade 4 diarrhea.   
It should be noted in the patient’s medical record  whether the subject is currently receiving anti-
diarrhea supportive care and the date of the last episode of diarrhea/loose stool.   
Diarrhea must be treated promptly with anti-d iarrheal therapy; loperamide is recommended.  
Each subject must be instructed to immediatel y begin taking anti-diarrhea l therapy at the very 
first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or  the earliest onset of bowel movements that are 
more frequent than normally expected for the subject.  Subjects with diarrhea must be carefully 
monitored, should be given adequate fluid a nd electrolyte replacement if they become 
dehydrated, and antibiotic support if they devel op ileus, fever, or seve re neutropenia.   
• Prophylactic antidiarrheal medications must not be used as they can confound the evaluation 
of recovery to Grade 0 (a return to norm al bowel movement habits) and monitoring of 
diarrhea AEs in subjects  receiving NKTR-102.   
• Each subject will be instructed to start taking anti-diarrheal therapy (i.e., loperamide) for diarrhea at the first episode of poorly formed or  loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel 
movements more frequent than norm ally expected for the subject.

 o One dosage regimen for loperamide used in clinical trials consisted of the following 
(Note: This dosage regimen exceeds the usual dosage recommendations for 
loperamide.):  4 mg at the first onset of diarrh ea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until 
the subject is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours.  Loperamide is not recommended 
to be used for more than 48 consecutive hour s at these doses, because of the risk of 
paralytic ileus.  During the night, the subj ect may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 
hours.   
• The use of drugs with stimulant laxative properties should be avoided because of the 
potential for exacerbation of diarrhea.   
• Subjects will be instructed  to report the following :  diarrhea for the first time during the 
infusion of NKTR-102; black or bloody stool s; symptoms of dehydration such as 
lightheadedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; inability to get dia rrhea under contro l within 24 hours; or fever or evidence of 
infection.   
An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved subj ect instruction sheet on the management of 
diarrhea will be provided to all the subjects.   
6.9 Antiemetic Therapy 
If a subject experiences na usea and/or vomiting, the subject may be given prophylactic 
antiemetics treatment prior to the next dose of NKTR-102.  The subject must be carefully 
monitored throughout the study period, and given ad equate fluid and electrolyte replacement to 
prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance.   6.10 Use of Growth Factor Support and Transfusions 
Upon NKTR-102 administration, subj ects may experience neutropeni a.  Subjects who do not 
meet retreatment criteria for ANC should return to clinic within 3-7 days fo r reassessment.  If the 
subject continues not to meet re treatment criteria for ANC, she shoul d return to clin ic at weekly 
intervals for reassessment.  Subj ects must demonstrate an ANC >
 1.5 X 109/L prior to 
retreatment with NKTR-102.   
Prophylactic use of growth factor support is no t permitted, however use of growth factor support 
in a setting of neutropenia is permitted.  Use of growth factor support must follow American 
Society Clinical Oncology (ASC O), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines 
or standard of care at the local institution.  For example, if a subject required growth factor 
support during a previous cycle, a subject may be administered prophylactic growth factor 
support during a subsequent cycle at the investigator’s  discretion.

 Subjects may receive transfusions (platelets or blood products) at the Investigator’s discretion.   
6.11 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Throughout the study, Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments 
deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care.   
All medications (both prescr iption and over-the-counter [OTC ] medications), vitamin and 
mineral supplements, and/or herbs taken by the subject from Screening through the 
End-of-Treatment visit will be documented on the concomitant medication eCRF.  Throughout 
the study, Investigators may pres cribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed 
necessary to provide adequate supportive care.  All concomitant  medications administered to 
study subjects will be recorded in the eCRF.   
6.11.1 Permitted Treatments 
• Palliative and supportive care for disease-related symptoms.   
• Standard therapies for concurrent medical c onditions, including antiemetic prophylaxis (see 
Section 6.9) and early interventional antidia rrheal therapy (see Section 6.8).   
• Diarrhea is an expected toxicity of NKT R-102.  All subjects must receive optimal 
antidiarrheal therapy immediately after the FIRST episode of diarrhea or loose stool 
regardless of severity.   
• Premedication with antihistamine and/or cortic osteroid is allowed in  subsequent cycles 
following occurrence of a self-limiting allergic/hype rsensitivity reaction to a prior infusion of 
NKTR-102.   
6.11.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications 
The treatments listed below are prohibited wh ile on study.  For treatments prohibited on study, 
alternative medical intervention sh ould be considered; if a prohibi ted treatment is required, study 
drug treatment should be discontinued.   
• Any concurrent chemotherapy (other than NKTR-102), radiotherapy (with the exception of 
palliative radiation), biologica l therapy, hormonal agents used for the treatment of cancer, 
immunotherapy, or other systemic therapy fo r cancer; megestrol acetate for appetite 
stimulation may be used; 
• Other investigational agents w ithin 28 days prior to Day 1 of  Cycle 1 or during the study;

 • Investigators must monitor subjects for use of potent cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) 
inducers or inhibitors, as they may induce or inhibit irinotecan or SN38 metabolism.  Some 
of these agents are OTC medications (e.g., St Jo hn’s Wort); subjects must provide a complete 
list of all concomitant medications as part of the screening process.  See Appendix 2  for a 
list of agents known to induce and inhibit CYP3A4.   
6.11.3 Adequate Forms of Birth Control 
Over the course of the study, women of childbear ing potential (WCBP) and men must agree to 
use adequate contraception during study participa tion (at least two methods  of contraception, one 
of which includes a barrier method [male condom] by the male partner or ab stinence) or a male 
who has undergone a vasectomy greater than 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.  Women of 
childbearing potential are wome n who are not 2 years postmenopa usal or are not surgically 
sterile.   
Protections against pregnancy shoul d be continued for at least 8 months after the last dose of 
NKTR-102.

• ECOG performance status 
• Vital signs (pulse, temperature, blood pressure) 
• Urine pregnancy test (only for WCBP) 
• Assessment of concomitant medications 
• Assessment of AEs 
7.4 Quarterly Follow-up 
Approximately every 12 weeks (±4 weeks) followi ng the End-of-Treatment visit, subjects will 
have their medical records reviewed and may be  contacted to assess disease status, survival 
status, receipt of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, and resolution of all toxicity attributable to 
study drug.  Disease status during follow-up will only be assessed if the subject has not 
demonstrated disease progre ssion since receiving NKTR-102.   Quarterly follow-up will continue 
until death, withdrawal of consen t by subject, physician decision, lost to follow-up, or the study 
is terminated by the Sponsor.

 9.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY OR ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
In this section, the term study drug refers to NKTR-102 for Injection.   
9.1 Adverse Event Definition and Assessment 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occu rrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not consider ed drug related.  An AE can th erefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally a ssociated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicina l product.  An AE can also arise from any use 
of the drug and from any route of  administration, formulation, or  dose.  This definition includes 
intercurrent illnesses or injuri es, and exacerbation of preexisting conditions as well as events 
attributed to protocol-mandated procedures.  Clinical laboratory abnormalities will only be 
reported as AEs if they are deemed clinically si gnificant by the Investigator  and/or are associated 
with signs and symptoms, require treatment, or require follow-up.   
An unexpected AE is one of a type not consistent in nature or severity with information in the 
current IB.   An AE does not include: • A medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extract ion, or transfusion); 
an AE is the underlying condition that leads to the procedure 
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions presen t or detected before start of study drug 
administration and which do not worsen or incr ease in severity or frequency after the 
administration of study drug 
• Situations where an untoward medical occu rrence has not occurred (e.g., hospitalization for 
elective surgery for a condition that has not wo rsened on study, social and/or convenience 
admissions to grant families a respite in caring for a subject) 
9.2 Monitoring Adverse Events 
All AEs will be assessed by the Investigator and recorded in th e appropriate case report form 
(CRF), including but not limited to, the date of onset and resolution, seriousness, severity, 
relationship to study drug, outcome, and action taken with study drug.  Adverse events will be 
reported starting immediately afte r the subject or subject’s legal representative has provided 
written informed consent through the End-of-Treatme nt visit (30 ± 7 days from the last dose of 
study drug in the extension study).   
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page 46 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 After providing informed consent for the extens ion study, if the subject is continuing in the 
original protocol and therefore will not have r eceived the first dose of st udy drug in the extension 
study (Protocol 11-PIR-09), any AEs that occur w ill be collected under the original protocol.  
For subjects who have ended the original protocol and have provided informed consent for the 
extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09), AEs will be  collected under the extension study (Protocol 
11-PIR-09).   
Adverse events that were considered related to  study drug in the origin al protocol and were 
ongoing when the subject ended the original prot ocol will be captured as a new AE in the 
extension study (Protocol 11-PIR-09) marked as c ontinuing.  Unrelated AEs that were ongoing at 
the end of the original protocol may also be  captured as new AEs in the extension study 
(Protocol 11-PIR-09) marked as continuing.   For each AE, the following data elemen ts will be recorded on the CRFs: 
• Verbatim description of event  
• NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 grade for AE se verity (refer to Section 
9.3) 
• Start and stop date of AE 
• Relationship/causality attribution to study drug 
• Whether or not the administration of study drug was reduced, inte rrupted, delayed, or 
permanently discontinued due to the AE 
• Whether or not the event was considered as an SAE 
• Treatment provided for the AE (pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic) 
• Outcome of the AE 
9.3 Grading of Adverse Events 
The severity of an event and the seriousness are not to be consid ered synonymous.  The severity 
is grading the intensity of an event.  The seriousness of event is based on the subject/event 
outcome or action criteria.  All AEs will be assessed for severity using the NCI-CTCAE 
version 4.0.  If a particular AE is not listed in the NCI-CTCAE, the following criteria will be used to assess severity by the Investigator:   
o grade 1 = Mild (asymptomatic or mild symptoms or clinical or diagnostic 
observations only, interv ention not indicated) 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page 47 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 o grade 2 = Moderate (minimal, or local or  non-invasive intervention indicated or 
limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living [ADL]) 
o grade 3 = Severe (medically significant  but not immediately life-threatening or 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated or disabling, limiting self 
care ADL) 
o grade 4 = Life threatening or disabling (life threaten ing consequences, urgent 
intervention indicated) 
o grade 5 = Death (related to AE) 
Adverse events will be reported using the maximal severity grade experienced for that continuing instance of the AE.  Please refer to  the CRF Completion Guidelines for detailed 
reporting instructions.   
9.4 Causality Relationship of Adverse Events 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug will be evaluated by the Investigator using the 
following definitions:   
• Not related:  The AE is clearly not related to  the study drug(s).  The AE  can be explained to 
be likely related to other factors such as concomitant medications or the subject’s clinical 
state.   
• Unlikely related:  The AE is doubtfully relate d to study drug(s).  The current knowledge or 
information about the AE indicates that a relationship to the study drug is unlikely.   
• Possibly related:  The AE may be related to the study drug(s).  A plausible temporal 
sequence exists between the time  of administration of the stu dy drug and the development of 
the AE and it follows a known response pattern to the study drug.  The reaction may have been produced by the subject’s clin ical state or other concomitant therapies or interventions.   
• Definitely related:  The AE is  clearly related to the study dr ug(s).  A plausible temporal 
sequence exists between the time  of administration of the stu dy drug and the development of 
the AE and it follows a known response pa ttern to the study drug.  The AE cannot be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or other 
concomitant therapies or intervention s administered to the subject.   
The causality criteria of definitely related and possibly related will be considered related to the 
study drug as applicable for regul atory reporting requirements.

Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 9.5 Adverse Event Reporting and Follow-up 
All AEs will be followed until resolution or until 30 ± 7 days after last dose of study drug 
administration, whichever is earlier, except re lated AEs which will be followed until they 
stabilize or resolve; until the I nvestigator assesses the event as chronic or stable; start of new 
cancer therapy; subject lost to follow-up or subjec t death, whichever is earlier.  If an unrelated 
AE has not completely resolved up to 30 ± 7 days  after last dose of study drug, the final outcome 
of these ongoing AEs will be captured as  “Not Recovered/Not Resolved” or 
“Recovering/Resolving”, whic hever is applicable.   
Any new AEs occurring more than 30 ± 7 days af ter last dose of study drug will be captured only 
if serious and assessed by the Investigator as re lated (possibly/definitely  related) to study drug 
(i.e. a related SAE).  For speci fic instructions on identifying a nd reporting SAEs, see Sections 
9.6 and 9.7 below.   
This study will use the MedDRA  for coding all AEs.   
9.6 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
An SAE is defined as any untoward me dical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death 
• Is life threatening, i.e., in the opinion of th e investigator, the AE places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; it does not incl ude a reaction that, had 
it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   
• Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of an existi ng hospitalization that occurs 
during the course of a subject’s participation in a clinical  study, except for those due to the 
following:   
o A surgery or procedure that was planned before the subject entered the study and 
which is part of the planned study procedure 
o Nonmedical reasons, in the absence of an AE 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page 49 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 • Is an important medical event that, ba sed upon appropriate me dical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject and may re quire medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above 
An unexpected SAE is any SAE in which the nature, frequency or severity is not consistent with 
that indicated in the IB.   
Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  All deaths regardless of causality must be 
reported.  An efficacy failure is not considered an SAE.  “Life-threatening” means that the 
subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred.  This does not include an 
event that might have led to death, if it had occurred with greater severity.  “Inpatient 
hospitalization” means the subject has been adm itted to a hospital for medical reasons for any 
length of time.  The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical informa tion.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE and/or SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.   
9.7 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
All SAEs with an onset within 30 days after the subject’s last dose of study drug, whether or not 
considered related to study drug treatment, will be reported to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or its designee within 24 hours  of when the site becomes aware of the event.  In addition, SAEs 
that are assessed by the I nvestigator as related to NKTR-102 and occurring > 30 days  after last 
dose of study treatment will also be reported to Ne ktar Therapeutics Drug Safety or its designee 
within 24 hours  of when the site become s aware of the event.   
   
The Investigator must complete the SAE Repor t Form, assess the causality relationship to the 
study treatment as applicable, and send the completed SAE form by fax to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or designee.   
A follow-up report and any additional records (such as hospital records, consultant reports, and 
autopsy findings) will be faxed to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or designee as soon as these 
documents become available or promptly upon request.   Any medication or other therapeutic measures us ed to treat the event will be recorded.   
All SAEs will be followed as described in Section 
9.8 below.

Nektar Therapeutics  Page 50 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 Pregnancy, although reportable, is not considered an AE/SAE unless a male subject’s female 
partner experienced signs or symptoms of pregnancy complications.  Females who become 
pregnant will be followed every trimester un til the outcome of the pregnancy is known.  
Pregnancy follow-up should describe the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or 
spontaneous termination, details of the birth, and the presence or abse nce of any congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects in the offspring.   
Reporting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC will be done  in accordance with the standard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC.  Ade quate documentation must be provided to Nektar 
Therapeutics, showing that the IRB/IEC was prope rly notified.  Serious adverse events will be 
reported by Nektar Therapeutics or designee to th e regulatory authorities, per local regulations.   
9.8 Serious Adverse Event Follow-up 
All SAEs will be followed until th e end of study or resolution, unless related to study drug and 
continuing or reported after the end of the study, in which the related SAE will be followed until 
any of the following occur (whichever comes first):   
• The event resolves. 
• The event has stabilized. 
• The event returns to baseline, if  a baseline value is available. 
• It is unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (e.g., subject or health care 
practitioner refuses to provide additional information; lost to follow-up after demonstration 
of due diligence with follow-up efforts).   
• Further follow-up is not warranted based upon th e medical judgment of the investigator.   
• Death 
All ongoing and new SAEs with a start date w ithin 30 days of last dose of study drug and 
assessed as “Unrelated” to study dr ug will be followed until reso lution or until 30 ± 7 days after 
last dose of study drug administra tion, whichever is earlier.   
9.9 Expedited Reporting of SAEs 
A SUSAR is a SAE that is considered “unexpected ” and assessed as related to the study drug by 
the Investigator or the Sponsor .  All SAEs deemed related to  the study drug and not expected 
based on the most current IB are subject to expe dited reporting by the Sponsor to the applicable 
Regulatory Authorities.  Therefor e, the investigator or study site  personnel must report all SAEs 
Protocol 11-PIR-09 Amendment 3.0  NKTR-102 (etirinotecan pegol) 
 
Nektar Therapeutics  Page 51 of 63 
Confidential and Proprietary  14 January 2016 
 to Nektar Therapeutics Drug Safety or its designee within 24 hours  of first becoming aware of 
the event.   
Fatal or life-threatening SUSARs  will be reported by the Sponsor to the Regulatory Authorities 
as soon as possible, but no late r than 7 calendar days after S ponsor or Sponsor’s designee has 
first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting.  Non-fatal or non-life-
threatening SUSARs will be reported to the Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/IECs, and 
Investigators as soon as possible, but no later th an 15 calendar days afte r Sponsor or Sponsor’s 
designee has first knowledge of the SUSAR.   Reporting of SUSARs to all applicable Regulatory Authorities will be done by Nektar 
Therapeutics Drug Safety or designee as pe r local country and re gional regulations.   
Notification of SUSARs to the central IRBs will be done by Nektar Therapeutics Clinical 
Operations or designee in accordance with the SO Ps and policies of the IRBs.  Reporting to local 
IRBs will be done by the applicable study site personnel as per their institutional guidelines.  Adequate documentation must be provided to Nektar Therapeutics Clinical Operations or 
designee, showing that the loca l IRB was properly notified.   
9.10 Ongoing Safety Monitoring 
Subject safety will be assessed throughout the study by a Safety Review Committee consisting of 
at minimum the Medical Monitor, Sponsor Clinic al Lead and Sponsor Pharmacovigilance Lead 
or designee by review of SAEs.

 10.0 EFFICACY EVALUATIONS 
Due to the nature of this study, no specific schedu le or type of tumor measurements/assessments 
are dictated within the protocol.  These will be conducted as per the local standard of care until 
disease progression.  Data on best response and disease progression (per physician assessment) 
will be collected according to RECIST criteria version 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et. al., 2009 ).  
Radiographs that document response, stable di sease, or progression should be performed 
according to routine patterns of care and (preferabl y original) copies should be maintained by the 
Investigator for review by the Sponsor, if requested.   
Approximately every 12 weeks (±4 weeks) followi ng the End-of-Treatment visit, subjects will 
have their medical records reviewed and may be  contacted to assess disease status, survival 
status, receipt of subsequent anti -cancer therapy, and resolution of all toxicity attributable to 
study drug.  Disease status during follow-up will only be assessed if the subject has not 
demonstrated disease progression since receivin g NKTR-102.  Quarterly follow-up will continue 
until death, withdrawal of consent by subject, physician decision, lost to follow-up, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor.

 11.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Nektar Therapeutics shall implement and main tain quality control and quality assurance 
procedures with written standard  operating procedures to ensure  that the study is conducted and 
data are generated, documented, and reported in  compliance with the protocol, GCP, and 
applicable regulatory requirements.   
All protocol deviations and the reasons for such deviations are to be documented in the source 
documents and reported to Nektar Therapeutics.   
11.1 Changes to the Protocol 
The Investigator may not deviate from the protoc ol without a formal pr otocol amendment having 
been established and approved by an appropriate IRB/IEC, except when necessary to eliminate 
immediate hazards to the subject.  Any deviation may result in the subject having to be 
withdrawn from the study and renderi ng that subject non-evaluable.   
11.2 Monitoring 
In accordance with 21 CFR § 312.56, ICH GCP and local regulations, the clinical monitor will periodically inspect all study documents, research facilities, and clinical  laboratory facilities 
associated with this study at mutually convenient times during and after completion of the study.  As required by 21 CFR § 312 Subpart D, ICH GCP and local regulations:  Responsibilities of 
Sponsors and Investigators, the monitoring visits  provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to 
evaluate the progress of the study; verify th e accuracy and completeness of submitted data; 
ensure that all protocol requirements, applic able FDA, ICH GCP and local regulations, and 
Investigator’s obligations are being fulfilled; and resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  This includes inspecti on of all documents and records that  are required to be maintained 
by the Investigator, including but not limited to me dical records (office, clinic, or hospital) for 
the subjects in this trial.  The na mes and identities of all research subjects will be kept in strict 
confidence and will not appear in the CRFs or other records provided to or retained by the Sponsor.  The IND regulations also require the Investigator to allow auth orized representatives 
of the FDA and European Union Re gulatory Authorities to inspect and make copies of the same 
records.  The names and identities of the subj ects need not be divulged to the Sponsor; however, 
the records must nevertheless be inspected.  This can be accomplished by blacking out the 
subject’s name and replacing the na me with the subject’s study id entification number.  If these 
requirements are in conflict with local regulatory  restrictions or institutional requirements, the 
Investigator must inform the Sponsor of these re strictions prior to init iation of the study.

 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Analysis Populations 
Safety Population:  The safety population consists of all subjects who receive NKTR-102 for 
Injection.  Unless otherwise stated, all safety analyses will be based on this population.   
12.2 Endpoints and Planned Analyses 
The primary endpoint of this study is assessment of safety for subjects receiving continued 
NKTR-102 therapy.   
The MedDRA medical dictionary will be used to map the AE/SAE verbatim terms to specific 
system organ classes and preferred terms.  The incidence and duration of AEs will be tabulated 
by MedDRA preferred term, system  organ class, severity and relationship to study drug.  The 
maximum intensity and frequency of AEs will be summarized by treatment (dose level).  
By-subject listings will be provide d.  No formal statistical tes ting is planned for AE or other 
safety and tolerability data.   Tumor response will be summarized by histological  tumor type and tabulated using by-subject 
listings based on disease assessments from this protocol.   Other data will be tabulated using by-subject listings.

 13.0 ETHICS 
This study will be conducted according to the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki 
(October 2008) and in accordance with F DA regulations (21 CFR § 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312), 
with the ICH guidelines on GCP (ICH E6), as well as  with any and all app licable federal, state 
and/or local laws and regulations.   
13.1 IRB/IEC Approval 
Prior to enrollment of subjects into the study, as required by Fede ral regulations (21 CFR § 56), 
ICH E6 GCP and local regulations, the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and 
approved by an appropriate IRB or IEC.  By signing the Statement of Investigator Form FDA 
1572, the Investigator assures that all aspects of  the institutional review will be conducted in 
accordance with current federal regulations.  A le tter documenting the IRB or IEC approval with 
the names and titles of the IRB or IEC members must be received by the Sponsor prior to the 
initiation of the study.  Amendments to the protoc ol will be subject to the same requirements as 
the original version of the protocol.   
The Investigator, the Sponsor or designee will subm it a progress report at least once yearly to the 
IRB or IEC and Regulatory Authorities.  The fr equency of these reports will depend on local 
regulations.  As soon as possible after completion or termination of the study, the Investigator 
will submit a final report to the IRB or IEC and to the Sponsor.  The results should be reported per the IRB or IEC’s local requirements.   
The Investigator, the Sponsor or designee is requi red to notify the IRB or IEC of SAEs, or any 
other information that may affect the safe use of the study drug duri ng the course of the trial, per 
the IRB or IEC’s local requirements.   
13.2 Written Informed Consent 
Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject or subject’s legal representative 
before entering the study.  Subjects/legal represen tatives will be informed of the nature of the 
study, and the ICF must be presented to each subject/subject’s legal representative in the 
language in which the subject/subj ect’s legal representa tive is fluent.  By signing the Statement 
of Investigator Form FDA 1572, the Investigator en sures that informed co nsent will be obtained 
from each subject/legal representa tive prior to any protocol-specific procedures, and that 
informed consent will be obtained and documente d in accordance with current state and federal 
regulations.  Signed and dated ICFs will be retained  by the Investigator with the study records.  
Each subject/legal representative will be given a copy of the signed and dated consent form.

medical records, records detailing the progress of the study for each subject, laboratory reports, 
CRFs, signed informed consent forms, drug dispos ition records, corresponde nce with the IRB or 
IEC and regulatory agencies AE reports, and information regarding subject discontinuation and 
completion of the study.   
14.1.2 Case Report Forms 
Case report forms will be used in this study.  Th ese forms are used to transmit the information 
collected in the performance of  this study to the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee and Regulatory 
Authorities.  Case Report Forms must be comple ted in English.  The Investigator must review 
the CRFs for completeness and accuracy and must  approve the appropriate CRF as indicated.  
Furthermore, the Investigator retains full responsib ility for the adequacy and accuracy of all data 
entered on the CRFs.   14.2 Retention of Essential Documents 
All records and documents pertaining to the study including, but not limited to, those outlined 
above (see Section 
14.1.1 ) will be maintained by the Investigator for a period of at least 2 years 
after FDA/European Medicines Agency (EMEA) a pproval of the drug or at  least 2 years after 
withdrawal of the IND under which this study was conducted, whichever is longer.  In countries 
outside the US, as a minimum, r ecords must be kept for the period of time required by the US 
FDA, and should also comply with  the local country regulatory re quirements, if longer retention 
times are required than in the US.  In order to  avoid any possible errors, the Investigator will 
contact the Sponsor before transferring or destro ying any study records.  The Investigator will 
also promptly notify the Sponsor in the event of accidental loss or de struction of any study 
records.   
14.3 Confidentiality 
Attention is drawn to the re gulations promulgated by the ICH E6 GCP guidelines, local 
confidentiality requirements and the FDA under the Freedom of Information Act providing, in 
part, that information furnished to clinical Inve stigators and IRBs/IECs will be kept confidential 
by the FDA/EMEA and local regulatory agencies only if maintained in confidence by the clinical

Informed Consen t X  a Cycle length is 21 days.   
b Any procedures that were completed as part of the end-of-study visit for the original 
protocol that match those procedures required during Screening may be used and do not 
need to be repeated if they were performed within 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1 of this extension study.  For all subsequent cycles, Day 1 assessments may be performed up to 5 
days before Day 1.  For all cycles, safety assessments are required before each treatment 
cycle.  All results must be available before dosing.   
c End-of-treatment visit to occur 30 ± 7 days after last dose of NKTR-102.   
d There will be a complete physical exam with height and weight during Screening, 
symptom-directed physical ex ams with weight during treatment, and a complete physical 
exam with weight at the End-of-Treatment.  Vital signs include pulse, temperature, and 
blood pressure.  ECOG performance status will be assessed as part of the physical exam.  
e Radiological exams or digital photography required during Screening unless subjects had 
disease assessment within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 dosing.  Disease assessments 
will occur during the study as per local standa rd of care (e.g., approximately every 6-12 
weeks).  CT or MRI scanning is acceptable for radiologic exams.   
f If Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is observed, more frequent CBC with differentials are 
recommended until Grade 1 or less.   
g Minimally required: hemoglobin, ANC, platelets, and creatinine.  Other tests obtained 
according to the Investigator’s discretion.   
h Body surface area (BSA) will be determined before the start of each cycle, based on 
baseline height and most recent weight.  Bo dy surface area may be calculated based on 
institutional guidelines.   Eligibilit y Criteria X

k Approximately every 12 weeks (±4 weeks) following the End-of-Treatment visit, subjects 
will be contacted or have their medical records reviewed to assess disease status, survival 
status, receipt of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, and resolution of all toxicity attributable to study drug.  Disease status during follow-up will only be assessed if the subject has not 
demonstrated disease progression since recei ving NKTR-102.  Quar terly follow-up will 
continue until death, withdrawal of consent by  subject, physician decision, lost to follow-
up, or the study is terminated by the Sponsor.

a The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration-, dose-, and preparation-
dependent.  Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength).

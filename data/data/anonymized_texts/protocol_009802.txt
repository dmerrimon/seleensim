Amendment 3  
The purpose of this protocol amendment is to modify the study phase, number of participants to 
be enrolled,  study schedule, treatment period, and endpoints. These changes are  due to  difficulty 
reaching  the study  enrollment goal during the  COVID -19 pandemic  and the low prevalence of 
ABPA . The study has changed from phase 3 to phase 4, the primary  and secondary  endpoin ts 
have been changed , and the sam ple size has been reduced . The following table outlines the 
changes made to the protocol and the affected sections:  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
The sample size has been reduced 
from 170 participants to 60 
participants, and the primary 
endpoint has been changed.  
New primary endpoint: “Change 
from baseline in pre -
bronchodilator FEV1 compared 
to placebo at week 24”  
Previous primary endpoint , which 
is now a secondary endpoint and 
no longer compared to placebo : 
“Annualized rate of severe The decision to stop enrollment was 
made because of difficulties enrolling 
participants due to the COVID -19 
pandemic and the low preva lence of 
ABPA. Nearly 60 patients had been 
enrolled when the decision to stop 
enrollment was made.  
A sample size of 60 participants has 
insufficient power to detect a 
difference in severe exacerbation rates

The study treatment period has 
been changed from 52 weeks to at 
least 24 and no more than 52 
weeks.  Changes in lung function between 
treatment groups can be adequately 
assessed after 24 weeks of treatment; 
however, some stud y patients will 
have already received 52 weeks of 
treatment at the time this amendment 
is approved.  
Modification of the treatment period 
will result in all patients who complete 
the treatment period being treated for 
a minimum of 24 weeks and a 
maximum of 52 weeks. This change 
will shorten the time to study 
completion while allowing for 
collection of endpoint data to evaluate 
efficacy in patients with ABPA.  Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis :

The study phase has been 
changed from phase 3 to phase 4.  Dupixent has market authorization for 
the treatment of asthma, and all 
patients must have asthma in addition 
to ABPA to be eligible for study 
participation. ABPA is diagnosed by 
the ISHAM criteria, which for this

The purpose of this protocol amendment is to update the inclusion and exclusion criteria to address 
 for patients on an tifungal  therapy  and to allow a broader population to 
enroll that are still within the recognized International Society  for Human and Animal Mycology 
(ISHAM)  diagnostic criteria . Provisions were also added to protect patient safety and data integrity 
during the COVID -19 pandemic by allowing for certain study procedures to occur at delayed time 
points and/or outside of the clinic environment. Other changes were made for clarification and 
consistency. The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the rationale.  
Description of Change  Rationale  Section Changed  
Antifungal therapy related changes  
The inclusion and exclusion 
criteria were modified such that 
patients on antifungal therapy at 
screening may enroll in the study.  
Patients on oral antifungal 
therapy at baseline will be capped 
at 45% of the study population. 
Furthermore, randomization wil l 
now be stratified by oral 
antifungal use at screening 
(yes/no), in addition to the prior 
stratification criteria. The 
statistical analysis models for this 
study were updated accordingly.

The allergic bronchopulmonary 
aspergillosis (ABPA) diagnostic 
criteria were updated to include a 
broader range of eosinophil 
counts at screening.  
Additionally, the inclusion 
criteria were modified to permit a  
documented historical positive 
test result  for the presence of 
serum precipitating or IgG 
antibodies to A fumigatus  within 
12 months prior to screening . 
 To provide flexibility to sites 
and reduce the screen failure 
rate by broadening the entry 
criteria related to ABPA 
while still adhering to the 
ISHAM 2013 diagnostic 
criteria for ABPA.

Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Patients with Allergic 
Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis  
Site Location(s)  
 Principal Investigator  Approximately 80 to 100 sites are planned, in the United States (US), European 
Union (EU), and other world regions.  
(PI TBD)  
Objective(s)  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab on  
lung function  in patients with allergic bronchopulmona ry aspergillosis 
(ABPA).   
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on exacerbations in patients with 
ABPA  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on ABPA -related exacerbations  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on hospitalization/emergency 
department (ED)/urgent care visits in patients with ABPA  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on asthma control in patients 
with ABPA   
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on health -related quality of life 
(HRQoL) in patients wit h ABPA  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on serum total IgE and 
Aspergillus -specific IgE concentrations  
• To evaluate the effects of dupilumab on fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
(FeNO) levels  
• To evaluate safety and tolerability of dupilumab in patients with 
ABPA  
• To evaluate dupilumab concentrations in serum and the incidence of 
anti-dupilumab antibodies in patients with ABPA  
Study Design  Phase 2 , global, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
parallel  group study to evaluate efficacy  and safety of dupilumab in patients 
with ABPA . The 3 study periods include a screening period, a randomiz ed 
treatment  period , and a post-treatment follow -up period . Patients will be 
randomized 1:1 to receive either dupilumab 300 mg given subcutaneously (S C) 
after a loading dose of 600 mg, or matching placebo given SC every 2 weeks 
(Q2W).  
Study Duration  The study  duration is 36 –64 weeks, excluding the 4 -week screening period.  
The randomized treatment period is 24 –52 weeks, with all patients being 
treated f or a minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks. The post -
treatment follow -up period is 12 weeks.  
End of Study Definition  The end of study is defined as the date the last patient completes the last study 
visit, withdraws from the study, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the study patient can 
no longer be contacted by the investigator) .

level)  over the treatment period ; number of severe respiratory exacerbations 
that are associated with hospitalization, ED, or urgent care visits ;  
; patient -reported  outcome questionnaires 
(SGRQ, ACQ -5); systemic corticosteroid use; oral antifungal use and  
 
Safety procedures include: vital signs; physical examination; 
electrocardiogram; laboratory testing.   
Samples will be collected for trough dupilumab concentrations, anti-drug 
antibody ( ADA ) and neutralizing antibody (N Ab) assessment, and 
pharmacody namic/biomarker assessments . Fractional exhaled nitric oxide, 
serum IgE, A fumigatus -specific IgE,  
 will be measured.  
A subset of study sites may be selected to perform evaluations of ci rculating 
immune cells before and after dupilumab treatment.  
Participation in future biomedical research and pharmacogenomic analysis will 
be optional .  
Statistical Plan  The power  calculation for this study is based on a comparison between 
dupilumab 300 mg Q2W and placebo with regard to the primary endpoint of 
the absolute  change  from baseline  in pre -bronchodilator FEV1  at week 24 . 
Assuming a randomization ratio of 1:1 , a standard deviation (SD) for the 
change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 of  in 
both groups, a 2 -sided Type 1 error of 0.05, and a dropout rate of by week 
24, with approximately 60 randomized patients (~30 patients per group ), the 
study will have approximately 9 6% power to detect a difference of  in 
the change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 between the 
dupilumab and placebo groups, based on the 2 -sample t -test.  
 
 
 
For the primary analysis, t he absolute change from baseline in pre -
bronchodilator FEV 1 at week 24 will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model 
with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The vector of responses will 
consist of the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at 
weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24. For patients who discontinu e study treatment prior 
to week 24, any off -study treatment pre -bronchodilator FEV1 values collected 
after the discontinuation of study treatment through week 24 will be included 
in the analysis. The MMRM model will include OCS use at screening, OAF 
use at  screening, region, age, sex, height, baseline eosinophil count, treatment, 
visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, baseline pre -bronchodilator FEV1 value, 
and baseline pre -bronchodilator FEV1 value -by-visit interaction as covariates. 
An unstructured covari ance matrix will be used to model the correlations 
between repeated measurements. Parameters will be estimated using the 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method and the Newton -Raphson 
algorithm. Statistical inference for the treatment comparison of the  absolute

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 99 1. INTRODUCTION  
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a progressive, immunologic lung disease 
caused by hypersensitivity to the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus  (A fumigatus ) that occurs in patients 
with asthma or cystic fibrosis (Agarwal, 2014 ). The prevalence of ABPA is estimated to be 1% to 
3% in patients with severe asthma referred for specialty care (Eaton, 2000 ) (Kurup, 2009 ). 
Clinically, asthma patients with ABPA have a more severe clinical course with poorly controlled 
asthma, poor response to treatment, and frequent episodes of exacerbations compar ed to patients 
with asthma who do not have ABPA . In addition, ABPA is often associated with thick mucoid 
secretions that can lead to obstruction of large and small airways, bronchiectasis (which does not 
otherwise occur in asthma), and lung function impair ment beyond that seen in a typical asthma 
patient . A staging system is described for patients with asthma and ABPA to monitor disease 
progression clinically . Depending on the stage of the disease, clinical features in ABPA vary from 
mild asthma with occasi onal episodes of wheezing and cough, to patients with fibrosis, honeycomb 
lung, and respiratory failure (Patterson, 1982 ). Stage I is the initial acute stage of ABPA 
manifesting clinically with productive co ugh, wheeze, shortness of breath, fever, malaise, pleuritic 
chest pain, elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE), peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, and 
fleeting pulmonary infiltrates on imaging studies . In stage II, the disease goes into remission for a 
variable period; symptoms are reduced, the lung infiltrates clear, and the serum IgE value declines . 
Stage  III is characterized by respiratory exacerbations with the recurrence of symptoms, 
production of thick sputum plugs, and an increase in serum total IgE levels that occur in up to 
24% to 50% of patients each year  (Agarwal, 2016 ) (Muthu, 2019 ). During episodes of 
exacerbations, thick brown mucoid sputum may contain A fumigatus  hyphae . Stage IV is reached 
when, despite treatment, the disease progresses to extensive mucoid impaction of airways  visible 
on chest x -ray or computed tomography (CT) imaging, lung function decline, and corticosteroid 
dependence . Stage V is the fibrotic stage . Unlike asthma, which does not progress to fibrotic lung 
disease, if the diagnosis is delayed or the disease is  undertreated, ABPA progresses to a fibrotic 
end-stage lung disease that can lead to pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, and respiratory 
failure.  
The diagnosis of ABPA is based on clinical, serological, and radiological criteria . Diagnostic 
criteria fo r ABPA have evolved over the past several decades with an increased understanding of 
the disease, recognition of “severe asthma with fungal sensitization” as a distinct clinical entity, 
and improvement in serological testing . Diagnostic criteria for ABPA, modified in 2013 by the 
International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM) Working Group, are widely 
used clinically, wherein the items are broadly divided into ‘obligatory’ and other supportive 
criteria (Agarwal, 2013 ). The obligatory diagnostic criteria include the presence of a predisposing 
condition (asthma or cystic fibrosis), elevated serum  total IgE >1000 IU/mL, and evidence of 
sensitization to A fumigatus (either a positive immediate hypersensitivity skin test or elevated 
serum -specific IgE to A fumigatus ). Supportive criteria for the diagnosis include 2 of the 
following  3 criteria: 1) eosinophilia >500 cells/µL  in steroid naïve patients (may be historical);  2) 
serum precipitating or IgG antibodies to A fumigatus ; and 3) radiographic findings consistent with 
ABPA.

Clinical Study Protocol  R668 -ABPA -1923 Amendment 4 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 99 Approximately 20% to 30% of asthma patients are sensitized to A fumigatus  (Eaton, 2000 ) 
(Schwartz, 1978 ); however, only a small minority of these patients develop ABPA . In individuals 
who develop ABPA, exposure to fungal antigens results in immune deviation toward a robust 
type 2 inflammatory response with release of type 2 cytokines (eg, interleukin 4  or IL -4, IL -5, 
IL-9, IL -13); activation of mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils; and isotype switching of 
lymphocytes to IgE -producing B  lymphocytes and plasma cells (Knutsen, 2011 ) (Chauhan, 2000 ). 
Ultimately, this florid type 2 inflammatory response is deleterious, resulting in mucoid impaction 
of bronchi, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic inflammation, bronchocentric granulomatosis, and 
exudative or obliterative bronchiolitis . This type 2-skewed immune response is thought to be 
related to genetically determined risk factors . Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes 
(HLA‑DRB1*1501 and HLA ‑DRB1*1503) are associated with a high risk of developing ABPA 
and promote exaggerated type 2 immune re sponses with continued synthesis of IgE upon exposure 
to A fumigatus  antigens (Chauhan, 2000 ). Conversely, HLA ‑DQ2 (HLA ‑DQB1*0201 in 
particular) is associated with a lower risk of ABPA (Chauhan, 2000 ). There are increasing numbers 
of reports of single nucleotide polymorphisms in host response genes (eg, polymorphisms in IL4R, 
IL13, IL10, TLR3, EEA1 ) found in ABPA patients, suggesting a panoply of underlying 
abnormalities in both adaptive and innate immunity (Knutsen, 2006a ) (Overton, 2018 ) 
(Overton,  2016 ). Gain -of-function variants in IL4R  are prevalent in atopic disease and lead to 
exaggerated synthesis of IgE antibodies and increases in the number of tissue mast cells 
(Hershey,  1997 ). Of note, a gain -of-function mutation in the extracellular coding region of IL4R  
(ile75val) was present in 80% of the ABPA patients in 1 study (Knutsen, 2006b ). Studies have 
shown that B  cells from patients with ABPA have higher sensitivity to IL ‑4 and spontaneously 
produce larger amounts of IgE, IgG, and IgA antibodies ag ainst A fumigatus  antigens 
(Hershey,  1997 ) (Knutsen, 1990 ).  
The current mainstay of treatment for ABPA is administration of systemic corticosteroids, with 
many patients becoming corticosteroid -dependent to control the disease . However, no t all patients 
respond to systemic corticosteroids . Long -term use of systemic corticosteroids is not 
recommended due to the lack of evidence supporting prevention of progressive bronchial 
destruction and the potential for serious side effects associated wi th chronic use . 
ABPA -complicating asthma does not respond clinically to conventional asthma therapy including 
high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) . Various antifungal agents (eg, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, ketoconazole, amphotericin B) are used as adjunctive treatments for ABPA in 
patients who respond poorly to corticosteroids in an effort to reduce the fungal antigenic stimulus 
(Agbetile, 2014 ) (Stevens, 2000 ) (Agarwal, 2018 ). However, clinical response to antifungals is 
variable, antifungal  therapy is not curative, and the side effects of antifungals - which include 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, rash, headache, and hepatotoxicity  ̶ limit their use . Long -term 
studies to evaluate the effect of treatment with these agents to modify the pr ogressive decline in 
lung function in ABPA are lacking.  
One prior clinical trial of omalizumab (an anti -IgE monoclonal antibody) has been published 
(Voskamp, 2015 ). In this randomized crossover trial of 13 patients wit h ABPA and asthma, 
4 months of omalizumab was associated with a reduced rate of exacerbation . The efficacy and 
safety of biologics that target eosinophilic or type 2 inflammation have not been established in 
ABPA . No biologic ha s been approved for the trea tment of ABPA by either the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA).

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 99 Thus, there is an unmet need for more effective and safe treatments that target the immunological 
underpinnings of ABPA to prevent irreversible airway and pa renchymal disease, improve clinical 
symptoms, and obviate the need for systemic corticosteroids with their accompanying safety 
concerns.  
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits IL -4 and IL -13 signaling by 
specifically binding to the IL -4Rα subunit shared by the IL -4 and IL -13 receptor complexes . 
Dupilumab inhibits IL -4 signaling via the type I receptor and both IL -4 and IL -13 signaling 
through the type II receptor . Blocking IL -4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL -4 and IL -13, key 
cytokines tha t drive the type 2 inflammatory response, including the release of proinflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE . Dupilumab, therefore, may have the potential to treat 
ABPA, a disease driven by type 2 inflammation.  
Dupilumab (brand name DUPI XENT®) has been approved as an add -on maintenance treatment in 
patients with moderate to severe asthma aged 6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or 
with oral corticosteroid (OCS) -dependent asthma in the United States (US), and in the European 
Union (EU) for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils, 
and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) in patients who are inadequately controlled 
with high -dose ICS plus another medicinal product for maintenan ce treatment . In Japan, 
dupilumab has been approved for patients aged ≥12  years with severe or refractory asthma whose 
symptoms are inadequately controlled with existing therapy . Additionally, d upilumab has been 
approved in over 50  countries for the treatment of patients aged ≥ 6 years with  inadequately 
controlled  moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD)  or with severe AD who are candidates for 
systemic therapy . In the US, dupilumab is approved for use in pediatric patients aged ≥6 months. 
Dupilumab is also approved in the US and EU in adult patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with 
nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) , and in the US in adult patients with prurigo nodularis  and patients ≥12 
years  (and ≥40 kg)  with eosinophilic  esophagitis .  
This study is designed to provide evidence of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with 
ABPA who remain uncontrolled despite ICS.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 30 of 99 3. HYPOTHESIS AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
Treatment with dupilumab will be efficacious in improving lung function and will be well tolerated  
in adult and adolescent patients ≥12 y ears of age with ABPA compared to treatment with placebo.  
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with ABPA.  
A double -blinded, randomized trial design is chosen to minimi ze bias in data collection and result 
interpretation . The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the objectives of this study as this 
will allow for the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab . Although 
dupilumab has been shown  to be efficacious and safe to treat patients with moderate -to-severe 
asthma, neither the safety nor the efficacy of dupilumab for ABPA in patients who have asthma 
has been established . In contrast to asthma, ABPA is characterized by irreversible airway da mage 
and parenchymal involvement, thus the known efficacy of dupilumab on key asthma outcomes 
cannot be easily extrapolated to ABPA . In addition, all patients will be allowed to receive rescue 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids (standard of care) and antifungal therapy (widely though 
not universally used) as necessary and will be closely monitored throughout the study . The 
proposed treatment duration  of at least 24 and no more than 52 weeks  provides an opportunity to 
assess the impact  of dupilumab on multiple clinical outcome measures of ABPA including long -
term changes in lung function; symptom control; rate of severe respiratory exacerbations; 
; and pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effects on biomarkers of type 2 inflammati on 
in ABPA, including serum total and A fumigatus -specific IgE levels. Patients will be treated for a 
minimum of 24 weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks . Details on the variable treatment period can 
be found in Section  9.1.1 . 
A 12 -week post -treatment safety follow -up period is chosen based on the time expected for 
dupilumab drug levels to reach below the lower limit of quantification after the last dose of the 
drug.   
The  primary endpoint is the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator forced expiratory 
volume in 1 second (FEV1)  at week 24 , as this is a well -accepted parameter to determine the effect 
of a drug on lung function . Lung function testing is useful in evaluating the progression of ABPA 
since decreased lung function is frequently associated with the disease. In a survey of 126 pat ients 
with ABPA, 85.7% had abnormal lung function  (Agarwal, 2006 ). Secondary  endpoints include :  
annualized rate  of severe respiratory exacerbations ; ABPA -related exacerbations (in which serum 
IgE doubles compared to the closest pre-exacerbation  value); St.  George’s Respiratory 
Questionnaire (SGRQ), a widely used, validated questionnaire to assess  the impact of the drug on 
HRQoL measures in chronic respiratory diseases; and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -
5), a validated measure of asthma co ntrol . Systemic drug concentration/anti -drug antibodies 
(ADA) and biomarkers (serum total IgE, A fumigatus -specific IgE, 
 have been used previously in the 
dupilumab program to ev aluate the exposure/effect relationship and will help to better understand 
the mechanism of action of dupilumab and IL -4 receptor pathway in patients with ABPA.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 31 of 99 3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
The proposed dose for this study is dupilumab 300 mg administered subcutaneously  (SC) every 
two weeks (Q2W) with a 600  mg loading dose for the first dose . This dose has proven to be 
effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in adult and adolescent patients with 
moderate -to-severe asthma . In addition, dupilumab 3 00 mg every two weeks (Q2W) has shown a 
significant  while significantly reducing exacerbations and improving lung 
function in a population of corticosteroid -dependent patients with severe asthma . This dose 
regimen is approved in the treatment of patients with corticosteroid -dependent asthma . Severity of 
asthma in ABPA is generally greater  than in  asthma patients without  ABPA,  and many ABPA 
patients require treatment with chronic systemic corticosteroids . Therefore, to achieve the opti mal 
benefit -risk ratio in patients with ABPA, dupilumab 300 mg Q2W dosing regimen is selected for 
this study.  
3.3. Risk/Benefit  
Recognizing that the “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID -19) pandemic will have an impact on 
the conduct of clinical trials, the sponso r does not intend to screen any new patients in this study 
unless the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic is deemed manageable and no longer interfering 
with the conduct of trials at individual sites, and patients can safely participate in this study.  The 
sponsor plans to obtain approvals from health authorities/ethics committees to enable continuation 
of study sites for this study, as allowed by local laws and regulations.  
3.3.1.  Risk/Benefit for Dupilumab  
Dupilumab has shown clinically relevant benefit in severa l type 2 -mediated immune disorders 
including AD, bronchial asthma, CRSwNP, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).  
In adults and adolescents with moderate -to-severe uncontrolled asthma, dupilumab significantly 
reduced the risk of severe exacerbations compared  to placebo and consistently improved lung 
function (FEV1), asthma control, and HRQoL in patients with a type 2 inflammatory signature as 
evidenced by a blood eosinophil count of ≥150 cells/µL or a fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
concentration of ≥25 parts  per billion (ppb) . In OCS -dependent patients with severe asthma, 
dupilumab significantly reduced the need for OCS by ~70% while at the same time reducing 
asthma exacerbations and improving FEV1 compared to placebo .  
Type 2 inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of ABPA . The hypothesis that 
blocking key mediators of type 2 inflammation will lead to clinical benefit in patients with ABPA 
is supported by a post -hoc subgroup analysis from the completed dupilumab phase 3 pivotal study 
EFC13579  (QUEST) in patients with moderate -to-severe asthma who met the suggested criteria 
for ABPA diagnosis at baseline . The results from a total of 30 patients (n=18 in the combined 
dupilumab group and 12 in the combined placebo group) provide compelling clinic al evidence for 
the efficacy of dupilumab in patients with ABPA. Dupilumab treatment compared to placebo 
showed an approximately 80% reduction in annualized severe exacerbation events and a 0.26L 
improvement in change from baseline to week 24 in pre -bronch odilator (BD) FEV1 . In clinical 
practice, serum total IgE, which is elevated in patients with ABPA, is monitored to assess ABPA 
disease activity . Dupilumab suppressed serum total IgE by approximately 70% from baseline over 
a 52-week treatment period. Overa ll, dupilumab was well tolerated in this subgroup of patients 
with ABPA.

Clinical Study Protocol  R668 -ABPA -1923 Amendment 4 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 32 of 99 For dupilumab, the safety data observed so far in completed and currently ongoing  studies  have 
demonstrated a satisfactory safety profile . As of 28 March 2022  (data lock point of last  PBRER) , 
approximately 13,577 subjects were enrolled into the development program for dupilumab and are 
included in the safety population:  564 as healthy volunteers, 4998 from atopic dermatitis studies, 
4195 from asthma studies, 880 from rhinosinusitis st udies, 468 from eosinophilic esophagitis 
studies, 275 from allergy studies, 1495 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease studies, 309 
from prurigo nodularis studies, 311 from urticaria studies, 45 from bullous pemphigoid study, and 
37 from an allergic b ronchopulmonary aspergillosis study.  
Dupilumab has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in clinical studies across all approved 
indications. The identified adverse drug reactions (ADR s) observed across  all indications are 
Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) , Sickness -like reaction/Serum Sickness and anaphylactic reaction. 
Though serious serum sickness and serum sickness -like reactions were observed rarely and only 
in AD clinical trials , and dupilumab -related anaphylactic reaction was observed rarely and only in 
an asthma clinical trial, they are considered ADRs across all indications as hypersensitivity is not 
expected to be indication specific. As protein therapeutics, all m onoclonal an tibodies  are 
potentially immunogenic. Systemic hypersensitivity is considered an important identified risk for 
dupilumab.  
Eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms in asthma patients is an important potential risk, 
based on cases of eosinophilic granu lomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic pneumonia 
reported in asthma clinical trials (as well as in adult patients with co -morbid asthma in the 
CRSwNP development program). These events may usually, but not always, be associated with 
the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. A causal association between dupilumab and these 
conditions has not been established  In the AD clinical studies, Conjunctivitis, Conjunctivitis 
Allergic, Conjunctivitis Bacterial, Blepharitis, Dry Eye, Eye Pruritus, Herpes Simp lex (primarily 
mucocutaneous in nature), Eosinophilia and Oral Herpes were identified ADRs. The eye and 
herpes related ADRs appear to be predominantly AD indication specific. Conjunctivitis is also 
considered an ADR for the CRSwNP indication, although it o ccurred at a lower incidence in these 
studies than in AD studies. Most events were mild in intensity, transient in nature, and did not 
necessitate treatment discontinuation. Conjunctivitis and keratitis related events in AD patients are 
an important identi fied risk for dupilumab. In the completed AD studies in children 6 to 17 years 
of age, the safety profile was consistent with that reported in adults and there were no new safety 
concerns identified. In a study in participants aged 6 to 11 years with asthm a, Enterobiasis and 
Eosinophilia were identified as additional ADRs. Angioedema, Arthralgia, Keratitis, Ulcerative 
Keratitis, and Facial Rash have been identified as ADRs in the post marketing setting.  The program 
has a  data monitoring committee (DMC), whi ch will review the benefit/risk on a regular basis.  A 
complete efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab, with respect to the overall development 
program, is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.

6.1. Study Description and Duration  
This phase 2 , global, multicenter,  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 
dupilumab is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with ABPA . 
Approximately 60 patients will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 study periods:  
• Screening p eriod (4 weeks)  
• Randomized treatment period ( 24- to 52 weeks)  
• Post-treatment follow -up period (12 weeks)  
This study employs a variable treatment duration from 24 - to 52 weeks. Patients enrolled in the 
trial will remain in the treatment period for up to a m aximum of 52 weeks or until the last patient 
completes a minimum treatment period of 24 weeks. Of note, the accrual and drop -out rates will 
be closely monitored. The maximum treatment duration of 52 weeks will not be changed . For 
further explanation regard ing the duration of the randomized treatment period, refer to 
Section  9.1.1 . 
Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of the following treatment 
groups:  
• Dupilumab 300 mg, after a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1, administered SC Q2W  
• Matching placebo, administered SC Q2W  
Randomization will be stratified by region (pooled country), chronic systemic corticosteroid use 
(yes/no) at  screening , and by oral antifungal use (yes/no) at screening.  
Rescue courses of systemic steroids for exacerbatio ns, as determined by the investigators, will be 
permitted during the study . Patients will be required to continue all background asthma controller 
medications (ICS) with or without long -acting beta agonist (LABA), leukotriene receptor 
antagonist (LTRA), or  long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) without any changes 
in the dose or regimen during the study period . However, if 2 or more exacerbations occur during 
the treatment period, changes to background therapy ( eg, changes to background asthma co ntroller 
medication or init iation  of antifungal therapy) may be made at the investigator’s discretion.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 37 of 99 Patients who experience a severe respiratory exacerbation will have, as soon as possible, an 
unscheduled visit at the site for the collection of a blood sample for serum tota l IgE measurement.  
Patients who withdraw from the study prematurely will have, at the time of  their next regularly 
scheduled visit , an early termination  visit. This  early termination visit will consist of  all 
assessments normally planned for the end of study (EOS) visit . To allow assessment of patient 
outcomes over the stipulated study period, p atients who discontinue study treatment but continue 
in the study  will be asked and encouraged to complete all remaining study visits and participate in 
all safet y follow -up assessments according to the visit schedule  (Table  1). 
Patients on Oral  Antifungals:  
For patients receiving oral antifungal therapy during the 24- to 52-week treatment  period, the dose 
and regimen of the oral  antifungal agent should remain stable until the end of the treatment period. 
However, antifungal discontinuation or modification to the dose or regimen is permitted for the 
following rea sons: side effects, intolerance, or lack of efficacy  (eg, acute exacerbation ) as 
determined by the investigator . Initiation of therapy with oral antifungal agent s is permitted if 2 or 
more exacerbations occur  during the course of the study . 
Blood Immunophenotyping Substudy (Optional):  
A blood phenotypic substudy may be performed at selected sites . Only patients who are not on 
chronic systemic steroids  and not on  antifungal therapy  at baseline and provide a separate written 
informed consent will be eligible to participate in the blood immuno phenotyping substudy . A 
blood sample will be collected at time points outlined in the Schedule of Events Table  1. Blood 
may be immunophenotyped and sorted using flow cytometry or other methods and characterized 
using RNA sequencing or other methods to quantitate mRNA.

Upon completing the randomized treatment period, patients wil l continue their background therapy 
and enter a 12 -week safety follow -up period . Adjustment of background asthma and ABPA 
medications will be allowed at the discretion of the investigator as clinically indicated during the 
post-treatment follow -up period.  
Figure  1: Study Flow Diagram  
 
Note: Upon implementation of amendment 3, the treatment period for all participants will be a minimum of 24 
weeks and a maximum of 52 weeks. The week of EOT and EOS will vary accordingly.  
NOTE: If there are restrictions to the clinical study as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic, it may 
be necessary to adjust the visit schedule, convert in -person visits to telephone contacts, and 
postpone study procedures until the next available study visi t. It is necessary that the randomization 
visit (V2) occur in the clinic. All temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned 
study procedures in response to COVID -19 are to be documented as being related to COVID -19 
and will remain in effect on ly for the duration of the public health emergency. Once local 
COVID -19 conditions resolve, all study visits and procedures should follow the schedule of events 
as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table  1). 
6.1.1.  End of Study Definition  
The end of study is defined as the date the last patient completes the last study visit, withdraws 
from the study, or is lost to follow -up (ie, the study patient can no long er be contacted by the 
investigator) .

6.3. Study Committees  
6.3.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), composed of members who are independent 
from the sponsor and the investigators, will monitor patient safety by conducting formal periodic 
reviews of cumulative or periodic safety data that will be blinded by treatment group . The IDMC 
may request and be provided the unblinded safety data, or any other req uested data, for the 
purposes of a risk/benefit assessment.  
The IDMC will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study . The IDMC 
will al so recommend any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study 
results during the study execution.  
All activities and responsibilities of the IDMC are described in the IDMC charter.

PATIENTS  
7.1. Number of Patients Planned  
Approximately 60 patients ( approximately 30 patients per  arm) will be enrolled globally.  
7.2. Study Population  
This study will enroll ABPA patients who meet modified ISHAM working group 2013 criteria for 
ABPA (Agarwal, 2013 ). These diagnostic criteria for ABPA are widely accepted clinically and 
broadly divided into ‘obligatory’ and  ‘other’ supportive criteria (Agarwal, 2013 ). 
The overall goals of treatment of ABPA include reduction of symptoms of ABPA, reducing 
pulmonary inflammation, and treatm ent of exacerbations to prevent progression of lung disease . 
Systemic corticosteroids have been the mainstay of treatment for ABPA, but toxicities limit their 
use. Approximately 25% to 35% of ABPA patients remain on long -term systemic steroids 
(corticoster oid-dependent) . Patients on chronic systemic corticosteroids with a stable dose of up 
to 10 mg/day of prednisolone (or its equivalent) or  up to  30 mg of prednisolone (or its  equivalent) 
every other day will be allowed to participate in the study to evaluat e treatment effects in patients 
with greater disease severity . Antifungal agents, especially triazoles, are prescribed as an adjuvant 
therapy in some cases . However, antifungal agents are not curative, their effects on preventing 
exacerbations are variable , and some of  the benefits associated with triazoles may be related to 
impairment of the metabolism of exogeneous corticosteroids by these agents rather than a direct 
antifungal effect . Therefore, to minimize confounding effects of these agents, randomizat ion will 
be stratified by the use of oral antifungal agents  (yes/no)  at screening . 
Rescue courses of systemic steroids for exacerbations, as determined by the investigators, will be 
permitted during the study . However, to minimize confounding effects of changes in background 
asthma therapies on the outcome measures, changes to background asthma controller therapy 
(other than OCS use as described above) will not be permitted unless the patient has had 2 or more 
severe exacerbations during the treatment per iod. Once 2 or more severe exacerbations have 
occurred during the treatment period, changes to background asthma controller therapy may be 
made at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients with post -bronchodilator airflow obstruction ( ) will be permitted 
to enroll, since mucus plugging and bronchiectasis may limit bronchodilator reversibility . 
However, patients with severely reduced lung function (  will not 
be permitted to participate.  
7.2.1.  Inclusion Criteria  
A patient must meet the following criteria to be eligible for inclusion in the study:

from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs . The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration 
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.  
‡ Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not 
acceptable methods of contraception . Female condom and male condom should not be 
used together.  
42. Any country -specific regulation that wou ld prevent the participant from entering the study  
NOTE: Patients  who do not meet the inclusion criteria or fail the exclusion criteria (eg due to 
a transient reason) may be rescreened once, after consultation with the medical monitor. 
Rescreened patients will be assigned a new patient ID versus the one received for the initial 
screening. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen -failure date and the 
rescreening.  
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient has the right to withdraw f rom the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or sponsor have the right to withdraw a patient from the study if it is no longer 
in the interest of the patient to continue in the study, or if the patient’s continu ation in the study 
places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a patient does not or cannot follow study 
procedures) . An excessive rate of withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; therefore, 
unnecessary withdrawal of patients shou ld be avoided.  
Patients who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination visit, as described in Section  9.1.2 . 
Rules for discontinuation of study treatment (permanent or temporary) are discussed in 
Section  8.4.2 .

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 48 of 99 8. STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1. Investigational and Reference Treatments  
Dupilumab drug product is supplied for this study in the following concentration:  
• Dupilumab 150 mg/mL:  Each 2.0 mL single -use prefilled  glass syringe with snap -off 
cap delivers 300 mg of study drug (2.0 mL of a 150 mg/mL solution)  
• Placebo -matching dupilumab is prepared in the same formulation without the addition 
of protein (ie active substance, anti -IL-4Rα monoclonal Ab).  
Study drug will  be administered by SC injections . Subcutaneous injection sites of study drug 
should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist 
areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same site is not injected for 2 conse cutive 
administrations.  
Dupilumab will be administered as a 600 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 300  mg 
administered SC Q2W.  
Matching placebo  will be administered SC Q2W.  
Instructions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.2. Background  Treatments  
Prior to screening, patients must be on a stable background therapy for asthma for at least 3 months 
with a stable dose ≥1 month , and all background therapy must remain stable  between screening 
and baseline . Asthma controller medications must include ICS and may include  1 or more 
additional controller medications (eg, LABA, LTRA, LAMA) . Patients requiring a third controller 
are allowed to participate in this study . The third controller should also be used for at least 3 months 
with a stable dose  ≥1 month prior to  screening and between screening and baseline .  
Patients requiring systemic corticosteroids (prednisone or equivalent) up to 10  mg per day, or up 
to 30 mg every other day, for ABPA are also permitted . Oral corticosteroid doses will be dow n-
titrated starting 4 weeks after randomization according to the schedule described in Appendix  A. 
Patients receiving oral antifungal therapy at baseline are permitted to enroll . For patients receiving 
antifungal therapy during the 24- to 52-week  treatment period, the dose and regimen should remain 
stable until the end of the treatment period. However, antifungal discontinuation or modification 
to the dose or regimen is permitted for the following reasons: side effects, intolerance, or lack of 
efficacy  (eg, acute exacerbation ) as determined by the investigator.   
Patients will be required to continue all background asthma controller medications (ICS) with or 
without long -acting beta agonist (LABA), leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), or long -acting 
muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) without any changes in the dose or regimen during the 
study period.  However, if 2 or more exacerbations occur during the treatment period, changes to 
background therapy (eg, changes to background asthma controller medication or initiation of 
antifungal therapy) may be made at the investigator’s discretion.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 99 8.3. Rescue Treatmen ts 
Short -acting bronchodilators (SABA) are permitted as rescue therapy throughout the study . Rescue 
therapy with ICS and/or LABAs is not permitted.  
Systemic corticosteroids are allowed as rescue treatment for exacerbation . The need for rescue 
therapy and d osage will be determined by the site investigator . For patients on chronic systemic 
corticosteroids, an increase in the dose of systemic steroids is allowed as rescue treatment.  
If 2 or more exacerbations occur during the treatment period, antifungal ther apy may be initiated  
(or the dose may be increased for patients on antifungal therapy) after consultation with the 
medical monitor  at the discretion of the investigator . 
Patients receiving rescue therapy permitted by the protocol may continue to receive st udy drug . 
They will remain blinded and will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits for 
the double -blind treatment period and the follow -up period, and participate in all assessments for 
these visits according to the Schedule of Eve nts specified in Table  1. 
8.4. Dose Modification and Study Treatment Discontinuation Rules  
8.4.1.  Dose Modification  
Study drug dose modification for an individual patient is not allowed.  
8.4.2.  Study Drug Discontinuation  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug should be encouraged to remain in the 
study . Those who agree and do not withdraw from the study  will be asked to return to the clinic 
for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule.  
Patients who permanently discontinue from study drug and who opt to withdraw from the study 
will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section  9.1.2 . 
8.4.2.1.  Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosing will be permanently stopped in the event of:  
• Evidence of pregnancy  
• Serious or severe allergic reactions considered related to study drug  
• Specific types of liver dysfunction (eg, Hy’s law is met ([Guidance for Industry Drug 
Induced Liver Injury: Premarketing Clinical Evaluation FDA 2009])  
• Patient withdraws consent  
• If, in the investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimen tal to the 
patient’s well -being  
• In the event of a critical protocol deviation, at the discretion of the investigator or the 
sponsor  
• At the specific request of the sponsor

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 99 • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or  
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin . Patient must be withdrawn for these latter 
malignancies if they cannot be adequately treated by local resection.  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infection whose nature or course may suggest an 
immunocompromised status  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities assessed as related to study drug:   
− Neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 103/μL 
− Platelet count ≤50 × 103/μL 
− ALT and/or AST values >3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN, excluding 
confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome  
− Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of study drug for the 
concerned patient . See Table  1 for information on  follow -up and any further evaluations 
that need to be completed.  
8.4.2.2.  Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug dosi ng may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  
• Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section  8.4.2.1 ) where a causal 
relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is 
evident):  study drug will be discontinued but may be resumed when the laboratory 
abnormality is sufficiently normalized . At minimum, the laboratory value(s) must 
return to a level that no longe r meets the specified criteria for discontinuation, as 
defined in Section  8.4.2.1 . A decision to resume study treatment will be made jointly 
by the investigator and medical monitor.  
• Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment  
• Other intercurrent illness or adverse event or major surgery which could, in the opinion 
of the investigator, present an unreasonable risk to the patient as a result of his/her 
continued use of the study drug   
After the condition leading to temporary discontinuation of study drug resolves, study drug dosing 
may resume . A decision to temporarily discontinue study drug and/or resume study drug dosing 
should b e discussed with the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. medical monitor . Re-initiation of 
treatment with the study drug will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or laboratory 
monitoring once the investigator will have considered, according to his /her best medical judgment, 
that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with the study 
drug.  
The investigator may temporarily discontinue study drug dosing at any time, even without 
consultation with the medical monito r if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action 
and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest . However, the Regeneron medical 
                                        VV-RIM-00295189-1.0 Approved - 24 Mar 2023 GMT-5:00
Clinical Study Protocol  R668 -ABPA -1923 Amendment 4 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 99 monitor should be contacted as soon as possible . Resumption of study drug dosing requires 
consultatio n and agreement between the investigator and the Regeneron medical monitor.  
For visits other than the randomization and EOT visits, if a patient is unable to return to the clinic 
for a given visit within the specified visit window, any follow -up procedures  scheduled for the 
missed visit should be performed at the subsequent visit.  
If the patient misses more than 4 consecutive doses, the patient will be permanently discontinued 
from the study.  
For all temporary discontinuations of study intervention, duration must be recorded by the 
investigator in the electronic case report form (eCRF) . Following a temporary interruption or 
missed dose, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) treatment should be reinitiated at the 
next scheduled visit, maintaining  the original dose.  
If a patient requires a prohibited medication at any time during the study, the investigator should 
contact the Regeneron medical monitor (except for illness requiring prompt treatment) . Based on 
the discussions, study drug may be conti nued or temporarily or permanently discontinued.  
8.5. Management of Acute Reactions  
8.5.1.  Systemic Injection Reactions  
Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of systemic reactions must be available 
for immediate use . All injection reactions must be rep orted as AEs (as defined in Section  10.2.1 ) 
and graded using the grading scales as instructed in Section  10.2.4 . 
Acute systemic reactions following  SC injection of study drug should be treated using clinical 
judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typical clinical practice.  
8.6. Method of Treatment Assignment  
Approximately 60 patients will be randomized at baseline/week 0/visit 2 in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
either dupilumab 300 mg Q2W or placebo according to a central randomization scheme provided 
by an interactive voice response s ystem (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) to the 
designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee) . Randomization will be stratified by region 
(pooled country), by chronic systemic corticosteroid use (yes/no) at screening , and by oral 
antifunga l use (yes/no) at screening . 
8.7. Blinding  
Study patients, the principal investigators, and study site personnel will remain blinded to all 
randomization assignments throughout the study . The Regeneron medical/study director, study 
monitor, and any other Regene ron and contract research organization (CRO) personnel who are in 
regular contact with the study site will remain blinded to all patient randomization assignments.  
Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used . In order to 
maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to 
individuals involved in study conduct.  
Anti-drug antibody, drug concentration results, and post -treatment biomarker results (  
, serum total IgE, a nd A fumigatus -specific IgEs) will not be communicated to the sites, and 
                                        VV-RIM-00295189-1.0 Approved - 24 Mar 2023 GMT-5:00

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 99 the sponsor’s operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification 
until after the database is locked for the respective study part.  
8.8. Emergency Unbli nding  
Unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency or 
any other significant medical event (eg,  pregnancy) and when a treatment decision is contingent 
on knowing the patient’s treatment assignment . Study drug  will be discontinued for patients whose 
treatment has been unblinded/unmasked (Section  8.4.2 ). 
• If unblinding is required:  
− Only the investigator will make the decision to unblind the treatment assignment.  
− Only the affected patients will be unblinded.  
− The designated study pharmacist(s)/designee at the study site will provide the 
treatment assignment to the investigator . If ther e is no study pharmacist, the 
investigator for the site will unblind/unmask the patient . Unblinding is performed 
using the IVRS/IWRS which will notify Regeneron .  
− The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee as soon as possible after 
unblinding t he patient.  
Treatment assignment is not to be provided to site personnel, other than the unblinded study 
pharmacist (when applicable), at any time during the conduct of the study, except in the case of a 
true emergency and when a treatment decision is cont ingent on knowing the patient’s treatment 
assignment . In the event that there is no study pharmacist, the individual at the site fulfilling that 
role will be the only unblinded member of the site personnel.  
8.9. Treatment Logistics and Accountability  
8.9.1.  Packaging,  Labeling, and Storage  
A medication numbering system will be used to label blinded investigational study drug . Lists 
linking medication numbers with product lot numbers will be maintained by the groups (or 
companies) responsible for study drug packaging . In order to maintain the blind, these lists will 
not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct.  
Study drug will be stored at the site at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC; storage instructions will be 
provided in the pharmacy manual.  
8.9.2.  Supply and Dispo sition of Treatments  
Study drug will be shipped at a temperature of 2ºC to 8ºC to the investigator or designee at regular 
intervals or as needed during the study . At specified time points during the study (eg, interim site 
monitoring visits), at the site close -out visit, and following drug reconciliation and documentation 
by the site monitor, all opened and unopened study drug will be destroyed or returned to the 
sponsor or designee.

Footnotes for  Table 1 Schedule of Events  
*Visits 5, 7, 9, and 10 will be performed as phone visits for patients not receiving OCS at baseline. 
For patients receiving OCS at baseline, these visits should be performed in -clinic if the patient 
remains on OCS on the day of the clinic visit. If OCS has been discontinued, these visits can be 
either in -clinic or performed as a phone visit at the discretion of the investigator. 
Assessments/procedure s marked with an asterisk should only be performed if the visit occurs 
in-clinic.  
**After the last patient has  completed visit 1 4/week 24  of the treatment period  or withdrawn from 
the study, all patients still currently in the treatment period (between visit 15/week 26 and visit 
27/week 50) should return to the clinic 2 weeks from their last dose/treatment administration to 
complete their EOT visit  and all its applicable assessments . For patients who have withdrawn from 
the study treatment  but remain  in the study , the EOT visit will take place 2 weeks from their last 
visit.  All patients must have their EOS visit 12 weeks after their EOT visit.  
 
a. Prior to screening, patients must be on a stable background therapy for asthma which may 
include ICS in combination with a second controller medication (eg, LABA, LTRA, 
theophylline, etc) for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to baseline . 
Patients requiring a third controller are allowed to participate in this study . The third 
controller sh ould also be used for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to 
visit 1 . Patients requiring systemic steroids of up to 10 mg per day (or up to 30 mg every 
alternate day) as  controller medication are permitted .  
b. Randomization/baseline visit is defined as day 1 . The visit schedule should be adhered to 
within ±1 week for the screening period, ±3 days for the randomized IMP treatment period, 
and ±7 days for the post -IMP treatment period.  
c. All assessments at visit 2 (day 1) are to be conducted pre -IMP dose except for the 
assessment of local tolerability of SC injections.  
d. Spirometry will be done locally according to European Respiratory Society 
(ERS)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidance, but measured by a central laboratory . 
Spirometry will be perf ormed during a trough period of bronchodilators according to their 
action duration, for example, withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol or 
levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours, withholding the last dose of ipratropium 
for at least 8 hours, withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours (ultra -long-
acting LABA -like vilanterol should be withheld for at least 24 hours), and withholding the 
last dose of LAMA for at least 24 hours . This will be verified before performing the 
measu rements . Post-bronchodilator FEV1 will be determined at the designated treatment 
visits.  
e. Three attempts may be made during the screening period until the baseline visit to meet 
the qualifying criteria for FEV1 . A total of 2 attempts may be made during the screening 
period until the baseline visit to meet the qualifying criteria for blood eosinophils, total 
serum IgE, Aspergillus -specific IgE, Aspergillus -specific IgG, Aspergillus  precipit ins, 
and/or skin prick test.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 61 of 99 f. Clinical laboratory testing at screening visit 1 will include hepatitis screen covering 
HBsAg, HBsAb, HBcAb), hepatitis C virus antibodies, HIV screen (anti -HIV-1 and 
anti-HIV-2 antibodies) . In case of results showing HBsAg (negative), and HBcAb 
(positive), an HBV DNA testing will be performed prior to randomization to rule out a 
false positivity if the investigator believes the result is a false positive, or to clarify the 
serological status if the investigator finds it unclear to interpret in absence of known HBV 
infection . In case of results showing HCV Ab (positive), an HCV RNA testing may be 
performed to rule out a false positivity, if the investigator believes the patient is a false 
positive.  
g. Patients with active tuberculosis or non -tuberculous mycobacterial in fection, latent 
untreated tuberculosis, or a history of incompletely treated tuberculosis will be excluded 
from the study unless it is well documented by a specialist that the patient has been 
adequately treated, and can now start treatment with a biologic  agent in the medical 
judgment of the investigator and/or infectious disease specialist . (Tuberculosis testing will 
be performed on a country -by-country basis according to local guidelines if required by 
regulatory authorities or ethics committees [ECs].)  
h. Only for women of childbearing potential . Pregnancy will lead to definitive treatment 
discontinuation in all cases . In case of positive urinary test, a serum pregnancy test should 
be performed as soon as possible to confirm the pregnancy.  
i. Serum pregnancy test will be conducted at visit 1 and urine dipstick pregnancy tests will 
be conducted at other visits . A negative result must be obtained at visits 1 and 2 prior to 
randomization.  
j.  
 
 
 
  
k. IVRS/IWRS will be utilized during screening to assign screening IDs, during baseline to 
provide treatment assignments to the investigator, and to dispense study drug.  
l. Every 2 wee ks, study drug administrations must be separated by at least 11 days . IMP can 
be administered in clinic at scheduled visits or at home (patient, caregiver, or health care 
professional). Patients and parents/caregivers who prefer to have clinic staff admini ster 
study drug may choose to have injections administered in the clinic. Due to the COVID -19 
pandemic, study drug may be shipped from the clinical site to the patient's home if 
necessary.  
m. ACQ -5 and SGRQ are completed in the electronic diary during clinic visits and prior to 
spirometry at each visit.  NOTE: If COVID -19 restrictions limit the availability of staff or 
the patient to have in -clinic visits, site staff should make every effort to conduct telephone 
interviews to complete these questionnaires. Site  staff should conduct the telephone 
interviews on the date of scheduled site visit by following an interview guide provided by 
the sponsor. Patient responses from the interviewer administered questionnaires will be 
captured by the site staff . 
n. Vital signs, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse rate (beats per 
minute), body temperature (°C), and respiratory rate will be measured at screening, 
baseline, and every subsequent on -site visit . For adults, height (cm) will be measured only

be conducted at other visits.  A negative result must be obtained at visits 1 and 2 prior to 
randomization.  
u. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and ADA samples are to be collected prior to the administration of 
the drug . In the event of suspected serious adverse events (SAEs), such as anaphylaxis or 
hypersensitivity, additional samples for the analysis of ADA and dupilumab drug 
concentration may be collected as close to the event as practically possible.  
v. Exhaled nitric oxide assessment is conducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of 
≥1 hour.  
w. If the patient experiences an exacerbation, an unscheduled visit is to be performed for the 
collection of an additional blood sample for serum total IgE at the time of, or as soon as 
possible after, the exacerbation.  
x. If collection is not completed at rando mization, sample can be taken at a following visit . 
To be collected prior to IMP administration  
y. Blood samples will be collected at selected sites . Only patients who are not on chronic 
systemic corticosteroids  and not on oral antifungal therapy at baseline will be allowed to 
participate in the blood immunophenotyping substudy.  
z. Unscheduled visits may be necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory 
results, for follow -up of AEs, or for any other reason as warranted . If the patient develops 
a respiratory exacerbation, he/she will be required to have an unscheduled visit as soon as 
possible, and a blood sample for serum total IgE needs to be collected.  
9.1.2.  Early Termination Visit

necessary to repeat testing following abnormal laboratory results, for follow -up of AEs, during 
respiratory exacerbation, or for any other reason as warranted.  
9.1.4.  End of Treatment Visit  
After the last patient has completed visit 14/ week 24 of the treatment period or withdrawn from 
the study, all patients still currently in the treatment period (between visit 1 5/week 26 and visit 
27/week 50) should return to the clinic 2 weeks from their last dose/treatment administration to 
complete an EOT visit  consisting of the assessments described in  Table  1. For patients who have 
withdrawn from the study drug but remain in the study, the EOT visit will take place 2 weeks from 
their last visit.  
9.2. Study Procedures  
9.2.1.  Procedures Performed at the Screening/Baseline Visit  
The following procedures will be  performed for the purpose of determining study eligibility or 
characterizing the baseline population: informed consent/assent, medical and surgical history, 
demographics, smoking history, qualifying ACQ -5, pre - and post -bronchodilator spirometry, 
hepatiti s and HIV serology, serum IgG against A fumigatus , serum precipitins to A fumigatus , A 
fumigatus  skin testing, serum pregnancy testing, urine toxicology for drug screening, 
randomization, and tuberculosis testing as guided by country local authorities.  
Eligible patients must meet all  of the  inclusion  criteria  and none of the  exclusion criteria to 
participate in the study .  
9.2.2.  Efficacy Procedures  
9.2.2.1.  Severity of Respiratory Exacerbations  
The number of severe respiratory exacerbations will be recorded by the investigator and defined 
as new onset symptoms or clinical worsening that requires systemic corticosteroid treatment for 
≥3 consecutive days, and, for patients who are on maintenance sy stemic corticosteroids, at least 
double  the dose of maintenance systemic corticosteroids for ≥3 consecutive days plus antibiotic 
therapy if indicated.  
Clinical signs and symptoms of respiratory exacerbation will be captured in the eCRF, including, 
but not limited to, new onset or increase in c ough, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, 
sputum volume, and/or change in sputum appearance, etc.  
Two events will be considered different if the interval between their start dates is ≥ 28 days.  
The reasons  (eg, infections including viral and bacterial, allergen exposure, exercise, and others) 
for the exacerbation events will be collected in eCRF.  
9.2.2.2.  Lung Function  
The following lung function parameters will be measured using spirometry at the clinical site:

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 64 of 99 • FEV 1 (pre - and post -bronchodilator)  
• percent predicted FEV1,   
Spirometry should be performed prior to administration of study drug and in accordance with 
ATS/ERS guidelines (Miller, 2005 ). 
For pre -bronchodilator measured parameters, including FEV1,  
spirometry will be performed after a washout period of bronchodilators according to their action 
duration . Examples of washout periods inclu de withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol 
or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours, withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 
12 hours (ultra -long-acting LABA, such as vilanterol, should be withheld for at least 24 hours), 
withho lding the last dose of ipratropium for at least 8 hours, and withholding the last dose of 
LAMA for at least 24 hours . Withholding times will be verified before performing the 
measurements . Note that when both pre - and post -bronchodilator spirometry are ass essed, the post -
bronchodilator spirometry should be performed 30 minutes after administration of 2 to 4 puffs of 
albuterol or another SABA .  
At all visits, spirometry should be performed in the morning if possible, but if the test can only be 
done at a dif ferent time of the day, the testing should be done at approximately the same time of 
the day at each visit throughout the study.  
A spirometer that meets the ATS/ERS recommendations will be used . The same spirometer and 
standard spirometric techniques, including calibration, will be used to perform spirometry at all 
visits and, whenever possible, the same person should perform the measurements . Three 
measurements fulfilling the ATS acceptability and repeatability criteria should be obtained at 
every visi t, if possible.   
The acceptability criteria must be applied before the repeatability criteria . Unacceptable 
maneuvers must be discarded before applying the repeatability criteria . If a patient fails to provide 
repeatable and/or acceptable maneuvers, an exp lanation should be documented .  
 
 
 
  
Further details on spirometry will be available in a separate operational manual provided to the 
sites. 
9.2.2.3.  Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis -Related Exacer bations  
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis -related exacerbations will be recorded by the 
investigator  and are defined as a severe respiratory exacerbation (as defined in Section  9.2.2.1 ) 
associated with a doubling of serum total IgE value compared to the closest value before the onset 
of the exacerbation . For all respiratory exacerbations, patients will be required to have, a s soon as 
possible, an unscheduled visit at the site for the collection of a blood sample for serum total IgE 
measurement.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 65 of 99 9.2.2.4.  Patient -Reported Outcome Questionnaires  
Health -related quality of life and disease control will be recorded by patients using patien t-reported  
outcome questionnaires . The questionnaires will be completed in an electronic diary during clinic 
visits, prior to spirometry .  
St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)  
This questionnaire will be completed by the patient at the time points specified in Table  1 The 
SGRQ is a 50 -item questionnaire designed to measure and quantify health status in adult patients 
with chronic airflow limitatio n (Nelsen, 2017a ). 
A total score ranges from 0 to 100 . Scores by dimension are calculated for three domains:  
Symptoms, Acti vity, and Impacts (Psychosocial ). Lower score indicates better QoL.  
The first part (Symptoms) evaluates symptomatology, including frequency and severity of cough, 
sputum production, wheeze, breathlessness, and the duration  and frequency of attacks of 
breat hlessness or wheeze.  
The second part has 2 components:  Activity and Impacts . The Activity section addresses 
disturbances to patients’ daily physical activities . The Impacts section covers a range of effects 
that chest troubles may have on patients’ daily  life and psychosocial functions (eg, daily life 
activities and functioning, employment, physical functioning, emotional impact, stigmatization, 
and patients’ perceptions when treated) . The recall period of the questionnaire is over the past 
4 weeks.  
Psychometric testing has demonstrated its repeatability, reliability, and validity . Sensitivity has 
been demonstrated in clinical trials  (Nelsen, 2017b ). A minimum change in score of 4 units was 
established as clinically relevant after patient and clinician testing . The SGRQ has been used in a 
range of disease groups including asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis.   
Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ -5) 
The ACQ -5 questionnaire will be completed by the patient at the time points specified in Table  1. 
The ACQ was designed to measure both the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma 
control, which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  
The ACQ -5 is a short version of ACQ -7. The ACQ -5 score is the mean of the first 5 questions, 
between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) . A higher score indicat es lower asthma 
control . Patients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately controlled asthma and patients with 
scores above 1.0 reflect inadequately controlled asthma . The optimal cut -point score of 1.50 should 
be used to be confident that a patient has i nadequately controlled asthma . On the 7 -point scale of 
the ACQ -5, a change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that can be considered 
clinically important, corresponding to the minimal clinically important difference defined by the 
develop er. 
Systemic Corticosteroid Use for Patients on Chronic Corticosteroids at Baseline  
Systemic corticosteroid use (including reduction or elimination) du ring the study will be 
recorded  for patients on chronic OCS at baseline .

Abnormal Laboratory Values and Laboratory Adverse Events  
All laboratory values must be reviewed by the investigato r or authorized designee.  
Significantly abnormal test results that occur after start of treatment must be repeated to confirm 
the nature and degree of the abnormality . When necessary, appropriate ancillary investigations 
should be initiated . If the abnorma lity fails to resolve or cannot be explained by events or 
conditions unrelated to the study medication or its administration, the medical/study director must

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 69 of 99 9.2.6.  Pharmacodynamic and Exploratory Biomarker Procedures  
In this study, research assessments will be performed to explore how dupilumab may modify the 
mechanism of action underlying the dis ease process in ABPA patients . In particular, the role of 
the IL-4Rα pathway and the effect of dupilumab on FeNO, , and 
total and specific IgE in serum will be explored .  
Biomarker samples will be collected at time points accord ing to Table  1. Pharmacodynamic 
marker/biomarker measurements will be performed to determine effects on biomarkers of ABPA 
or relevant physiological and  pathogenic processes . The biomarkers studied are believed to be 
relevant to the pathophysiology of ABPA, target engagement, mechanism of action of dupilumab, 
and possible toxicities.  
Several biomarkers related to type 2 inflammation will be assessed for t heir value in predicting 
therapeutic response and/or in documenting the time course of drug response:  concentrations of 
FeNO (a marker of airway inflammation), serum total IgE (a product of immunoglobulin class 
switching driven by IL -4), serum A fumigatus -specific IgE,  
 
 
Data analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) and the results will be 
described in the clinical study report (CSR).   
9.2.6.1.  Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide  
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide is a measure of lung inflammation . FeNO will be performed 
according to the timepoints in  Table  1. FeNO will be analyzed using a NIOX instrument 
(Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden), or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s,  and reported in  
parts per billion . This assessment should be conducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of 
at least 1 hour . Further details on the procedure for measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide with 
NIOX will be provided in a separate instruction manual.  
9.2.6.2.  Serum Total IgE  
Patients with ABPA have elevated IgE, and levels are clinically monitored to assess disease 
activity . Changes in total IgE reflect not only on ABPA but atopy in general . Baseline IgE levels 
will be assessed for potential predictive value for treatment response . Post-treatment samples will 
be evaluated for PD effects of study treatment on total IgE.  
Total IgE will be collected according to the time points in Table  1 and measured in serum with a 
quantitative method (eg, Phadia ImmunoCAP) approved for diagnostic testing .  
Detailed instructions for blood sample collection are provided in the study reference manual/site 
binder or file.  
9.2.6.3.  Serum A Fumigatus -Specific IgE  
A fumigatus -specific IgE will be measured in serum from samples collected according to the time 
points in Table  1 and measured in serum using a method (eg, Phadia  ImmunoCAP) approved for 
diagnostic testing .

A subset of study sites may be selected to perform evaluations of circulating cells before and after 
dupilumab treatment. Only patients who are  not on chronic systemic corticosteroids and not on 
oral antifungal therapy at baseline will be allowed to participate in the blood immunophenotyping 
substudy . 
Blood will be collected from patients in the substudy. Circulating immune cells, including 
eosin ophils, will be analyzed to assess changes in frequency, activation status, and  
. Collection for the blood immunophen otyping  substudy will be performed according 
to the Schedule of Events in Table  1. The results of the substudy will not be included in the CSR.  
9.2.7.  Future Biomedical Research (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the future biomedical research substudy will be required  to 
consent to this optional substudy before samples are banked in long -term storage . Additional 
samples for future biomedical research will be collected according to the Schedule of Events in 
Table  1. These unused biomarker samples for study -related research, as well as unused PK and 
ADA samples, will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database lock . The unused 
samples may be utilized for future biomedical research related to the study, as reference samples 
for other studies, or for other research including development and validation of new assays . After 
15 years, any residual samples will be destroyed . The results of th ese future biomedical research 
analyses will not be presented in the CSR.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 71 of 99 9.2.7.1.  Pharmacogenomic Analysis (Optional)  
Patients who agree to participate in the genomics substudy will be required to consent to this 
optional substudy before collection of the samples . Whole blood samples for DNA extraction 
should be collected on day 1/baseline (pre -dose) but can be collected at a later study visit . Whole 
blood samples for RNA extraction will be collected at time points indicated in Table  1. 
DNA and RNA samples will be collected for the pharmacogenomic analyses to understand the 
genetic determinants of efficacy and safety associated with the treatments in this study an d the 
molecular basis of ABPA and related diseases . These samples will be single -coded as defined by 
the ICH guideline E15 . Samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the final date of the database 
lock. If there are specific site or country requireme nts involving the pharmacogenomics analyses 
which the sponsor is unable to comply with, samples will not be collected from patients at the site.   
Research findings from the optional genomic substudy will not be disclosed to the patient or 
principal investi gator, even if they have implications for a patient’s health and management . 
Genetic results from this substudy are for research purposes only and not for medical diagnosis or 
for reproductive decision -making.  
The purpose of the pharmacogenomic analyses is  to identify genomic associations with clinical or 
biomarker response to dupilumab, other ABPA clinical outcome measures, and possible AEs . In 
addition, associations between genomic variants and prognosis or progression of ABPA, as well 
as related allergic /atopic diseases, may also be studied . These data may be used or combined with 
data collected from other studies to identify and validate genomic markers related to the study drug 
or ABPA, asthma, and related diseases.  
Analyses may include sequence determi nation or single nucleotide polymorphism studies of 
candidate genes and surrounding genomic regions . Other methods, including whole -exome 
sequencing, whole -genome sequencing, DNA copy number variation, and transcriptome 
sequencing (or other methods for qua ntitating RNA expression) may also be performed . The list 
of methods may be expanded to include novel methodology that may be developed during the 
course of this study or sample storage period . Results from the genomic analyses will not be 
reported in the CSR.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 99 10. SAFETY EVALUATION AN D REPORTING  
10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data collection 
period (see Section  11.4.5.1 ). Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the 
signing of the ICF will be recorded as part of medical history . Abnormal laboratory values and 
vital signs observed at the time of informed consent should also be recorded as medical history . 
Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of 
a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study d rug should also be 
recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by evaluating the 
patient . Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by the patient or by 
questioning the patient at each study visit . Patients should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms . The investigator must assess all AEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in Se ction  10.2. 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with 
the investigator’s signature . The investig ator should follow up on SAEs (and adverse events of 
special interest [AESIs]) until they have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should 
be followed until they are resolved or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagno sis as the AE or SAE term . When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available . If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE .  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by the 
investigator to determine their clinical significance . Isolated abnormal labor atory results, vital sign 
findings, or other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as 
AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation or  dose reduction,  require 
corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospitalization, the reason for hospitalization must be reported 
as the SAE (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospitalization) . A procedure is not an AE or SAE, 
but the reason for  the procedure may be an AE or SAE . Pre-planned (prior to signing the ICF) 
procedure s, treatment s requiring hospitalization for pre -existing conditions that do not worsen in 
severity, and admission for palliative or social care should not be reported as SAEs (see 
Section  10.2 for Definitions) .  
For deat hs, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE .  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period (end of the follow -up period) that the 
investigator assesses as related to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, SAEs , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section  10.1.3 .

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 73 of 99 10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (seriou s and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the (when applicable:  blinded) study drug . For SAEs and 
AESIs, a detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including it s evaluation, 
treatment, and outcome should be provided on the AE CRF . Specific or estimated dates of event 
onset, treatment, and resolution should be included, when available . Medical history, concomitant 
medications, and laboratory data that are relevant  to the event should also be summarized in the 
narrative . For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed, 
and include the results if available . Information not available at the time of the initial report must 
be do cumented in a follow -up report . Source documents  (including hospital or medical re cords, 
diagnostic reports, etc ) will be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF, and retained at the  
study center and available upon request .  
Urgent safety queries must be  followed up and addressed promptly . Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning 
of the event:  
• SAEs . 
• AESIs ; serious and nonserious :  Adverse events of special interest for this study 
include the following:   
− Anaphylactic reactions  
− Systemic hypersensitivity reactions  
− Helminthic infections  
− Any severe type of conjunctivitis or blepharitis  
− Keratitis  
− Clinically symptomatic eosinophilia (or eosinophilia associated with clinical 
symptoms)  
• Pregnancy:   Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it i s the responsibility of 
the investigator to report to the sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female , during the study or within 12 weeks of the last 
dose of study dr ug. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study patient 
and/or fetus and/or newborn that meets the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE . 
Outcome for all pregnancies should be reported to the sponsor.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 74 of 99 10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any un toward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug . Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which  is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline . Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the inves tigator, the patient is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event . This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
In-patient hospitalization is defined as a hospital admission (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours . Prolongation of existing hospitalization 
is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator 
or treating physician.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) .  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an important medical event . Important medical events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may 
require intervention to prevent one of the other se rious outcomes listed above 
(eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of 
drug dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI (serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical interest specific to the sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the  investigator 
to the sponsor can be appropriate . Such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand it. For a list of AESIs, see Section  10.1.3 .

Clinical Study Protocol  R668 -ABPA -1923 Amendment 4 
 
REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 75 of 99 10.2.4.  Severity  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  
Mild:  Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal functioning level . It 
may be an annoyance . Prescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may 
be given because of personality of the patient.  
Moderate:   Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health . It is 
uncomfortable or an embarrassment . Treatme nt for symptom may be needed.  
Severe:   Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard 
to the patient’s health . Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized.  
If a laboratory value is considered an  AE, its severity should be based on the degree of 
physiological impairment the value indicates.  
Injection Site Reactions  
The severity of injection site reactions will be graded according to the following scale (semi -colon 
indicates “or” within description  of grade ): 
Mild :  Pain that does not interfere with activity; mild discomfort to touch; <5 cm of erythema or 
induration that does not interfere with activity  
Moderate :  Pain that requires repeated use of non -narcotic pain reliever >24 hours or interferes 
with activity; discomfort with movement; 5.1 cm to 10 cm erythema or induration or induration 
that interferes with activity  
Severe :  Pain that requires any use of narcotic pain reliever or that prevents daily activity; 
significant discomfort at rest; >10 c m erythema or induration; prevents daily activity; requires 
emergency room visit or hospitalization; necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis  
10.2.5.  Causality  
The investigator must provide causality assessment as to whether or not there is a reasonable 
possibility that  the drug caused the adverse event, based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical 
judgment, and the following definitions . The causality assessment must  be made based on the 
available information and can be updated as new information becomes available.  
For double -blinded studies using an active comparator, the investigator should consider all study 
drugs in determining event causality .  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship:  time to onset versus time drug  was administered  
• Nature of the reactions:  immediate versus long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about the drug and same class of drugs  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses

• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, if applicable  
• Patient’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug (including study drug administration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical 
state (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, concomitant me dications), or 
other external factors.  
or 
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration, 
and is a known reaction to the drug under study or its class of drugs, or is predicted 
by known pharmacology.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does n ot follow a reasonable sequence from study drug administration, or 
can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
Causality to the study conduct (protocol -specified procedure):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from a protocol -specified 
procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, 
patient’s clinical state (eg, disease  under study, concurrent diseases, and 
concomitant medications), or other external factors.  
• Not Related:  
− The AE does not follow a reasonable sequence from a protocol -specified procedure, 
or can be reasonably explained by the nature of the reaction, patient ’s clinical state 
(eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications) or 
other external factors.  
10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study patient at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this protocol  and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) . Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the sponsor in a timely fashion . The sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites . The medical/study director will have primar y responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by other departments 
(eg, Pharmacovigilance; Risk Management; Biostatistics and Data Management) . Safety 
monitoring will be performed on an ongoing basis (eg, individua l review of SAEs) and on a 
periodic, cumulative aggregate basis.

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 78 of 99 11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study . The SAP will be revised prior to the end 
of the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to 
adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned an alyses . The 
final SAP will be issued before the first database lock.  
Endpoints are listed in Section  4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
Data collected through the implementa tion of new CRFs regarding the impact of the COVID -19 
pandemic on patients will be summarized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). Any additional 
analyses and methods required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 on the efficacy (eg, missing 
data due to  COVID -19) and safety evaluation will be specified in the SAP.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
The primary analyses of the study compare the treatment effect of dupilumab 300 mg Q2W against 
placebo on the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1 . 
The statistical hypotheses to test dupilumab 300 mg Q2W against placebo on having a greater 
increase from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1  at week 24 are as follows:  
• Null hypothesis:  ΔDupilumab  - ΔPbo = 0 
• Alternative hypothesis: ΔDupilumab  - ΔPbo ≠ 0 
where ΔDupilumab  and ΔPbo represent the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1 
at week 24  in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively.  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
The power  calculation for this study is based on a comparison between  dupilumab 300  mg Q2W 
and placebo  with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in 
pre-bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 . Assuming a 1:1 randomization ratio, a standard deviation 
(SD) for the change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 of  in both 
groups, a 2 -sided Type 1 error of 0.05, and a dropout rate of  by week 24, with approximately 
60 randomized patients (~30 patients per group ), the study will have approximately 96% power to 
detect a difference of  in the change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator FEV1 at week 24 
between the dupilumab and placebo groups, based on the 2 -sample t -test.

24. For patients who  discontinue study treatment prior to week 24, any off -study treatment pre -
bronchodilator  FEV1 values collected after the discontinuation of study treatment through week 
24 will be included in the analysis. The MMRM model will include OCS use at screening,  OAF 
use at screening, region, age, sex, height, baseline eosinophil count, treatment, visit, treatment -by-
visit interaction, baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 value, and baseline pre-bronchodilator FEV1 
value -by-visit interaction as covariates . An unstructured  covariance matrix  will be used to model 
the correlations between repeated measurements. Parameters will be estimated using the restricted 
maximum likelihood (REML) method and the Newton -Raphson algorithm. Statistical inference 
for the treatmen t comparison of the absolute change from baseline in pre -bronchodilator  FEV1 at 
week 24 will be derived from the MMRM model using the Kenward Roger method for calculation 
of the denominator degrees of freedom for the tests of the fixed effects.  If the mode l does not 
converge, alternative model specifications (eg, a different covariance structure or reduction in the 
number of covariates) will be applied; details will be provided in the SAP.  
For the primary estimand of interest for the primary endpoint, the i ntercurrent events, strategies, 
and the corresponding missing data handling approaches are provided as below:  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  Intercurrent event(s) handling 
strategies  Missing data handling 
approaches  
Change from baseline in 
pre-bronchodilator  FEV1 at 
week 24   The intercurrent events will be handled 
using  the treatment policy strategy  as 
follows:  
-        Taking rescue medications with 
systemic corticosteroids and/or oral 
antifungal drugs (including an 
increase in dose) for asthma or 
ABPA for any reason: all endpoint 
data collected after use  of rescue 
medication will be used in the 
analysis  
-        Taking prohibited medications: all 
endpoint data will be included in the 
analysis irrespective of use of 
prohibited medications  
-        Discontinu ing the study treatment: all 
endpoint data collected after 
discontinuation will be used in the 
analysis   Two types of missing data:  1) 
Patients discontinu ing from the 
study prior to  the analysis time 
point (week 24) will have missing 
data from  the time of 
discontinuation through week 24 ; 
2) Some intermittently missing 
data are expected because of 
occasionally missing a study visit 
while continuing with the 
randomized treatment  
Missing data handling:  for both 
types of missing data, the primary 
analysis MMRM model assumes 
that missing data are MAR, that is, 
that patients with missing data 
would have efficacy outcomes like 
those in similar patients in their 
treatment group who continue their 
randomized treatment through the 
time point at which data are 
missing

I have read the attached protocol:  “A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, 
Parallel -Group Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Dupilumab in Patients with Allergic 
Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis” and agree to abide by all provisions set forth therein.  
I agree to comply with the current International Council for Harmonisation Guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice and the laws, rules, regulations, and guidelines of the community, country, state, 
or locality relating to the conduct of the clinical study.  
I also agree that persons debarred fr om conducting or working on clinical studies by any court or 
regulatory agency will not be allowed to conduct or work on studies for the sponsor or a partnership 
in which the sponsor is involved . I will immediately disclose it in writing to the sponsor if any 
person who is involved in the study is debarred, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending, or, 
to the best of my knowledge, threatened.  
This document contains confidential information of the sponsor, which must not be disclosed to 
anyone other tha n the recipient study staff and members of the IRB/EC . I agree to ensure that this

REGENERON CONFIDENTIAL  Page 97 of 99 APPENDIX  A. ORAL CORTICOSTEROIDS  (OCS) DOSE REDUCTIO N 
SCHEDULE DURING THE RANDOMIZED TREATMENT  
PERIOD FOR PATIENTS WHO ENTER THE STUDY ON 
OCS  AT BASELINE  
The OCS dose should be down -titrated during this phase following a predetermined schedule that 
is based upon the OCS dose patient was receiving at baseline visit (week 0) . During this period, 
patients will continue taking their background controller medication(s) (ICS +/ - LABA, LTRA, 
LAMA, theophylline, etc) w ithout any changes . The reduction in OCS dose should occur per the 
schedule unless the patient meets defined criteria indicating that it is not acceptable for the patient 
to reduce the dose . A clinical assessment should be completed prior to each dose redu ction . 
Primary reasons for not following the scheduled dose reduction include:  
1. FEV1 >15% reduction from the baseline value  
2. Need for rescue short -acting bronchodilator medication by metered dose inhaler or dry 
powder inhaler use more than 4 puffs/day (or 2 or more nebulized doses/day) above the 
mean baseline value for any 2 consecutive days in the prior week; or 12 puffs or more of a 
short -acting bronchodilator metered dose inhaler or dry powder inhaler (or more than 
6 uses of a nebulizer) on any 1 day in th e prior week  
3. Increase in ACQ -5 score ≥+0.5 from the prior OCS dose assessment visit  
4. Clinically significant respiratory exacerbation  
5. Requiring hospitalization or treatment in the ED/urgent care due to asthma related or 
ABPA -related symptoms  
6. Clinically sign ificant event, based on investigator judgment, that requires treatment by 
OCS dose adjustment  
The investigator will decide, depending on the reason for not reducing the OCS dose per schedule, 
whether to maintain or increase patient’s current OCS dose by 1 step.

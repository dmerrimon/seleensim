Protocol Final Version 1  29 January 2015  
Amendment 4 [9 May  2021 ] 
Overall Rationale for the Amendment change:  The protocol is being amended to 
document the increase in blood volumes drawn at certain visits (Visit 2 and Visit 6)  to 
improve the serum yield which is critical to evaluate the study endpoints. The  allowed  
window s for study visits during special circumstances have also been widened to 
maintain subject visit compliance during the  COVID -19 pandemic . Additionally, 
considering that some of the study interventions are combination products constituted of 
a device and biologic product (pre -filled syringes), the amended protocol provides 
instru ctions for collection of safety information related to the use of medical devices.  The 
reporting period for pregnancies has also been updated in line with the current guidelines.   
The list of main changes in the protocol with rationale is presented in Table 2 and all 
changes made to this amendment ( including correction of typos) are presented in the 
amendment history  (Refer to Section 12.10.1 ).

assessments  
 
 The blood volume collected at Visit 2 
and Visit 6 has been increased from 
25mL to 30 mL . This change has been made to 
increase serum yield which is 
critical to evaluate study endpoints.  
Section 8.9: Study procedures 
during special circumstances  The allowed windows for study visits 
during special circumstances  (Table 17)  
has been changed from +21 days to 
+28 days.  To allow for subject visit 
compliance during the global 
COVID -19 pandemic.

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  19 1. SYNOPSIS  
Rationale:  
In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with the Company  
proposa l to evaluate  meningococcal B vaccine  effec tiveness against a large panel of US 
epidemi ologically  relevant invasive disease strains of N. meningitidi s serogrou p B in 
adolescent s using serum bacter icidal  assay s with endogenou s huma n complement (en c-
hSBA). This panel includes 110 serogroup B strains randomly selected from the original 
panel of 442 endemi c strains identified as appropriately representative of invasive 
meningococcal serogroup B strains detected in the US by  the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC ) [Welsch , 2018] .  
Following licensure of Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV NZ) in the US in 2015 , as required under 
accelerated approval regulations, GSK was requested to demonstrate effectiveness of 
Bexsero  via a post -approval confirmatory trial  in US adolescents and adults . To date, 
there has not been an evaluation c ompleted to assess the  vaccine  effec tivenes s of the 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine against the panel (as described above) of the US 
epidemiologically  relevant invasive disease strains of N. meningitidis serogroup B.  
The investigational MenABCWY combination vaccine is based upon two established 
GSK vaccines, the quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine ( Menveo ) and 
the multi -component recombinant meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ), for which 
significant nonclinical and clinical data have been generated and used to support 
marketing author isations in US, European Union (EU) and several other countries. The 
MenABCWY investigational vaccine  will be reconstituted from the following two 
components before administration:  
• the MenACWY component lyophil ised in vial;  
• the MenB liquid component in prefilled syringe.  
The MenACWY component contains the same antigens in the same amounts as the 
commercial Menveo , in a lyophil ised form. The MenB liquid component is the same 
formulation as the commercial Bexsero . 
The primary purpose of this study is hence  to demonstrate the  vaccine effectiveness using 
enc-hSBA against a panel of 110 randomly selected endemic US N. meningitidis  
serogroup B invasive disease strains, when administered in a 3 -dose (0,2,6 -months) or a 
2-dose (0,6 -months; 0,2 -months) schedule as a meningococcal gr oup B vaccine ( Bexsero ) 
and when administered in a 2 -dose (0,6 -months) schedule as a combined MenABCWY 
vaccine.  
In addition, the other main objectives of this study are:  
• to demonstrate the consistency of immune responses from 3 production lots of the 
MenAC WY component of the MenABCWY vaccine,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of a 2 -dose series of MenABCWY vaccine versus 
a single dose of Menveo  (MenACWY) in terms of immune response to 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y,  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  20 • to demonstrate the non -inferior ity of the effectiveness of the MenABCWY vaccine 
versus Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV NZ ) against a randomly selected panel of endemic 
US N. meningitidis serogroup B invasive disease strains,  
• to assess the safety of all study vaccines administered as per their vaccin ation 
schedule to healthy subjects aged 10 -25 years.  
Objectives and Endpoints:  
Synopsis Table 1 Study objectives and endpoints  
(Amended: 9 May  2021)  
Objectives  Endpoints  
Primary  
Vaccine effectiveness (Test -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  
To demonstrate the effec tiveness of the rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine against a randomly selected panel of endemic  US N. 
meningitidis serogroup B invasive disease strains as 
measured by bacter icidal ac tivity using enc-hSBA at 1 month 
after the 3-dose (0,2,6 -months) and 2-dose ( 0,6-months; 0,2-
months ) vaccination series when c ompared to 1 month after 
the MenACWY vaccination . 
Criterion  
Lower limit (LL) of the two-sided 97.5% confidence interval 
(CI) for vaccine effectiveness is above  65% against a 
randomly selected strain panel between the:  
• MenB_0_2_6 and ACWY groups (for 0,2,6 -months 
schedule)  
• MenB_0_6 and ACWY groups (for 0,6 -months schedule),  
• MenB_0_2_6 and ACWY groups (for 0,2 -months 
schedule)  The percentages of samples without bactericidal 
serum activity using enc -hSBA against each of 
the endemic US N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
strains, at 1 month after the:  
• 3-dose vaccination series in MenB_0_2_6 
group (Day 211, Month 7)  
• 2-dose vaccination series in MenB_0_6 
group (Day 211, Month 7), and  
• 2-dose vaccination series in MenB_0_2_6 
group (Da y 91, Month 3)  
• 1 month after the MenACWY vaccination in 
ACWY group (Day 31, Month 1).  
Effectiveness (Responder -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine by assessing the percentages of subjects whose sera 
kill ≥70% of strains tested using enc -hSBA at 1 month after 
the 3 -dose (0,2,6 -months) and 2 -dose (0,6 -months; 0,2 -
months) vaccination series of the rMenB+OMV NZ.  
Criterion : 
LL of the two-sided 97.5% CI for the percentages of subjects 
whose sera kill ≥70% of strains is above  65%, tested for:  
• MenB_0_2_6 group (for 0,2,6 -months schedule)  
• MenB_0_6 group (for 0,6 -months schedule),  
• MenB_0_2_6 group (for 0,2 -months schedule)  The percentages of subjects whose sera kill 
≥70% of the strains tested using enc -hSBA, at 1 
month after the:  
• 3-dose vaccination series (Day 211, Month 7 
in MenB_0_2_6 group)  
• 2-dose vaccination series (Day 211, Month 7 
in MenB_0_6 group),  
• 2-dose vaccination series (Day 91, Month 3 
in MenB_0_2_6 group)  
The 3 vaccine schedules will be tested for both,  test-based and responder -based, in a hierarchical way (starting 
from 0 -2-6, to 0 -6 and 0 -2). Refer to Section 10.1 for details on continuing the eval uation . 
Lot-to-lot consistency: MenABCWY vaccine  
To demonstrate lot -to-lot consistency of the immune 
responses of 3 lots of the MenACWY component of the 
MenABCWY vaccine, as measured by hSBA GMTs directed GMTs directed against serogroups A, C, W and Y  
for each lot (ABCWY -1 group, ABCWY -2 group, 
ABCWY -3 group) at 1 month after the last 
vaccination (Day 211, Month 7)  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

3. INTRODUCTION  
3.1. Study r ationale  
In 2013, the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with the 
Company  proposa l to evaluate meningococcal B  vaccine  effec tiveness against a large 
panel of the US epidemi ologically  relevant invasive disease strains of Neisseria 
meningitidis  (N. meningitidis ) serogroup B in adolescents using serum bactericidal assay 
with endogenous human complement (enc -hSBA). This panel  includes 110 serogroup  B 
strains selected from the original panel of 442 endemic strains identified as appropriately 
representative of invasive meningococcal serogroup B strains detected in the US by the 
US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [Welsch , 2018].  Following licensure of Bexsero  
(rMenB+OMV NZ) in the US in 2015, under accelerated approval regulations, GSK was 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  35 requested to demonstrate effectiveness of Bexsero  via a post -approval confirmatory trial  
in US adolescents and young adults . 
The first effec tiveness study with GSK’s MenB-containing vaccine (inves tigational 
MenABCWY vaccine; V102_16) was ini tiated in 2014 and showed a vaccine 
effec tiveness (test-based) of 67% after 2 doses  against the panel of strains described 
above, as measured by serum bacter icidal ac tivity at 1:4 dilu tion one month post -
vaccination [ Welsch , 2018] . The V102_16E1 extension study showed a vaccine 
effectiveness of  71% after 3 doses . To date there has not been an evaluation to assess the  
vaccine  effec tivenes s of the rMenB+OMV NZ vacc ine (Bexsero ) against this same  panel 
of the US epidemiologically  relevant invasive disease strains of N. meningitidis 
serogroup B.   
GSK  investigational MenABCWY vaccine intended to protect against 5 of the most 
prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans. This combination  
vaccine is based upon two established GSK vaccines, the quadrivalent meningococcal 
ACWY conjugate vaccine ( Menveo ) and the multi -component recombinant 
meningococcal B vaccine ( Bexsero ), for which significant non clinical and clinical data 
have been generated and used to support marketing author isations in US, European 
Union (EU) and several other countries. The MenABCWY investigational vaccine will 
be reconstituted from the following two components before administ ration:  
• the MenACWY component lyophil ised in vial;  
• the MenB liquid component in prefilled syringe.  
The MenACWY component contains the same antigens in the same amounts as the 
commercial Menveo , in a lyophil ised form. The MenB liquid component is the same 
formulation as the commercial Bexsero . 
The primary purpose of this study is to hence  demonstrate the vaccine effectiveness using 
enc-hSBA against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
invasive disease strains, when administered  in a 3 -dose (0,2,6 -months) or a 2 -dose (0,6 -
months; 0,2 -months) schedule as a meningococcal group B vaccine ( Bexsero ) and when 
administered in a 2 -dose (0,6 -months) schedule as a combined MenABCWY vaccine.  
In addition, the other main objectives of this st udy are:  
• to demonstrate the consistency of immune responses from 3 production lots of the 
MenACWY component of the MenABCWY vaccine,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of a 2 -dose series of MenABCWY vaccine versus 
a single dose of Menveo  (MenACWY) in term s of immune response to 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y,  
• to demonstrate the non -inferiority of the effectiveness of the MenABCWY vaccine 
versus Bexsero  (rMenB+OMV ) against a randomly selected panel of endemic US N. 
meningitidis  serogroup B invasive disease strains,  
• to assess the safety of all study vaccines administered as per their vaccination 
schedule to healthy subjects aged 10 -25 years.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  36 3.2. Background  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
N. meningitidis  is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide, capable 
of causing outbreaks and epidemics of invasive disease. N. meningitidi s infec tions 
causing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are an important public health concern 
worldwide due t o the substantial morbidi ty and mortality they cause , as well as the 
transmissibili ty of these infec tions. In healthy individuals, IMD can rapidly progress to 
serious clinical disease and may be associated with poor outco mes, including  fatali ty in 
~10% of cases. While the greatest IMD burden is in infants, there is a second peak of 
disease in adolescents and young adults. 
IMD  occurs when the normally asymptomatically carried encapsulated  gram-negative 
bacterium N. meningitidi s enters  the bloodstream,  multiplies and causes sepsis. Once the 
blood -brain  barrier  is compromised, development of acute bacterial meningi tis represents 
a neurological emergency and necessitates immediate diagnosis and treat ment 
[Heckenberg , 2014 ]. Although IMD occurs worldwide, incidence varies in different 
geographic regions, with the highest disease burden observed in lo w-income countries . 
Reliable estimates of the global bu rden of disease are currently not available, as case 
defini tions differ and surveillance data from many regions are inc omplete [Gossger , 
2012 ]. The overall incidence of IMD in European countries ranges fr om approximately  
0.1 to 2.4  cases per 100  000 popula tions [ECDC , 2016 ]. In the US, incidence was 0.1 
cases per 100  000 population [ CDC , 2018].  
Ninety percent  of menin gococcal mening itis and  septicaemia  are caused by only  five N. 
meningitidis  serogroups : A, B, C, W and Y.  The distribu tion of serogroup s varies 
geographically  and over time. While the disease  burden  of IMD  in highe r-income 
regions, such as Europe and Australia,  is largely attributable to serogroup  B, in the 
‘meningi tis belt’ of su b-Saharan Africa, IMD is predominan tly caused by serogroups A 
and W. In the US, serogroups B, C and Y account for most IMD .  
The best option for the control of meningococcal disease is the use of effective vaccines 
that would include all five of the most common serogroups responsible for invasive 
disease.  
GSK’s  Meningococcal Groups A, C, Y and W-135 Conjugate Vaccine ( Menveo ) is a 
meningococcal oligosaccharide conjugate vaccine licensed for active immun isation to 
prevent IMD caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W -135, and Y . It contains a 
nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin ( Corynebacterium diphtheriae  Cross Reacting 
Materia l-197, CR M197) as the carrier protein  and has been demonstrated to be  highly  
immunogenic against serogroups ACWY and is well tolerated in all age groups. It has 
been licensed in more than 60 countries ; many of these countries have also approved its 
use in children. In the EU, the vaccine is indicated for use in individuals 2 years of age 
and older, and in the US, in individuals 2 months to 55 years of age.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  37 In contrast to the meningococcal serogroups A, C, W and Y, the capsular polysaccharide 
of serogroup B is poorly  immunogenic  in humans, pos sibly  due to antigenic similari ties 
in serogroup B carboh ydrate moieties  to carboh ydrate s widely expressed on various 
human cell types. As a result, research has focused on proteins in the outer membrane of 
meningococc i with potent ial for broad protection against serogroup B  as potential  
antigens for candidate vaccines.  
The Meningo coccal Group B Vaccine ( Bexsero , rMenB+OMV NZ) contains three 
recombinant proteins [ factor H binding protein ( fHbp ), Neisseria adhesin A  (NadA ), and 
Neisseria l Heparin Binding Antigen ( NHBA )], combine d with Outer Membrane Vesicles  
(OMV ) components from the New Zealand outbreak strain NZ98/254. rMenB+OMV NZ 
is immunogenic against the majori ty of circula ting meningococca l serogroup B strains 
and has acceptable reactogenici ty and safety profiles when administered to individuals 
across age groups.   
In January  2013 European marke ting authorisation had been granted for Bexsero  for use 
in individuals over 2 months of age. In January  2015, based on accelerated approval 
regulations, FDA licensed  Bexsero  for active immun isation to prevent invasive disease 
caused by N. meningitidis  serogroup B in adolescents and young adults 10 through 25 
years of age. The vaccine is currently approved in 42 countries worldwide.   
Bexsero  is indicated for active immun isation against invasive disease caused by N. 
meningitidis  serogroup B. Although the meningococcal group B vaccine was developed 
for individuals aged 2 mont hs and older, the actual age range for which this 
recommendation extends varies depending on the approval from different health 
authorities.  
With evidence of meningococcal epidemiology changing over time and across 
geographies [ Cohn , 2015; Halperin , 2012 ; Harrison , 2009 ], a vaccine with the broadest 
possible coverage is an important step toward a definitive and global solution for 
meningococcal disease prevention.  
GSK is currently developing a combinatio n vaccine intended to protect against five of the 
most prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans. The availability 
of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would reduce the 
number of injections and could inc rease coverage for meningococcal disease caused by 
N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide.

clinical and clinical studies of Bexsero , Menveo  and MenABCWY vaccine .

Investigational vaccine: rMenB+OMV NZ ( Bexsero ) 
Important potential risk: Guillain -Barre Syndrome 
(GBS)  GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No cases 
have been identified in the Bexsero  clinical development 
program . The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology  that might occur is mentioned in the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF). GBS will b e monitored through the 
potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMD) and SAE  
collection  
(See Section 12.5.6.2 ) 
Important potential risk: Acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis (ADEM)  ADEM has been observed with other vaccines. No cases 
have been reported during the Bexsero  clinical 
development program .  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology  that can occur is mentioned in the  ICF. ADEM 
will be monitored through the pIMD and SAE collection.  
(See Section 12.5.6.2 ) 
Important potential risk: Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic 
shock  No cases of anaphylaxis to be related to Bexsero  have 
been reported in the Bexsero  clinical development 
program. However, one case of anaphylaxis within 30 
minutes following vaccination was reported in a third party 
expanded access program (V72_70TP).  
Allergic reaction (including anaphylactic reaction) is listed 
in the Bexsero  US PI.  Anaphylaxis following the administration of Bexsero  
constitutes a contraindication (see section 7.7). Subjects 
will be observed closely for at least 30 minutes following 
the administration of the vaccines, with appropriate 
medical treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis 
(see Sect ion 8.2). 
Hypersensitivity, including allergy , to any component of 
vaccines, are exclusion criteria in this study (see Section  
6.2). 
Important potential risk:  
Arthritis  This potential risk is based on a signal observed for 
Bexsero . Attenuated live virus vaccines (rubella) were 
reported to be associated with joint -related diseases 
[Tingle , 1986]. Among inactivated vaccines, different 
manifestations of arthritis following hepatitis B vaccination 
(psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, etc.) were described 
[IOM, 2011]; however no association with meningococcal 
vaccines has been reported in the literature. O ne clinical 
case of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) possibly related to 
rMenB+OMV NZ has been observed.  Arthritis will be monitored through the AESI collection  
(See Section 12.5.6.1 ). 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

shock  Anaphylaxis and anaphylactic shock have been observed 
with other vaccines. No serious cases of anaphylaxis 
related to MenABCWY have been reported in the 
MenABCWY clinical development program. Allergic 
reaction (including anaphylactic reaction) is reported in the 
MenABCWY IB section “Warning and Precaution".  Anaphylaxis following the administration o f MenABCWY 
constitutes an absolute contraindication to subsequent 
vaccination (see Section  7.7. The subjects  will be 
observed closely for at least 3 0 minutes following the 
administration of the vaccines, with appropriate medical 
treatment readily available in case of anaphylaxis .  
Hypersensitivity, including allergy, to any component of 
vaccines, are exclusion criteria in this study (see Section 
6.2). 
MenACWY vaccine (Menveo)  
Important Identified risk:  
Reconstitution errors  Cases describing medication errors due to administration 
of the MenCWY conjugate liquid component only without 
reconstitution with the MenA conjugate lyophil ised 
component, or due to administration of the MenA 
conjugate lyophil ised component only after reconstitution 
with a different solvent, have been reported during the 
MenACWY clinical development program.  In Se ction 7.1. of the protocol ( “Treatment administered ”) 
it is clarified that the 2 vaccine components have to be 
reconstituted before vaccine injecti on. 
Important potential risk:  
GBS  GBS has been observed with other vaccines. No serious 
cases have been reported during the MenACWY clinical 
development program.  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology  that might occur is mentioned in the ICF. GBS 
will be monitored through the pIMD and SAE collection  
(See Section 12.5.6.2 ) 
Important potential risk:  
ADEM  ADEM has been observed with other vaccines. Two 
serious cases from clinical trials were retrieved from the 
GSK’s global safety database for MenACWY. None of 
them has provided sufficient evidence of a causal 
association between ADEM and MenACWY.  The potential risk of events of possible autoimmune 
aetiology  that can occur is mentioned in the ICF. ADEM 
will be monitored through the pIMD and SAE collection.  
(See Sect ion 12.5.6.2 ) 
Important potential risk:  
Thrombocytopenia  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura has been reported in 
association with several licensed vaccine s. One serious 
case has been reported during the MenACWY clinical 
development program. This case didn’t provide sufficient 
evidence of a causal association between 
thrombocytopenia and MenACWY vaccine.  Immune thrombocytopenic purpura  will be monitored 
through SAE collection (See Section 12.5.6.2 ). 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  40 Important /Potential/Identified /Risk of Clinical 
Significance  Sum mary of Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
Important potential risk:  
Facial paresis  Facial paresis was recogn ised as an importa nt potential 
risk following the results of a sponsored observational 
study (V59_34OB) which found an imbalance of cases of 
facial paresis following vaccination with MenACWY, 
mainly when administered concomitantly with other 
vaccines. No cases of facial par esis were reported from 
interventional clinical trials.  Paralysis of the face is mentioned in the list of side effects 
in the ICF. Facial paresis will be monitored through SAE 
collection (See Section 12.5.6.2 ) 
Important potential risk:  
Vaccination failure (lack of efficacy)  It is known that a protective immune response may not be 
generated in every recipient. The number of reports 
suggestive of vaccination failure reported cumulatively 
does not suggest a significantly or unexpectedly high rate 
of vaccine failure.  No specific  risk mitigation in place in this study.  
Study Procedures  
Risk of blood sampling  Blood sampling is associated with a risk of syncope, 
dizziness, local reactions and infection after or during 
venepuncture . Blood samples will be obtained by a trained professional 
and medical assistance will be available. The potential risk 
of feeling faint, experiencing mild local pain, bruising, 
irritation or redness at the site where blood was taken, is 
mentioned in the ICF . Appropriate medical treatment will 
be readily available.

• Contributing to the process of developing new therapies.   
3.3.3.  Overall Benefit: Risk conclusion  
Considering the measures taken to minimise risk to subjects participating in this study, 
the potential or identified risks in association with rMenB+OMV NZ, MenABCWY and 
MenACWY  are justified by the potential benefits (prevention/treatment) that may be 
afforded to subject(s) receiving rMenB+OMV NZ and MenACWY or MenABCWY .

5. STUDY D ESIGN  
5.1. Scientific rationale for study design  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
As the rMenB+OMV NZ licensure  in the US was issued through accelerated approval, 
the FDA has requested to demonstrate the effectiveness of the vaccine against an 
extended panel of serogroup B meningococcal strains (MenB)  as a post -marketing 
commitment  in US adolescents and young adults , thus confirming that the vaccine can 
protect against diverse meningococcal B strains prevalent in the US. 
The availability of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would 
however reduce the numbe r of injections and could increase coverage for meningococcal 
disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide. GSK’s 
investigational MenABCWY  combination vaccine is intended to protect against 5 of the 
most prevalent serogroups of N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans.  
Hence, along with the licensed MenB vaccine ( Bexsero ), this Phase III study will also 
assess the safety, effectiveness, and immunogenicity of the investigational MenABCWY 
vaccine.  
Rationale for effectiveness  assessment  
As mentioned above, o ne of the primary purposes of this study is to evaluate the 
effectiveness of 2 or 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ and of 2 doses of the MenABCWY 
vaccines in healthy adolescents and young adults by measuring the bactericidal activit y 
against 110 endemic US N. meningitidis  serogroup B strains using an endogenous 
complement human Serum Bactericidal Assay (enc -hSBA), when compared to a control.  
Sera from the ACWY group receiving the MenACWY vaccine will also be tested against 
serogroup B meningococcal strains by enc -hSBA as a control  for test -based effectiveness  
assessment . The overall vaccine effectiveness ( VE) against all 110 strains combined will 
be computed by means of a general ised linear model. For additional details see statistica l 
analysis section (Section 10). 
Rationale for lot-to-lot consistency  assessment  
MenABCWY is a reconstituted vaccine with the lyophilised ‘ACWY component’ and 
liquid  rMenB+OMV NZ. The MenB component has the same formulation as the 
commercial Bexsero . To demonstrate that the lots of the investigational MenABCWY 
vaccine are adequately representative of the formulation intended for marketing, 
equival ence will be assessed for 3 different lots of the ACWY component of the 
ABCWY vaccine.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  48 Rationale for non-inferiority assessment of MenABCWY vs MenACWY and 
rMenB+OMV NZ  
The study aims to also demonstrate that the  investigational combination MenABCWY 
vaccine  is not inferior to a licensed MenACWY vaccine (Menveo ) and a licensed MenB 
vaccine (Bexsero ) which are part of  the current standards of care in the US for prevention 
of invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, C, W, Y  and by 
N. meningitidis  serogroup B , respectively . 
Rationale for blood volume collected:  
In order to provide the necessary serum volume  for the bactericidal assays (enc -hSBA 
and/ or hSBA(s))  and ELISA (or equivalent ), approximately  30 mL whole blood will be 
collected at Visit 2 and Visit 6 and approximately 25 mL whole blood will be collected 
at Visit 4 . At pre-vaccination (Visit 1), 20 mL whole blood will be collected to provide 
the necessary serum volume for th e hSBA , and ELISA (or equivalent ).  
Blood samples are taken from all subjects irrespective of the testing status in order to 
maintain the study blind. Refer to Section 8.4.2.1  for furthe r details.  
Rationale for the selected vaccination schedules  
rMenB+OMV NZ: Th is study aims to demonstra te the VE of the rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccine administered as 2 -dose vaccine, either with a shorter interval (0,2 -months) or a 
prolonged interval (0,6 -months) between doses. A 3-dose schedule has also been  added to 
better characterize the VE  with an alternative dose  regimen as a post approval 
requirement from the US FDA . 
Note: The rMenB+OMV NZ  in the ACWY group is administered in a 0,1 -months 
schedule. This interval is within the recommendations in the summary of product 
characteristics of Bexsero  and helps in mainta ining the blind. No objectives are 
associated with this schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ . 
MenABCWY: A number of different vaccine formulations were evaluated in 
MenABCWY Phase I and II clinical studies. The formulation with the same active 
ingredient composition a s the rMenB+OMV NZ ( Bexsero ) and MenACWY ( Menveo ) 
vaccines was chosen as the final formulation of the investigational MenABCWY vaccine.  
Two doses administered 6 months apart (0,6 -months) is considered the optimal dosing 
schedule, based on serogroup B immunogenicity results from MenABCWY Phase II 
clinical studies.  
MenACWY: As a comparator for serogroup A, C, W, and Y vaccine effectiveness and 
immune responses, a single dose of MenACWY vaccine is administered to subjects in the 
ACWY group. To conform wit h the standard of care  (also in alignment with current 
ACIP routine immun isation recommendations in US) , subjects in the MenB_0_2_6 and 
MenB_0_6 groups will also receive a dose of MenACWY at Day 211 and Day 61, 
respectively . 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  49 5.1.1.  Rationale for the use of placeb o 
For this study, a placebo (saline solution) will be administered as presented in  Figure 1. A 
placebo is the only available option to minimize possible introduction of reporting bias in 
collecting information about AEs and to ensure the same number of vaccinations are 
administered t o subjects assigned to either of the six study groups.

9 May 2021  50 • Type of study:  self-contained  
• Experimental design: This is a  phase III, randomised, controlled, observe r-blind , 
multi-centre  study  to evaluate effec tivenes s, immunogenicity  and safet y of 
rMenB+OMV NZ  and MenABCWY vaccine s. A total of 3651  healthy adolescent s 
and young adults aged 10-25 years will be enrolled  and randomised (5:5:3:3:3:1  
ratio) to one of the six parallel study  group s:  
− MenB_0_2_6 group : subjects will receive 3 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 
1, Day 61 and Day 181 ( 0,2,6-months  schedule).  These subjects will receive 1 
dose of the MenACWY vaccine at Day 211 *. Data from this group will be used 
to assess both the 0,2 -months and 0,2,6 -months schedules; the 0,2 -months 
schedule will be assessed 1 month after the second rMenB+OMV NZ 
vaccination administered at Day 61 (Visit 3), and the 0,2,6 -months schedule will 
be assessed 1 month after the third rMenB+OMV NZ vaccination at Day 181 
(Visit 5), in the same group . 
− MenB_0_6 group : subjects will receive 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 1  
and Day 181 and 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 61 ( rMenB+OMV NZ , 
0,6-months schedule).  These subjects will receive 1 dose of placebo at Day 
211*. 
− ABCWY -1**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 1 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *.  
− ABCWY -2**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 wit h Lot 2 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *. 
− ABCWY -3**: subjects will receive 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine 6 months 
apart (0,6 -months schedule ), at Day 1 and 181 with Lot 3 of the MenACWY 
lyophilised vial component of the vaccine. They will receive 1 dose of placebo 
at Day 61 and at Day 211 *. 
− ACWY  group : subjects will receive 1 dose of MenACWY vaccine at Day 1, 1 
dose of placebo at Day 61 and 2 doses of rMenB+OMV NZ  at Day 18 1 and Day 
211*. 
* In order to let the subjects in MenB_0_2_6 group receive a dose of MenACWY 
vaccine and for subjects in ACWY group to receive the second dose of rMenB+OMV 
NZ in line with the vaccine as standard of care  (also in line with the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations in the US [ ACIP , 
2011]) , the subjects in these groups will receive a  vaccination of MenACWY and 
rMenB+OMV NZ  vaccines, respectively, on Day 211 (Visit 6) after completion of the 
post-vaccination 3 blood sampling. To maintain the blinding of the study, subjects in 
the rest of the groups (MenB_0_6, ABCWY -1, ABCWY -2 and ABCWY -3) will 
receive a dose of Placebo. All these vaccines/ product s administered at Day 211 are 
not associated with any study objectives/ endpoints ( safety assessment conducted 
after 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in the ACWY group at Day 181 is to maintain the 
blind  of the study).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  57 6.3. Criteria for temporary  delay for enrolment and vaccination  
and/or blood sampling  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
Enrolment/ v accination / blood sampling  may be postponed within the allowed time 
interval until transient circumstances cited below have been resolved:  
• Acute disease and/or fever at the time of vaccinat ion. 
− Fever is defined as body temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F). The preferred location 
for measuring temperature in this study will be the oral route . 
− Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory 
infection) without fever can be administered all vaccines.  
• Signific ant acute illness within the previous 7 days.  
• Receipt of systemic an tibiotics within 3 days prior to blood sampling visit  (Visit 1, 
Visit 2, Visit  4 and Visit 6) (this will defer the blood draw) . 
• A positive test for current infection with COVID -19. The testing should have been 
done using a molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen test) approved 
by the country regulatory authorities.  
• Subjects with known COVID -19 positive contacts in the  past 14 days .  
• Individuals who have received any other vaccines within 7 days (for inactivated 
vaccines) or 14 days (for live vaccines) prior to and following  each vaccination up to 
Visit 5*. 
*In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public  health threat (e.g.: 
a pandemic) is organ ised by the public health authorities, outside the routine 
immun isation program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary 
for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to the local governmental 
recommendations and that the Sponsor is  notified accordingly . 
In case of seasonal influenza vaccination, the time period described above can be 
reduced if necessary for that vaccine provided it is licensed and used according to its 
Prescribing  Information and according to the local governmental recommendations . 
Under such circumstances, a subject may  be considered eli gible for study  enrolment and 
vaccination and/or blood sampling  after the appropriate window for delay has passed and 
inclusion/exclusi on criteria have been re-checked, and if the subject is confirmed to be 
eligible.  
6.4. Screen and baseline failures  
In the event that the individual is determined ineligible for study participation, he/she is 
considered a screen failure. Screen  failures are subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn 
from the study following informed consent, but before random isation to study treatment.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  61 The inves tigator or designee will be responsible for oversight of the administration of 
vaccine to subjects enr olled in the study  according to the procedures stipulated in this 
study protoco l. All vaccines will be administered only  by unblinded  personnel who are 
qualified to perform that func tion under applicable local laws and regula tions for the 
specific study  site. 
Detailed vaccine prepara tion and administration instructions will be provided to 
investigators in t he SPM  prior to study start.  The exact anatomic loca tion of each 
injec tion must be carefully recorded in the Medical Chart and in the eCRF.  
After  comple ting the pr e-vaccina tion procedures  on Day 1, Day 61, Day 181  and Day 
211, administer the vaccine to the  subject.  Observe the blinding procedures described in  
Section 7.3. 
7.1.1.  Precautions to be observed in administering study vaccine  
Prior to each vaccinat ion, subjects must be determined to be eligible for study vaccination 
and it must be clinically appropriate in the judgment of the investigator to vaccinate. 
Eligibility for vaccination prior to each study vaccine administration is determined by 
evaluating  the entry criteria outlined in protocol sections 6.1, Inclusion Criteria and 6.2, 
Exclusion Criteria and Section 7.7 regarding the contraindications to subsequent 
vaccination . 
If the investigator or delegate determines that the subject’s health on the day of 
administration temporarily precludes vaccine(s)/p roduct(s) administration  (Refer to 
Section 6.3), the visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this visit (refer 
to Table 5). 
The subjects will be observed closely for at least 30 minutes following the administration 
of the vaccine(s)/product(s), with appropriate medical treatment read ily available in case 
of anaphylaxis and /or syncope.  
7.1.2.  Vaccine Administration Error or Overdose of Vaccine  
Vaccine administration error is defined as receiving a dose of study  vaccine that was not 
reconstituted as instructed or administered by a different route from the intended route of 
administration. An overdose of study  vaccine (whether accidental or inten tional) is 
defined when a dosage higher than the recommended dosage is administered in one dose 
of study vaccine  rMenB+OMV NZ , MenABCWY  and/or MenACW Y. 
An overdose would also occur if two doses of the study  vaccine are administered within  2 
week s of the recommended interval between doses.  
Any vaccine administration error or overdose of study  vaccine detailed in this protocol 
must be reported as an adverse event, and if the vaccine administration error or overdose 
is associated with a serious adverse event, it must be reported as such within 24 hours to 
the Sponsor.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  62 7.2. Method of t reatment assignment  
There are 2 random isation processes for each subject in the stud y. 
• Random isation to 1 of the 6 treatment groups  (5:5:3:3:3:1 ratio) . Refer to Section 
7.2.2 . 
• Random isation to strains for enc -hSBA testing (will be performed by the 
random isation officer and a treatment blinded listing will be provided to GSK 
Laboratory  or laboratory designated by GSK to schedule the enc -hSBA testing)  
(Refer Section  7.2.3 ) 
7.2.1.  Subject identification  
Subject identification numbers will be assigned sequentially to the subjects who have 
consented to participate in  the study, according to the range of subject identification 
numbers allocated to each study centre . The Subject ID will be documented in the 
Screening and Enrolment log.  
The eligibility of the subject will be determined based on the inclusion and exclusio n 
criteria listed in Section 6 and evaluated during this screening procedure. The Subject ID 
will be the subject’s unique identification number for all eCRFs and associated study 
documentation that will be used for duration of the study . 
7.2.2.  Random isation of treatment  
7.2.2.1.  Random isation of supplies  
The random isation of supplies within blocks will be performed at GSK, using MATerial 
Excellence ( MatEx ), a program developed for use in SAS (Cary, NC, USA) by GSK. 
Entire blocks will be shi pped to the study centres/warehouse(s).  
To allow GSK to take advantage of greater rates of recruitment in this multi -centre study 
and to thus reduce the overall study recruitment period, an over -random isation of 
supplies will be prepared.  
7.2.2.2.  Treatment alloca tion to the subject  
The treatment numbers will be allocated by component.  
7.2.2.2.1.  Study group and treatment number allocation  
The target will be to enrol a total of 3651 eligible subjects who will be randomly assigned 
to 6 study groups in a 5:5:3:3:3:1 ratio (912 each in MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 groups, 
548 in each ABCWY group and 183 in ACWY group ). 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  63 Allocation of the subject to a study group/a treatment number at the investigator site will 
be performed using a random isation system on internet (SBIR). The random isation 
algorithm will use a minim isation procedure accounting for study, region  (US and ex-US 
countries) , previous MenACWY vaccination  (primed) ? (Yes and No )*, and age category 
(10-17 years of age and 18 -25 years of age) . Minim isation factors will have equal  weight 
in the minimisation algorithm . 
To ensure adequate representation in the US in line with the post -marketing commitment  
(Section 3.1), a minimum of 30% of adolescents and young adults will be enrolled in the 
US. 
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/subject’s parent/LAR and 
having checked the eligibi lity of the subject, blinded site staff will access SBIR. Upon 
providing the subject identification number, the subject ’s age category and previous 
MenACWY vaccination ? (Yes/ No)*, the random isation system will determine the study 
group and will provide the treatment number to be used  for each dose.  The number of 
each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
When SBIR is not available, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions . 
If for any reason, after random isation the subject fails to undergo treatment, this is an 
early Termina tion and the reason should be recorded in source document as specified in 
the SDA.  
Note that enrolment will be frozen as soon as the target number s (Table 7) are reached. 
Refer to the SPM for further details.  
Note: * Subjects with and without a previous MenACWY vaccination (primed and 
unprimed) . 
7.2.2.2.2.  Treatment number allocation for subsequent doses  
For each dose subsequent to the first dose, the study staff in charge of the vaccine/product 
administration will access SBIR, provide the subject identification number, and the 
system will provide a treatment number consistent with the allocated study group.  
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
7.2.3.  Allocation of subjects to assay subsets  
Analysis of effectiveness and immunogenicity en dpoints will be performed on different 
sub-sets of subjects , independent of allocation by study group. Refer to Section 10 for 
details. Blood sample s will be collected from all subjects participating in the study.   205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  64 7.2.3.1.  Random isation to strains for enc -hSBA testing  
The evaluation of the randomly selected panel of invasive serogroup B strains (110 
strains) for each vaccinated subject is not technically feasible with clinically acceptable 
blood volumes drawn  from adolescent s and young adults. For each applicable serum 
sample , 35 strains will be chosen completely at random  from the 110 strains.  
• The target  number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains.  
• The serum sample  collected from each subject will be sent on an ongoing basis to 
GSK Clinical Laboratory Sciences or to laboratories  delegated by GSK  where the 
assays are available and qualified for the intended use . Aliquots for immunogenicity 
and enc-hSBA testing will be prepared depending on the serum volume available for 
a visit from one subject. A minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be available 
to confirm eligibility to perform enc-hSBA testing.  Additional instruction on  the 
number of strains to be randomly assigned for enc -hSBA testing, according to the 
actual sample volume of serum provided to the laboratory , is provided in Section 
10.1.2 . 
7.3. Blinding  and unblinding  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By observer -blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study, the vaccine(s)/product(s) recipient and those responsible 
for the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity, and effectiveness ) 
will all be unaware of which vaccine/product was administered. To do so, 
vaccine/product preparation and administration will be done by  qualified healthcare 
professional  who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation.  A minimu m 
number of study site personnel  respon sible for preparing and / or delivering the injec tions 
will be unblinded. See Glossary of terms  for definition of qualified healthcare 
professional  and unblinded study staff.  Site personnel responsible for delivering the 
injection must not be involved in study assessments. The study v accine/placebo will be 
provided to the site as subjects’ kits, similar in appearance, identified with treatment 
information (either Meningococcal Group B Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups A, B , C, 
W and Y Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups A, C, Y and W  Conjuga te Vaccine or 
placebo).  Refer to SPM for details . 
The laboratory in charge of the laboratory  testing will be blinded to the treatment , and 
codes will be used to link the subject  and study (without any link to the treatment  
attributed to the subject ) to each sample.   
The serological data, which could lead to the unblinding of the study groups, will not be 
available during the course of the study to any investigator or any person involved in the 
clinical conduct of the study  or analysis . 
7.3.1.  Emergency unblindi ng 
Unblinding of a subject’s individual treatment code should occur only in the case of a 
medical emergency when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the clinical 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

The emergency unblinding process consists of the  automated Internet -based system 
(SBIR) that allows the investigator to have unrestricted, immediate and direct access to 
the subject’s individual study treatment.  
As back -up process, the investigator has the option of contacting a GSK Helpdesk (refer 
to Table 10) if he/she needs support to perform the unblinding (i.e. he/she cannot access 
the automated Internet -based system).  
Non-investigator physician (e.g. physician from emergency room) or subject/care 
giver/family member can also request emergency unblinding either via the investigator 
(preferred option) or via the GSK Helpdesk (back -up process). Contact details of 
investigator and GSK Helpdesk are re ported in the patient/subject card.

GSK Vaccines Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (VCSP) staff may unblind the 
treatment assignment for any subject in case of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse 
Reaction (SUSAR) as well as in case of fatal or life -threatening cases. If the SAE 
requires  an expedited regulatory report be sent to 1 or more regulatory agencies, a copy 
of the report, identifying the subject’s treatment assignment, may be sent to invest igators 
in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy.  
7.4. Handling , storage and  replacement of study 
vaccine(s)/product(s)  
7.4.1.  Storage and handling of study vaccine(s)/product(s)   
The study vaccine(s)/product(s) must be stored at the respective label storage temperature 
conditions in a safe and locked place. Access to the storage space should be limited to 
authori sed study personnel. The storage conditions will be assessed during pre -study 
activities under the responsibility of the sponsor study contac t. The storage temperature 
should be continuously monitored with calibrated (if not validated) temperature 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

SPM for more details on storage of the study vaccine(s)/prod uct(s).  
A temperature excursion is any temperature that is not in range of the label storage 
temperature conditions. Temperatures outside the range of label storage temperature 
conditions must be reported and/or documented. Temperature excursion impacting study 
vaccine(s)/product(s) must be reported and/or documented.  
In the frame of the reporting, the lack/absence of temperature monitoring documentation 
from a device meeting GSK requirements has to be considered as a temperature 
excursion.  
Study vaccine(s) /product(s) that are impacted by a temperature excursion may not be 
used and must be quarantined at label storage conditions until usage approval has been 
obtained from/via the local study contact (e.g. Site Monitor).  
Refer to the Module on Clinical Trial Supplies in the SPM for details and instructions on 
the temperature excursion reporting and usage decision process, packaging and 
accountability of the study vaccine(s)/product(s).  
7.4.2.  Replacement of unusable vaccine (s)/product (s) doses  
In addition to the vacc ine/product doses provided for the planned number of subjects 
(including over -random isation when applicable), at least 10% additional vaccine/product 
doses will be supplied to replace those that are unusable.  
7.5. Concomitant medication(s)/product(s) and concom itant 
vaccinations  
7.5.1.  Recording of concomitant medications/products and 
concomitant vaccinations  
Concomitant medications include all medications taken by/administered to the subject at 
and after enrolment to treat any AE collected in the eCRF and any vaccine administered 
to subjects. These medication s/ vaccine s must be documented on the Prior and 
Concomitant Medications and Vaccination  eCRF.   
At each study visit/contact, the investigator or delegate should question the subject and/or 
the subject’s parent(s)/LA R(s) about any medications/products taken and vaccinations 
received by the subject.  When  recording  conc omitant medica tions/vaccines, they  shou ld 
be checked against the study entry and continuation criteria in  Section 6, Selec tion of 
Study Popu lation to ensure that the subject should be enrolled/continue in the stud y. 
The following concomitant medication(s)/product(s)/vaccine(s) must be recorded in the

Medications taken for prophylaxis are those intended to prevent the onset of 
symptoms. Medications taken for treatment are intended to reduce or eliminate the 
presence of symptoms that are present. An anti -pyret ic is considered to be 
prophylactic when it is given in the absence of fever and any other symptom, to 
prevent fever from occurring [fever is defined as temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F 
regardless the location of measurement]. The preferred location for measuri ng 
temperature in this study will be the oral route.

7.7. Contraindications to subsequent vaccin e(s) administration  
Prior to receipt of additional study vaccination, subjects must be eval uated to confirm that 
they are eligible for subsequent vaccination.  
If subjects meet any of the original exclusion criteria or the criteria listed below, they 
should not receive additional vaccinations. However, the subjects should be encouraged 
to contin ue other study procedures at the discretion of the investigator (Section 8.5.7 ). 
• Anaphylaxis following the administration of vaccines.  
• Pregnancy (see Section 12.5.8.1 ). 
• Any condition that in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular 
injection unsafe.  
• Any occurrence of an event listed in the exclusion criteria which must be always re - 
assessed by the investigator before administration of the  next dose of study vaccine.  
• Subjects who experience any serious adverse event judged to be possibly or probably 
related to study  vaccine or non -study vaccines, including hypersensitivity reactions.  
• Subjects who develop any  new condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, 
may pose additional risk to the subject if he/she continues to participate in the study.  
• Occurrence of a  new AESI or the exacerbation of an existing AESI that, in the 
opinion of the investigator, exposes the subject to unacceptable risk from subsequent 
vaccination. In such cases, the investigator should use his/her clinical judgement 
prior to administering t he next dose of the vaccine(s)/product(s). Refer to Section

7.9. Treatment after completion of the study  
During the study conclusion contact, the investigator will ask each subject/subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) if they are interested in participating/allowing the subject to participate 
in a booster study/long -term study. If a subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) is/are not 
interested in participating in the booster study/long -term study the reason for refusal will 
be documented, when available, in the subject’s CRF/eCRF . 
The investigator is encouraged to share the immunological assay results for non -
responders with the study subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s).   
For the subjects identified as non -responders, it remains the responsibility of the 
investigator in charge of the subject’s clinical management to determine the medical care 
needed as per local/regional practices (such  as re-vaccination of the subject(s)).  
Refer to Section 8.4.5  for details.  
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Study procedures and their timing are summar ised in the SoA  (Section  2).  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed unless necessary for the management of 
immediate safety concerns.   
Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject (s) should discontinue study 
treatment . 
Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is 
essential and required for study conduct.  
All screening evaluations (i.e. eligi bility criteria check) must be completed and results 
reviewed before confirming  that potential subject s meet all eligibility criteria. The 
investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all subject s screened and to 
confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
The sections that follow provide an overview of t he procedures that are to be f ollowed in 
enrolling, evalua ting, and following subjects who participate in this clinical stud y. Visits 
can be either clinic visits or safe ty follow-up telephone calls, as specified in the  Table 3. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompanying SPM. The SPM provides the investigator and the site 
personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not impact the 
safety of the subjects.  
During special circumstances, exemplified by the COVID -19 pandemic, certain study 
procedures may be adapted to protect the subject and promote data integrity. Refer to 
Section 8.9 for further details.  
8.2. Data Collected from Subjects  
The following data will be collected from each subject over the duration of their study 
participation:  
• Demographic Information.  
• Medical history (any significant past diagnoses including allergies, hospital isations, 
surgeries requiring in -patient hospital isation, any other medical conditions which 
may impair the assessment of safety of the rMenB+OMV NZ , MenABCWY  and 
MenACWY vaccines).  
• Pre-vaccination body temperature.  
• Post-vaccin ation immediate reactions observed for at least 30 minutes after injection  
(on Day 1, Day 61 , Day 181 and Day 211) : signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis, 
allergic phenomena (such as rashes, itching, or other allergic manifestations). Local 
and systemic solicited data (including e.g., use of medication to treat or prevent 
fever, and/or pain). Refer to Section 12.5.12.1  for details.  
• Post-vaccination so licited local and systemic AEs collected at home by subject 
and/or subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and recorded in the Subject eDiary for 7 days 
following each vaccination visit  (at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181) . Any ongoing event  
(beyond 7 days) may be followed u p for 30 days or until resolution , whichever is  
earlier , in the eDiary . Any solicited AE that has not resolved within 30 days post 
vaccination and is reported during clinic visits or safety follow -up calls will be 
entered into the subject’s eCRF as an unsolicited AE. It will also be included in the 
subject’s source documents a t the site by the investigator/site staff as a verbally 
reported event. It will not be included in the Subject eDiary. These AEs will be 
analy zed as unsolicited AEs (i.e. in the Unsolicited Safety Set).  
• Adverse Events.  
− Unsolicited A Es occurring within 30 days after each vaccination (at Day 1, Day 
61 and Day 181) will be collected for all subjects by interviewing the subject 
and/or subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) (as applicable) during the site visits or Safety 
Follow -up Calls and by reviewing of available medic al records.  
− SAEs occurring during the entire study period

All data collected must only be identified using the GSK Subject ID,  as described in 
Section  7.2, documented in the source documents and entered in the eCRF*.  
*Only the solicited local and systemic AEs 30 minutes post vaccination are entered in the 
eCRF. The solicited local and systemic AEs during 7 -day post -vaccination period are not 
entered in the eCRF but are recorded in eDiary.  
8.3. Pre-vaccination procedures  
8.3.1.  Screening / Eligibility criteria  
After an individual or individual’s parent/LAR  has consented participation  in the study  
and infor med consent/assent is signed, that individual will be given a unique Screening 
Number manually created by the inves tigator. The  subject’s unique Screening Number 
will be d ocumented  in the Screening and Enrolment log. The eligibili ty of the subject 
will be determined based on the inclusi on and exclusi on criteria listed in  Section 6 and 
evaluated during this sc reening  procedure.  
In the event that the i ndividual  is determined  ineligible  for study  participation, he/sh e is 
considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure must be documented in the 
Screening and Enrolment log. If the individual is determined to be eligible for the stud y, 
he/she will  be enrolled into the stud y. 
8.3.2.  Collection of demographic data  
Prior to study enrolment, demographic data will be collected  from the subject, including  
date of birth ( month and year ), gender, race, ethnicity, weight, and heigh t, and recorded 
in the subject’s  eCRF.  
8.3.3.  Medical history  
Medical history  will also be collected, including but not limited to any  medica l history 
that may be relevan t to subject eligibili ty for study participation such as prior 
vaccinations, concomitant medica tions, and previous and ong oing illnesses or injuries. 
Relevant medical history  can also include any  medica l histor y that contributes to the 
understanding of an adverse event that occurs during study  participation, if it represents 
an exacerba tion of an underlying disease/pr e-existing problem.  
Obtain the subject’s medical history by interview and/or review of the subject’s medical 
records and record any pre -existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a 
subject prior to the first study vaccination  in the eCRF . 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  72 8.3.4.  General and symptom -directed physical examination  
A general physical examination is to be performed by a qualified healthcare practitioner. 
“Qualified health care practitioner” refers to any licensed  or certified healthcare 
professi onal who is permitted by institutional policy to  perform  protocol required 
procedures , and who  is identified within the Delegation of Responsibility Log . The 
physical examination will include examination of organ systems that are relevant to the 
investigator based on medical history and review of systems and a measurement of heart 
rate, blood pressure, and temperature.  
These data will be written in the source  document. Should the physical assessment reveal 
any abnormal values or events, these must be documented in the eCRF Adverse Events 
Form.  
Physical examination at each study visit subsequent to the first vaccination visit, will be 
performed only if the subj ect/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) indicates during questioning that 
there might be some underlying pathology(ies) or if deemed necessary by the Investigator 
or delegate.  
If the investigator determines that the subject’s health on the day of vaccination 
tempor arily precludes vaccination, the visit will be rescheduled.  Treatment of any 
abnormality observed during this examination should  be performed according to local 
medical practice outside this study or by referral to an appropriate health care provider.  
8.3.5.  Preg nancy test  
Female subjects of childbearing potential are to have a urine pregnancy test prior to any 
study vaccine administration. The study vaccine(s)/product(s) may only be administered 
if the pregnancy test is negative.  
Urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing in females of child -bearing 
potential, before vaccinations at Visits 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the results recorded in the source 
document and the eCRF.  
Note: Pregnancy test must be performed even if the subject is menstruating at the time o f 
the study visit.  
8.3.6.  Pre-vaccination body temperature  
The body temperature (preferably oral) of each subject needs to be measured prior to any 
study vaccines administration . If the subject has fever [fever is defined as body 
temperature 38.0°C/100.4°F regar dless of the location of measurement] on the day of 
vaccination, the vaccination visit will be rescheduled within the allowed interval for this 
visit (see Section  6.3). 
Note: If the body temperature is measured by any other route ( other than oral ), this also 
needs to be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  73 8.4. Effectiveness  and/or immunogenicity  assessments  
Please refer to the SPM and/or Central Laboratory Manual for details on biospecimen 
management (handling, storage and shipment).  
Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subject but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).  
Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research and purposes related to 
the improvement, development and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in 
this protocol. This may include the management o f the quality of these tests, the 
maintenance or improvement of these tests, the development of new test methods, as well 
as making sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work reliably.  
Future findings may make it desirable to use the s amples acquired in this study for further 
research, not described in this protocol. Additional serologic al testing may be performed 
in the future to further character ise the antibody response to the antigens included in the 
study vaccines or hSBA against an additional panel of strains of Neisseria  species.  
Therefore, all subjects  in countries where this is allowed  will be asked to give a specific 
consent to allow GSK or a cont racted partner to use the samples for further research. 
Further  research will be subject to prior EC/IRB approval if required per local legislation.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK.  
Any sample testing wil l be done in line with the consent of the individual 
subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s)  
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , wher e it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
If additional testing is performed, the marker priority ranking given in Section 8.4.4  may 
be changed.  
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years (counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study visit), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines require 
different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the subject 
consent. These extra requirements need to be communicated formally to and discussed 
and agreed with GSK.   
8.4.1.  Use of specified study materials  
When materials are provided by GSK, it is MANDATORY  that all clinical samples 
(including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in 
the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the 
subject from the per -protocol analysis (See Section 10.2 for the definition of populations  
for analyses ). The investigator must ensure that his/her personne l and the laboratory(ies) 
under his/her supervision comply with this requirement. However, when GSK does not 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

SPM.  
8.4.2.  Biological samples  
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM and/or Central Laboratory 
Manual for detailed instructions for the collection, handling and processing of the 
samples.  
8.4.2.1.  Blood sampling for effectiveness and immunogenicity response 
assessments  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
A minimum  of approximately  20 mL of blood will be drawn fr om all subject s at visit 1 
before vaccina tion. Approximately 30 mL sample of blood will be drawn from all 
subjects 30 days after the first and third vaccination [at Visit 2 (Day 31)  and Visit 6 
(Day 211) ] and approximately 25 mL sample of blood will be drawn fr om all subject s 
30 days after the second vaccina tion (at Visit 4 (Day 91)). 
The blood samples should be collected before the study  vaccination when applicable. The 
blood volume that is drawn as presented in Table 11 is needed in  order to provide the 
necess ary serum volume for the bactericidal  assays  (enc-hSBA and hSBA (s)). Refer to 
Section 5.1 and Section 7.2.3.1  for further details on the rationale for the requirement of 
this blood volume.  
Chec k criteria for blood draw delay as specified in Section 6.3. A topical anaesthetic  (e.g. 
EMLA adhesives or cream) may be used at the site of blood sample draw, according to 
local practice in order to minim ise pain.  
The blood will be processed as descr ibed in the SPM  and/or Central Laboratory Manual . 
The serum will be stored at a temperature of  -80°C ( -70°C is accepted but -80°C is 
preferred) . Each serum tube will be identified  with a Central Laboratory  label and  sent to 
Central Laboratory per defined frequency . Complete instruct ions for labelling  and storage of 
serum samples are included in the SPM  and/or Central Laboratory Manual . 
The total amount of blood collected over the study  period per subject will be 
approximately  105mL. 
Insufficient blood volume may lead to test cancellation and jeopard ise the statistical 
power. Hence, every effort must be done to collect blood volume as per protocol 
requirements  
Note: Blood samples are taken from all subjects irrespective of the testing status to maintain 
the blind of the study. Refer to Section 8.4 for detail s on how the unused/ left -over samples 
will be used .  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

8.4.3.  Laboratory assays  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
Serum bactericidal activity is a functional measure of the ability of antibodies, in 
conjunction with human complement, to kill meningococci, and it is widely accepted as 
the serological surrogate marker for protection.  
Effectiveness of the MenB component  will be evaluated with serum bactericidal assays 
using endogenous source of human complement (enc -hSBA), on a panel of 110 US 
representative N. meningitidis  serogroup B invasive disease strains.  
Immunogenicity of the vaccine against serogroups A, B, C, W and Y will be evaluated by 
serum bactericidal assay s using exogenous source of human complement (hSBA s), using 
indicator strains representing serogroups A, B, C, W and Y.  
An Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA ), or equivalent,  will b e used to 
evaluate  the serotype -specific IgG responses to A, C, W, and Y . The intent is to 
characterize  whether  the immunogenicity measured by hSBA using the MenA, C, W and 
Y indicator strains may be confounded by the contribution of the responses against the 
MenB antigens of the combination vaccine. The ELISA procedure is used to detect the 
amount of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in response to specific N. 
meningitidis  polysaccharide antigens . 
Effectiveness  testing by enc -hSBA and MenACWY immunogenicity tes ting by  hSBA 
will be priorit ised over any other assays using exogenous source of human complement , 
or ELISA  (or equivalent ), based on the volume of serum available for a visit from one 
subject.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

No generally accepted immunological correlate of protection has been demonstrated so 
far against N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, W, and Y . 
An hSBA titre ≥4 is a generally accepted correlate of protection against invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroup C.  
The immunological assay results will be communicated to the investigator when ready 
and available.  
8.5. Safety Assessments  
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. The investigator and any 
designees remain responsible for following up A Es that are serious, considered related to 
the study treatment or the study, or that caused the subject to discontinue the  study 
treatment or study.  
8.5.1.  Safety definitions  
Please refer to Section 12.5 for safety definitions.  
8.5.2.  Follow -up Clinic Visit(s)  
A follow -up clinic visit will be performed on  Day 31 ( -5/+14  days , Visit 2 ), Day 91 (-5 / 
+14 da ys, Visit 4) and Day 211 ( -5 / +14 days, Visit 6). 
The eDiary will be reviewed on Day 31 (Visit 2), Day 91 (Visit 4) and Day 211 (Visit 6).  
Study -specific requirements are described in the SPM. For details on the eDiary see 
Section  12.5.9 . 
The subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) will be interviewed to determine if any 
unsolicited AEs occurred and if any concomitant medica tions or vaccines were 
taken/received in the time since the last clinic  visit.  The qualified healthcare professi onal 
reviewing these data will discuss the symptoms (if any) reported by  the subject and will 
determine if any additional diagnoses and/or AEs are/were  present. Adverse events 
reported by the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) at this follo w-up clinic visit 
must be recorded in the subject ’s source document and on an Adverse Events CRF, as 
specified in Section 8.5, and not written on the script used for the interview.  
Perfor m a brief sympto m-directed physical examination if necessary according to 
symptoms the subject has reported.  This is a physica l examina tion that will include an 
examina tion of organ systems that are relevant to the inves tigator based on review of the 
subject’s reported adverse  events, concomitant medica tion use. This assessment may 
include: measurement of vital signs, body  temperatur e (prefe rably  oral) and a check of 
general appearance. The physical assessment must be performed by the inves tigator  or 
designee of the investi gator, who is qualified to perform a physical assessment in 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  83 8.5.6.2.  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification of an SAE by the investigator to the sponsor is essential for meeting 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities for the safety of subjects and the safety of a 
study treatment under clinical investigation.  
The sponsor has a legal r esponsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting  to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards 
(IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory re quirements and sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other 
specific safety information (e .g. summary or listing of SAE s) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.   
8.5.7.  Follow -up of A Es and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject  at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAE  and non -serious AESI s (Refer Section 
12.5.6  for definition) , will be followed until the event is resolved, stabili sed, otherwise  
explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up. Further information on follow -up 
procedures is given in  Section  12.5.12.4 . 
8.5.8.  Treatment of adverse events  
Treatment of any AE is at the sole discretion of the investigator and according to current 
good medical practice. Any medication administered for the treatment of a  SAE / AESI  
should be recorded in Expedited Adverse Event Report of the subject’s eCRF (refer to 
Section 7.5). 
8.5.9.  Subject card  
Study subjects /subjects’ par ent(s)/LAR(s) must be provided with the address and 
telephone number of the main contact for information about the clinical study.  
The investigator (or designate) must therefore provide a “subject card” to each 
subject /subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s). In an emergency situation , this card serves to inform 
the responsible attending physician that the subject is in a clinical study and that relevant 
information may be obtained by contacting the investigator.  
Subjects /subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be instructed  to keep subject cards in their 
possession at all times during the study duration.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

(Amended 9 May  2021)  
The study interventions (MenABCWY and Bexsero) are combination products 
constituted of a device and biologic product (e.g., pre -filled syringes). Refer to Glossary 
of terms  for the definition of a combination product and a medical device deficiency.  
8.5.10.1.  Detection, follow -up and prompt reporting of medical device deficiency  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt repor ting 
of any medical device deficiency occurring during the study to GSK. This applies to 
any medical device provided for the conduct of the study.   
Device deficiencies will be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event  meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 12.8 for definitions and details on recording and reporting of these events.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or relat ed of the device deficiency to the incident. Follow -up 
applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention or the 
study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and da ted by the investigator and reported to GSK within 24 hours . 
8.5.10.2.  Regulatory reporting of medical device deficiency when used as 
combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device deficiencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for us e in the study to GSK. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify 
appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about safety information linked to 
medical devices being used in clinical studies. Refer to Section 12.8.2  for details of 
reporting.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (e.g. the head 
of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory 
requi rements relating to the reporting of device deficiencies to the IRB/IEC.  
8.6. Holding rules and safety monitoring  
There are no predetermined stopping rules other than circumstances for which subjects 
may not be eligible  for additional study vaccina tions or may be withdraw n from the study 
according to the best interests of the subject.  
8.7. Biomarkers and p harmacogenomics

The study termina tion call will occur  on Day 361. The termina tion visit will be a phone 
call (also in case of early termination of the study).  
The date of termina tion is the date of the last contact (telephone call) in which the 
subject’s health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not agree to any 
further safety follow -up, it is the date consent is withdrawn. This date should be recorded 
on the termi nation eCRF page. For visit procedures to be performed for a subject whose 
planned study participation ends prematurely, please see  Section 8.8.1 . 
During the phone call  at the end of the study  (Day 361), the following procedures will be 
performed: interview of subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to collect SAEs, 
AESIs, medically attended AEs, pregnancies and/or  concomitant medications/ 
vaccinations.  
The site will review  with the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) the plan of when 
infor mation relating to the subject’s par ticipa tion in the study may be available (e.g., 
study results, treatment assignments). It will also be discussed how information rela ting 
to the subject’s participation in the study  will be share d with the subject’s  healthcare 
provider, if the subject and/ or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) chooses to share this

termina tion will be included in the subject’s source documentation. If the Early  
Termin ation Visit is a telephone call, collect as much informa tion as possible. Early  
Termina tion Visits include subjects who were random ised but not treated.  
At the clinic visit or during the telephone call, the following procedures will be 
perfor med: 
• review of Subject  eDiary (if applicable)  
• interview of subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to collect all AEs if 
termination occurs within 30 days after vaccination. If the termination occurs more 
than 30 days after the vaccination , all AEs within 30 days after vaccination and  
medically attended AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs , pregnancy,  AESIs  
beyond the 30 day s after vaccination have to be collected.  
• interview of subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to collect concomitant 
medications administered to treat adverse events collected in the study,  
• blood sampling (if withdrawal occur s at or prior to Visit 4 (Day 91)  or Visit 6 (Day

During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local public health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, the 
following measures may be implemented for enrolled subjects:  
• If the Subject eDiary device was provided to the subject , it may be returned to the 
site by conventional mail after the end of the relevant data collection period (Visit 6). 
• Study visit s may be per formed  at a different location* other than the study site (e.g. 
at subject ’s home ). For study visits involving blood draw, b iological samples should 
not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely manner or appropriately 
stored until the intended use.  
• If despite best efforts it is not possible to collect the biological samples within the 
interval predefined in the pro tocol (see Table 4), then the interval may be extended 
as described below in Table 17.  
• If despite best efforts it is not possible to administer the dose of study intervention as 
defined in the protocol (see Table 4), then the interval may be extended as described 
below in  Table 17.  
* It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location. The 
investigator should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, 
such as adequate faciliti es to perform study procedures, appropriate training of the 
staff and documented delegation of responsibilities in this location. This alternate 
location should be covered by proper insurance for the conduct of study on 
participants by investigator and sta ff at a site other than the designated study site.  
In case of home visits, the study procedures should be carried out by a qualified 
person/s as delegated by the Principal Investigator, provided that the compliance 
with protocol procedures are ensured . Refer to Schedule of Activities for the 
schedule of visits (see Table 3).  
Refer to local regulations  on the conduct  of clinical trials during the COVID -19 
pandemic for more details.  
Impact on the per protocol set for immunogenicity will be determined on a case by case 
basis.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

If local regulations allow and if quality of study procedures can be maintained, 
participant(s) can be offered remote visits (e.g. home visits)  for the collection of 
biological samples and/or study intervention administration. These remote visits must 
be performed by qualified study staff/healthcare professionals HCPs. Refer to the 
Schedule of Activities  (Table 3) for the timing of these visits.  
Following  procedures can be performed remotely. Refer to the Glossary of terms  for 
definitions of remote virtual visit:  
• Biological samples may be collected remotely by qualified study staff/HCPs . 
Biological samples should be collected only if they can be processed in a timely 
manner and appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Administration of study intervention can be performed remotely/at participant’s 
home by qualified study staff/HCPs if appropriate storage conditions for the study 
intervention can be ensured . Furthermore, appropriate medical treatment must be 
readily available during 30 minutes after dosing in case of anaphylaxis, syncope.  
9. DISCONTINUATION FROM  THE STUDY  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study refers to any subject who 
was not available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol.  
All data and samples collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will 
be used for the analysis.  
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’ from the study when no study p rocedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected

9 May 2021  88 Primary reason for study withdrawal will be documented in the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made by 
the subject himself/herself, by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), or b y the investigator, as 
well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal:  
• Adverse events (AEs)  requiring expedited reporting  (please refer to section 12.5.10.2  
for the details)  
• Unsolicited non -serious AE 
• Solicited AE 
• Protocol deviation  
• Withdrawal by subject, not due to an AE* 
• Migrated/Moved from the study area  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Sponsor study termination  
• Other (specify)  
*In case a subject is withdrawn from the study because he/she/the subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) has withdrawn consent, the investigator will document the reason for 
withdrawal of consent, if specified by the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), in the 
eCRF . 
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of SAEs/A Es/pregnancy  must be 
clearly distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons. Investigators 
will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as result of a SAE/AE /pregnancy  
until resolution of the event (see Section 12.5.12 ). 
A subject will be withdrawn if the subject’s treatment code is unblinded by the 
investigator or tre ating physician (Refer to Section 7.3.1 ). The primary reason for 
discontinuation (the event or condition which led to the unblinding) will be recorded  in 
the eCRF.  
Adverse  Event  
For any subjec t withdraw n from study participation prior to the planne d Study 
Termina tion Visit , it is important to determine if an AE was associated with the reason 
for discontinuin g the study. This AE must be identified on the  AE eCRF page by  
indica ting “Withdrawn  from study due to AE”. Any ongoing A Es at the time of study  
withdrawal must be followed until res olution or stabil isation. 
Subjects who develop a SAE judged to  be possibl y or probably related to the study 
vaccine, including hypersensi tivity reactions, shou ld not receive subsequent  vaccina tion. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  89 Death  
For any subject withdrawn  from study participation due to death, this should be noted on 
the Study  Termina tion eCRF  page and the associated SAE that led to the death must be 
reported.  
Withdrawal of consent  
The subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) can withdraw consent for participa tion in 
the study at any time without pena lty or loss of benef it to which the subje ct is otherwise 
entitled. Reason  for early  termina tion shou ld be deemed as “withdrawa l of consent” if the 
subject withdraws fr om participation due to a no n-medical reason (i.e., reason other than 
AE). If the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) inten ds to withdraw consen t from 
the study, the inves tigator  should  clarify  if the subject  will withdraw  completely  from the 
study or if the subject will con tinue study  participat ion for safet y, or a subset  of other 
study procedures. If the subject requests com plete withdrawa l from the study, no further 
study intervent ions will be performed wi th the subject.  
For sites in US:  If a subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) withdraws consent but 
does not revoke the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) 
author isation, the Sponsor will have full access to the subj ect’s medical  records, 
including termina tion visit informa tion. If a subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) 
revokes only  the HIPA A author isation, the Sponsor will have full access to all of the 
subject’s medical records prior to the date and time of wr itten revocat ion. 
Lost to Follow -Up 
Refer to Section 9.2. 
Administrative  Reason  
Examples for subjects withdrawn from the  study  due to administrative re ason can 
include: Sponsor decision to terminate the study, subject meeting a pre -specified 
withdrawal criterion, subject discon tinuation for insurance issues, moving, no time, etc. 
This reason shou ld be noted in the Study Termina tion eCRF page and any  ongoi ng AEs 
at the time of study withdrawa l must be f ollowed un til resolution/stabil isation. 
If the clinical study  is prematurely terminated by  the Sponsor, the investigator is to 
promptly inform the study  subject s and local EC/IRB and should assure appropriate 
therapy and follow-up for the subjects. All procedures and requirements pertaining to the 
archiving  of study  document s shou ld be followed. All other study materials (study 
medica tion/vaccines, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor.  
For subjects who are wi thdraw n from the study due to receipt of an excluded 
medica tion/vaccination or due to significant protocol no n-compliance, this reason should 
be noted in the Study  Terminat ion eCRF page.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  90 Protocol Deviation  
A protocol devia tion is any change, divergence, or departure from the study  design  or 
procedures of a study  protoco l. In genera l, subject s assoc iated with protoco l devia tions 
may remain in the study  unless continua tion in the study  jeopard ises the subject’s  health, 
safety, or rights.  
Inves tigators will apply due diligence to avoid protocol devia tions. Under  no 
circumstance s shou ld the invest igator contac t GSK  or its agents, if any, monitoring the 
study to reques t approva l of a protoco l deviat ion, as no author ised devia tions are 
permitted. If the inves tigator  feels a change to the protocol would improve the conduct of 
the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment 
is agreed upon by  GSK and approved by the IRB/EC  and health authori ties it cannot be 
implemented.  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study, despite the protocol requirement for 
adequate contraception, will not receive further  vaccina tion but should be encouraged to 
continue participating in the study  for safety follow-up. The site must complete a 
Pregna ncy Report eCRF (ini tial report) as soon as possible after learning of pregnancy 
occurrence (Refer to Section 12.5.9 ). If the subject withdraws from the study for any of 
the above categories except death, the site will obtain permission  from the subject to 
continue to remain in contact with her un til the outcome of the pregnancy is known, even 
if the o utcome is not known until after the subject reaches the end of follow -up period . 
9.1. Discontinuation of study vaccine(s)/product(s)  
A ‘withdrawal’ from the study vaccine(s)/product(s) refers to any subject who does not 
receive the complete treatment, i.e. when  no further planned dose is administered from 
the date of withdrawal. A subject withdrawn from the study vaccine(s)/product(s) may 
continue further study procedures (safety or immunogenicity) if planned in the study 
protocol, as deemed appropriate by the i nvestigator.  
Primary reason relative to premature discontinuation of the study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
will be documented on the Vaccine Administration screen of the eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to discontinue further vaccinatio n/treatment was 
made by the subject himself/herself, by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) , or by  the 
investigator, as well as which of the following possible reasons was responsible for 
withdrawal:  
• Adverse event requiring expedited reporting  
• Unsolicited non-serious adverse event  (specify)  
• Solicited adverse event  
• Not willing to be vaccinated  
• Other (specify).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  91 9.2. Lost to follow -up 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit as soon 
as possible and counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a subject is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the subject’s 
medical record.  
• Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to fo llow-up. The 
termination date for the subject to be captured on the Study Termination eCRF page 
is the date of the last successful contact (clinic visit or telephone) with the subject.  
10. STATISTICAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.  Sample size determination  
(Amended 9 May  2021) 
Three thousand six hundred fifty-one (3,651) subjects are to be enrolled in the study. 
Figure 1 presents the study design overview with the breakdown of sample size per study 
arm:  
• MenB_0_2_6: 912 subjects  
• MenB_0_6: 912 subjects  
• ABCWY -1: 548 subjects  
• ABCWY -2: 548 subjects  
• ABCWY -3: 548 subjects  
• ACWY: 1 83 subjects.  
It is assumed that 25% of the subjects will drop -out and not contribute to an evaluable 
result. The remaining subjects who do give an evaluable result provide 90% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of rMenB +OMV NZ  and 92% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of MenABCWY vaccine. Additionally, 
the study is powered to reject key secondary objective for three N. meningitidis  serogroup 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

power.  
An explanation of the testing strategy and hypotheses can be found in Section 10.1.1  and 
its sub -sections. A breakdown of the power for the individual objectives can be found in 
Section 10.1.2  and its sub -sections.  
10.1.1.  Hypothesis testing strategy  
Multiple objectives and endpoints require type I error control. Full alpha (0.05) is split 
equally (alpha=0.025) between rMenB+OMV NZ  objectives and MenABCWY 
objectives. Furthermore, within rMenB+OMV NZ, as well as within MenABCWY, 
objectives are tested hierarchically. If the first null hypothesis is rejected, then the testing 
will continue with the second hypothesis at same alpha. Same for 3rd, 4th, and so forth. 
Whenever a null hypothesis is not reje cted, then the testing will stop.  
As the comparator for MenABCWY non inferiority objective for the B component will 
be the selected  schedule of rMenB+OMV NZ  as determined in this study, the objectives 
of rMenB+OMV NZ  will be analysed first. Additionally, i f all null hypotheses related to 
rMenB+OMV NZ  objectives will be rejected, the alpha (alpha=0.025) will be propagated 
to the MenABCWY part, and hypotheses related to MenABCWY objectives will be 
tested at full alpha (alpha=0.05). See Figure 2 for an explanation of the hierarchical 
testing (top to bottom, the order indicated by the arrows).  
Figure 2 Hierarchical testing of hypothesis  
 
* Alpha split equally between rMenB+OMV NZ  and MenABCWY vaccine objectives.  
 If all rMenB+OMV NZ  objectives achieved, MenABCWY vaccine objectives will be tested at full alpha.

9 May 2021  93 ** If all objectives of rMenB+OMV NZ  are met, the comparator will be the 0,2 -month s schedule. If the 0,2 -months 
objective is not met, and the 0,6 -months is met, then the 0,6 -months schedule  will be the comparator. If the 0,6 -months 
is also not met, then the 0,2,6 -months schedule will be the comparator.  
Refer to Glossary of terms  for definitions of test -based and responder -based vaccine 
effectiveness.  
An explanation of the hypothesis testing is given in the  following subsections:  
10.1.1.1.  Vaccine effectiveness (Test -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  - 3 dose s (0,2,6 -
months schedule)  
For demonstration of VE of rMenB+OMV NZ  the following hypothesis will be tested:  
Null hypothesis:   
H0: VE ≤ 65% 
vs. Alternative hypothesis:  
H1: VE > 65% 
Where, VE represents the vaccine effectiveness, defined as 1 - RR = (1- percentage of  
samples without bactericidal serum activity measured by enc -hSBA at a 1:4 dilution in 
the MenB group / percentage of samples without bactericidal serum activit y at 1:4 
dilution in the ACWY group) x 100 % and 6 5% is the pre -specified success criteria for 
VE. The VE against all 110 strains combined and associated 97.5% CI, will be computed 
by means of a general ised linear model. If the lower limit of the 97.5% CI f or VE is > 
65% effectiveness will be claimed.  
10.1.1.2.  Effectiveness  (Responder -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  - 3 dose s (0,2,6 -

See Section 10.1.1.2  
10.1.2.  Sample size justification  
Overall study sample size and its power is provided in Section  10.1. This sub -section 
provides a breakdown of the power calculation for each of the objectives. All calculations 
are based on number of evaluable subjects.  
10.1.2.1.  Vaccine effectiveness (Test -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  - 3 dose s (0,2,6 -
months schedule)  
The planned  (target)  number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains. A 
minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be available to perform enc -hSBA testing.  
In case the  volume of serum shipped to the laboratory for enc -hSBA testing  is <5 mL , 
enc-hSBA testing will be still perfo rmed  if the volume of serum allows to test  a minimum 
number of 20 strains. Otherwise no enc -hSBA testing will be performed with the specific 
sample . The power was calculated for two situations: 30 and 35 strains to be tested per 
subject.  
In study V102_16E1, the observed raw percentages of samples without bactericidal 
serum activity at 1:4 dilution were 77 .8% in the MenACWY vaccine group and 21.9% in 
the MenABCWY group one -month post 3rd vaccination. The estimated VE of 
MenABCWY compared to  MenACWY was 71% (95% CI: 69% - 73%). For the sample 
size calculations, it is assumed that MenB (any schedule) will have similar results as 
MenABCWY 0,2,6 -months.  
Table 18 shows the result of power calculation for a group size of  684 evaluable subjects 
in MenB group, (any schedule) and 137 subjects in MenACWY group. The percentage of 
tests without bactericidal serum activi ty for MenACWY is assumed to be  75% , while the 
estimation for MenB is 22%. Sample size calculations revealed  >99.9% power to show 
that the lower limit of the two-sided 97.5%  CI for the VE is >65% (Refer to Section

Post-hoc calculations for study V102_16E1 were performed  following a regulatory 
agency request . The calculated percentage of responders of subjects with >=70% of 
tested strains killed was 78.5% (95% CI [68.8%; 86.3%]) in the MenABCWY group one -
month post 3rd vaccin ation. To have overall power of 90% (refer to Section 10.1), the 
effectiveness (responder -based) endpoint needs to have 97% power. Six hundred eighty -
four (684) evaluable subjects will be necessary to demonstrate with at least 97% power 
that the lower  limit of the 97.5% CI for proportion of responders in the MenB group (any 
schedule) is above 65% assuming the expected percentage in the study is 72.5% (see

in each in ABCWY -1, ABCWY -2 and ABCWY -3 groups) are needed to demonstrate, for 
all pairs of lots, the two -sided 97.5% CIs for the ratio of hSBA GMTs of antibodies 
against serogroups A, C, W and Y are within the [0.5; 2.0] equivalence int erval.   
Assuming standard deviations as the 80% upper confidence limit of the ones observed in 
a previous GSK study with MenABCWY vaccine (V102_15) to account for possible 
more variation in new data, an assumed underlying ratio between lots of 1.2 and 
independency, a single equivalence test based on 411 evaluable subjects per lot group has 
power 9 9.0%->99.9% (see Table 20). The resulting overall power is 9 6.1%, because the 
total number of comparisons is 12 (three pairwise comparisons for the 4 serogroups A, C, 
W, and Y).

10.1.2.8.  Immunological non -inferiority: MenABCWY vs. MenACWY in subjects  
without a previous MenACWY vaccination (unprimed)  
Assuming at least 70% subjects without a previous MenACWY vaccination (unprimed), 
there will be at least   863 (70% out of 1233) evaluable subjects in the ABCWY group 
(pooled lots), at 1 month after the last vaccination, and 96 (70% out of 137) in the 
ACWY gro up at 1 month after the MenACWY vaccination (at Month 7 for ABCWY 
group (pooled lots) and at Month 1 for ACWY group). This sample size  is sufficient to 
demonstrate that the lower limit of the two -sided 97.5% CIs for by percentage of subjects 
with 4-fold rise in hSBA titres against MenACWY indicator strains A, C, W and Y is >  -
10%.  
Assuming similar underlying immune response after 2 doses of MenABCWY vaccine, as 
previously observed in study V102_16 (Column 2 and 3 of Table 21), the resulting 
overall power is 99.6% .  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Key secondary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of MenABCWY vs 
rMenB+OMV NZ  measured by the percentages of subjects with 4-fold rise in hSBA 
titres against the N. meningitidis  serogroup B indicator strains post 2nd dose. Six hundred 
twenty  (620)  subjects are needed to demonstrate the immunological non -inferiority of the 
MenABCWY vaccine compared to the rMenB+OMV NZ  as measured by the percentages 
of subjects achieving a 4 -fold rise in hSBA titres against N. meningitidis  serogroup B 
indicator strai ns at 1 month after the last MenABCWY vaccination (0,6 -months schedule) 
and 1 month after the MenB vaccination (0, 2,6-months or 0,6 -months or 0,2 -months) 
with 81% power calculated for three strains (96217 (NadA), M14459 (fHbp), and

MenABCWY is predicted to be at least 10% less than the 4-fold rate for MenB.  
Non-inferiority will be demonstrated if the LL of the 2 -sided 97.5% CI for the group 
difference in percentage of subjects achievi ng a 4 -fold rise in hSBA titres against all N. 
meningitidis  serogroup B indicator  strains is above -10%. Table 23 presents the power to

the actual vaccination a subject received.  The list  of protocol deviations that would result 
in exclusion from the PPS is available in Section 4.2.2.1 of the Statistical Analysis Pl an. 
Subgroups : 
• Analyses of the primary objective s will be repeated by age group (10-17 years of age 
and 18 -25 years of age ), race , sex and US region , and subjects with and without a 
previous MenACWY vaccination (primed and unprimed) as relevant . 
• Additional  subgroup analyses may be performed to assess the impact of  any COVID -
19 pandemic . More details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan  if 
applicable .

Number of subjects enrolled, vaccinated subjects (at least 1 vaccination, full vaccination 
course) and completed  will be described by group. Reason for early withdraw will be 
described by group. Full analysis and per -protocol analysis population set will be 
described by group.  
10.3.2.  Demography and baseline charact eristics analyses  
Descrip tive statistics (mean, standard deviation  (SD) , median, minimum and maximum) 
for age, heigh t, weight, and body mass index  (BMI) at enrolment will be calculated 
overall and by vaccine gr oup. 
Distribu tions of subjects by se x, race, ethnic origin  will be summar ised overall and by

Statistical method: The VE is defined as 1 - RR= (1 - percentage of samples without 
bactericidal serum activity at 1:4 dilution in MenB group / percentage of samples without 
bactericidal serum activity at 1:4 dilution in the Control group) x100% and it will be 
analyzed using a general ised linear model  with vaccine group, strain and centre  as 
independent variables. Furthermore, a repeated statement will be used to estimate the 
variance of the RR  including correlation within subject’s responses . A centre  effect will

9 May 2021  102 the factor “centre ”, a model without centre  effect will be fitted instead. The response 
variable of the model will be the Bernoulli distributed outcome without bactericidal 
activity at a 1:4 dilution (i. e. response is 1 if titre < 4, and 0 if titre ≥ 4), at  1 month after 
the last vaccination (Month 7) in the MenB group and at Month 1 for the ACWY group. 
Each subject will contribute with approximately 35 measures to this analysis, each of the 
measures corr esponding to the response variable to one of the 35 strains randomly 
assigned to be tested with the samples available for that specific subject. For the 
statistical analysis it is assumed that the response to each strain is an independent 
measure with a un ique true underlying rate and VEs are expected to vary among the 
strains. In order to obtain the VE measure which is a measure based on the relative risk 
(RR), a general ised linear model  will be used with the Binary distribution and link 
function log in or der to compute the log RR and the corresponding 97.5% CI. If this 
model would not converge, the Poisson distribution will be used instead. The obtained 
values will be exponentiated to obtain the RR and the corresponding 97.5% CI. The VE 
will be computed as  100% x (1 – RR). Effectiveness of rMenB+OMV NZ  will be 
demonstrated if the lower limit of the two -sided 97.5% CI for VE against the selected 
strain panel between MenB and the ACWY group is above 65%.  
10.3.3.2.  Effectiveness  (Responder -based): rMenB+OMV NZ  - 3 dose s (0,2,6 -

Analysis set: FAS will be the primary analysis population.  
Statistical method: The percentage of responders (see definition in Section 10.1.1.2 ) and 
the corresponding exact two -sided 97.5% CI based on Clopper -Pearson method will be 
calculated  [Cloppe r, 1934] .  
The objective is to demonstrate that the lower limit of the 97.5% CI for the percentage of 
responders is higher than 65%.

Analysis set: The analysis of lot -to-lot consistency will be based on th e PPS.  
Statistical method: For each of the three ABCWY lots (Lot s 1, 2 and 3 of the MenACWY 
component of the ABCWY vaccine), GMTs and 97.5% CIs will be calculated by 
exponentiating (base 10) the least squares means and the lower and upper limits of the 
97.5% CIs of the log transformed titres (base10) obtained from a two -way Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) with factors for vaccine lot and study centre . Additionally, lot -to-lot 
GMT ratios will be computed for each pair of ABCWY lots. Ninety -seven point five 
percent (97.5%) CIs for the ratios of GMTs will be constructed by exponentiating the 
difference of the least square means of the log  transformed titres and the lower and upper 
limits of the 97.5% CIs on the difference obtained from the ANOVA model above.  
Lot-to-lot consistency  criterion : The three ABCWY lots will be considered equivalent if 
for each of the 4 serogroups A, C, W and Y and each pair of vaccine lots, the two -sided

percentages between ABCWY (pooled lots) and ACWY  group will be constructed using 
the method of Miettinen and Nurminen [ Miettinen , 1985].  
Non-Inferiority criterion: Non -inferiority of MenABCWY vaccine for the proportion of

Analysis sets : Solicited  Safety Set (solici ted local and systemic adverse events and other 
solicited adverse events), Unsolicite d Safe ty Set (unsolicited adverse events), and Overall 
Safety Set.  
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  Endpoints description : The frequencies and percentages of subjects with solicited local (i.e., 
injection site pain, erythema, swelling, induration) and systemic (i.e., fever [temperature ≥ 
38.0°C], nausea, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, headache) adverse events during the 7 days 
(including the day of vaccination) following each vaccination at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181.  
All solicited adverse  events will be summar ised according to defined severity grading scales, see 
protocol section  12.5.9.3  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects experi encing each adverse event will be presented for 
each symptom severity. Summary tables showing the occurrence of any local or systemic 
adverse event overall and at each time point will also be presented.  
Post-vaccination solicited adverse events reported fr om Day 1 to Day 7 will be summar ised for 
the intervals Day 1 -3, Day 4 -7, and Day 1 -7 by maximal severity and by vaccine group, excluding 
the 30 -minute measurement, which will be summar ised separately. The severity of solicited local 
adverse events, includi ng redness (erythema) at injection site, swelling of skin at injection site, 
and hardness of skin at injection site will be summar ised according to categories based on linear 
measurement: None (1 to 24mm); Mild (25 to 50mm); Moderate (51 to 100mm); Severe 
(>100mm).  
Injection site tenderness and systemic reactions (except fever) occurring up to 7 days after each 
vaccination at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181 will be summar ised according to “mild”, “moderate” or 
“severe”.  
Each solicited local and systemic adverse e vent will also be further summar ised as “none”  
versus “any” (for fever the latter will be ≥38.0 °C).  
Use of antipyretics and analgesics will be summar ised by frequency by type of use  
(prophylactic versus treatment) and percentage of subjects reporting use.  
Body temperature will be summar ised by 0.5 °C increments from 36.0 °C up to ≥40 °C and will 
be broken down according by route of measurement, if applicable. Frequencies and percentages 
of subjects with temperatures ≥ 38.0 °C and temperatures ≥ 40.0 °C wil l also be presented.  
 Endpoints description:  The frequencies and percentages of subjects with any unsolicited AEs 
(including all SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal and medically attended AEs during the 7 and the 
30 days (including the day of vaccination) following each vaccination at Day 1, Day 61 and  Day 
181. 
The frequencies and percentages of subjects with SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal , AESIs  and 
medically attended AEs throughout the study period.  
This analysis applies to all adverse events occurring during the study, judged either as possibly 
related, or not related to vaccination by the investigator, recorded in AE CRF, with a start date on 
or after the date of first vaccination. AE starting prior to the first vaccination will only be listed. 
The original verbatim terms used by investigators to id entify adverse events in the CRFs will be 
mapped to preferred terms using the MedDRA dictionary. The adverse events will then be 
grouped by MedDRA preferred terms into frequency tables according to system organ class.  
All reported adverse events, as well a s adverse events judged by the investigator as possibly 
related to study vaccine, will be summar ised according to system organ class and preferred term 
within system organ class. These summaries will be presented by vaccine group and by interval 
of study o bservation. When an adverse event occurs more than once for a subject, the maximal 
severity and strongest relationship to the vaccine group will be counted.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  113 12.1.2.  Glossary of terms  
(Amended 9 May  2021)  
Adverse event:  Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject, temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. 
For marketed medicinal products, this also includes failure to 
produce expected benefits (i.e. lack of efficacy), abuse or 
misuse.  
Adverse Event of 
Special Interest:  Adverse events of special interest (AESIs): are predefined 
(serious or non -serious) adverse events of scientific and 
medical c oncern specific to the product or program, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the 
investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate, because such 
an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
character ise and understand it.  
Blinding:  A procedure in which 1 or more parties to the trial are kept 
unaware of the treatment assignment in order to reduce the 
risk of biased study outcomes. The level of blinding is 
maintained throughout the conduct of the trial, and only 
when the data a re cleaned to an acceptable level of quality 
will appropriate personnel be unblinded or when required in 
case of a serious adverse event.  
In an observer -blind study, the subject and the site and 
sponsor personnel involved in the clinical evaluation of the 
subjects are blinded while other study personnel may be 
aware of the treatment assignment (see Section 7.3 for details 
on observer -blinded studies).   
Certified copy:  A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the 
original record that has been verified (i.e. by a dated 
signature or by gene ration through a validated process) to 
have the same information, including data that describe the 
context, content , and structure, as the original.  
Child in care:  A child who has been placed under the control or protection 
of an agency, organ isation, ins titution or entity by the courts, 
the government or a government body, acting in accordance 
with powers conferred on them by law or regulation. The 
definition of a child in care can include a child cared for by 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

above. The definition of a child in care does not include a 
child who is adopted  or has an appointed legal guardian.  
Combination product:  Combination product comprises any combination of  
• drug  
• device  
• biological product  
Each drug, device and biological product included in a 
combination product is a constituent part.  
Eligible:  Qualified for enrolment into the study based upon strict 
adherence to inclusion /exclusion criteria.  
End of Study (EoS)  
(Synonym of End of 
Trial)  For studies with collection of human biological samples 
and/or imaging data, the EoS is defined as Last subject last 
visit ( T7). or Last testing results released of samples 
collected at Visit 6*. 
* In this case EoS must be achieved no later than 8 months 
after LSLV .  
Enrolled  ‘Enrolled’ means a subject ’s/parent’s/LAR’s agreement to 
participate in a clinical study following completion of the 
informed consent process. Potential subjects  who are 
screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the 
study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered 
enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol.  
Refer to Section 10.2 for the definition of “Enrolled set” 
applicable to the study.  
Essential documents  Documents which individually and collectively permit 
evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the 
data produced  
eTrack:  GSK’s tracking tool for clinical trials.  
Evaluable:  Meeting all eligibility criteria, complying with the 
procedures defined in the protocol, and, therefore, included 
in the per -protocol analysis (see Section 10.2 for details on 
criteria for evaluability).  
Immunological 
correlate of 
protection:  The defined immune response above which there is a high 
likelihood of protection in the absence of any host factors 
that might increase  susceptibility to the infectious agent.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Pharmacogenomic biomarkers include germline (host) DNA 
and RNA as well as somatic changes (e.g. mutations) that 
occur in cells or tissues. Pharmacogenomic biomarkers are 
not limited to h uman samples but include samples from 
viruses and infectious agents as well as animal samples. The 
term pharmacogenomic experiment includes both the 
generation of new genetic or genomic (DNA and/or RNA)

The tests detailed in Table 12 will be performed at GSK or at a laboratory designated by 
GSK  where the assays are a vailable and qualified for the intended use .  
Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of subject s are detailed in 
Section 6 of the protocol.  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted as needed for women of childbearing potential 
(refer to Section 8.3.5 ). 
The investigator is not allowed to do extra testing on samples outside of what has been 
agreed upon by the ethic com mittees. 
12.2.1.  Effectiveness Assessment : Endogenous complement serum 
bactericidal assay – rMenB + O MV NZ  
The measures of vaccine effectiveness against 110 invasive disease serogroup B strains 
will be based on the qualified endogenous complement serum bactericidal assay  (enc-
hSBA ). 
The qualified  enc-hSBA assay provides a qualitative assessment (yes/no) of the presence 
of sufficient bactericidal antibodies in human sera to kill a meningococcal strain. In this 
study, test sera will be diluted 1:4 prior to testing. Serum samples will be collected us ing 
an appropriate process to preserve endogenous complement activity and to allow 
measurement of the bactericidal activity due to the antibodies present in the serum. This 
is in contrast to a traditional human serum bactericidal assay (hSBA) which heat 
inactivates the intrinsic complement proteins and uses an external source of human donor 
complement for each serum sample.  
The enc -hSBA will be performed for each subject against a target number of 35 strains . A 
minimum amount of 5 mL of serum needs to be a vailable to perform enc -hSBA testing. 
In case the  volume of serum shipped to the laboratory for enc -hSBA testing is <5 mL, 
enc-hSBA testing will be still performed if the volume of serum allows to test  a minimum 
number of 20 strains.  Refer to Section 10.1.2.1  for details.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

positive for the enc -hSBA testing . Post-dose 1 s era from the ACWY  group receiving the 
MenACWY vaccine will also be tested against serogroup B men ingococcal strains by 
enc-hSBA  (as a control) .  
12.2.2.  MenB serum bactericidal assays using exogenous  human 
complement (hSBA) – rMenB + OMV NZ  
Serum bactericidal act ivity against rMenB+OMV NZ will be determined by using a 
validated manual (Tilt -based) hSBA against a standard panel consisting of 4 
meningococcal B indicator strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M13520 . Each of 
these strains measures bactericidal activity primarily directed against one of the major 
bacterial antigens included in the vaccine: strain M14459 measures hSBA against the 741 
part of the 936 -741 antigen, also known as fHbp variant 1.1; strain 96217 measures 
hSBA against antigen 961c, also known as NadA; strain NZ98/254 measures hSBA 
against PorA P1.4, the immunodominant antigen in the OMV NZ vaccine component; 
strain M13520  measures hSBA against the 287 part of the 287 -953 antigen, also known 
as NHBA.  
Serum bactericidal activity against rMenB+OMV NZ  may be determined by performing 
serum bactericidal assays using human complement (hSBA) against an additional panel 
of Neisseria  strains for exploratory objective if necessary.  
12.2.3.  MenACWY serum bactericidal assays using human complement 
(hSBA):  
Serum bacteri cidal activity against MenACWY will be determined by using a validated 
agar-overlay hSBA.  
This hSBA is based on the measurement of human complement -dependent bactericidal 
killing of meningococci. As with all functional hSBAs, the assay includes a first step of 
heat inactivation of the human serum samples to inactivate the endogenous complement, 
followed by serial dilution of the serum samples in which a fixed amount of bacteria and 
of human exogenous complement are added. The reactions are incubated to a llow the 
association of meningococcal specific antibodies and their target antigen. The antibody -
antigen complex activates the classical pathway of complement which ultimately results 
in bacterial lysis.  
As a measure of the meningococcal specific antibody titre of each serum sample, the 
MenACWY agar -overlay hSBA follows the principle of detecting and counting the 
surviving meningococcal bacteria after bacterial growth within solid agar media, using an 
automatic colony counter (detection of colony forming un its, CFU).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  121 12.2.4.  MenACWY IgG ELISA  
The anti -MenACWY total IgG antibody (Ab) concentrations will be measured by using 
an Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) , or equivalent , to evaluate the 
immunogenicity of the capsular polysaccharides of serogroups A, C, W  and Y in 
MenACWY vaccine.  
The assay characteristics (e.g. validated assay cut -offs and units) for each of the 
serogroup will be determined at the time of the generation of validation data.  
Any change, including the change of the format of the assay, will be documented in a 
protocol amendment or in the clinical study report.

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  122 − Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval before 
implementation of changes  made to the study design, except for changes necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subject s.  
− GSK will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator, either 
verbally, in writing, or both.  
− The investigator will be responsib le for the following:  
− Providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/IEC annually 
or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and 
procedures established by the IRB/EC . 
− Notifying the IRB/IEC of SAE (s) or other signif icant safety findings as required 
by IRB/IEC procedures . 
− Providing oversight of the conduct of the study at the site and adherence to 
requirements of 21 CFR, ICH guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European regulation 
536/2014 for clinical studies (if applicable), an d all other applicable local 
regulations . 
12.4.2.  Financial d isclosure  
Investigators and sub -investigators will provide the sponsor with sufficient, accurate 
financial information as requested to allow the sponsor to submit complete and accurate 
financial certific ation or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. 
Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interest prior 
initiation of the cent re and for providing an update of Financial Disclosure if their 
financial in terest changes at any point during their participation in a study and for 1 year 
after completion of the study.  
12.4.3.  Informed consent process  
"Informed consent" is the v oluntary agree ment of an individual or his/her legal 
guard ian(s)  to participate in research. Consent must be given wi th free will of choice, and 
without undue inducement. The individual must have sufficient knowledge and 
understanding of the nature of the proposed research, the an ticipated risks and potential 
benefits, and t he requirements of the research to be able to make an informed decisi on. 
"Assent" is a term used to express willingness to participate in research by  person s who 
are by defin ition too young to give informed consent but who are old enough to 
understand the proposed  research in general, its expected risks and possible benefits, and 
the activi ties expected  of them  as subjects.  Assent  by itself is not sufficient, however. If 
assen t is given, informed consent must still be obtained from the subject's parent(s) or 
legal guardian(s). Local laws define who constitutes a "child," and such defini tions 
dictate whether or not a person can legally consent to participate in a protocol [Levine , 
1988 ]. 
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject or his/her legally authorised representative and answer all questions regarding the 
study.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  123 Subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) must be inform ed that their participation is 
voluntary.  
Freely given and written or witnessed/thumb printed informed consent must be obtained 
from each subject and/or each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and subject informed assent, as 
appropriate, prior to participation in the study.  
The content of informed consent form must meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50, local 
regulations, ICH guidelines, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act 
(HIPAA) requirements, where applicable, and the IRB/IEC or study centre.  
The me dical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained 
before the subject was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was 
obtained. The authorised person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF.  
For subjects who become legally emancipated during the course of the study, e.g. become 
of the legal age of consent, re -consent is sought in accordance with local laws and 
regulations. The subject can provide consent by signing an ICF, similar to that provided  
to the parent(s)/LAR(s) at the study start, which summarises the study and includes a 
consent statement and documents that the subject agrees to continue participating in the 
study.  
Subjects must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) o r an ICF 
addendum during their participation in the study.  
A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the subject or the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s).  
Subjects who are rescreened are required to sign a new ICF.  
The study investigator is encouraged to obtain assent from the minor in addition to the 
consent provided by the LAR(s) when a minor is able to give assent to decisions about 
his/her participation in a study. The investigator is also accountable for determining a 
minor's capacity to assent to participat ion in a research study according to the local laws 
and regulations.  
12.4.4.  Data protection  
Subject will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any subject records or 
datasets that are transferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; subject ’s 
names or any information which would make the subject identifiable will not be 
transferred.  
The subject must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law.  
The subject must  be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical 
Quality Assurance auditors or other authorised personnel appointed by the sponsor, by 
appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

which will be collected within the frame and for the purpose of the study.  
12.4.5.  Committees structure  
12.4.5.1.  Responsibilities of the Investigator and IRB/EC  
The protocol and the proposed  informed consent form must be reviewed and approved by 
a properly  constituted IRB/EC before study  start. Properly cons tituted IRB/EC is defined 
in ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (R1), Section 3 [ICH, 1997 ]. A signed 
and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent have been approved by the  
IRB/EC must be given to  GSK  before study  initiation. Prior to study start and at any  time 
the protocol is amended during study  conduct, the investigator is requir ed to sign a 
protoco l signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study  in accordance 
with these docu ments and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and 
to give access to all relevant data and records to  GSK monitors, auditors,  GSK  Clinical 
Quali ty Assurance representatives, designated agents of  GSK, IRBs/ECs,  and regulatory 
author ities as required. If an inspec tion of the clinical site is requested by  a regulatory 
author ity, the invest igator must inform  GSK immediately that this request has been made.  
The inves tigator  also responsible  for the following:  
• Maintaining a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom the investigator has 
delegated significant study -related duties.  
• Demonstrating the capability of recruiting the required number of suitable subjects 
within the recruitment period.  
• Demonstrating sufficient time and staffing to properly conduct and complete the 
study within the agreed study period.  
• Ensuring that all pers ons assisting with the study are adequately informed about the 
protocol, the investigational product(s), and their study -related duties and functions  
• Ensuring that appropriately trained healthcare professionals who can perform  all 
study -related medical dec isions and for ensuring appropriate medical care of subjects 
experiencing any AE related to the study.  
• If permission to do so is given by the subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s), 
ensuring that the subject’s primary healthcare provider is informed of  the subject’s 
participation in the study.  
The inves tigator  should  not implement  any devia tion from, or changes of the protocol 
without agreemen t by the Sponso r and prior review and documented approval/favourable 
opini on from the IRB/IEC of an amendment, except where ne cessar y to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to study  subjects, or when the change(s) inv olves only logis tical or 
administrative aspects of the study  (e.g., change in m onitor(s), change of telephone 
number(s)).  In addition, the inves tigator, or person desig nated by the inves tigator , should 
docu ment and explain any devia tion from  the approved  protocol.  
The inves tigator  may implement  a deviation  from, or a change of, the protocol to

i. to the IRB/IEC for review and approval/ favourable  opinion,  
ii. to the Sponsor for agreement and, if required,  
iii. to the regulatory authority(ies).  
12.4.6.  Protocol Amendments  
An amendment is a written descrip tion of change(s) to or formal clarifica tion of a study 
protoco l which  may impact  on the conduct  of the clinical  study, potential benefit of the 
clinical  study, or may affec t subject safe ty, including changes of study  objec tives, study 
design, subject population, sample sizes, study  procedures, or significant administrative 
aspects. An administrative change  of a study  protoco l is a minor correction or 
clarificat ion that has no significant  impact  on the way the clinica l study is to be 
conducted and no effect on subject safe ty (e.g., change of telephone number(s), logis tical 
changes). Protoco l amendment s must be approved by  GSK, health author ities where 
required, and the IRB/EC. In cases when the amendment is required in order to protect 
the subject safety, the amendment can be implemented prior to IRB/EC approval. 
Notwithstanding, the need for formal approval of a protoco l amendm ent, the inves tigator 
is expected to take any immediate action required for the safe ty of any subject  included  in 
this study, even if this action represents  a devia tion from the protocol. In such cases,  GSK  
shou ld be notified of this action, the IRB/EC at the study site, and, if required by local 
regula tions, the relevant  health authori ty) shou ld be informe d within 10 working days.  
12.4.7.  Publication policy  
GSK aims to publish the results of this study in searchable, peer reviewed scientific 
literature. GSK will target to submit within 18 months from LSLV for interventional 
studies and from the completion of the analysis for non -interventional studies and follows 
the guidance from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  
12.4.8.  Dissemina tion of clinical study d ata 
The key design elements of this protocol will be posted on the GSK Clinical Study 
Register and on publicly accessible registers including ClinicalTrials.gov. Where 
required, protocol summaries will also be posted on national or regional clinical trial 
registers or databases (e.g. EudraCT database) in compliance with the applicable 
regulations.  
GSK also assures that results will be submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov within the required

explained if necessary (e.g. via an audit trail). Safety and rights of subjects must be  
protected  and study be conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and 
any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all app licable regulatory requirements.  
Quality tolerance limits (QTLs) will be pre -defined in the  study management plan  to 
identify systematic issues that can impact participant safety and/or the reliability of 
study results. These pre -defined parameters will be  monitored during the study. 
Important deviations from the QTLs and remedial actions taken will be summarised in 
the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Trial records and source documents, including signed ICF, pertaining to the conduct of 
this study must be reta ined by the investigator for 25 years from the issue of the final

12.5.  Appendix  5: Adverse Events: definitions and procedures for 
recordi ng, evaluating, follow -up, and r eporting  
12.5.1.  Definition of AE  
12.5.1.1.  AE Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the 
study treatment.  
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavo urable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), sy mptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study treatment.  
12.5.1.2.  Examples of e vents Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chro nic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
administration even though they may have been present prior to th e start of the study.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  129 • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
vaccine(s)/product(s ) or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be 
reported as an AE/SAE).  
• Signs, symptoms temporally associated with study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
administration.  
• Significant failure of expected pharmacological or biological action.  
• Pre- or post -treatment events that occur as a result of protocol -mandated pr ocedures 
(i.e. invasive procedures, modification of subject’s previous therapeutic regimen).  
• Signs, symptoms that require medical attention (e.g. hospital stays, physician visits 
and emergency room visits).  
AEs to be recorded as endpoints (solicited AEs) a re described in Section  12.5.3 . All other 
AEs will be recorded as UNSOLICITED AEs.  
The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack  of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE.  
12.5.1.3.  Examples of e vents NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g. social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
• Pre-existing conditions or signs and/or symptoms present in a su bject prior to the 
first study vaccination. These events will be recorded in the medical history section 
of the eCRF . 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that 
leads to the procedure is an AE/SAE.  
12.5.2.  Definition of SAE  
A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life -threatening,  
Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospital isation, 
Note: In general, hospital isation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emer gency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Complications 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  130 that occur during hospital isation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospital isation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered 
serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospital isation’ occurred , or was necessary, 
the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospital isation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition  (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, OR  
Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject.  
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in  other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospital isation but may jeopard ise the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes liste d in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. 
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions

Note: subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to measure and record the  
oral body temperature in the evening , ideally at the same time each day . Should 
additional temperature measurements be performed at other times of day, 
subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to record the highest temperature in 
the eDiary .  
Note: If the body temperature is measured by any other route ( other th an oral ), this also 
needs to be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
12.5.4.  Other solicited adverse  events  
The use of analgesics/antipyretics for either prophylactic or treatment purposes will be 
recorded as other solicited events in the Subject eDiary and subsequentl y recorded onto 
the eCRFs and subject medical records.  
The study staff must review the data entered into the Subject eDiary as described in 
Section 12.5.9 . 
12.5.5.  Unsolicited  adverse events  
An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not solicited using an eDiary and that was 
spontaneously communicated by a subjects/parent(s)/LAR(s) who has signed the 
informe d consent.  
Potential unsolicited AEs may be medically attended (i.e., symptoms or illnesses 
requiring a hospital isation, or emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider). 
The subjects/ subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact  the site as soon as 
possible to report medically attended event(s), as well as any events that, though not 
medically attended, are of subject/ parental /LAR’s concern. Detailed information about 
reported unsolicited AEs will be collected by qualified site  personnel and documented in 
the subject ’s records.  
Unsolicited AEs that are not medically attended nor perceived as a concern by 
subject/subject’s  parent(s)/LAR(s) will be collected during interview with the 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

12.5.6.  Adverse events of special interest  (AESI s) 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) are predefined (serious or non -serious) 
adverse events of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or pro gram, for 
which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor 
can be appropriate, because such an event might warrant further investigation in order to 
character ise and understand it.  
12.5.6.1.  Arthritis  
Cases of arthritis are defined  according to the following ad -hoc definition:  
• Presence of a physical exam findings of swelling, redness, heat, or limitation in 
range of motion and/or  
• Presence of a diagnostic imaging studies interpreted by a health care provider as 
demonstrating evidence  of joint inflammation and/or arthrocentesis results 
evidencing inflammation.  
Due to the heterogeneity of the presentation of arthritis which can be either acute or 
chronic, the threshold of duration of 6 weeks is to be considered.  
The list of PTs corresponding to the diagnosis of arthritis, are those included in the 
MedDRA SMQ Narrow “Arthritis”. For any new diagnosis of arthritis (serious or non -
serious) in a study subject, the investigator (or designate) must complete, an electronic 
Expedited Adv erse Events Report and an ad -hoc eCRF page on arthritis to further 
character ise this AESI.  
12.5.6.2.  Potential immune -mediated diseases  
Potential immune -mediated diseases (pIMDs) are a subset of AESIs that include 
autoimmune diseases and other inflammatory and/or ne urologic disorders of interest 
which may or may not have an autoimmune aetiology. AEs that need to be recorded and 
reported as pIMDs include those listed in the Table 27. 
However, the investigator will exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in 
deciding whether other diseases have an autoimmune origin (i.e. pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ -specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and shou ld also be 
recorded as a pIMD.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2021  135 When there is enough evidence to make any of the above diagnoses, the AE must be 
reported as AESI. Symptoms, signs or conditions which might (or might not) represent 
the above diagnoses, should be recorded and reported as AEs but not as AESI until the 
final or definitive diagnosis has been determined, and alternative diagnoses have been 
eliminated or sh own to be less likely.  
In order to facilitate the documentation of pIMDs in the eCRF, a pIMD standard 
questionnaire and a list of MedDRA preferred terms (PTs)  and PT codes corresponding to 
the above diagnoses will be available to investigators at study sta rt. 
12.5.7.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as adverse events or serious adverse events  
In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g. clinical chemistry, 
haematology, urinalysis) or  other abnormal assessments  (e.g. x -ray imaging studies ) that 
are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AE or SAE 
if they meet the definition of an AE or SAE (refer to Sections 12.5.1  and 12.5.2 ). 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that 
are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will also 
be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically significant abnormal labor atory findings 
or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being studied,  unless 
judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or 
that are present or detected at the start of the study and do no t worsen, will not be 
reported as AEs or SAEs.  
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding,  or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
12.5.8.  Events or outcomes not qua lifying as adverse events or serious

at the discretion of the investigator.  
While pregnancy is not considered an AE or SAE, any adverse pregnancy outcome or 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded 
and reported as an AE or a SAE.  
Note: The pregnancy sh ould always be recorded on a n electronic pregnancy report

spontaneous abortion.  
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered 
by the investigator to be reasonably related to the study vaccine(s)/product(s) will be 
reported to GSK as described in Section  12.5.10 . While the investigator is not obligated 
to actively seek this information from former s ubjects , he/she  may learn of a pregnancy

An Electronic Diary (eDiary) hereafter referred to as Subject eDiary will be used in this 
study to capture solicited local and systemic AEs. The subject  or subject’s parent/LAR  
should be trained on how and when to complete each field of the Subject eDiary.  
The subjects/subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately should the subjects manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as serious  
or concerning .  
Subject eDiary training should be directed at the individual(s) who will perform the 
measurements of AEs and who will enter the information into the Subject eDiary. This 
individual may  not be the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s), but if a person other than 
the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) enters information into the Subject eDiary, this 
person’s identity must be documented in the subject’s source document . Any individual 
that ma kes entries into the Subject eDiary must receive training on completion of the 
Subject eDiary at the time of the visit when Subject eDiary is dispensed. This training 
must be documented in the subject’s source document . 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

the completion of the Subject eDi ary remains with the subject ’s parent(s)/LAR(s). The 
investigator should discuss this accountability with the subject ’s parent(s)/LAR(s).  
Each subject/subject’s parent(s)s/LAR(s) will be assigned a Subject eDiary at Visit 1 and 
shown how to use the device – this will include how to access the diary, performing test 
data entry on sample questions, and how to charge and store the device.   
The subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) will have to  bring their completed eDiar ies at 
Visit 2  and Visit 4, and  return it at  Visit 6 . The r eturned Subject eDiaries should be

Refer to the SPM for more information regarding the use of eDiary.  
Note: Any solicited AE that meets any of the following criteria must be entered into 
subjects’ source docum ent (see Section 12.5.9 ) and also as an AE on the Adverse Event

• Solicited local or systemic AE that continues beyond day 7 after vaccination not 
captured in the eDiary.  
• Solicited local or systemic AE that leads to a visit to a healthcare provider (medically 
attended AE, see Section 12.5.9.3.3 ). 
• Solicited local or systemic AE leading to the subject withdrawing from the study or 
the subject being withdrawn from the study by the investigator ( AE leading to 
withdrawal).  
• Solicited local or systemic AE that otherwise meets the definition of a n SAE (see 
Section 12.5.2 ) or an AESI (See Section 12.5.6 ). 
Any new safety information reported during the safety follow -up phone call or site visits 
cannot be entered into the Subject eDiary. Such information must be described in the 
source documents as a verbally -reported event. Any adverse event rep orted in this 
fashion must be described as an unsolicited AE and therefore entered into the eCRF.

If the subject/subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) wishes to describe safety information, this 
information should only be collected by a qualified healthcare professional at  the site, and 
the safety data described must be written down in the subject’s medical chart.

All solicited AE s during  7 days following administration of each dose  of study 
vaccine(s)/product(s)  (Day  1 to Day  7) (at Visit 1, Visit 3 and Visit 5) must be recorded 
in the eDiary, irrespective of intensity . Solicited local and  systemic events that are 
ongoing after th e 7-day reporting period may continue to be recorded in the eDiary until 
resolution or up to 30 days post -vaccination (ie, recording period for unsolicited AEs) 
whichever occurs first and do not need to be entered as an AE in the AE eCRF or the 
subject’s source document . Any solicited AE that has not resolved within 30 days post 
vaccination and is reported during clinic visits or safety follow -up calls will be entered 
into the subject’s eCRF as an unsolicited AE.  It will also be included in the subject’s 
source documents at the site by the investigator/site staff as a verbally reported event. It 
will not be included in the Subject eDiary. These AEs will be analysed as unsolicited AEs 
(i.e. in the Unsolicited Safety Set).  
All other AEs during 30 days followi ng administration of each dose  of study 
vaccine(s)/product(s)  (Day  1 to Day  30) (at Visit 1, Visit 3 and Visit 5) must be recorded 
in the appropriate section of the eCRF , irrespective of intensity or whether or not they are 
considered vaccination -related.  
The time period for collecting and recording SAEs will begin at the first  receipt of study 
vaccine(s) /product(s)  and will end 6 months following administration of the study 
vaccines (Day 361 (T7) for each subject . See Section  12.5.10  for instructions on reporting 
of SAEs.  In addition to the above -mentioned reporting requirements and in order to fulfil 
international reporting obligations, SAEs tha t are related to study participation (i.e. 
protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing therapy) or are 
related to a concurrent GSK medication/vaccine will be collected and recorded from the 
time the subject consents to participate in the study until she/he is discharged from the 
study.  
All AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study will be collected and recorded from 
the time of the first receipt of study vaccines until study end . 
The time period for collecting and recording preg nancies will begin at the first receipt of

12.5.9.3.  Evaluation of adverse events and serious adverse events  
12.5.9.3.1.  Active questioning to detect adverse events and serious adverse 
events  
As a consistent method of collecting AEs, the subject or the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
should be asked a non -leading question such as:  
‘Have you felt different in any way since receiving the vaccine(s)/product(s ) or since the 
previous visit? ’ (for subjects equal to and above 18 years of age)  
OR 
‘Has your child acted differently or felt different in any way since receiving the 
vaccine(s)/product(s) or since the last visi t?’ (for subjects below 18 years of age)  
When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then re cord all relevant information regarding an 
AE/SAE in the eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the 
subject’s medical records to GSK instead of appropriately completing the eCRF. 
However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested by GSK. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of 
the medical records prior to submission to GSK.  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.

3 : ≥ 40.0°C  (104.0°F)   
The investigator will assess the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the 
event for all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) recorded during the study. The assessment 
will be based on the investigator’s clinical judgement.  
The intensity should be assigned to 1 of the following categor ies: 
1 (mild)  = An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
2 (moderate)  = An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with 
normal everyday activities.  
3 (severe)  = An AE which prevents normal, everyday activities  
(in a young child, such an AE would, for example, prevent 
attendance at school/kindergarten/a day -care centre and would 
cause the parent(s)/LAR(s) to seek medical advice. In 
adults/adolescents, such an AE w ould, for example, prevent 
attendance at work/school and would necessitate the 
administration of corrective therapy.)  
An AE that is assessed as Grade 3 (severe) should not be confused with a SAE. Grade 
3 is a category used for rating the intensity of an e vent; and both AEs and SAEs can be 
assessed as Grade 3. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets 1 of the pre -defined 
outcomes as described in Section  12.5.2 . 
Assessment of causality  
The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study 
vaccine(s)/product(s) and the occurrence of each AE/SAE using clinical judgement. In 
case of concomitant administration of multiple vaccines/products, if possible, the 
investigator should specify if the AE could be causally related to a specific 
vaccine/product administered (i.e . investigational, control/placebo or co -administered 
vaccine). When causal relationship to a specific vaccin e(s)/product(s) cannot be 
determined,  the investigator should indicate the AE to be related to all products.  
Alternative plausible causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, 
concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relatio nship of the event to the 
study vaccine(s)/product(s) will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also 
consult the IB and/or SmPC and/or Prescribing Information for marketed products to 
determine his/her assessment.  
There may be situations w hen a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the 
investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission 
of the Expedited Ad verse Events Report to GSK. The investigator  may change his/her 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

accordingly. The causality assessment is  one of the criteria used when determining 
regulatory reporting re quirements.  
All solicited  local and systemic  AEs will be considered causally related to vaccination . 
Causality of all other AEs should be assessed by the investigator using the following 
question:   
Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE may have bee n caused by the study 
vaccine/product?  
YES  : There is a reasonable possibility that the study vaccine(s)/product(s) 
contributed to the AE.  
NO : There is no reasonable possibility that the AE is causally related to the 
administration of the study vaccine( s)/product(s) . There are other, more 
likely causes and administration of the study vaccine(s)/product(s) is 
not suspected to have contributed to the AE.  
If an event meets the criteria to be determined as ‘serious’ (see Section  12.5.2 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possible contributing factors for each SAE.  
Possible contributing factors  include:  
• Medical history.  
• Other medication.  
• Protocol required procedure.  
• Other procedure not required by the protocol.  
• Lack of efficacy of the vaccine(s)/product(s) (delete as applicable ), if applicable.  
• Erroneous administration.  
• Other cause (specify).  
Assessment of outcomes  
The investigator will assess the outcome of all unsolicited AEs (including SAEs) 
recorded during the study as:  
− Recovered/resolved.  
− Recovering/resolving.  
− Not recovered/not resolved.  
− Recovered with sequelae/resolved with sequelae.  
− Fatal (SAEs only).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Once an investigator becomes aware that a SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator (or designate) must complete  the information in the electronic Expedited 
Adverse Events Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will always be completed as 
thoroughly as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does 
not have all information regarding a SA E, the report should still be completed within 24 
hours. Once additional relevant information is received, the report should be updated 
WITHIN 24 HOURS.  
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report. The investigator will be required to confirm the review of the SAE causality by 
ticking the ‘reviewed’ box in the electronic Expedited Adverse Events Report within 72 
hours of submission of the SAE.  
12.5.10.3.  Back -up system in case the electronic reporting system does n ot work

After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject and provide additional relevant information on the subject’s condition to GSK  
(within 24 hours for SAEs; refer to  Table 15). 
All SAEs  and AESIs  documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not 
recovered/not resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent 
visits/contacts until the last visit/contact  of the subject.  
All AEs documented at a previous visit/contact and designated as not recovered/not 
resolved or recovering/resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/contacts until the 
last visit/contact of the subject . 
12.5.12.4.2.  Follow -up after th e subject is discharged from the study  
The investigator will follow subjects:  
• With SAEs, AESIs (serious and non -serious) or subjects withdrawn from the study 
as a result of an AE, until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilised, disappeared, or 
until th e event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previously reported SAE, 
he/she will provide this information to GSK using a paper/electronic Expedited Adverse 
Events R eport and/or pregnancy report as applicable.  
GSK may request that the investigator performs or arranges the conduct of additional 
clinical examinations/tests and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  The investigator is obliged to assist. If a subject dies 
during participation in the study or during a recognised follow -up period, GSK will be 
provided with any available post -mortem findings, including histopathology.

of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the status of the mother 
and child will be forwarded to GSK using the electronic pregnancy report  and the 
Expedi ted Adverse Events Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period doesn’t 
need to be longer than 6 to 8 weeks after the estimated date of delivery.  
Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs for this study, if the pregnancy outcome is a 
SAE, it sho uld always be reported as SAE . 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

12.6.1.  Definitions  
12.6.1.1.  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permane ntly sterile (see below)  
12.6.1.1.1.  Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP  
• Premenarchal  
Menarche is the onset of menses for the first time in a young female and is preceded 
by several changes associated with puberty including breast development and pubic 
hair growth. Menarche usually occurs within 1 -2 years of breast development, 
thelarche. However, a young female can become pregnant before her first menses. 
Thus, a conservative definition of non -childbearing potential in a pre -menarcheal 
female is a young female who has not yet entered puberty as evidenced by lack of 
breast development (palpable glandular breast tissue).  
• Premenopausal female with ONE of the following:  
− Documented hysterectomy  
− Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
− Documented bilateral  oophorectomy  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of subject ’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
• Postmenopausal female  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the 
postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not 
using hormonal contrac eption or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in 
the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
• Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 
of the non -hormonal highly effecti ve contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrolment.  
12.6.2.  Contraception g uidance  
• Female subjects of childbearing potential are e ligible to participate if they agree to 
use an adequate contraception consistently and correctly according to the methods 
listed in GSK list of highly effective contraceptive methods provided  in Table 29. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Male partner steril isation prior to the female subject’s entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for that 
subject,  
(The information on the male sterility can come from the site personnel’s review of the subject’s medica l records; 
medical examination and/or semen analysis, or medical history interview provided by her or her partner).  
Sexual abstinence  
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to  the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject .)

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  151 12.8.2.  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and USADE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
a. Led to death  
b. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either  resulted 
in: 
− A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the 
definition of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
− A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
− Inpatient or prolonged hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation for a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without s erious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
− Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
c. Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
d. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE (USADE) definition  
• An USADE (also identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
12.8.3.  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs, SADEs and 
USADE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination

12.10.1.  Protocol amendment 4  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment change: The protocol is being amended to 
document the increase in blood volumes drawn at certain visits (Visit 2 and Visit 6) to 
improve the serum yield which is critical to evaluate the study endpoints. The allowed 
window s for study visits during special circumst ances have also been widened  to 
maintain subject visit compliance during the COVID -19 pandemic. Additionally, 
considering that some of the study interventions are combination products constituted of 
a device and biologic product (pre -filled syringes), the amended protocol provides 
instructions for collection of safety information related to the use of medical devices. The 
reporting period for pregnancies has also been updated in line with the current guidelines.

 The blood volume collected at Visit 2 
and Visit 6 has been increased from 
25mL to 30 mL.  This change has been made to

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  157 In Section 5 Study design ; Section 5.1 Scientific rationale for study design:  
Rationale for blood volume collected:  
In order to provide the necessary serum volume for the bactericidal assays (enc -hSBA 
and/ or hSBA(s)), and ELISA  (or equivalent ), approximately  30 mL whole blood will be 
collected at Visit 2 and Visit 6 and approximately 25 mL whole blood will be collected 
at Visit 2,  Visit 4 and Visit 6 . At pre-vaccination (Visit 1), 20 mL whole blood will be 
collected to provide the necessary serum  volume for the hSBA  and ELISA (or 
equivalent ). 
In Section 6.3 Criteria for temporary delay for enrolment and vaccination and/or 
blood sampling : 
*In case an emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g.: a 
pandemic) is organised by the public health authorities, outside the routine immunisation 
program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that va ccine 
provided it is licensed and used according to its Prescribing Information and according to  
the local governmental recommendations and provided a written approval of  that the 
Sponsor is obtained  notified accordingly.

In Section 8.4.2.1, Blood sampling for effectiveness and immunogenicity response 
assessments : 
A minimum  of approximately  20 m L of blood will be drawn fr om all subject s at visit 1 
before vaccina tion, .and aApproximately 30 mL sample of blood will be drawn from all 
subjects 30 days after the first and third vaccination [at Visit 2 (Day 31)  and Visit 6 
(Day 211) ] and approximately  25 mL sample of blood will be drawn fr om all subject s 
30 days after the first, second and third  vaccina tion (at Visit 2 (Day 31), Visit 4 (Day 91) 
and Visit 6 (Day 211) ). 
The blood samples should be collected before the study vaccination when applicable. The 
blood volume of 25 mL at Visit 2,  Visit 4 and Visit 6  that is drawn as presented in Table 
11 is needed in order to provide the necessary serum volume for the bactericidal assays 
(enc-hSBA and hSBA(s)). Refer to Section 5.1 and Section 7.2.3.1  for further details on 
the rationale for the requirement of this bl ood volume.  
The total amount of blood collected over the study  period per subject will be 
approximately  95 105mL. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

volume could be drawn at Visit 2 and V isit 6. In this population every effort must be done to collect at least 
25ml of blood volume, samples will be analysed according to priority ranking provided in Table 13 
In Section 8.4.3 Laboratory assays  
An Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA ), or equivalent,  will b e used to 
evaluate the serotype -specific IgG responses to A, C, W, and Y.  
Effectiveness testing by enc -hSBA and MenACWY immunogenicity testing by hSBA 
will be prioritised over any other assays using exogenous source of human complement, 
or ELISA  (or equivalent ), based on the volume of serum available for a visit from one

8.5.10  Medical device deficien cies 
The study interventions (MenABCWY and Bexsero) are combination products 
constituted of a device and biologic product (e.g., pre -filled syringes). Refer to Glossary 
of terms for the definition of a combination product and a medical device deficiency.  
8.5.10.1  Detection, follow -up and prompt reporting of medical device deficiency  
The investigator is responsible for the detection, documentation and prompt reporting 
of any medical device deficiency occurring during the study to GSK. This applies to 
any med ical device provided for the conduct of the study.   
Device deficiencies will be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the investigator 
determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a device deficiency. Refer to 
Section 10.6 for definitions and  details on recording and reporting of these events.  
The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any additional investigations to 
elucidate the nature and/or related of the device deficiency to the incident. Follow -up 
applies to all participants,  including those who discontinue study intervention or the 
study.  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all 
changes signed and dated by the investigator and reported to GSK within 24 hours . 
8.5.10.2  Regulatory reporting of medical device deficiency when used as 
combination product  
The investigator will promptly report all device deficiencies occurring with any medical 
device provided for use in the study to GSK. GSK has a legal responsibility to noti fy 
appropriate regulatory authorities and other entities about safety information linked to 
medical devices being used in clinical studies. Refer to Section 12.8.2  for details of 
reporting.  
The investigator, or responsible person according to local require ments (e.g. the head

8.10 Decentralised study procedures  
If local regulations allow and if quality of study procedures can be maintained, 
participant(s) can be offered remo te visits (e.g. home visits)  for the collection of 
biological samples and/or study intervention administration. These remote visits must 
be performed by qualified study staff/healthcare professionals HCPs. Refer to the 
Schedule of Activities ( Table 3) for the timing of these visits.  
Following  procedures can be performed remotely. Refer to the Glossary of terms  for 
definitions of remote virtual visit:  
• Biological samples may be collected remotely by qualified study staff/HCPs . 
Biological samples should be col lected only if they can be processed in a timely 
manner and appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• Administration of study intervention can be performed remotely/at participant’s 
home by qualified study staff/HCPs if appropriate storage conditions f or the study 
intervention can be ensured. Furthermore, appropriate medical treatment must be 
readily available during 30 minutes after dosing in case of anaphylaxis, syncope.  
In Section 10.1, Sample size determination:  
It is assumed that 25% of the subjects will drop -out and not contribute to an evaluable 
result. The remaining subjects who do give an evaluable result provide 90% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of rMenB+OMV NZ and 92% power to 
reject all hypotheses for the primary objectives of MenABCWY vaccine. Additionally, 
the study is powered to reject key secondary objective for three N. meningitidis  serogroup 
B indicator strains (96217 (NadA), M14459 (fHbp), and M07 -0241084  M13520

(pooled lots), MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 groups)  will be logarithmically transformed 
(base10) to fulfil the normal distribution assumption. For each N. meningitidis  serogroup 
A, C, W and Y and each B indicator strain (M14459, 96217, M07 -0241084*  M13520  and

GMRs (post -vaccination/baseline) will be calculated with their associated 2 -sided 95% 
CIs, by exponentiating the corresponding log -transformed means and their 95% CIs. The 
ratio of GMTs and GMRs between two groups and the  corresponding CI will be 
constructed by exponentiating the mean difference and the confidence limits in log10 
(titre), using ANOVA with study centre included as an independent variable.  
For each N. meningitidis  A, C, W and Y and each serogroup B indicator strain (M14459,

titres ≥  LLOQ and of subjects with 4 -fold rise and the corresponding exact 2 -sided 95% 
CIs based on Clopper -Pearson method will be calculated for each study group at each 
timepoint not previously analyzed.  
* The NHBA indicator strain may be subject to change during the study, before 
clinical testing starts. In this case, this change will be documented in the clinical

meningococcal B indicator strains M14459, 96217, NZ98/254 and M07 -0241084  
M13520 . Each of these strai ns measures bactericidal activity primarily directed against 
one of the major bacterial antigens included in the vaccine: strain M14459 measures 
hSBA against the 741 part of the 936 -741 antigen, also known as fHbp variant 1.1; strain 
96217 measures hSBA ag ainst antigen 961c, also known as NadA; strain NZ98/254 
measures hSBA against PorA P1.4, the immunodominant antigen in the OMV NZ 
vaccine component; strain M07 -0241084  M13520  measures hSBA against the 287 part of

12.8 Appendix 8: Definition of medical device AE, adverse device effect (ADE), 
serious adverse device effect (SADE) and unanticipated SADE (USADE)  
12.8.1  Definition of medical device AE and adverse device effect (ADE)  
• Medical device AE is any untoward medi cal occurrence, in a clinical study 
participant, users, or other persons, temporally associated with the use of study 
intervention  whether considered related to a medical device or not. An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a medical device. This definition includes events related 
to the medical d evice or comparator and events related to the procedures involved.  
• An adverse device effect (ADE) is an AE related to the use of a medical device. 
This definition includes any AE resulting from:  
• insufficient or inadequate instructions for use (i.e. user er ror), or  
• any malfunction of a medical device, or  
• intentional misuse of the medical device.  
12.8.2  Definition of medical device SAE, SADE and USADE  
A medical device SAE is any serious adverse event that:  
e. Led to death  
f. Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant, that either resulted 
in: 
• A life -threatening illness or injury. The term ‘life -threatening' in the 
definition of ‘serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk 
of death at the time of the event. It does not refe r to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
• A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function.  
• Inpatient or prolonged hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation for a pre -
existing condition, or a procedure  required by the protocol, without serious 
deterioration in health, is not considered an SAE.  
• Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury 
or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function  
g. Led to fetal distre ss, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Protocol Amendment 4 Final 
9 May 2021  166 h. Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) definition  
• A SADE is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event.  
• Any device deficiency that might have led to an SAE if appropriate action had 
not been taken or circumstances had been less fortunate.  
Unanticipated SADE (USADE) definition  
• An USADE (also  identified as UADE in US Regulations 21 CFR 813.3),  is a 
serious adverse device effect that by its nature, incidence, severity or outcome 
has not been identified in the current version of the IB.  
12.8.3  Recording and reporting of medical device AE, ADEs,  SADEs and USADE  
• Any device deficiency must be reported to GSK within 24 hours after the 
investigator determines that the event meets the definition of a device deficiency.  
• E-mail/Facsimile transmission of the paper ‘Medical device or combination 
product w ith device deficiency/incident report form’ is the preferred method to 
transmit this information to the sponsor.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of ‘Medical device or comb ination product 
with device deficiency/incident report form’ sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Contacts for reporting can be found in Section 8.5.6.1 . 
GSK will review all device deficiencies, determine and document in writing whether 
they could ha ve led to an SAE. These device deficiencies will be reported to the 
regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs as required by national regulations.

Section 3.1 Study rationale  
In 2013, the United States ( US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agreed with the 
Company proposal to evaluate meningococcal B vaccine effectiveness against a large 
panel of the US epidemiologically relevant invasive disease strains of Neisseria 
meningitidis  (N. meningitidis) serogroup  B in adolescents using serum bactericidal assay 
with endogenous human complement (enc -hSBA). This panel includes 110 serogroup B 
strains selected from the original panel of 442 endemic strains identified as appropriately 
representative of invasive meningo coccal serogroup B strains detected in the US by the 
US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [Welsch, 2018]. Following licensure of Bexsero  
(rMenB+OMV NZ) in the US in 2015, under accelerated approval regulations, GSK was 
requested to demonstrate effectivenes s of Bexsero  via a post -approval confirmatory trial 
in US adolescents and young adults.  
Study 3.2 Background  
N.eisseria  meningitidis  is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and sepsis worldwide, 
capable of causing outbreaks and epidemics of invasive di sease. N. meningitidis  
infections causing invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) are an important public health 
concern worldwide due to the substantial morbidity and mortality they cause, as well as 
the transmissibility of these infections. In healthy indiv iduals, IMD can rapidly progress 
to serious clinical disease and may be associated with poor outcomes, including fatality in 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

disease in adolescents and young adults.  
…. In the EU, the vaccine is indicated for use in individuals 2 years of age and older, and 
in the United States ( US), in individuals 2 months to 55 years of age.  
Bexsero  is indicated for active immunisation against invasive disease caused by Neisseria

Section 5.1  Scientific rationale for study design  
As the rMenB+OMV NZ licensure in the US was issued through accelerated approval, 
the FDA has requested to demonstrate the e ffectiveness of the vaccine against an 
extended panel of serogroup B meningococcal strains (MenB) as a post -marketing 
commitment in US adolescents and young adults, thus confirming that the vaccine can 
protect against diverse meningococcal B strains preval ent in the United States US.  
The availability of a pentavalent meningococcal vaccine in a single administration would 
however reduce the number of injections and could increase coverage for meningococcal 
disease caused by N. meningitidis  serogroups A, B, C, W, and Y worldwide. GSK’s 
investigational MenABCWY combination vaccine is intended to protect against 5 of the 
most prevalent serogroups of Neisseria  N. meningitidis  (A, B, C, W, Y) in humans.  
Rationale for the selected vaccination sch edules  
rMenB+OMV NZ: This study aims at to demonstrate demonstrating  the VE of the 
rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine administered as 2 -dose vaccine, either with a shorter interval 
(0,2-months) or a prolonged interval (0,6 -months) between doses. A 3 -dose schedule has 
also been also added to better characterise the VE with an alternative dose regimen as a 
post approval requirement from the US FDA .

in the US [ACIP, 2011]) , the subjects in these groups will receive a vaccination of 
MenACWY and rMenB+OMV NZ vaccines, respectively, on Day 211 (Visit 6) after 
completion of the post -vaccination 3 blood sampling. To maintain the blinding of the 
study, subjects in the rest of the  groups (MenB_0_6, ABCWY -1, ABCWY -2 and 
ABCWY -3) will receive a dose of Placebo. All these vaccines/ products 
administered at Day 211 are not associated with any study objectives/ endpoints 
(sSafety assessment conducted after 1 dose of rMenB+OMV NZ in the ACWY 
group at Day 181 is to maintain the blind of the study).  
** Note 1:  (1) A single MenB lot will be used for the pre -filled syringe component 
of the MenABCWY vaccine ; (2) Note 2: The groups ABCWY -1, ABCWY -2, 
ABCWY -3 will be pooled into a single group, ABCWY (pooled lots) (except for 
analysis of lot -to-lot consistency).

9 May 2021  186 Section 7.2.2.2.1  Study group and treatment number allocation  
The target will be to enrol a total of 3651 eligible subjects who will be randomly assigned 
to 6 study groups in a 5:5:3:3:3:1 ratio (912 each in MenB_0_2_6 and MenB_0_6 groups, 
548 in each ABCWY group and 183 in ACWY group).  
Allocation of the subject to a study group/a treatme nt number at the investigator site will 
be performed using a randomisation system on internet (SBIR). The randomisation 
algorithm will use a minimisation procedure accounting for study, region (US and ex -US 
countries) , previous MenACWY vaccination? (Yes an d No)*, and age category (10 -17 
years of age and 18 -25 years of age). Minimisation factors will have equal weight in the 
minimisation algorithm.  
To ensure adequate representation in the US in line with the post -marketing commitment 
(Section 3.1), a minimum  of 30% of adolescents and young adults will be enrolled in the 
US. 
After obtaining the signed and dated ICF/IAF from the subject/subject’s parent/LAR and 
having checked the eligibility of the subject, the blinded  site staff in charge of the 
vaccine/produc t administration will access SBIR. Upon providing the subject 
identification number, the subject’s age category and previous MenACWY vaccination? 
(Yes/ No)*, the randomisation system will determine the study group and will provide the 
treatment number to b e used for each dose. Region does not have to be given as an input 
by the site staff as SBIR deduces it from the site ID.   
The number of each administered treatment must be recorded in the eCRF on the Vaccine 
Administration screen.  
When SBIR is not availab le, please refer to the SBIR user guide or the SPM for specific 
instructions.  
If for any reason, after randomisation the subject fails to undergo treatment, this is an 
early Termination and the reason should be recorded in source document as specified in 
the SDA.  
Note that enrolment will be frozen  as soon as the target number s (Table 7) are reached  
in a group has been reached . Refer to the SPM for further details . (refer to Table 7), the 
enrolment will be frozen for this group.  
Note: * Subjects with and without a previous MenACWY vaccination (primed and 
unprimed).  
Section 7.2.3.1 Randomisation to strains for enc -hSBA testing  
The evaluation of the randomly selected panel of invasive serogroup B strains (110 
strains) for each vaccinated s ubject is not technically feasible with clinically acceptable 
blood volumes drawn from adolescents and young adults. Thus, in addition to 
randomisation of enrolled subjects to the rMenB+OMV NZ or MenABCWY and ACWY 
groups,  For each applicable serum sample, 35 strains will be chosen completely at 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

resulting in a list of planned strains [from the 110 -panel] per subject per acquired blood 
sample of sufficient volume for testing.  
• These strains were randomly ordered into a testing sequence. This testing sequence 
will be used to define a list of strains to be tested for each subject. Within each study 
group, each subject will be randomly assigned to a start strain in the pre -ordered  
sequence of 110 invasive disease serogroup B strains (e.g., strain 1 or 5 or 101). The 
randomisation algorithm will use a block size of 110 (i.e., a start strain will not be 
repeated for 110 subjects within each block), to ensure as much as possible, a si milar 
number of subjects tested for each strain.  
• The target number of strains to be tested for each subject will be 35 strains.  
• The serum sample collected from each subject will be sent on an ongoing basis to 
GSK Clinical Laboratory Sciences or to laborato ries delegated by GSK where the 
assays are available and qualified for the intended use. Aliquots for immunogenicity 
and enc -hSBA testing will be prepared depending on the serum volume available for 
a visit from one subject. A minimum amount of 5 mL of ser um needs to be available 
to confirm eligibility to perform enc -hSBA testing. Additional instruction on the 
number of strains to be randomly assigned for enc -hSBA testing, according to the 
actual sample volume of serum provided to the laboratory, is provide d in Section 
10.1.2.  
Section 7.3 Blinding and unblinding  
Data will be collected in an observer -blind manner. By observer -blind, it is meant that 
during the course of the study, the vaccine(s)/product(s) recipient and those responsible 
for the evaluation of any study endpoint (e.g. safety, reactogenicity, and eff ectiveness) 
will all be unaware of which vaccine/product was administered. To do so, 
vaccine/product preparation and administration will be done by qualified healthcare 
professional who will not participate in any of the study clinical evaluation. A minimu m 
number of study site personnel responsible for preparing and / or delivering the injections 
will be unblinded. See Glossary of terms for definition of qualified healthcare 
professional and unblinded study staff. The tasks of the unblinded site staff are limited to 
storage, registration of the storage temperature, drug accountability, preparation and 
administration of the study vaccines. No other tasks are to be performed. Site personnel 
responsible for delivering the injection must not be involved in stud y assessments. The 
study vaccine / placebo will be provided to the site as subjects’ kits, similar in 
appearance, identified with treatment information (either Meningococcal Group B 
Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups A, B, C, W and Y Vaccine or Meningococcal Groups 
A, C, Y and W Conjugate Vaccine or placebo). Refer to SPM for details.  
Except in the case of medical necessity, a subject’s treatment should not be unblinded 
without the approval of the Sponsor. In such instance of medical emergency, every effort 
should be made to contact the Sponsor prior to unblinding. If unblinding should occur (by 
either accidental unblinding or emergency unblinding for a serious adverse event) prior to 
completion of the study, the investigator must promptly contact the Sponsor a nd 
document the circumstances on the appropriate forms. Instructions regarding emergency 
unblinding will be provided to the investigator (See Section 7.3.1).  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

Section 8.2 Data collected fro m Subjects  
• Post-vaccination solicited local and systemic AEs collected at home by subject 
and/or subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and recorded in the Subject eDiary for 7 days 
following each vaccination visit (at Day 1, Day 61 and Day 181). Any ongoing event 
(beyond 7 days) may be followed up for 30 days or until resolution, whichever is 
earlier, in the eDiary.  Any solicited AE that has not resolved within 30 days post 
vaccination and is reported during clinic visits or safety follow -up calls will be 
entered i nto the subject’s eCRF as an unsolicited AE. It will also be included in 
the subject’s source documents at the site by the investigator/site staff as a verbally 
reported event . It will not be included in the Subject eDiary. These AEs will be 
analyzed as un solicited AEs (i.e. in the Unsolicited Safety Set).  
Section 8.3.5  Pregnancy test  
Urine samples will be collected for pregnancy testing in females of child -bearing 
potential, before vaccinations at Visits 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the results recorded in the source 
document and the eCRF.  
Section 8.4 Effectiveness and/or immunogenicity assessments  
Future findings may make it desirable to use the samples acquired in this study for future 
further  research, not described in this protocol. Additional serological testing may be 
performed in the future to further characterise the antibody response to the antigens 
included in the study vaccines or hSBA against an additional  panel of strains of Neisseria  
species.  
Therefore, all subjects in countries where this is allowed  will be asked to give a specific 
consent to allow GSK or a contracted partner to use the samples for future further  
research. Future Further  research will be subject to prior EC/IRB approval if required 
per local legislation.  
Section 8.4.3 Laboratory assays  
An Enzyme -Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) will be used to evaluate the 
serotype -specific IgG responses to A, C, W, and Y. The intent is  to 
characterise characterize  whether the immunogenicity measured by hSBA using the 
MenA, C, W and Y indicator strains may be confounded by the contribution of the 
responses against the MenB antigens of the combination vaccine. The ELISA procedure 
is used t o detect the amount of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in response to 
specific N. meningitidis  polysaccharide antigens.  205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

9 May 2 021 192 Section 8.5.6.2  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or  other 
specific safety information (e.g. summary or listing of SAE s) from the sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
Section 8.8.  Study Termi nation Visit/ Study Conclusion  
The study termination call will occur on Day 361541. The termination visit will be a 
phone call (also in case of early termination of the study).  
The date of termination is the date of the last contact (telephone call) in wh ich the 
subject’s health status was assessed or, in cases where the subject does not agree to any 
further safety follow -up, it is the date consent is withdrawn. This date should be recorded 
on the termination eCRF page. For visit procedures to be performed  for a subject whose 
planned study participation ends prematurely, please see Section 8.8.1.  
During the phone call at the end of the study (Day 361541), the following procedures will 
be performed: interview of subject and/or parent(s)/legal guardian(s) to collect SAEs, 
AESIs, medically attended AEs, pregnancies and/or concomitant medications/ 
vaccinations.  
Section 8.9  Study procedures during special circumstances  
During special circumstances (e.g., COVID -19 pandemic), the specific guidance from 
local publi c health and other competent authorities regarding the protection of 
individuals’ welfare must be applied. For the duration of such special circumstances, 
the following measures may be implemented for enrolled subjects:  
• If the Subject eDiary device was pr ovided to the subject, it may be returned to the 
site by conventional mail after the end of the relevant data collection period (Visit 
6). 
• Study visits may be performed  at a different location* other than the study site (e.g. 
at subject’s home). For study visits involving blood draw, biological samples 
should not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely manner or 
appropriately stored until the intended use.  
• If despite best efforts i t is not possible to collect the biological samples within the 
interval predefined in the protocol (see Table 4), then the interval may be extended 
as described below in Table 17.  
• If despite best efforts it is not possible to administer the dose of study intervention 
as defined in the protocol (see Table 4 then the interval may be extended as 
described below in Table 17.  
* It is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an alternate location. The 
investigator should ensure that this alternate location  meets ICH GCP 
requirements, such as adequate facilities to perform study procedures, appropriate 
training of the staff and documented delegation of responsibilities in this location. 205416 | Protocol Amendment 4 12 May 2021 | TMF-12466267 | 1.0

In case of home visits, the study procedures should be carried out by a qualified 
person/s as delegated by the Principal Investigator, provided that t he compliance 
with protocol procedures are ensured. Refer to Schedule of Activities for the 
schedule of visits (see Table 3).  
Refer to local regulations on the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID -19

• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of  the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK  
• Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal  
status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• Note: Conventionally, the estimated gestational age (EGA) of a pregnancy is dated 
from the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) of the cycle in which a woman 
conceives. If the  LMP is uncertain or unknown, dating of EGA and the estimated 
date of delivery (EDD) should be estimated by ultrasound examination and recorded 
in the pregnancy report.  
12.8.1  Protocol amendment 1  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment /Administrative change : As per the 
recommendation from Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) [IND 
11561 Amendments 257, 283 – CBER comments on Study Protocol V72_72 Version 1, 
dated February 08, 2019], the scope of the study has been extended to include the 3 -dose 
(0-,2-,6-month) schedule and an additional 2 -dose schedule (0 -,6-month) along with the 
2-dose (0 -,2-month) schedule planned originally. The study will assess the 
immunogenicity of the 2 -dose and 3 -doses vaccination with rMenB+OMV NZ vaccine 
along with effec tiveness and safety.

Detailed description of Protocol Amendment changes:  As per process, the changed 
text of the amendment change should be indicated in bold italics in the body of the 
protocol. The deleted text (strikethrough) and the changed text (bold italics) is to be 
provided in this appendix . However due to the extensive nature of this amendment, the 
changes in the body of the protocol are indicated in the bold italics only at one instance. 
In this section , explanation has been provided for the changes done throughout the 
document. The track changes document can be referre d to see all the change s made to the 
protocol (at Amendment 1).  
Other changes: As the sponsorship of the study has changed from Novartis Vaccines to 
GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ (GSK), the protocol has been transcribed to the GSK’s 
protocol template ( DS-BIO-CLIN -1000 vs 16.1 ). All applicable & mandatory sections 
and text have been included during the template transfer without highlighting the 
changes. Table 2 and Section 12.9 only present the rationale and the changes made to the

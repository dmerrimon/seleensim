1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives of this research.  
Response: This study aims to im plement information technology 
(telemedicine) for improvement in hea lth care delivery to the difficult to 
reach and underserved patient population of people with substance use 
disorders (PWSUD) who are on opi ate agonist treatment (OAT).    
Primary specific aim: To compare the effectiveness of a patient-centered, 
OAT-integrated telemedicine-based appr oach for management and delivery 
of HCV treatment to PWSUD versus usua l carereferral to an offsite location 
for HCV management. The effectiven ess will be expressed through the 
primary patient centered and clinic al outcome, achievement of viral 
eradication or sustained virologic re sponse (SVR), defined as undetectable 
HCV RNA 12 weeks post tr eatment cessation.   
Our secondary aims are:  
a. Comparison of treatment initiation rates between the two arms, as 
measured by the proportion of patients th at take an initial medication dose. b. 
Comparison of treatment completion rates between the two arms.  
c. Comparison of patient satisfaction with health care delivery between 
the two arms as assessed through th e Hepatitis C Patient Satisfaction 
Questionnaire, Mini Mental Health Sc reen, National Institute on Drug Abuse 
Quick Screen, Drug Abuse Screening Test  and Socio-demographics Survey.   
d. Comparison of treatment adherenc e rates between the two arms, as 
measured by attendance at scheduled specialists, telemedi cine visits, and 
medication adherence.  
e. Resource utilization between the two arms  
f.  Association between social deter minants of health and pursuit of HCV 
 
treatment in both arms. 
   
 
Interview substudy:   
g) Understand from the patient point-of-v iew the barriers and facilitators 
  
  
  Page 5 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   for pursing telemedicine  treatment of HCV. 
 
 
h) Understand the role that knowledg e of new treatment s or innovative 
  
technologies play in patient’s willin gness to be treated for HCV.   
i) From the staff point of view, what are the ba rriers and facilitators o f 
  
establishing telemedicine as a method to integrate behavioral and medical 
 
treatment. 
   
  
 1.2  State the hypotheses to be  tested, if applicable.   
NOTE:  A hypothesis is a specific, testable prediction about what you expect to 
happen in your study that corresponds with your above listed objectives.  
Response:   
The primary hypothesis is a patient-cent ered OAT-integrated, telemedicine-
based approach for delivery of HCV care that addresses PWSUDs’ specific 
needs will lead to improved treatm ent outcomes compared to usual care, 
which in most cases we assume will be  referral to an offsite location for 
HCV management.   
2.0 Scientific Endpoints

3.0 Background  
3.1 Provide the scientific or scholarly background, rational e, and significance of the 
research based on the existing literature and how it will contribute to existing 
  Page 6 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   knowledge.  Describe any gaps in cu rrent knowledge.  Include relevant 
preliminary findings or prior re search by the investigator.   
Response:   
HCV infection is a leading cause of chronic liver disease affecting more 
than 120 million people globally1 and ~5 million in the United States 
(US)2. Approximately 80% of HCV-exposed individuals develop chronic 
infection that can progre ss to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. As 50% to 
75% of those infected are unaware of their status3, the impetus to diagnose 
and to treat chronic HCV is tremen dous. Currently, HCV is the leading 
indication for liver tran splantation in the US4. The prevalence of HCV-
related liver cirrhosis is predicted to increase from 25% in 2010 to 45% by 
2030 and liver-related deaths are pr ojected to increase by 175% over the 
next decade5. Injection drug use is the prim ary route of HC V transmission; 
estimated HCV prevalence among PWSUD is 30% to 70% while incidence 
ranges from 16% to 42% per year6,7. Of those with chronic HCV infection, 
56% have a history of  injection drug use8.   
Recent therapeutic advances have ra dically improved HCV treatment.  
Using a combination of orally admi nistered, direct acting antivirals 
(DAAs), treatment is curative in mo re than 90% of individuals with 
virtually no side effects and substantia lly shortened treatment duration (i.e., 
8 to 12 weeks)9,10,11. Previously, interferon (IFN) was prescribed for HCV 
and had significant, frequently treatment-limiting side effects12,13.  
Despite these advances, DAA dissemina tion to PWSUD has been limited. 
Consequently, new patient-centered appro aches are critical to deliver these 
medications to those most desperate for treatment. PWSUD referral to an 
HCV specialist is the current usual HCV management strategy. 
Unfortunately, despite the majori ty (>70%) of PWSUD indicating 
willingness to pursue HCV treatment, only 21% to 65% of HCV 
seropositive PWSUD have been ev aluated for HCV and only a minor 
percentage (1% to 6%) actually receives therapy14,15,9,10. The importance 
of HCV treatment among PWSUD will only increase as a result of an 
increase in acute HCV cases among injection drug users < 30 years11.   
Treatment of substance use:  Of treatments availabl e for opiate dependence, 
methadone maintenance when combined  with medical, psychiatric, and 
socioeconomic support services has the highest probability of 
effectiveness16. Because of a concern of illegal sale and distribution of 
methadone, most patients receivi ng methadone through an OAT program 
are required to attend clinic a ppointments 3 to 6 days per week16. The 
frequency of required OAT program vi sits provides an opportunity for 
otherwise hard-to-reach patients to  access health care services, an 
important consideration as many PW SUDs experience multiple health 
problems, including higher rates of  viral hepatitis, HIV and sexually 
transmitted infections compar ed to the gene ral population17. Many OAT 
programs also represent a primary health  care site for their patients.   
For this study we are implementing and evaluating a patient centered, OAT 
program-integrated telemedicine appro ach for the management and delivery 
of HCV care to diverse PWSUD populat ions compared with usual care 
  Page 7 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   (referral). The patient-ce ntered telemedicine approach, based on diffusion 
of innovations theory (DOI), is key for the intervention and treatment of 
HCV, and ultimately other frequent co-morbid conditions that affect 
PWSUD18.  
  
Interview substudy:  
Patients: As part of our ongoing PC ORI study, we have collected patient 
surveys that assess their re sponses and reactions to te lemedicine or referral 
-based care for HCV. We have also  recently completed a study that 
identified themes derived from case managers’ stories of HCV treatment. 
We identified three themes as being im portant for pursuit of HCV care: 1) 
trust in the opioid treatment program (OTP), 2) identifi cation of competing 
priorities, and 3) personalizing care so that identified priorities are 
addressed. Satisfactorily addressing these issues enables pursuit of HCV 
care (Talal, Jaanimägi, et al ., 2020; Zeremski et al., 2014).  
We now propose to pursue a study of patient interviews and focus groups 
for a more in depth assessment of th eir reactions to telemedicine and 
referral-based care. Our e xperiences have shown that  direct patient contact 
is the most effective met hod to assess reactions to an intervention in this 
population (Talal et al., 2019). We will utilize the in terviews to pursue a 
mixed qualitative/quantitative manuscript combining the patient reaction 
data with the already collected survey data.  
Staff – In 2013, we published a paper on clinical staff attitudes toward 
onsite HCV treatment within the OTP (T alal et al., 2013). In  other work, we 
have shown that knowledge of HCV na tural history and treatment improves 
the likelihood of primar y care providers pursuing HCV screening (Samuel, 
Martinez, Chen, Markatou, & Talal, 2018).Our goal now is to update our 
knowledge of barriers and facilitators to HCV tr eatment pursuit among staff 
at substance use treatmen t programs, to identify barriers to telemedicine 
and how they have been overcome, a nd considerations and lessons learned 
about telemedicine implementation from  the point of view of the staff 
working at or leading OTPs (T alal, Sofikitou, et al., 2020).

4.0 Study Design  
4.1 Describe and explain the study design (e.g. case-control, cross-sectional, 
ethnographic, experimental, interven tional, longitudinal, observational).  
Response:   Our study will be conducted as a non-blinded Stepped Wedge 
Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial with two arms: Onsite HCV 
management through telemedicine versus HCV management through 
usual care, which in most cases will be referral to an offsite liver specialist 
(Referral). The arm assignment will be at the cluster (clinic) level. After an 
initial period 9 months) in which al l OAT clinics implement the control 
intervention (usual care), at regu lar intervals (i.e., the “steps”) of  9 months 
duration each, one group of OAT clinics will be randomized to cross over 
from the Usual Care arm to the Telemedicine arm. In this way, there will 
be enough time for implementation a nd assessment of the intervention 
within each time period. The process continues until all OAT clinics have 
crossed over to implement telemedicine , and thus the clinics contribute 
data to both interventions. Board-eligible or certified providers will 
manage HCV treatment. All sites are allocated to a single cluster. 
Therefore, no participant cross-over  between the arms is permitted. 
  
Interview substudy:  
This is an observational study consis ting of interviews and focus groups.  
5.0 Local Number of Subjects  
5.1 Indicate the total number  of subjects that will be enrolled or records that 
will be reviewed locally.  
  Page 10 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: The University at Buffalo Dept . of Medicine is the Sponsor of the 
study initiating the study design and managi ng its implementation as well as data 
analysis. Therefore, UB staff  will not be  directly consenting or  enrolling subjects. 
Screening, consenting and enrollment of s ubjects will be at ea ch participating  
OAT clinic. Our target sample size is 624 OAT program-maintai ned patients from 
12 clinics throughout the state of NY Interview substudy:  
Patients-We will plan to interview up to  25 patients who participated in the 
parent study (approximate ly 2 per clinic).   
Staff: We will plan to interview/c onduct focus groups with up to 200 
individuals across th e study clinics.   
We may also contact sites that declined to participate in the pare nt study to assess 
the reasons for non-participation. These individuals would likely represent the 
leadership at these sites, including admin istrators, providers, lawyers or clinic 
directors.  
We are also trying to interview patients w ho were invited to participate in the 
study but declined.  
  
  
5.2 If applicable, indicate how many subjec ts you expect to screen to reach your 
target sample (i.e. your screen failure rate).   
Response: We estimate that approximate ly 2534 patients (~130 patients/clinic) 
will be screened.  
  
5.3 Justify the feasibility of recruiting the proposed number of eligible subjects 
within the anticipated re cruitment period. For exampl e, how many potential 
subjects do you have access t o? What percentage of t hose potential subjects do 
you need to recruit?  
Response:   
Currently, there are 126 OAT programs in  New York State. Estimated HCV 
(antibody) prevalence among PWID range s from 30% to 70%, depending on 
frequency and duration of use, while incidence ranges from 16% to 42% per 
year.  
Interview Substudy  
Most of the potential participants ar e subjects from the parent study, so many 
of them are either still in regular cont act with the study staff or have contact 
information available.   
For staff, we will work closely with the clinic leadership at each site to tailor 
staff recruitment to be consistent wi th local procedures. We have been 
working with all sites since late 201 6, and the parent study is very well 
known to clinic leadership and staff. Ma ny staff have been involved in either 
HCV medication dispensing, supporting pa tients through their treatment, or 
identifying patients for recruitment.   
  
  Page 11 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   We will also seek to conduct interviews  or focus groups with staff at sites 
that might have declined study particip ation. Additional interviews or focus 
groups might be conducted with state ag encies that oversee telemedicine or 
substance use treatment, such as New York State Dept of Health and the 
Office of Addiction Services and Sup ports (OASAS). The goals of these 
discussions will be to understand facili tators and barriers to telemedicine 
implementation and how these might ha ve changed as a result of the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
  
6.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
6.1 Describe the criteria that define who will be included  in your final study sample.   
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.  
Response: The inclusion criteria:  
1. HCV antibody detected  
2. Ability and willingness of subject or lega l representative to provide written 
informed consent.  
3. 18 years of age or older  
4. A minimum of 6-month enrollme nt in the OAT program  
5. Likely to be adherent to  the therapeutic regimen  
6. Treatment must be covere d by medical insurance  
  
Interview Substudy:  
Subjects from the parent study or staff that worked at  the study s ite clinics 
during the study period will be eligib le. We also may approach current 
or former members of our.patient ad visory committee th at is operational 
at each site and ask them to particip ate in focus groups or interviews.   
Additional interviews may be conducted with staff from other substance use 
treatment facilities or gove rnmental agencies that participate in telemedicine 
or substance use treatment  
Patients at the clinic who were invited to  participate in the study but declined are 
eligible to be interviewed in a single  session, but will not participate in any 
other aspect of the study.  
6.2 Describe the criteria that define who will be excluded  from your final study 
sample.    
NOTE:  This may be done in bullet point fashion.   
Response:  
1. Mental instability or incompetence, su ch that the validity of the informed 
consent or ability to be compli ant with the study is uncertain.  
2. <18 years of age  
3. < 6 months enrolled in OAT program.  
  Page 12 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   4. Non-compliance with methadone therapeu tic regimen at the Opiate Agonist 
Treatment program, defined as three c onsecutive missed appointments that 
will result in a discussion between the principal investigator at the site and 
the study participant to determine th e reason for the missed appointments. 
Continuation in the study for the pa rticipant will be assessed on a case-
bycase basis between the study PI and the site sub-PI.  
5. Lack of medical insurance coverage  
6. Ineligibility for HCV treatment  
7. Active treatment for HCV at the time of the study enrollment  
8. HIV positive- not on stable antiviral therapy  
9. Enrolled subjects will be w ithdrawn if they are discharged from their clinic 
or their HCV medication administrati on lapses for 1 month or more  
6.3 Indicate specifically whether you will  include any of the following special 
populations in your study using the checkboxes below.    
  
NOTE:  Members of special populations may no t be targeted for enrollment in your 
study unless you indicate this in your inclusion criteria.  
Response: we will not enroll any special populations in our study   
☐  Adults unable to consent  
☐  Individuals who are not yet adul ts (infants, children, teenagers)  
☐  Pregnant women  
☒  
   Prisoners  
6.4 Indicate whether you will include non- English speaking individuals in your 
study.  Provide justification if you will exclude non-English speaking 
individuals.   
In order to meet one of the primary et hical principles of equitable selection 
of subjects, non-English speaking individuals may not be routinely excluded 
from research as a matter of convenience.  
In cases where the research is of th erapeutic intent or is designed to 
investigate areas that would necessar ily require certain populations who 
may not speak English, the researcher is  required to make efforts to recruit 
and include non-English speaking indivi duals.  However, there are studies 
in which it would be reasonable to limit subjects to those who speak 
English.  Some examples include pilot studies, small unfunded studies with 
validated instruments not available in other languages, studies with 
numerous questionnaires, and some non-th erapeutic studies which offer no 
direct benefit.  
Response:   
Study materials will be offered in both Englis h and Spanish, the tw o languages that are 
spoken by the vast majority of OAT program patients in NY State.   
  Page 13 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   At least one of the patients who declined  participation and will be invited to 
participate in a single inte rview is Spanish speaking.  
7.0 Vulnerable Populations   
If the research involves special popula tions that are considered vulnerable, 
describe the safeguards included to  protect their rights and welfare.     
NOTE: You should refer to the appropriate ch ecklists, referenced below, to ensure you 
have provided adequate detail regarding  safeguards and protections. You do not, 
however, need to provide these checklists to the IRB.  
7.1 For research that involves pregnant women, safeguards include: NOTE 
CHECKLIST: Pregnant Women (HRP-412)   
Response:  
   
☒  N/A:  This research does not involve pregnant women.  
7.2   For research that involves neonates of uncertain viability or non-viable 
neonates,  safeguards include:  
NOTE CHECKLISTS: Non-Viable Neonates (HRP-413), or Neonates of Uncertain 
Viability (HRP-414)   
Response:   
  
☒  N/A:   This research does not involve non-viable neonates or neonates of 
uncertain viability.  
7.3   For research that involves prisoners , safeguards include: NOTE 
CHECKLIST: Prisoners (HRP-415)  
Response: We do not plan to study prisoners  specifically, but since many 
methadone-maintained patients cycle through the correctio nal system quite 
frequently, there will be instances when  we have study subjects who become 
incarcerated.  No study related procedures  will occur during the time of the 
incarceration, but will resume if possible after the subject is released.  No data 
will be collected on the subject during the time of incarceration.  Subjects will not 
be recruited while incarcerated.  If a subj ect is incarcerated wh ile being treated for 
HCV, the treatment may be continued as st andard of care duri ng the incarceration. 
Subjects will only be withdrawn from the st udy for incarceration if it causes them 
to meet the overall criteria for withdrawal from the st udy:  they are discharged 
from the clinic or if their HCV medicati on administration lapses for 1 month or 
more.  
If incarcerated subjects are withdrawn from the study, the stu dy data collected on 
them up to the point of withdrawal  will still be us ed for the study.   
  
  
☐  N/A:   This research does not involve prisoners.  
6.5 7.4 For research that involves persons who have not attained the legal age for 
consent to treatments or procedures in volved in the research (“children”) , 
safeguards include:    
  Page 14 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   NOTE CHECKLIST: Children (HRP-416)   
Response:   
  
☒  N/A:   This research does not involve persons who have not attained the 
legal age for consent to treatment s or procedures (“children”).  
6.6 7.5 For research that involves cognitively impaired adults , safeguards include: 
NOTE CHECKLIST: Cognitively Impaired Adults (HRP-417)  
Response:   
  
☒  N/A:   This research does not involve  cognitively impaired adults.  
7.6 Consider if other specifically targ eted populations such as students, 
employees of a specific firm, or educa tionally or economically disadvantaged 
persons are vulnerable.   Provide information regarding their safeguards and 
protections, including safeguards to el iminate coercion or undue influence.   
Response: there will not be students,  employees of a sp ecific firm or 
educationally or economically di sadvantaged persons targeted 
Interview substudy:  
Subjects from our PCORI study and staff at the OTP clinics will be targeted, but 
the voluntary nature of participation will be stressed during the consent process. 
This will also be stressed to sites that ma y not be participating in or who declined 
participation in the PCORI study as well.  
  
8.0 Eligibility Screening   
8.1 Describe screening procedures  for determining subj ects’ eligibility.  
Screening refers to determining if prosp ective participants meet inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.    
 Include all relevant screening documen ts with your submission (e.g. screening 
protocol, script, questionnaire).   
Response: By New York State regulation, all OAT programs are required to screen for the 
presence of HCV antibody on an annual basis. Consequently, potential subjects in this 
study will be identified from the health record  at each of the partic ipating clinics for the 
presence of HCV antibody. In the case that a clinic does not screen for HCV, we will 
provide HCV antibody and HCV RNA screening as part of this protocol, and provide the 
necessary screening kits to the clinic.  
  
☐  N/A:     
9.0 Recruitment Methods  
☐  N/A:  This is a records review only, and subjects will not be 
recruited.  NOTE:  If you select th is option, please make sure that 
all records review procedures a nd inclusion/exclusion screening 
are adequately described in other sections.   

  Page 15 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   9.1 Describe when, where, and how pot ential subjects will be recruited.   
NOTE:  Recruitment refers to how you are identifying potential participants and 
introducing them to the study.  Incl ude specific methods you will use (e.g.  
searching charts for specific ICD code numbers, Research Participant Groups, 
posted advertisements, etc.).  
Response:  By regulation, all OAT progr ams in NYS are required to screen 
for the presence of HCV antibody on an annual basis.  
Consequently, potential s ubjects in this study will  be identified from the 
health record at each of the particip ating clinics for the presence of HCV 
antibody. A partial HIPAA waiver will be obtained to allow for review of 
potential subjects HCV antibody status . We will offer sc reening for HCV 
antibody and HCV RNA for any patients or  clinics that ha ve not had access 
to these tests. A brochure and flyer will be distributed to all sites to enhance 
recruitment. A video simu lating a telemedicine visit within a methadone 
clinic will be available for patients to view when deciding on participation 
within the telemedicine arm. The goal is to enhance understanding how 
telemedicine can be incor porated into the daily flow  of the subject’s routine 
when coming for dosing of methadone. The video produced by the 
University at Buffalo Center for the Ar ts will be completed using actors and 
clinic setting not involved in the study.  
Recruitment of subjects to particip ate in the dissemination of results 
(interviews and public speaking opport unities) will be done either with a 
phone call or at the subject’s st udy visit. Interview substudy:  
Patients  
We will plan to interview up to 25 patie nts who participated in the parent 
study (approximately 2 per clinic) u tilizing purposive sampling. We will 
approach PCORI parent study participants who have had particularly 
interesting or meaningful experiences as  a result of the treatment modality of 
telemedicine.  Potential subjects will be contacted by the case manager  who 
intereacted with them in the parent st udy, either in person or  by text or phone 
call or email, depending on the known preferences of the individual.  
Staff  
We will plan to interview up to 200 staff w ho participated in or were involved 
with the parent study utilizing purposi ve sampling. We w ill approach staff 
who have had particularly interesting or  meaningful experiences as a result of 
their engagement with the study and treatment modality  of telemedicine.    
Administrators  
We will plan to interview all administrators – one to two, depending on a site 
or organization.   
For the staff members, the case manager will also contact them either in 
person, or phone or by email.  
Non-subjects  
Patients at the clinics who were invited to  be part of the study but declined to 
participate and are still going to the same clinic may be approached during 
their clinic visit with an invitation to be interviewed.  Eligible patients will be 
  Page 16 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   found based on screening records fro m the main study or study staff 
recollections.  
9.2 Describe how you will protect the pr ivacy interests of prospective subjects 
during the recruitment process.    
NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to him or herself.     
Response: Protection against privacy breach by participants will be 
ensured by discussions of study enroll ment done in a private setting, 
between the study case manager at each participating site and the potential 
study participant. Similarly, for pati ents in the telemedicine arm, HCV 
therapies will be dispensed at the methadone dispensing window at the 
same time as methadone to minimize the chance that other patients from 
the OAT program might observe a st udy subject taking HCV medications. 
As part of the informed consent, we will also request consent from patients 
to contact their medical providers an d HCV specialists in order to follow 
up on the referral requests to determine if the patient actually went for the 
referral from their primary provider to  an off-site Liver specialist.   
Data security. Stored data protections will be designed in collaboration 
with the Information Technology Depart ments at each of the participating 
institutions as well as with the da ta management systems, My Own Med 
(MoM) and Breadcrumb Analytics, we  will employ for this protocol. 
Protections employed in this study will be similar to those that have been 
enacted in similar clinical resear ch studies. Data will be stored on 
password protected servers. Patient iden tity will not be shared with anyone 
other than the staff at participati ng sites and the physicians who are 
treating the patients. Each participati ng site will be assigned a site number, 
with each patient provided a single study identification number in 
ascending order by the study coordina tor for all study related data 
pertaining to the subject. This info rmation once de-identified will be 
stored additionally on a data management  server housed at the Institute for 
Healthcare Informatics or similar university-designated server at the 
University at Buffalo  and monitored by study staff at UB Research. 
Additionally, in all partic ipating OAT clinics, all study personnel will be 
trained and certified in human subjec t studies protection. Furthermore, 
training in human subject’s protectio n and research methodology will be 
part of the engagement process for any study related procedures to be 
conducted as part of  this protocol.  
9.3 Identify any materials that will be used to recruit subjects.   
NOTE:  Examples include scripts for te lephone calls, in person announcements / 
presentations, email invitations.   
For advertisements, include the final copy  of printed advertisements with your 
submission. When advertisements are t aped for broadcast, attach the final  
audio/video tape.  NOTE:  You may submit the wording of the advertisement prior 
to taping to ensure there will be no IRB-re quired revisions, provided the IRB also 
reviews and approves the final version.  
 Response: At present, we will not rely on advertisements or video production but 
will recruit people from the electronic health record or through the screening 
process described in sect.7.1 Eligibility Screening   

  Page 17 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016     
10.0 Procedures Involved  
10.1 Provide a description of all research procedures or activities  being 
performed and when they are performed once a subject is screened and 
determined to be eligible. Provid e as much detail as possible.    
NOTE:  This should serve as a blueprint fo r your study and include enough detail 
so that another investigator could pick up your protocol and replicate the research.  
For studies that have multiple or compl ex visits or procedures, consider the 
addition of a schedule of events table in in your response.   
Response: All participating OAT clinics wi ll screen patients for HCV Antibody as 
required by New York State. At each partic ipating OAT clinic, the designated study 
manager will meet privately with each patient identified as HCV Antibody positive to 
discuss the study. Once consented, blood specime ns would be obtained (up to 44 ml) to 
determine HCV RNA, geno-typing, Drug sens itivity, HIV RNA, CD4 count (to be 
offered if in not in patient’s char t), HBsAb, HBsAg, complete blood count, 
comprehensive metabolic panel with estimate d glomerular filtrati on rate, international 
normalized ratio, prothrombi n time, and a referral either dir ectly to a specialist or to their 
primary care physician (if HCV RNA detected ). Once a referral has been issued, the 
designated study case manager of the OAT clin ic will interact w ith the patient on a 
monthly basis to determine whether they have  complied with the referral as well as 
medication adherence. HIPAA consent and co ntact information of the primary care 
physician as well as the liver specialist will be  obtained. In the case of one-step referral 
process, the coordinator will be able to follow  up directly with the liver specialist. In the 
case of a two-step referral process, the c oordinator will follow up with both the primary 
care provider as well as the liver specialist . Some payers may re quire the two-step 
process as they may require that all referrals be completed by the PCP. We will 
administer the  Hepatitis  C Patient Satisfaction Questionnai re, Modified Mini Mental 
Health Screen, National Institute on Drug Abuse Quick Screen, Drug Abuse Screening 
Test (DAST), and Sociodemographic Survey  to patients who are referred for HCV 
management at an offsite location. Similarl y, in both arms, subjects will be given a 
standardized brochure about  HCV produced by SAMHSA.  
After 9 months, 4 randomly selected clin ics will begin consenting and enrolling 
patients into the telemedicine arm. This randomization will conti nue every 9 months 
until all clinics have been transitioned into the telemedicine arm. Screening and 
consent will be conducted in the same manne r described for the referral arm. We will 
offer HCV-related interactive educational sessions to the patients enrolled in 
telemedicine treatment of HC V at each clinic during its telemedicine period. These 
sessions will cover the specifics of telemedi cine as a means for delivery of healthcare 
and will address the concerns, such as privacy and confidentiality. During the 
telemedicine visits, patients will be linked with the provider via two-way 
videoteleconferencing, which may be, dependi ng upon a visit, facili tated by an onsite 
OAT program staff member. The educational se ssions will also include the principles 
of telemedicine as well as an introducti on, including the creden tials of the physician 
conducting telemedicine-based appointments a nd the privacy of medical data. Family 
members and patient caregivers  will be invited to particip ate in the initial session so 
that they may be a means of moral s upport to the patient during HCV treatment. 
  Page 18 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   During this appointment, patients will be evalua ted for liver fibrosis  that only requires 
a routine blood sample (Fibrosure)    
Two weeks later, patients will have a second telemedicine appointment when their results will be 
discussed with the liver specialist. If the patient m eets treatment eligibility criteria and is willing 
to undergo HCV therapy, medications will be prescr ibed using the standard format requested by 
our specialty pharmacy partner. This telemedicine visit will be concluded with specific 
information provided to the pati ent concerning the medication regi men to be followed and side 
effects. The patient will then be instructed  on how to take the HCV medications and the 
importance of adherence to the HCV treatment  regimen will be empha sized. HCV medication 
will be administered as directly observed th erapy (DOT) dispensed through the methadone 
dispensing counter in the OAT program. Subjects in both arms will be given Hepatitis C 
Treatment Satisfaction Questionnair es at the time of the first visit, and three months post 
treatment cessation.   
In the Telemedicine arm, HCV RNA will be obta ined at baseline, treatment week 2, treatment 
week 6, at the end of treatment, post treatment  week 4, and at 12 weeks posttreatment cessation. 
The blood will also be obtained at 6, 12, 18, a nd 24 months posttreatment to monitor for HCV 
reinfection. Follow up test s for reinfection may be  done by standard blood draw or by dry blood 
spot testing, which involve s a finger prick.    
DBS (dried blood spot) testing is used to asse ss HCV RNA (Hep C vira l load). If the test 
comes back positive, we would confirm HCV RN A with venipuncture. At the same time, we 
would likely check the genotype for genotype sw itching. A different genotype would likely 
indicate reinfection.  
All telemedicine appointments will occur online w ith the liver specialist.  The OAT Program staff 
clinician (MD/NP/PA) will be requested to be  present based on the clinical need (e.g., non-
compliance with therapeutic regimen, issues  related to substance use). Telemedicine 
appointments will occur at the initial evaluation, when the HC V medication is ordered, and 2 
weeks into treatment. Post-trea tment, telemedicine appointment  will occur at week 12. Other 
visits are optional and are based on the clinical  need. Counseling sessi ons aimed at preventing 
reinfection will be offered to both arms at post treatment week 12 visit. Finally, we will administer the Hepatitis C Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire, Drug abuse Screening Test three 
months post treatment cessation. Among patients in both arms w ho achieve viral eradication, 
HCV RNA, toxicology screens will be obtained at week 4 post tr eatment, week 12 post treatment 
and months 6, 12, 18 and 24 post treatment cessation. This blood may be shipped from the clinic 
to SUNY at Buffalo, where it may be assaye d for HCV RNA and HCV genotyping. We may also 
store an aliquot of blood for fu ture reference including sequenci ng for new viruses. We may also 
decide to sequence the baseline virus to investigate for viral genetic diversity.   
If a patient is found to again test positive for HCV during their follow up period, we 
will collect data about their new infection, a nd draw up to 3 tbsp of blood at 2 and 6 
weeks after the beginning of retreatment, at  the end of treatment and at 4 and 12 weeks 
after the end of treatment.  We may also d ecide to sequence samp les obtained from any 
patients who have a positive HCV RNA sample  after successful viral eradication in 
order to differentiate those who have reinf ection versus relapse.  We may also measure 
the HCV core antigen on these samples.   
Collecting of HCV reinfection data occurs only during the subject’s  study period, that 
is, up to 24 months from the end of thei r first study-related HCV treatment. If the 
subject is not retreated, we will continue monitoring him/her for a potential treatment 
start date during the study period and if s/he starts new treatment, we will collect 
follow-up data until the end of their study period . If the subject is re infected at the end 
  Page 19 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   of his/her study period, i.e., Visit 11 in the Usual Care Arm and Visit 12 in the 
Telemedicine Arm of the study, there will be no further data collection.  
For the collection of social determinants of  health (SDOH) data:  Information from the 
subject’s initial intake forms (local to each si te: Comprehensive assessments ), as well as 
any follow-up assessments done in subsequent  years, will be entered into a data 
collection spreadsheet.  
Then the PAS-44 and certain PAS-26s will be collected as follows:  
1. Following instructions sent from OASAS, da ta from the PAS-44, administered at 
patient’s admission to the opioid treatment program, and specified PAS-26s, will be 
downloaded into an Excel spreadsheet fro m OASAS’s website (this is a secure 
download through their system). The data will  be extracted by a member of the study 
team.   
2. The spreadsheet is generated by OASAS’s pr ogram based on entering a date range of 
up to a year.  A spreadsheet is created that contains the informati on for all the clinic’s 
patients that filled out the PAS form for that date range.    
3. After the spreadsheet is cr eated, without opening the file , it will be dropped into a 
computer program created by Breadcrumb An alytics that has been downloaded onto 
the local computer. The program will allow the us er to enter a set of patient identifiers  
(which will include some of the following identifiable data points: Provider Client ID, 
Birth Date, Last 4 SSN, Last  Name-First 2 Letters, First Name-First 2 Letters) to 
select only the data related to the study s ubjects.  The program will extract the data 
for the selected patients, and remove th e identifying columns (All data points in 
TRS61 and TRS-49 sections,, please see screen shot below).  It will also change the 
date of admission and date of  assessment completion to just month and year.  All 
other records of non-study subjects will be discarded and deleted.    
4. The program will then allow the user to inspec t the other fields to verify that there is 
no identifying information.  Once the record s have been verified as containing no 
identifiable information except for the St udy ID#, the program will allow the user to 
send the files to the UB study team over secure FTP.  
5. The time sequence of requested  PAS-26 is as follows:  
The first one administere d (that is, the first annual update ), 4 years prior to the study, and 
every year after that until the participant co mpletes the study or is otherwise discontinued 
from the study (up to ap proximately 10 PAS-26).  
  
  
  
Patient Advisory Committee: Patien t Advisory Committee members and study 
participants may be requested to speak on behalf of their e xperiences participating in the 

  Page 20 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   study, their experiences with HCV treatment, or  on the dissemination of results of the 
study. These appearances may consist of medi a interviews, one-on-one interviews, or 
public speaking engagements.  
The purpose of these interviews and speaking engagements is not for recruitment into 
the study. The purpose of the dissemination of results is to spread the word about the 
benefits of telemedicine to a wide variety of stakeholders in cluding patients, clinic staff, 
and insurance companies. The goal is to fa miliarize patients with the procedures, to 
encourage financial sustainabi lity through appropriate tele medicine reimbursement, and 
to promote the growth of the modality as a method to deliver healthcare.  
Interview substudy:  
Some of the subjects from the parent study will be invite d to be interviewed about their 
experiences, opinions and feelings about the study, medical care in general, and their 
OTP clinic and community.  The interviews will take place over videoconferencing, the 
phone, or in person.  All in terviews will be recorded  and transcribed.     
Subjects will be interviewed by someone on the study staff who does not work in the 
subject’s OTP.    
The questions will fall under the following general categories:  
• Trust in the OTP clinic and communi ty (Example: How would you describe 
your relationship with clinic st aff, i.e., counselor, physician?)  
• Experience with the research study (Examp les:  What attracted you to being in 
the PCORI study?  Features that made you skeptical about bei ng in the study?)  
• Challenges with receiving medical care outside of the study (Example: What are 
the barriers or problems you do ha ve or have encountered in general medical settings?)  
• Experiences with personalized care in th e OTP (Example: What are some of the 
helpful things that clinic staff does to ma nage your treatment plan and prioritize your 
needs (including addiction, comorbidities, me ntal health issues, insurance/finances, 
transportation)?)  
Some of the staff who have been working at the clinic during the conduct of the study 
will be interviewed, about their feelings, opini ons and experiences with telemedicine in 
general, as well as specifically their obser vations about the use of telemedicine to 
implement HCV treatment.  
Interview guides are incl uded in this submission.  
Contacts at sites that did not choose to participate in the pa rent study will be interviewed 
about the reasons why and thei r opinion about telemedicine.  
  
Patients at the clinics who were invited to pa rticipate in the main study and declined and 
agree to be interviewed will participate in a single interview either by Zoom, telephone, 
or in person.  They will be asked que stions in the following categories:  
  
1) Why did you decide not to pursue HCV treat ment and/or particip ate in the study?  
2) Is there anything that we could do to get you ready fo r treatment?  
3) Are there any areas where you think educat ion or knowledge could be helpful?  
  Page 21 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   4) Do you have any other re commendations for us?  
  
  
  
10.2 Describe what data will be collected.    
NOTE:  For studies with multiple data collection points or long-term follow up, 
consider the addition of a schedule or table in your response.  
Response: The following data will be co llected from patients enrolled in the 
study:  
1. Demographic information (a ge, sex, race, ethnicity)  
2. Height  
3. Weight  
4. Body Mass Index  
5. Marital status  
6. Type of residence  
7. Employment status  
8. Legally disabled   
9. Highest level of educ ational attainment  
10. Type of insurance  
11. Co-morbid medical and ps ychiatric diagnoses  
12. Medications with current dose  
13. CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level on pa tients chart- if status unknown HIV 
testing to be offered  
14. Data related to HCV including HCV R NA, HCV genotype, fibrosis level, 
inflammatory grade, HCV resistance associated variants, complete blood 
count, comprehensive metabolic panel w ith estimated glomerular filtration 
rate, international normalizat ion ratio, and prothrombin  
15. Data related to hepatitis B virus in fection-HBV DNA level, HBsAb, HBsAg   
16. Opiate agonist specific variables-meth adone peak and trough levels, type of 
treatment, dose and duration.  
17. Illicit drug use and behavior  
18. For sites that have access to FibroScan, we will collect fibrosis measurements 
and steatosis level.   
19. Model of end-stage liver disease (MELD)  
20. Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST)  
21. Billing and claims data such as CPT c ode, gross charges, payment, patient 
cost share (co-pay or co-insurance),  reason for denial of payment by the 
insurance company.  
  
  
  Page 22 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   22. Patient stories and events will be collected from study case managers and 
study staff to illustrate how the tele medicine model with accompanying 
medication dispensing facilitates HCV tr eatment.  No identifiable patient 
information will be included.  
Information to be collected incl udes patient-reported outcomes,  such 
as how the onsite treatment delivery  facilitated treatment completion, 
overcoming stigma barriers, obtaini ng secure housing in a homeless 
shelter, and obtaining treatment in the case of physical immobility.  
23.    Social determinants of health  – behavioral, environmental, and 
demographic characteristics that can affect a patient’s health.  Please 
see Comprehensive Assessment and SDOH in  
Supporting Documents.  These may be  from the versions done at the 
subject’s initial admission to the clinic, or during follow up 
administrations of the same and/or  similar forms over the time since 
the initial admission.  We will also collect the data from the PAS-44 
and PAS-26s (see section 10.1 for sc hedule) minus the identifiable 
fields.  The PAS forms are the SDOH variables collected by OASAS 
from each clinic, and overlap the local clinic’s forms.  
Interview substudy:  
General demographics from staff will be collected (age, gender, ethnicity), job 
title, and degrees received. (See data co llection instrument). Everything else 
that will be collected from both patients and staff will be qualitative data such 
as opinions and experiences from record ed and transcribed interviews and 
focus groups. No quantitative data will be collected from patients as all 
required quantitative data have been colle cted as part of the parent study.  
General demographics will be collected from the non-participants as 
well – age, gender, ethnicity and educational level completed.  
  
  
  
10.3 List any instruments or measuremen t tools used to co llect data (e.g.  
questionnaire, interview guide, validated instrument, data collection form).    
  
Include copies of these documents with your submission.  
Response:  All participants will complete a Modified Mini Mental Health Screen, 
National Institute Drug Abuse Quick Screen  and Sociodemographic Survey at the 
first study visit. We will also administer  the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) 
at screening, and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire at 3 months post treatment 
cessation.   
If a subject is found to be reinfected w ith HCV, the information about the new 
treatment episode will be collected on  an Excel spreadsheet (attached).  
  
Interview substudy:  

  Page 23 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Videoconference recordings and transcri pts or digital voi ce recordings and 
transcripts will be used to collect the interview and focus group data.   Interview 
guides are included in this submission. Please see atta ched Excel file for the 
quantitative data to be collected from staff.  
  
  
  
Describe any source records that will be  used to collect data about subjects (e.g. 
school records, electronic medical records).  
Response: Data will be collected from  Electronic Medical Records using an 
electronic file transfer through MoM. Additionally  this de-identified information 
will be stored on a data management server, housed at the Institute for Healthcare  
Informatics or similar univer sity-designated server at th e University at Buffalo and 
monitored by study staff at UB Research.  Financial data for the telemedicine 
subjects and usual care subjects that were  treated by the PI will be extracted from 
the UBMD or START financial reports th at the PI receives as the rendering 
provider.  
Financial data for usual care subjects not  treated by the PI wi ll be requested from 
subjects’ insurance companies or  treating physicia n/practice.  
Social Determinants of Health may be accessed in paper medical records if the 
information has not been added to the clinic’s EMR.  The PAS-44 and PAS-26 
will be downloaded from the OASAS servers through an online portal at each 
clinic.  
  
Interview substudy: NA  
  
10.4 Indicate whether or not individual  subject results, such as results of 
investigational diagnosti c tests, genetic tests, or incidental findings will be 
shared with subjects or others (e.g., th e subject’s primary care physician) and if 
so, describe how these will be shared.  
Response: Each subject will be privately gi ven all test results at screening and at 
each visit. Consents will be obtained to share collected inform ation with primary 
physicians and/or liver specialists.  
10.5 Indicate whether or not study results will be shared w ith subjects or others, 
and if so, describe how these will be shared.  
Response: Presentations will be done at  participating clinics in order to 
share our findings with study participan ts as well as with other patients 
who might be interested in the st udy results. Similar presentations will 
also be organized in other methadon e clinics. We plan to engage the 
Patient Partners (a group of pati ent volunteers who have gone through 
HCV treatment via telemedi cine) in the dissemination of the results within 
their own clinics and to outlaying clin ics.  Many patients seen in these 
clinics are HCV infected and may be ve ry interested in the study findings 
and embrace alternative strategies for HCV management and treatment 
  Page 24 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   other than usual care, referral to an offsite location. Results of this study 
will be made available on ClinicalTrials.gov  
Information collected from study case managers and other study staff (see 
10.2 #23) will be used to create a manusc ript of interesting patient stories 
or events to illustrate how the telemedicine model with accompanying 
medication dispensing facilitates HCV treatment. We have had a variety of 
instances where patients have reported that the model directly or indirectly 
facilitated their overcoming obstacles  to healthcare access and delivery 
related to HCV. The manuscript will be an opportunity to capture these 
events to illustrate ancillary benefi ts of integrated addiction and HCV 
treatment in our telemedicine model. 
Study results will be shared with stakehol ders at the national, state, and local 
levels to obtain their input and perspectiv es for drafting a variety of manuscripts 
based on the study. These stakeholders, w ho were involved in the implementation 
and conduct of the study, may include pati ent-participants, case managers, and 
clinic administrators and staff. No identifiable information will be shared.

12.1 Describe all facilities/sites wher e you will be conducting research 
procedures.  Include a description of th e security and privacy of the facilities 
  Page 25 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   (e.g. locked facility, limited access, priv acy barriers).  Facility, department, and 
type of room are relevant.  Do  not abbreviate facility names.    
NOTE:  Examples of acceptable response may be: A classroom setting in the 
Department of Psychology equipped with a computer with relevant survey administration software,” “The angiogram suite at Buffalo General Medical Center, a fully accredited tertiary care institution within New York State with 
badge access,” or, “Community Center meeting hall.” 
 
Response: All participating OAT clinics must provide a patient-friendly, private 
examination room for discussion of HCV detection, study information, and 
consenting. For telemedicine they mu st employ two-way, face to face 
communication using a HIPAA- compliant,  secure web – connected computer 
equipment with digital camera.  
 
Interview substudy:  
Interviews will happen over the phone, ove r videoconferencing, or in a private 
room in the OTP clinic.    
  
12.2 For research conducted outside of  UB and its affiliates, describe:  
• Site-specific regulations or cu stoms affecting the research  
• Local scientific and ethical review structure  
NOTE:  This question is referring to UB affiliated research taking place outside 
UB, i.e. research conducted in the community, school-based research, international research, etc.  It is not referring to multi-site research.  UB affiliated 
institutions include Kaleida Health, EC MC, and Roswell Park Cancer Institute.   
 
Response: Submission, review and approval of  the protocol will be at the local  
IRB level.  Those sites without a lo cal IRB sites 01 and 11, will follow UB-IRB 
guidelines and approvals. All sites will meet state regulations and licensing 
requirements for treatment of substance abuse patients.  UB is acting as the main 
coordinating site.  All the other sites will submit their clinical data to UB through 
MyOwnMed (MoM), and the billing data and SDOH data through other secure 
means.  There is no data sharing between  sites laterally.  Data Use Agreements 
are in place between UB and th e participating sites.   
  
☐  N/A:   This study is not conducted outs ide of UB or its affiliates.  
13.0 Community-Based Participatory Research  
13.1 Describe involvement of the commun ity in the design and conduct of the 
research.   
NOTE:  Community-Based Participator y Research (CBPR) is a collaborative 
approach to research that equitably invo lves all partners in the research process 
and recognizes the unique strengths that each brings.  CBPR begins with a 
research topic of importance to the co mmunity, has the aim of combining 
knowledge with action and achieving social  change to improve health outcomes 
and eliminate health disparities.  
  Page 26 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: This research will be conducte d in a largely medically disenfranchised, 
largely under-represented minority group of pa tients in substance use treatment.  
In addition to protocol reviews by loca l IRBs, a patient-partner group led by a 
patient advocacy manager, will meet every month or quarterly to discuss the 
details of treatment practi ce and to provide feedback on the study conduct to share 
with participating sites and within th eir own communities. As this study is 
supported by the Patient-Centered Outcomes  Research Institute  (PCORI), patient 
and community engagement of interested stakeholders is a cr ucial part of the 
entire study. Meetings will occur at leas t annually with patient and stakeholder 
advisory groups where feedback will be ascertained on mechanism by which to 
improve the study conduct.    
  
☐  N/A:   This study does not utilize CBPR.  
13.2 Describe the composition and involvement of a community advisory board.  
Response: For this study, the “community advisory board” will be comprised of 
two separate committees, a patient advisory  board and a sustai nability committee 
comprised of stakeholders. The objective of each will be to educate and to 
advocate for treatment and support services  for individuals w ith viral hepatitis. 
Patient partner groups will consist of a pati ent advocate acting as facilitator and 3 
patients who have completed or w ho are undergoing HCV treatment at a 
participating site. The Sustainabil ity Committee will be comprised of 
representatives of New York State and City Departments of Health, leading 
pharmaceutical manufacturers of HCV treat ments and diagnostic companies, third 
party payers, HCV educational foundati ons, medical provide rs, telemedicine 
implementation expert, and federal agencies involved in treatment of patients with 
substance use disorders.   
  
☐  N/A:   This study does not have a community advisory board.  
14.0 Resources and Qualifications  
14.1 Describe the qualifications (e.g., educ ation, training, expe rience, expertise, 
or certifications) of the Principal Investigator and staff to perform the research.  
When applicable describe their knowledge of the local study sites, culture, and 
society.  Provide enough information to convince the IRB that you have 
qualified staff for the proposed research.   
NOTE:  If you specify a person by name, a change to that person will require prior 
approval by the IRB.  If you specify a person by role (e.g., coordinator, research 
assistant, co-investigator, or pharmacist), a change to that person will not usually 
require prior approval by the IRB, provided that the person meets the qualifications described to fulfill their roles.  
Response: The Principal Investigator (P I) of this study, Dr. Andrew Talal is a 
board-certified gastroenterologist who has been treating patients with HCV 
infection for the past 25 years, and who has been conducting a pilot study of HCV 
treatment via telemedicine for the past 5 years at one of the participating sites 
(START Treatment and Recovery Centers) . At the European Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases annual meeting in April 2016, Dr. Talal illustrated the 
  Page 27 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   results of the first 19 methadone-maint ained patients treated for HCV via 
telemedicine that showed  excellent efficacy, medication adherence, and 
acceptance of the modality. The research t eams, at each participating site consist 
of experts in addiction medicine, infec tious diseases, imple mentation science, 
epidemiology, biostatistics, and addiction psychiatry. All will be responsible for 
general study oversight as delegate d and supervised closely by the PI. 
Describe other resources available to conduct the research.   
14.2 Describe the time and effort that the Principal Investigator and research 
staff will devote to conducting and completing the research.

14.3 Describe the availability of medi cal or psychological resources that 
subjects might need as a result of anticipated consequences of the human 
research, if applicable.  
NOTE:  One example includes: on-call ava ilability of a counselor or psychologist 
for a study that screens subjects for depression.  
Response: The study will be conducted at sites that have familiarity  with the treatment 
of mental health disorders in patients in  substance use treatment as well as 24-hour 
  Page 28 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   medical coverage for emergencies. Secondly, in  the case that a partic ular site does not 
have the requisite expertise to address a medical issue, each participating site could 
contact other sites that could support patient  management in specific areas that may 
be lacking at the individual clinic. Thir dly, each individual si te study staff will be 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to address issues that may not be readily 
addressed by the above mentioned methods.   
  
14.4 Describe your process to ensure that all persons assisting with the 
research are adequately informed about th e protocol, the research procedures, 
and their duties and functions.  
Response: Clinicians, staff, and administrato rs from the participating OAT clinics will 
be engaged at the outset of  the project by convening mult iple information and staff 
training sessions given by UB Research staff to introduce the study, to explain the 
rationale and background for the initiative, and to review the protocol. Update 
meetings will be conducted to share progress and to address challenges.  
  
15.0 Other Approvals  
15.1 Describe any approvals that will be  obtained prior to commencing the 
research (e.g., school, external site, funding agency, laboratory, radiation 
safety, or biosafety).  
Response: Participating OAT sites must ha ve all state required  licenses prior to 
consideration of particip ating in research study. Pr otocols will be submitted, 
reviewed and approved by local IRBs. Thos e sites without a local IRB will use 
UB-IRB approved protocol. Physicians deliv ering telemedicine must be licensed 
in the state where services are delivered and versed in the state and payer-specific 
reimbursement processes. The sponsor, PCORI, has already approved the study 
concept.   
Interview substudy:  
All study sites not depending on UB I RB will obtain IRB approval at their 
institutions.  
☐  N/A:   This study does not require any other approvals.  
16.0 Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
  
16.1 Describe how you will protect subjects ’ privacy interests during the course 
of this research.  NOTE:  Privacy refers to an individual’s right to control access to 
him or herself.  Privacy applies to the pe rson.  Confidentiality refers to how data 
collected about individuals for the research will be protected by the researcher from 
release.  Confidentiality applies to the data.    
Examples of appropriate responses include: “participant only meets with a study 
coordinator in a classroom setting where no one can overhear”, or “the participant is reminded that they are free to refuse to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable answering.”   
 
  Page 29 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: During visits, clinicians and specialist will meet with patients in 
private, comfortable, closed examination rooms to discuss lab results, plans of 
care and progress.   
Subjects who agree to be interviewe d in an external setting for study 
dissemination activities will si gn a separate consent form and will be asked about 
each interview opportunity separately.  These subjects will be reminded that any 
information that they share, as well as th eir status as active participants in a study 
about hepatitis C treatment conducted in an OAT clinic, will no l onger be private.  
Interview substudy:  
During videoconference or phone interviews , privacy on both sides of the call will 
be ensured, with the interview being resc heduled if privacy is not possible.  
Participants will be reminded that they ar e free to refuse to answer any questions 
that they do not feel comfortable answering.  
16.2 Indicate how the research team is  permitted to access any sources of 
information about the subjects.    
NOTE:  Examples of appropriate responses include:  school permission for review 
of records, consent of the subject, HIPAA waiver.  This question does apply  to 
records reviews.  
Response: Subjects will be asked to si gn a HIPAA consent and a study-specific 
informed consent to allow primary providers , liver specialists, and their particular 
substance use treatment site to share patie nt information pertai ning to treatment of 
HCV and as required for the conduct of the study. A Partial HIPAA Waiver will 
be submitted at each site for review of  potential subject’s medical records at 
screening.  
A HIPAA waiver is being requested to anal yze the billing data for the subjects in 
the telemedicine arm and thos e in the usual care arm who were treated by the PI.  
Modification 5/8/2020 -  A HIPAA waiver is  also being reques ted to collect the 
billing data for the usual care arm subj ects who were treated elsewhere, by 
requesting the billing data  from the insurance companies or from the treating 
physician.     
A HIPAA Waiver is also being requested to  collect retrospective data from the 
subject’s clinic records and the OASAS serv er on their SDOH.  This will apply to 
the subjects from the two sites covere d by UB-IRB only.  All other sites will 
submit to their own IRBs.  
17.0 Data Management and Analysis  
17.1 Describe the data analysis plan, includ ing any statistical procedures.  This 
section applies to both quantitative and qualitative analysis.   
Response:  In this study, we will implement a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled 
trial with two arms (intervention and control) . The statistical analysis will be performed 
using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and R ( http://www.r-project.org/ ). The 
data collection will be conducted over 4 time po ints with 3 steps with 4 clinics switching 
(in a random order) from contro l to intervention at each step . The analysis set will include 
all patients who satisfy the patient level eligibility criteria (6 months active OTP 
  Page 30 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   enrollment, HCV RNA positivit y, and medical insurance; exclusion criteria are HCV 
medication contraindications a nd HCV treatment elsewhere) a nd consent to participate.  
We will follow the intention to treat principl e. Enrolled subjects’ characteristics will be 
summarized by their arm and by time period. In addition to demographic data (sex, age, 
race, ethnicity, education, employment), we wi ll also collect data on opiate agonist therapy-
specific variables (type of tr eatment, duration, therapeuti c regimen), illicit drug use 
behavior (frequency, abstinence), HCV-speci fic variables (HCV RNA, HCV genotype, 
fibrosis, ALT, AST, hemoglob in, platelet count, sodium, total bilirubin, creatinine, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate, prothrombin, internationa l normalized ratio,  previous 
HCV treatment) and co-morbiditi es (HIV, HBV, psychiatric). Continuous variables will be 
presented by their mean (and standard devi ation) and median (a nd interquartile range 
[IQR]).  Categorical variable s will be presented by their frequencies. We will assess 
comparability between the two arms. Catego rical variables will be compar ed through 
Fisher’s exact test, and continuous variables will be compared through Wilcoxon’s ranksum test.   
 
The primary outcome of the study is achievement of SVR, whic h is defined as undetectable 
HCV RNA 12 weeks post treatment cessation. For the primary analysis, the SVR rate will 
be evaluated based on all study patients (HCV RNA+, age ≥18, at least 6months of OTP, 
insurance coverage) who consent to referral (usual) care or telemedicine management of 
HCV. Primary analysis will be individual-leve l based with binary outcome, corresponding 
to successful treatment outcome (achieveme nt of SVR), using GLMM or GEE modelling 
to account for the clustering.  The GLMM model will include  a random effect for each 
cluster, as well as a fixed effect for each time  period and for the cluster (clinic) intervention 
assignment at each time point. We will check for interaction be tween time and intervention 
and will adjust as necessary for covariates to account for potential di fferences between the 
two arms. The intervention effect will be e xpressed as odds ratio and will be reported 
together with its 95% confidence interval and p-value, and both una djusted and adjusted 
odds ratios will be reported. Model assumptio ns will be checked at every level of the 
analysis through graphical and analytical tool s. Additionally, for patients assigned to the 
telemedicine arm who do not adhere to at least one teleme dicine appointment , we will also 
account, by subgroup analysis, for the actual management strate gy for HCV treatment that 
each patient utilized (i.e., whether at least one telemedicine appointment was completed).  
As secondary outcomes, we  will collect in formation on Hepa titis C patient 
satisfaction surveys, National Institute on Dr ug Abuse Screen, Modi fied Mini Mental 
Health Screen, Drug Abuse Screening Test  and Sociodemographic Survey, treatment 
initiation rate, treatment adherence rate, tr eatment completion rate and HCV reinfection 
rate at the end of the study. We will assess for the questionnaire’s internal consistency by calculating the Cronbach’s alpha. We will compar e patient satisfaction with the delivery of 
health care between the two arms using lin ear mixed effects model or GEE. For the 
comparison of the treatment initiation and treatment completion rates between the two 
arms, we will apply the same methodology as for the analysis  of the SVR rate (above). 
Adjustment for covariates will be incorporat ed as appropriate. HCV reinfection will be 
represented by a binary variable indicated  as HCV RNA positivity and will be modeled 
using GLMM or GEE. All tests will be two sided with level of significance of 0.05. Most 
covariates for adjustment of the analyses for potential confounding will be assessed during 
the screening process of  the study either directly from th e patient or from the patients’ 
medical record. We will use graphical and anal ytical methods for detection of outliers in 
the data and conduct sensitivity analysis by fitting the model with and without the 
suspicious observations. The suspicious obs ervations will be checked for accuracy.  
  Page 31 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016     
We will be evaluating the resource utiliz ation used in trea ting Hepatitis C via 
telemedicine as a way to minimize the long term  complications of the virus, such as liver 
transplants, liver cancer and cirrhosis.  Resour ce utilization will be analyzed for regional 
differences and other socio economic variables.    
  
SDOH will be analyzed for any association with the pursuit of HCV treatment. For the 
analysis of SDOH data, we may use large language models provided by Open AI using 
their application programming interface (API) to pre-proces s the data for statistical 
analysis. We will abide by Open AI’s pro cedures for processing data following their 
terms, conditions, and protocols. The UB Purchasing Department and the Office of 
Medical Computing are carefully reviewing the terms and conditions associated with 
procuring the Open AI large language model API access.  Terms and Policies associated 
with the program are located at https://openai.com/policies . Policies related to an 
addendum for Personal Data Processing is located at https://openai.com/policies/data-
processing-addendum . The following form will be comp leted as required for compliance

Interview substudy:  
Topic areas of interest for both patients and staff will be developed by a group of 
experts in the area of qualitative resear ch including a clinical psychologist with 
significant experience with s ubstance use research in th e criminal justice system, a 
UB Professor of Nursing, and an In fectious Diseases physician who has 
conducted research in OTPs for the past two decades. Combined with experienced 
case managers and the PI of the parent  study, we will develop interview/focus 
group/survey topics to be a ssessed. We anticipate asking th ese topics in sections...  
For qualitative research, we will analyze th e data using Hermeneutic phenomenology to 
interpret and to explicate common meanings  and shared practices of the phenomena.   
17.2 If applicable, provide a power analysis.

18.1 A.  Where and how will all data and records be stored?  Include 
information about:  password protec tion, encryption, physical controls, 
authorization of access, and separation of  identifiers and data, as applicable.  
Include physical (e.g. paper) and electronic files.  
Response: We are using My OWN MED (MoM ) as the data management system 
for this protocol.  All study data is ente red into MoM, which utilizes end-to-end 
data encryption, SHA384Managed hash al gorithm, and passwo rd authentication 
with 24/7/365 network monitoring. All partic ipating institutions have been made 
aware of MOM data security prac tices. A copy of the MOM Functional 
Requirements document is being included in this submission.  MoM contains 
identifiable information.  The data can be sent to UB either de -identified or with 
identifiers.  Any database with identifier s will be kept on a se cure server accessed 
by study team members with password prot ected access. Identifiers will be used 
as necessary to link billing data to th e correct subject, but the data will be 
deidentified before the analysis stage.  Additionally coded information will be 
stored on a data management server, housed at the Institu te for Healthcare 
Informatics at the University at Buffalo.  IHI staff are responsible for routine and 
continuous monitoring of the network, server s, and overall data security, and our 
data analytics team also monitors the da ta for integrity and completeness via data 
queries and checks.  Protect ions employed by this study wi ll be similar to those 
that have been enacted in similar clinical  research studies. Data  will be stored on 
password protected servers. Passwords w ill only be available to the study case 
manager and to the Principal Investigator. Patient identity will not be shared with 
anyone other than the staff involved in the c linical management of the patient 
including the physicians who are treating the patients. Patients will be provided a 
study identification number fo r all study related data.  
Answers from questionnaires and surveys w ill be entered into MoM.  Any paper 
copies will be kept in locked file cabin ets in the clinic where they were done. 
Billing data will be stored in an exce l spreadsheet, under the subject’s study 
identification number, on passwor d protected computers.    
The intake forms containing the SDOH in formation, or excel sheets that the 
information from the intake forms has b een entered into, or that contain the 
downloaded PAS data, will be sent to th e UB study team either by fax, secure 
email or through UB Box or s ecure file transfer.  The in formation will reside in 
appropriate computer files (i.e., excel, pdfs, cvs) unde r study IDs, and will be 
stored on secure servers at Breadcrumb An alytics, or on secu re servers at UB 
including the IHI and CCR.  The data need ed for biostatistics will be sent to the 
IHI server and combined with the main  study data under study IDs.  Any paper 
copies of the forms will be ke pt in a locked drawer in a key card protected office 
in the CTRC.  The electronic files will be  stored in a password protected file on 
the S drive.   
Interview substudy:  
  Page 34 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   All recordings and transcript s will stored on a password pr otected secure server.   
  
18.2 A.  How long will the data be stored?  
Response: Data related to the study will be stored for three years after study 
completion.  
All identifiable data in the billing data will be destr oyed at the end of the study, 
defined as the successful pub lication of a manuscript.  
The intake forms (both paper and electron ic) and excel sheets that contain the 
SDOH data will be destroyed/ deleted upon successful publication of that portion 
of the study.   
Interview substudy:  
Recordings and complete transcripts w ill be kept until successful publication.  
After publication, transcripts will be de-identified and stored indefinitely for 
future research, and recordi ngs will be deleted.    
18.3 A.  Who will have access to the data?  
Response: Because HCV treatment will be a part of the subject’s routine care, 
identifiable data regarding individual subjects will be available to study staff and 
providers directly involved in the clinical management of the patients enrolled in 
the study. Subject data will be de-ident ified and assigned a study identification 
number prior to transmission of data for study analysis.  Aggregate data will be 
shared with stakeholders, patient- partners  and patient advocates as well as with 
local IRBs, as appropriate.  
The non-coded SDOH information (in the form  of the intake forms or downloaded 
PAS data) will only be accessed by the PI  and the study team member(s) at the 
study site doing the data en try or the downloading and coding of the PAS data.  
The information will never be in the da tabase in a non-coded form.  The coded 
SDOH data will be combined with the c oded data in the main study database for 
analysis by the biostats team listed on th e study.  No one who is not currently part 
of the study team will see the coded databa se and have access to the code key or 
identifiable data.   
Interview substudy:  
Only the study staff at UB will have access to the data.  
18.4 A.  Who is responsible for receipt or transmission of the data?  
Response: Ultimately, the principal inves tigator is responsib le for receipt and 
transmission of all samples and data. C linical data will be transmitted over web-
secured, HIPAA-compliant data manageme nt system (MoM) to the Principal 
investigator and biostatistician responsi ble for this project. Additionally, this 
coded information will be stored on a data management server, housed at the 
Institute for Healthcare Informatics at the University at Buffalo and monitored by 
study staff at UB Research for the sake  of generating reports to identify 
incomplete or missing data within the MoM system.  
The intake forms that contain SDOH data , or the excel sheets that contain the 
intake forms and PAS data, will be transmitted by fax or electronically. Once 
  Page 35 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   entered into the database built for this purpose on the Breadcrumb Analytics 
server, the data will be securely transferre d to the server in IHI, where they can be 
accessed by the biostatisticians.  
Interview substudy:  
The study coordinator and PI will be res ponsible for receipt,  The study team 
member doing the interviews will be  responsible for transmission.  
18.5 A.  How will the data be transported?  
Response: Data will be transported via elec tronic documentation to web secure, password 
protected servers through MoM, a clinical tria l management system that will enable us to 
perform clinic randomization electronically a nd data collection and transfer from the 12 
participating sites to UB research staff fo r data analysis. All sites enter data into 
MyOwnMed and the aggregate data is only a ccessible to UB study st aff.  Sites do not 
share their data with any other site, just Dr . Talal and the UB study staff.  MOM will also 
provide consulting and technical support on re gulatory and compliance issues related to 
data sharing throughout the study and will offe r resources, such as business associate 
agreements to permit data sharing between th e system and each clinic  partner. Data Use 
Agreements are in place.   
SDOH data will be sent via fax or elect ronically through secure email or Box.  
Interview substudy:  
All data will be transp orted electronically.  
B. Confidentiality of Study Specimens  
  
Describe the local procedures for maintenance of con fidentiality of study 
specimens .    
  
 ☐  N/A:  No specimens will be collected or analyzed in this research.    
(Skip to Section 19.0)   
  
18.1B.  Where and how will all specimens be stored?  Include information 
about:  physical controls, authorization of access, and labeling of specimens, as 
applicable.    
Response: The primary purpose of this study is to compare efficacy of HCV treatment 
between traditional referral and telemedicine. Therefore, handling of specimens will 
be managed through each indi vidual OAT site with pr oper labeling of specimens. 
Patients will be provided a study identificati on number for all st udy related data and 
specimens. Processing, reporting and storing of  Standard of Care specimens will be 
dictated by the commercial vendor laborat ory standards of practice. We will also 
collect 4 vials of blood (60 ml) for viral diversity among patients who relapse after 
treatment and subject to future research. (See Sec.8) These coded specimens will be 
sent to the biorepository at UB and will be  maintained indefinitely. All samples will 
be labeled with the partic ipant’s study number.   
  
18.2 B.  How long will the specimens be stored?  
  Page 36 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: specimens for biorepository (if the subject agreed on the ICF to have 
additional blood drawn for the biorepository ) will be stored in definitely in a 
biorepository located at 875 Ellicott St Buffalo, N.Y. 14203. A 2ml de-identified 
aliquot maybe stored at Abbott laborato ries in Abbott Park, IL. for possible 
genome sequencing in the future.    
18.3 B.  Who will have access to the specimens?  
Response: For specimens housed at the UB biorepos itory, the PI and study staff associated 
with the biorepository will have access. Sa mples sent to commerc ial vendor laboratories 
for Standard of Care laboratory assessmen ts will be accessed by employees of these 
laboratories and will not be used or accessed for future research purposes.    
The following is a description of a possible substudy to happen in the future if 
scientific questions merit.  A new protocol would be su bmitted for approval if this 
were to happen.   A request to Abbott Laboratories is for a sub-study to th at funded through 
PCORI. Although patient follow up for two years post treatment  cessation was part of the 
requirements for the PCORI award, no additional funding was provided to enable us to 
collect and sequence viral isolates. The assu mption was that the HCV RNA measurements 
would be completed by clinical laboratories routinely utilized by each clinic. However, we 
are interested in increasing the scientific valu e of the project through the fulfillment of the 
following specific aims:  
1) To assess genetic differences in viral isol ates between those pa tients who have viral 
recurrence.   
2) To identify baseline rela tedness between HCV isolates obtained from patients on OAT 
from different parts of New York State.  
3) To identify “hot spots” of vi ral transmission among PWSUD.  
4) To conduct new virus discovery to assess for novel isolates among symptomatic OAT 
patients from throughout NYS.   
Aims related to HCV core antigen  
1) Cross-sectional assessment of relationshi p between HCV core antigen (HCVcAg) 
and HCV RNA at baseline among OAT patients.  
2) Longitudinal assessment of HCVcAg declines in a cohort of PWID on DAA-
based therapy.   
3) Decline in HCV core antigen for up to 2 years post-treatment completion in a 
cohort of PWSUD.   
1) HCV RNA and HCV genotyping will be pe rformed on the M2000 at Kaleida’s 
Flint Road facility in a GCP lab.  
Whole genome sequencing will be performed at  Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, IL.  
  
18.4B.  Who is responsible for receip t or transmission of the specimens?  
  Page 37 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: Individual sites will be re sponsible for shipping of specimens 
according to commercial lab. A lab manual with standard operational procedure 
and shipping supplies will be provided to each individual clinic for biorepository 
specimens (sect.16.6). Specimens will be delivered to:   
Biorepository- Dr. Andrew Talal  
875 Ellicott St 6th fl. Rm.6047  
Buffalo, N.Y. 14203 Via 
FedEx.  
Staff at the University of Buffalo with  prior IRB authorization to maintain 
specimens in the Bioreposito ry, will ship via courier  from this repository, a de-
identified specimen to the Kaleida lab at Flint Rd. Amherst, N.Y. where the 
Abbott Lab M2000 is  
housed, for HCV RNA and genotyping, and a 2 ml aliquot of de-identified blood 
product will be sent to Abbott Laborator ies in Abbott Park, IL. for genome 
sequencing via shipping supplies provided by Abbott Lab.  
  
18.5B.  How will the specimens be transported?  
Response: In the case of shipment of sp ecimens to the UB biorepository, ambient 
specimens will be shipped daily to the bi orepository using the designated courier 
(FedEx). Staff at the University of Bu ffalo with prior IRB authorization to 
specimens in the Bioreposito ry, will ship via courier  from this repository, a 
deidentified specimen to the Kaleida lab at Flint Rd. Amherst, N.Y. where the 
Abbott Lab M2000 is housed, for HCV R NA and genotyping, and a 2 ml aliquot 
of de-identified blood product will be sent  to Abbott Laboratories in Abbott Park, 
IL. for genome sequencing via ship ping supplies provided by Abbott Lab.  
  
 Standard of Care samples sent to commercial laboratories will be sent using the 
standard procedure identified by each laboratory at each site.   
  
19.0 Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
☐  N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects,  or is limited to records review 
procedures only.  This s ection does not apply.  
  
NOTE:  Minimal risk studies may be required  to monitor subject safety if the research 
procedures include procedures that presen t unique risks to subjects that require 
monitoring.  Some examples include:  exercisi ng to exertion, or instruments that elicit 
suicidality or substance abuse behavior.  In  such cases, N/A is not an acceptable 
response.  
  
19.1 Describe the plan to periodically evaluate the data collected regarding 
both harms and benefits to determin e whether subjects remain safe.  
Response: During the study start–up phase , a Data Safety Monitoring Board  
(DSMB) will be established and meet at a minimum annually. The DSMB will 
include experts in liver disease, infecti ous diseases, epidemio logy, biostatistics, 
  Page 38 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   bioethics and a patient representative, a ll of whom are inde pendent of the study 
and institutions. The DSMB will meet in itially to review the study aims and 
protocol, to select variable s and procedures for monito ring, and to establish early 
stopping rules in the case of subject harm . Subsequently, the DSMB will have the 
opportunity to review trial outcome data at scheduled interim analyses to be 
conducted in months 24, 36, 48 and 60. Similarly, the IRB at each of the 
participating institutions c ould request review of the st udy in case of concern for 
patient safety. Rules for early study term ination will be established prior to 
participant engagement.  
  
19.2 Describe what data are reviewed, in cluding safety data, untoward events, 
and efficacy data.  
Response: Data to be reviewed will be that involved with di rect patient care 
management by the liver speci alists and physician extenders . Data review will include 
lab values obtained during the clinical management of HCV infection, such as 
hemoglobin, chemistries, rena l and liver function tests as  well as HCV RNA. Also, 
day to day communications with the patient to address patient’s concerns and side 
effects of treatment will be reviewed on a regular ba sis by the study team at the 
participating OAT sites.  
  
19.3 Describe any safety endpoints.  
Response:  Any evidence of serious a dverse events and/or death related to 
telemedicine.   
  
19.4 Describe how the safety informati on will be collected (e.g., with case 
report forms, at study visits, by telephone calls with participants).  
Response: Safety information will be collected by day to  day communication with the 
patient, completion of patient satisfaction surveys, and review of lab reports.  
  
19.5 Describe the frequency of safety data collection.  
Response: Subjects on methadone maintenance must report to clin ics at a frequency 
that ranges from once daily to once weekly for dosing of methadone. Therefore, any 
patient concerns or safety  laboratory signals may be addressed quickly with the 
patient by study staff and/or clini cal personnel at the OAT clinic.  
  
19.6 Describe who will review the safety data.  
Response: Data on the study and particularly  any safety concerns will be reviewed 
and discussed by study and clinic staff incl uding the PI as appropr iate. Similarly, the 
IRB at each of the participa ting clinics and of the part icipating institutions may 
request review of the study in case of c oncern for patient safety. The DSMB will 
review data annually  at a minimum.   
  
19.7Describe the frequency or periodicity of review of cumulative safety data.  
  Page 39 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Response: Cumulative safety data will be reviewed at monthly meetings of Steering 
committee and at least annually by the DSMB.  
  
19.8 Describe the statistical tests for analyzing the safety data to determine 
whether harm is occurring.  
Response: Providers, nurse practitioner/physic ian assistants will continuously monitor 
lab results and patient reports  of symptoms for assessment of adverse events, and if 
necessary use disproportionali ty measures of analysis to  assess for potential harm.  
  
19.9 Describe any conditions that tri gger an immediate suspension of the 
research.  
Response: Evidence of serious adverse even ts and death related to telemedicine.  
  
20.0 Withdrawal of Subjects  
 ☐  N/A:   This study is not enrolling subject s.  This section does not apply.  
  
20.1 Describe anticipated circumstances under which subjects may be 
withdrawn from the research  without their consent.  
Response: If, in the opinion of the PI conti nued participation in the study of any subject 
might lead to undue harm, the subject ma y be withdrawn without consent. Three 
consecutive missed appointments will resu lt in a discussion between the principal 
investigator at the site an d the study participant to dete rmine the reason for the missed 
appointments. Continuation in the study for th e participant will be  assessed on a case-by-
case basis between the study PI and the site PI. Continued HCV treat ment will not be 
affected by study withdrawal and subject to local institutional policy and procedure.  
Participants in both arms who do not under go an HCV evaluation within 5 months of 
enrolling in the study will be withdrawn and will be considered as treatment failuresAny 
subject will be discontinued from the study if th ey are discharged from the clinic or if 
their HCV medication administration lapses for 1 month or more.  
  
20.2 Describe any procedures for orderly termination.    
NOTE:  Examples may include return of study  drug, exit interview with clinician.  
Include whether additional follow up is  recommended for safety reasons for 
physical or emotional health.  
Response: Orderly termination will proceed  as follows. Sites will contact the 
patient advising of the potent ial need to terminate part icipation in the research 
protocol. If subject is agreeable, a visit may be scheduled at the site to discuss 
subjects concerns and or reas ons for poor adherence.    
20.3 Describe procedures that will be foll owed when subjects withdraw from the 
research, including retention of already  collected data, and partial withdrawal 
from procedures with continue d data collecti on, as applicable.  
Response: Subjects will be informed at th e time of informed consent that should 
they choose to withdraw prematurely from the study, they will be asked to 
  Page 40 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   complete a last survey and agree to last blood draw to determine viral load status, 
subsequently, any new and all data collect ed to date will be included in study 
results.  
  
21.0 Risks to Subjects  
21.1 List the reasonably foreseeable ri sks, discomforts, hazards, or 
inconveniences to the subjects related to their participation in the research. 
Consider physical, psychological, social, legal, and economic risks.   Include a 
description of the probab ility, magnitude, duration, and reversibility of the 
risks.   
NOTE:  Breach of confidentiality is always a risk for identifiable subject data.  
Response: The primary risk potential is br each of participant confidentiality and 
privacy and injury due to blood draw ing. Blood obtained for HCV RNA levels 
will be drawn by experienced laboratory personnel who have been trained in 
phlebotomy. Data protections will be  designed in collaboration with the 
information technology departments at each  of the participating sites throughout 
the study to minimalize the risk of  breach of confidentiality.   
Interview substudy:  
Breach of confidentiality is a risk.  Subj ects may feel uncomfortable with some 
interview questions.  
For the focus groups:  While we are not sp ecifically looking fo r information that 
may be damaging, we are asking abou t experiences from the staff and 
administrators’ places of employment, and due to the free form nature of the focus 
groups, participants may offer opinions a nd information that may be damaging to 
their employment and/or re putation.  Due to the nature of the focus groups, 
multiple people from each clinic may be present, as well as other professionals 
from other clinics, and therefore participan ts would not have c onfidentiality from 
other participants.  No c ontent from the focus groups w ill be published or shared 
in an identifiable manner.  
21.2 Describe procedures performed to lessen the probability or magnitude of 
risks, including procedures being perf ormed to monitor subjects for safety.  
Response: To minimize risk, blood will be  drawn in medical settings with 
protections such as bandages and immedia te access to medical personnel in case 
of severe injury. Discussions of study enrollment will be done in a private setting, 
between the study case mana ger and the potential st udy participant at the 
individual participating OAT clinic site. Si milarly, for patients in the telemedicine 
arm, HCV therapies will be dispensed at  the methadone dispen sing window at the 
same time as methadone to minimize the chance that a person might be observed 
taking HCV medications. Consent will be obtained to disclose medical 
information to their medical  providers and HCV specialis ts in order to follow up 
on referral requests. Participants will al so be asked to si gn a confidentiality 
statement acknowledging the importance of not disclosing personal information to 
other participants. Participant medical in formation will be entered into a password 
protected electronic medical  record. Data collected during the study will be 
entered using data entry by experienced data operators into MoM, or a secure 
  Page 41 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   database created by Breadcrumb Analytic s. This de-identif ied data will be 
monitored for accuracy and completeness via reports generated by the Institute for 
Healthcare Informatics Department at the University at Buffalo  
Interview substudy:  
Subjects’ names will not be included in reco rdings or transcripts.  All recordings and 
transcripts will be stored electronically on a password protected server.    
  
21.3 If applicable, indicate which procedures  may have risks to the subjects 
that are currently unforeseeable.  
Response: While measures wi ll be taken to avoid br each of confidentiality, 
technology at all levels is at  risk for corruption of data  servers as well as cyber 
hacking of information.  
  
21.4 If applicable, indicate which resear ch procedures may have risks to an 
embryo or fetus should the s ubject be or become pregnant.  
Response: N/A  
  
21.5 If applicable, describe risks to others who are not subjects.  
Response: N/A  
  
22.0 Potential Benefits to Subjects  
22.1 Describe the potential benefits that individual subjects may experience by 
taking part in the research.  Include the probability, magnitude, and duration of 
the potential benefits.  Indicate if there is no direct benefit.    
NOTE:  Compensation cannot be stated as a benefit.  
Response: For those participants who follow through with treatment from referral to a 
liver specialist or via teleme dicine intervention, the expected  benefit will be sustained 
virologic response. Additionally, many patients who have resolved HCV report 
improved quality of life, diminished fatigue, a more positive attitude toward life in 
general with the knowledge th at they have eliminated a chronic viral infection.   
  
23.0 Compensation for Research-Related Injury  
☐  N/A:   The research procedures for this study do not present risk of 
research related injury (e.g. survey st udies, records review studies).  This 
section does not apply.    
23.1 If the research procedures carry a risk of research related injury,  
describe the available compensation to s ubjects in the event that such injury 
should occur.    
Response: Since this is a study of teleme dicine-based treatme nt approaches for 
HCV, we do not anticipate a great deal of  risk associated with the protocol.  
  Page 42 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   Therefore, no compensation will be availa ble to subjects in the event of injury. 
We do acknowledge, however, that we are assessing a treatment delivery 
modality that will involve the use of FDA-approved medications at indicated 
doses and durations; these medications ma y have their own associated adverse 
events. Although not part of the research, pe r se, in the event of  injury to the study 
subject, immediate medical attention will be provided at the clinic where they 
customarily receive treatment or by referral from the study participating clinic to a 
local hospital.   
  
23.2 Provide a copy of contract language , if any, relevant to compensation for 
research related injury.  
NOTE:  If the contract is not yet approved at the time of this submission, submit the 
current version here.  If the cont ract is later approved with different  language regarding 
research related injury , you must modify your response here and submit an amendment 
to the IRB for review and approval.   
Response: There is no specific contra ct language from PCORI related to 
compensation for research related injury.   
  
24.0 Economic Burden to Subjects  
24.1 Describe any costs that subjects may be responsible for because of 
participation in the research.    
NOTE:  Some examples include transportation or parking.  
Response: Inclusion criteria require that all subjects must be covered by medical 
insurance as is the case for 95% of patie nts on OAT in New York State. Subjects 
consenting to participate in either ar m will be responsible for any and all 
copayments identified by medical insure rs. We will attempt to have visits for 
subjects managed by telemedicine sche duled during their re gularly scheduled 
methadone visits. However, there may be  some costs related to travel for 
unscheduled visits. Therefore, we do not  anticipate signifi cant added financial 
burden incurred due to transportation requi red to travel to the methadone clinic 
for study-related visits.  
  
☐  N/A:   This study is not enrolling subjects,  or is limited to records review 
procedures only.  This s ection does not apply.  
25.0 Compensation for Participation  
25.1  Describe the amount and timing of any compensation to subjects, 
including monetary, course credit, or gift card compensation.  
Response: Subjects will receive $25 each for completion of consent and blood 
draw, and $15 for completion of each survey as well que stionnaire/survey. 
Participants in the telemedicine arm w ill be reimbursed a total of $130 and in the 
usual care arm a total of $130.

If a subject is reinfected and agrees to  have additional blood draws, they will 
receive $25 for the genotyping blood draw visi t, and if they be gin retreatment, 
$25 for each blood draw visit, up to 5.  
Interview substudy:  
PCORI Study subjects and non-partic ipants will be compensated $25 per 
interview or focus group sessi on. Compensation may be in th e form of gift card or 
cash.  It will be available immediately after the interview at the substance use 
treatment facility for the s ubject to pick up at their c onvenience, or mailed in a 
secure fashion.  If possibl e (depending on union/site rules) staff will be 
compensated $25 for interviews.  
☐  N/A:   This study is not enrolling subj ects, or is limited to records 
review procedures only.  Th is section does not apply.  
☐  N/A:   There is no compensation for participation.  This section 
does not apply.  
26.0 Consent Process  
26.1 Indicate whether you will be obtaining consent.    
  Page 44 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   NOTE:  This does not refer to consent doc umentation, but rather whether you will 
be obtaining permission from subjects to participate in a research study.   Consent 
documentation is addressed in Section 27.0.  
 ☒  Yes  (If yes, Provide responses to each question in this Section)  
 ☐  No  (If no, Skip to Section 27.0)   
  
26.2 Describe where the consent process wi ll take place.  Include steps to 
maximize subjects’ privacy.  
Response: Consenting of subjects will be completed at the individual participating 
clinic sites by designated study staff.  Discussions of study enrollment and 
consenting will be done in a private setting between the study case manager at the 
participating OAT clinic and the potential study participant. All participating OAT 
clinics must provide a patie nt-friendly, private examina tion room for discussion of 
HCV detection, study information, and consenting.   
Subjects who are found to be reinfected will be asked to sign an ICF addendum 
for the collection of additional blood draws.  
Interview substudy:  
For interviews, the consent process will take place in a private room, or over the 
phone or videoconference while both parties are in a private room.  
26.3 Describe how you will ensure that subjects are provided with a sufficient 
period of time to consider taking part in the research study.    
NOTE:  It is always a requirement that a pr ospective subject is given sufficient time 
to have their questions answered and cons ider their participation.  See “SOP: 
Informed Consent Process  for Research (HRP-090)” Sections 5.5 and 5.6.  
Response: Patients identified as HCV an tibody positive will be given their results 
and information regarding HCV infecti on in the form a brochure provided by 
SAMHSA. At that time, the case study ma nager will inform the patient of the 
study and will provide them w ith a copy of the consent fo r their review. Potential 
subjects will be given as much time as required to review th e consent, including 
taking it home with them for consideration of signing at another visit. As patients 
attend the OAT program several times pe r week, asking them  to return on a 
subsequent day should not pose an undue burden on patients. All patients will be 
encouraged to ask questions and to di scuss potential enrollment with family 
members, friends, and other providers. Patie nts may enroll at any time during the 
control or interven tion time frames.  
Interview substudy:  
Subjects may take their time  deciding whether they w ould like to participate.  
  
26.4 Describe any process to ensure ongoi ng consent, defined as a subject’s 
willingness to continue participation for the duration of the research study.    
Response: Subjects will be informed of th eir right to withdraw from the study at 
any time without risk of jeopardizing ongoing participation in the OAT program.  
Interview substudy:  
  Page 45 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   If subjects seem uncomfortable with a que stion, they will be reminded that they 
may skip any questions, or stop the interview at any time.  
26.5 Indicate whether you will be follow ing “SOP: Informed Consent Process 
for Research (HRP-090).” If not, or if there are any exceptions or additional details to what is covered  in the SOP, describe:

27.0 Waiver or Alteration  of Consent Process  
Consent will not be obtained, required info rmation will not be disclosed, or the 
research involves deception.  
 ☐  N/A:   A waiver or alteration of consent is not being requested.   
27.1 If the research involves a waiver or alteration of the consent process, 
please review the “CHECKLIST: Waiver  or Alteration of Consent Process 
(HRP-410)” to ensure that you have provid ed sufficient information for the IRB 
to make the determination that a wai ver or alteration can be granted.    
NOTE:  For records review studies, the fi rst set of criteria on the “CHECKLIST: 
Waiver or Alteration of Consent Process (HRP-410)” applies.   
Response:   (Modification 2/27/2020) We ar e requesting a waiver of consent only 
for the analysis of the subjects’ financia l data for those in the telemedicine arm 
and the subset of usual care arm subj ects who were treated by the PI.  The 
workforce and resource analysis was not planned at the beginning of the study, so 
permission to collect billing data was not in cluded in the consent. At this point in 
the timeline of the study, it is impracticable to re-cons ent everyone that the PI 
treated.  Approximately 5% of the subject s are deceased or lost to follow up, and 
many of the subjects are in long term follow up, with study visits only every 6 
months.  Given the nature of the st udy population, with approximately 15% 
discontinuation from the meth adone treatment program annually, the rate of 
subjects who will be lost to follow up  during the long term follow up period is 
expected to be higher than the average patient population.    
The major point is that long term follow up lasts for two years.  With patients who 
have discontinued from the study because they no longer have follow up, as well 
as those who have transferred, expired or  been imprisoned, approximately 30% of 
telemedicine patients are no longer in  contact with th e study team.    
  Page 49 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   As the provider of the telemedicine or usual care, the PI and his practice plan 
(UBMD) are already in possession of th e data for non-research purposes, so no 
further patient records would have to be accessed to gather the data.  In addition, 
the use of these data would not re quire any patient interactions.  
In order to properly analyze socioecono mic variable differences by region and 
cost benefit measures  by liver disease stages, we w ould like to include the entire 
telemedicine population and the few usual care subjects treated by the PI, and not 
just the smaller subset of those from whom we can get consent from at this point.  
(Modification 5/8/2020)  Based on the initial analysis of the billing data that was 
collected in our previous modification, we are asking for a waiver of consent to 
try to collect the retrospec tive billing data for the remainder of the usual care arm 
subjects who were not treated by the PI.  This study is a comparison of 
telemedicine vs usual care, and usual care in the vast majority of cases is offsite 
referral. We would request th e billing data from the s ubject’s insurance company, 
or secondarily, from their trea ting physician or clinic.  
  
We are also asking for a waiver of consen t to retrospectively collect data points 
from the subjects’ medical records at th e substance use treatment facility and 
OASAS’s servers to analyze their social determinants of he alth (SDOH).  SDOH 
are behavioral, environmental, and demogr aphic characteristics that can affect a 
patient’s health. Upon admission to a substa nce use treatment facility, all patients 
are requested to complete a form that or iginates from the New York State Office 
of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) and collects a variety of 
psychosocial and economic information. A c opy of the form fro m the 01 clinic, a 
powerpoint showing the site 11clinic, and the PAS-44 and PAS26 have been 
added to Supporting Documents and all clin ics in NYS collect similar information 
as part of their admission process. The c linics have their own forms, and then the 
clinic fills out the PAS-44 and PAS-26 fo r OASAS. The original award that funds 
the study was recently amended by PCOR I to include this analysis.  
  
  
27.2 If the research involves a waiver of  the consent process for planned emergency 
research, please review the “CHECKLIST: Wa iver of Consent for Emergency Research 
(HRP-419)” to ensure you have provided suffici ent information for th e IRB to make these 
determinations.  Provide any additional information necessary here:  
Response: N/A  
  
28.0 Process to Document Consent  
 ☐  N/A:   A Waiver of Consent is being requested.    
(Skip to Section 29.0)   
28.1Indicate whether you will be follow ing “SOP: Written Documentation of 
Consent (HRP-091).” If not or if there are any exceptions, describe whether and 
how consent of the subject will be obtain ed including whether or not it will be 
documented in writing.    
  Page 50 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   NOTE:  If your research presents no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects 
and involves no procedures for which written documentation of consent is normally 
required outside of the research context , the IRB will generally waive the 
requirement to obtain written documentati on of consent.  This is sometimes 
referred to as ‘verbal consent.’  Review “CHECKLIST: Waiver of Written Documentation of Consent (HRP-411)” to en sure that you have provided sufficient 
information.  
 
If you will document consent in writing,  attach a consent document with your 
submission.  You may use “TEMPLATE CONSENT DOCUMENT (HRP-  
502)”.  If you will obtain consent, but not document consent in writing, attach the 
script of the information to be provided or ally or in writing (i.e. consent script or 
Information Sheet).    
Response:   
Interview substudy:  
If the subject is consented in person, a written, signed consent form will be 
available.  If the subject is consente d remotely, either over the phone or over 
videoconference, the person obtaining cons ent will document the subject’s verbal 
consent. A hard copy of the consent will be  left in participant’s OTP for them to 
pick up or emailed/mailed to them in a secure manner. No matter which of these 
methods are used, consent to be recorded for interviews and/or focus groups will 
be reitereated at the beginning of th e activity and prior to recording.  
 
 ☐  We will be following “SOP:  Written Documentation of Consent” (HRP-
091).  
29.0 Multi-Site Research (M ultisite/Multicenter Only)

including the protocol, consent docum ent, and HIPAA authorization.  
• All required approvals have been  obtained at each site (including 
approval by the site’s IRB of record).  
• All modifications have been comm unicated to sites, and approved 
(including approval by the site’s  IRB of record) before the 
modification is implemented.  
• All engaged participating sites will safeguard data as required by local 
information security policies.  
• All local site inves tigators conduct the study appropriately.  
• All non-compliance with the study prot ocol or applicable requirements 
will be reported in accordance with local policy.  
Response:  

  Page 51 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016   • As the lead site, the UB Research Center will ensure that once an IRB 
amendment is approved by the UB IRB,  the revised protocol, consents, 
and HIPAA authorization (if applicable ) is distributed to all of the study 
sites.  
• As the lead-site, we will maintain documentation that all required 
approvals will have been obtained at  each site prior to implementation 
of any study related procedures, incl uding approval by the site’s IRB of 
record.  
• As the lead site, we will ensure that all modifications have been 
communicated to sites and approved (including approval by the site’s 
IRB of record) before the m odification is implemented.  
•  As the lead site we will ensure  all engaged par ticipating sites 
will safeguard data as required by local information security 
policies.  
•  As the lead site we will ensure all local site investigators 
conduct the study appropriately.  
•  All non-compliance with the st udy protocol or applicable 
requirements will be reported in accordance with local policy.  
29.2 Describe the method for communica ting to engaged participating sites:  
• Problems  
• Interim results  
• Study closure  
Response: Communication to engaged part icipating sites will be achieved through 
a Governance Plan. A management struct ure will be organi zed through a Steering 
committee and four stan ding committees.    
The Governance Plan consists of:  
Steering committee: will set priorities, oversee timely completion of tasks 
and monitor the overall budget for the study. They will also supplement 
the Data and Safety Monitoring Plan a nd will review project data in that 
capacity as needed.  
Implementation Committee: This committee will oversee intervention 
activities, monitor quality of inte rventions, and make adjustments as 
needed.  
Evaluation Committee: Will oversee all aspects related to data 
management and analysis, including the preparation of study instruments 
and development of the evaluation t ool for capturing data from the 
electronic chart reviews.  
Patient Advisory Committee: Will revi ew procedures to permit patients an 
opportunity to discuss th eir concerns, and to maintain the patient 
centeredness of the study. All case managers will attend the regular 
meeting with the PAC at each clinic s ite to ensure timely resolution of  
patient-centered ongoing concerns or obstacles to study recruitment.  
Sustainability Committee: will incl ude all stakeholders and will meet 
annually to review study progress and to  provide advice on sustainability.  
  Page 52 of 54   IRB Version: JAN2016     
29.3 Indicate the total number of subjects that will be enrolled or records that 
will be reviewed across all sites.  
Response: The total sample size is project ed to be 624 patients enrolled from 12 
participating OAT programs th roughout New York State.  
  
29.4If this is a multicenter study for whic h UB will serve as the IRB of record, 
and subjects will be recruited by methods not under the control of the local site 
(e.g., call centers, national advertis ements) describe those methods.   
Response: We will seek to engage a local I RB at each individual site for review and 
approval of the study protocol. In the case that a site does not have a local IRB, 
University at Buffalo IRB will be acting as the IRB of record.  
  
30.0 Banking Data or Sp ecimens for Future Use  
☐  N/A:   This study is not banking data or specimens for future use or

NOTE:  Your response here must be consistent with your response at the “What 
happens if I say yes, I want to be in th is research?” Section of the Template 
Consent Document (HRP-502).  
Response: A separate check box will be included in the informed consent to 
enable the collection of blood specimens at  the time of enro llment (baseline), 
during treatment and up to two years after treatment for storage in the 
biorepository for viral genetic testing.  Patients will be given a copy of the 
consent and will be counselled that their pa rticipation in this aspect of the study is 
voluntary and will not disqualify their enrollment should they choose not to 
participate in donating a serum specimen. Si milarly, should they choose to request 
that their sample be discarded at any time, study personnel will adhere to their 
request. Samples will be stored indefini tely and only study personnel at UB will 
have access to them.  From this repository a de-ident ified specimen will be sent to 
the Kaleida lab at Flint Rd. Amherst,  N.Y. where the Abbott Lab M2000 is 
housed for HCV RNA and genotyping. A 2ml de-identified aliquot will be stored 
at Abbott laboratories in  Abbott Park, IL. for genome sequencing.     
Interview transcripts will be de-identif ied and banked indefi nitely for future 
research purposes.  
30.2 List the data to be stored or associated with each specimen.

 I.  STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
 
The primary outcome of interest is the sustained virological response ( SVR) rate in the two arms  as well as the comparison 
of the SVR rates between usual care and telemedicine. Other outcomes of interest include: 1) treatment initiation rates 
as measured by the proportion of individuals who take an initial medication dose; 2) treatment completion rates; 3 ) 
patie nt satisfaction with the telemedicine -based hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) care scores using the adapted Patient Satisfaction 
Questionnaire ( PSQ) [1, 2] ; and 4) reinfection rates.  
 
For an explanation of the study scope, aims, setting, description of the population, and implem entation strategies, please 
see [3]. We analyze d treatment initiation and completion rates graphically . Deta ils on the analysis of patient satisfaction 
scores are reported below as are the analysis of reinfections.  We have follow ed the CONSORT statement for reporting of 
stepped wedge trials [4] .  
 
Ia. Primary Aim  Analysis Plan  
 
Ia1. Data Collection : Per guidance of the New York State Office of Addiction Services and Supports ( OASAS) , HCV 
antibody levels are assessed on admission to the opioid treatment program ( OTP) and on an annual basis. Thus, we  
obtain ed a list of potentially eligible participants who were then approached regarding study entry . If HCV seropositive 
individuals cons ented to study participat ion, they were scheduled for a screening visit where the l aboratory parameters 
mentioned in Table 1  were obtained.  Those individuals who ha d detectable serum HCV RNA were enrolled in the study 
and had their level s of fibrosis and inflammation subsequently assessed.  
 
Table I.2: Laboratory parameters collected at Baseline  
Lab test  Reason  
HCV antibody  Assess exposure to HCV  
HCV RNA  Assess active HCV infection  
HCV genotype  Assess type of hepatitis C  
CBC Assess hemoglobin concentration  
CMP  Assess metabolic, renal, hepatic parameters  
INR Assess coagulation parameters  
Toxicology screen  Assess use of illicit substances  
HIV antibody  Assess exposure to HIV  
HBV surface antigen  Assess exposure to HBV  
HBV surface antibody  Assess immunity to HBV  
FibroSure®  Assess liver fibrosis and inflammation levels  
HIV RNA  Assess active HIV infection  
CD4 cell count  Assess immune system status in HIV infection  
Abbreviations: CBC , complete blood count; CMP,  complete metabolic panel; HCV , hepatitis C virus; INR , 
international normalized ratio; HBV , hepatitis B virus ; HIV , human immunodeficiency virus;  RNA , ribonucleic acid  
 
Ia2. Missing data: Missing data can occur in any study design and with any data source.  In clinical trials, missing data 
often arise when participants drop out of the study before its conclusion  [5]. Li et al (2014) indicate that the single best 
approach to deal with missing values is to prospectively prevent their occurrence  [6]. To this end, the study  personnel 
attempted to minim ize the amount s of missing values by following the s tudy participants  closely . The case managers were 
provided with a list of strategies to avoid missing values, and issues surrounding missing data were reviewed weekly during 
conference ca lls.  
 
3 
 Specifically, the following strategies wer e implemented to limit the amount of missing data. Adherence to the treatment 
schedule was monitored very closely by the case managers at each site. At the level  of the overall study , the Biostatistics 
and Data Management Team monitored  the trial weekly. S tudy participants were  informed at the consent stage of the 
importance of completing all surveys, and case managers facilitate d their completion by administering the surveys onsite  
within the OTP . During the time  of COVID -19 restrictions and because recruitment had been completed, the impact of 
COVID on the study was minimal. Additional strate gies we implemented include d frequent reminders to study participants 
for study visits, education of participants of the importance of continuous engagement, keeping participant contact 
information current, providing monetary incentives to participants, ut ilizing OTP staff support to promote participant 
engagement, and collecting information on participants at risk of dropout .  
 
To adequately address statistical challenges around missing data, we collect ed detailed information on the reasons for 
missingness when missing data occur red. Whenever a participant discontinue d all or some type of study participation, we 
document ed the following: 1) the reason for discontinuation, 2) type (s) of participation that the discontinuation involve d, 
and 3) who decided to discontinu e the participant from the study. For example, in the case of ongoing non-adherence 
with OTP attendance requirements or prolonged absence  from the OTP , such as in the case of incarceration , the OTP may 
“administratively discontinue” an individ ual. If a study participant was  discontinued from the OTP, their study participation 
cease d. Therefore, opportunities for follow up blood draws and obtaining study -related information were not possible.  
 When we encountered  missing data , we took the follo wing steps. 1) We filed a report documenting the occurrence of 
missing data, its potential resolution, and the expected resolution date . 2) The case manager at each site investigate d 
whether data retrieval was possible. If not retrievable, we supplemented the report with  the reasons for missing data. We 
requested that each site report the percentage of missing data for each participant on a weekly basis.  
 The above strategies severely limited the quantity of missing data. When we encountered missing data, the explanations 
that accompanied the missing data guided the adjudication of the missing data mechanis m. We used valid statistical 
methods , such as  multiple imputation , to impute missing data. In our study, the maximum percentage of missing data is 
5.814%, and the missing mechanism is missing at random. To perform  multiple imputation, we use d Multivariate 
Imputation by Chained Equations  (MICE) since the estimated intra -cluster correlation is 0.099, sufficiently low to allow the 
use of MICE . We genera ted 20 imputed data sets that were used in the analysis.   
 To estimate the effect of facilitated telemedicine, we used two methods of analysis. Generalized linear mixed effects models, adjusted for the time effect, were used in an intention to treat analysis. An alternative robust, nonparametric, within period, cl uster -level method was also used.  
 
I2 Secondary Aim  Analys es 
 
I2a  Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects : Analysis of heterogeneity of the intervention effect, that is, estimation of the 
intervention effects in subgroups, can be challenging (see [7] ). We defined “a priori subgroups of interest ”, at the request 
of the sponsor,  by the following variables: 1) comorbid medical conditions (specifically anxiety and depression), 2) liver 
fibrosis stage (binary with one level including F3 , F3-F4, and F4 participants versus all other stages), 3) location of residence 
(specifically urban/rural classification). Our goal is the identification of whether or not these factors  influence the decision 
to initiate and adhere to HCV treatment in the telemedicine and usual care arms .   
 The percentage of people with opioid use disorder with comorb id medical conditions ranges from 20% to 85% based upon 
findings reported by others [7, 8] .  We included d epression and anxiety disorders  as a specific diagnosis among those with 
co-morbid conditions  since  the prevalence var ies from 24.5% to greater than 50% [7 -9]. The sample size of our study was 
sufficient to permit stratification by the comorbid conditions variable to allow exploratory analyses.  
 Despite the tremendous therapeutic advances in HCV treatment over the past several years, fibrosis stage remains an 
important factor to explore for its importance as a determinant of successful HCV cure . We based our estimates of advance 
fibrosis and cirrhosis from ou r previous study  [10] in which the percentage of participants with advanced fibrosis (F3 and 
4 
 F3-F4) was 16% and 12% had cirrhosis (F4) .  Correspond ingly, we estimate d that 28% of the participants in each study arm 
would have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis , thereby permitting evaluation of the variable’s influence on virologic outcome s. 
We also evaluate d the percentage of study participants resid ing in urban or rural areas.   
 
Univariate subgroup analyses were conducted by incorporating  a treatment by factor interaction in all relevant models 
and adjust ing for multiplicity of testing. People with opioid u se disorder ha ve been substantially affected by opioid -related 
deaths. As our secondary analyses are largely exploratory, we follow ed Wang et al, (2007) in interpreting and reporting 
the results [11] .  
 
I2b  Patient Satisfaction Analysis : Our mixed -methods a nalysis of patient satisfaction with HCV treatment delivery 
comparing in -person and telemedicine has recently been published  [12]. Generalized linear mixed models  were used to 
account for the time effect on the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire that was administered at two timepoints, 
incorporating adjustments for the clustering effect and the study arm. We modeled  the survey response rate as a function 
of demographic and other relevant covariates .  
 
I2c  Other Secondary Aims : One proposed analysis, desi gned to understand the stability of people with opioid use 
disorder , analyzed v ariables collected on methadone adherence and retention. These include the characterization of 
longitudinal profiles of study participants to illustrat e adherence in the telemed icine and usual care arm s. For these 
analyses, c ontinuous variables were summarized by means/medians  and d iscrete type variables were summarized by 
percentages . 
 
I2d  Analysis of Reinfection Study : An exploratory aim of the trial was the follow up of study participants for up to 24 
months after achieving an SVR  to evaluate for HCV reinfection. We compared the reinfection rates between the usual care 
and telemedicine arms by calculating the cumulative  incidence density for both arms .  
 
I2e Analysis of Social Determinants of Health : We conducted a separate analysis of data obtained on admission to the 
opioid treatment program as well as annual updates for up to four years preceding participants entry in to the study. The 
goal of this analysis was to understand the non -medical factors, specifically social determinants of health, on a 
participant’s willingness to pursue HCV treatment. We have recently published an overview of the methods we employed 
to coll ect, aggregate, and integrate data collected clinically for research purposes [1 3]. We used multiple correspondence 
analysis, k -means algorithm, and logistic regression to identify variables and  clusters associated with uptake of HCV 
management.  
 
I2f Implementation Characteristics of Facilitated Telemedicine : We evaluated organizational characteristics and 
implementation variables associated with patient satisfaction with HCV care through facilitated telemedicine and an SVR. We initially used  random forests and configurational comparative methods to identify combinations of factors associated 
with high levels of patient satisfaction and successful HCV treatment  outcomes. We subsequently use d thematic analysis 
to identify themes associated with successful implementation based upon guidance from an advisory board comprised of 
staff members who were involved with the study. We used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and 
Mainten ance (RE -AIM) framework  to understand the factors that led to successful implementation.  
  
I2g.  Qualitative methods : As part of the study, we sought to understand the impact of the case managers’ perceptions 
and obstacles of conducting research with people with opioid use disorder  [14].  In a separate manuscript, to understand 
the implementation process, we  investigat ed clinical and administrative staffs’ experiences  toward integrated  clinical care 
through onsite telemedicine  for HCV  [15]. We also sought to understand their recommendations regarding scaling and 
sustaining facilitated telemedicine fo r HCV [16] . In both aforementioned manuscripts, w e utilize d hermeneutic 
phenomenology, a qualitative approach to interpreting texts to study a phenomenon. In our initial work, we requested 
texts of stories and held a focus group of case managers facilitating HCV care in people with opioid use disorder . The case 
manager s’ experiences provided  unique perspectives as they were the primary conduits between the participants, 
investigative team, clinicians, and  the OTP staff. We also interview ed study participants t o understand their reactions 
more fully  to integrated HC V and OUD treatment [17] .

A.2.3  Exploratory A nalysis  
 
Distribution of all variables was examined using graphical methods and descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are  
presented by their means and standard deviations or medians and associated interquartile ranges. Categorical variables 
are presented by the associated counts and percen tages. Distributional assumptions were  checked via boxplots, qq -plots 
or other appropriate graphical techniques, and outliers were  identified via the aforementioned graphical analysis . All 
statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,  NC) and /or R. The estimated intraclass correlation 
coefficient ( ICC) was .099 .  
 
Demographic description of the population was provided in terms of characteristics such as age, gender, race , and 
ethnicity . Other variables that contribute d to the descriptions include d residence type (i.e., urban versus rural), Drug 
Abuse Screening Test (DAST) -10 scores [18] , and variables incorporated within the NIDA Quick Screen questionnaire [19] . 
We also incorporate d variables collected on methadone and HCV adherence.

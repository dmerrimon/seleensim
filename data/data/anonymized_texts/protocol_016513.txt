Study Product, 
Dose, Route, 
Regimen and 
Duration  A personalized exercise regimen based on a patient’s AM -PAC 
score and performed in the outpatient setting starting 2 to 4 
weeks pre -surgery, inpatient for the duration of the hospital stay, 
and outpatient 6 months post -surgery.  
Statistical 
Methodology  Primary analysis  
Power calculations are based on the group effect in an analysis 
of covariance for the 6MW test at 8 weeks, with baseline 6MW 
test as covariate. The planned sample size (n = 200) allows for a 
25% dropout rate leaving at least 150 subjects eva luable for the 
primary endpoint. The hypothesi s is that the difference in the 
6MW distance between the study arms (Intervention vs. Control) 
will be ≥ 39.95 m. This effect size stems from a meta -analysis 
where 4 weeks of post -surgery exercise training provided a 39.95 
increase in the 6MW distance in NSCLC patients. Consistent 
with Arbane, SD = 100 m and correlation = 0.5 between repeated 
6MW test measurements on the same subject  are assumed . 
Power to detect the treatment effect was estimated by simulati on 
(in R) of an analysis of covariance model with 6MW test at 2 
months post -surgery as outcome, treatment group as primary 
predictor and pretreatment 6MW test as covariate. Pre and post 
6MW test was assumed to be bivariate normally distributed.

2 BACKGROUND  
2.1 Lung Cancer: A Major Public Health and Clin ical Challenge  
The incidence and prevalence of lung cancer has risen dramatically. In 1953, primary 
lung cancer became the most common cause of cancer death in men, while the same 
occurred for women in 1985 in the United States.1 Worldwide, lung cancer is one of 
the most commonly diagnosed cancer types and also the lea ding cause of death in men.1 
Among the most aggressive cancers, lung cancer c auses more deaths than the next three 
most lethal common cancers combined.1 The lungs are the most common site for 
metastatic disease (secondary lung cancers), which are identified in 30 -55% of 
metastatic cancer patients.2  
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of primary lung cancer 
(~ 85%). Stage I disease (small lesion, no spread in lymph nodes) and stage II disease 
(larger lesion, no spread in lymph nodes and involvement of structures such as the chest 
wall or diaphragm, or involvement of hilar lymph nodes) make up about a third of 
patients with NSCLC.1 Treatment options for lung cancer depend on histology, stage, 
and patient -specific factors. Randomized clinical trials have established surgical 
resection of a single lobe of the lung, or lobectomy, as the treatment of choice for 
operable lung cancer patients in stage I and II,1 improving survival to up t o 75%.1,2 For 
those patients with stage IIIa disease (involvement of ipsilateral mediastinal lymph 
nodes), surgical resection plays a role a fter chemoradiation therapy, provided no further 
spread of disease has occurred, and patients remain medically operable. The lung is 
also a common site for metastatic spread from other primary cancers (most common: 
breast, colon, sarcoma and melanoma). Exp erience with surgical resection of secondary 
lung cancers (pulmonary metastasectomy), once the primary cancer has been 
controlled, has confirmed that resection can substantially prolong survival and 
potentially cure some patients.3-8 In 2015, lung cancer accounted for $13.4 billion in 
costs out of a total expense of  cancer care of $147.5 billion.9 Lung cancer patients often 
experience multidimensional impairments affecting quality -of-life ( QoL) duri ng their 
course of disease.10 Impairments result from both symptoms of the disease and 
comorbidities, as well as side effects of treatment. Interventions aimed at minimizing 
morbidity would have a significant impact on public and population he alth.

Page 13 of 44 2.2 Functional Outcomes after  Surgery  
Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for primary lung cancer patients with stage 
I to IIIa lung cancer, as it offers the best chance for cure. The goal of surgical resection 
for lung cancer patients is excis ion of one or more lobes of the lung that are affected 
by cancer. For secondary lung cancers, this goal is complete removal of the lesion with 
adequate margins. Lung cancer patients suffer substantial functional decline and 
reduced activity levels followin g surgical lung resection.11-13 There is a significant 
deterioration in six minute walk (6MW) distance at five days post -operatively 
compared with pre -operatively (average of 337m vs. 467m).11 Lung resection is 
associated with an immediate 12% reduction in exercise tolerance and 18% reduction 
in pulmonary function.12 Lung resection also has an impact on pos t-surgery health -
related QoL14-16 and causes persistent pain following surgical tr eatment for up to 33% 
of patients.17 The postsurgical period is associated with a 20 -40% reduction in 
physiological and f unctional capacity, particularly in the elderly with comorbidities, 
who may never return to pre -surgery levels of function.18-20 Additionally, poor pre -
surgery physical perf ormance has been shown to increase the risk of mortality,21 post-
surgery complications,  and prolonged functional recovery.22 Thus, the pre -operative 
and post -operative periods are ideal periods to intervene. Enhancing functio nal 
capacity 2 -4 weeks prior to a lung resection is feasible and motivates the patient to 
continue with physical activities and exercises post -operatively, which is essential for 
optimizing outcomes  
2.3 Exercise Training in Oncological Patients  
Exercise interv ention studies prior to, during and after cancer treatment consistently 
show beneficial effects for various physical and psychosocial outcomes.23-33 The 
American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable on Exercise Guidelines for Cancer 
Survivors concluded that exercise training is safe during and after cancer treatments 
and results in improved physical function, QoL, and cancer -related fatigue in multiple 
cancer survivor groups .24 It has been shown that exercise interve ntions can ameliorate 
or reverse cancer treatment -induced impairment of physical function and QoL, such as 
cancer -related fatigue and pain.24-37 
Several non -randomized intervention studies and ten randomized controlled trials have 
demonstrated positive effects of pre - or post -surgical exercise intervention in lung 
cancer patients .11,38 -59 In a review, Crandall et al. concluded that compared to usual 
care, exercise interventions among lun g cancer patients both pre - and post -surgery are 
associated with improved cardiopulmonary exercise capacity and muscle strength, and 
reduced fatigue, post -operative complication s and hospital length of stay.60 Despite this 
consistent and convincin g evidence, implementation of exercise programs in clinical 
practice for patients with lung cancer is still low, perhaps due to unacceptable financial 
and resource demands on the patient and the health care system (e.g., center -based 
exercise). There are f urther gaps in the evidence base: Although the majority of  
exercise studies have demonstrated positive impact, only a small Turkish trial has 
covered the continuum from pre -surge ry to the survivorship period,49 and none have 
used a highly standardized, yet patient -tailored approach. Most of the exercise studies 
in lung cancer patients have been developed outside of the United States, and there are 
currently only two American trials recruiting patients, both of which differ substantially

Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 14 of 44 in their design. One trial tests a 16 -week exercise intervention that starts at least one 
year following t he completion of therapy and requires participants to attend three 
supervised sessions  per week (NCT 01068210). The other trial provides mindfulness -
based pulmonary rehabilitation prior to surgery for both lung cancer and COPD patients 
(NCT 01682850). There is clearly a need for testing innovative exercise interventions 
in lung cancer patients that can be translated into clinical practice across the entire 
continuum of care.  
2.4 Physical Functioning (AM -PAC Scores ) Among Lung Cancer Patients at 
HCI  
The AM -PAC mobility score61 was implemented as the inpatient mobility assessment 
tool in June of 2014 within the U niversity  of Utah Health Care system (UUHS) and has 
become a standard mobility measure collected by physical therapists in the University’s 
acute hospitals ( see Appendi ces 1-3). The PEP Study team plans to extend assessments 
to pre-surgery visits for the standardized precision exercise program. As part of a pilot 
study, n  = 63 AM -PAC scores were collected at Dr. Varghese’s clinic from lung cancer 
patients during their pre -operative outpatient clinic visit. The average score was 5 4 ± 
13. Patients were 54% female, with mean age of 61  ± 15 years. Overall 44% of patients 
were categorized as AM -PAC stage 3, indicating that they had difficulty with 
community mobility. Eighteen % had stage 2, indicating that they had difficulty with 
mobility within the home. Patients ranging across mobility stages 2 -4 are generally 
capable of performing exercise that will have the greatest likelihood in  resulting in 
positive outcomes.  The level of physical function of patients in the clinic can vary 
widely, reinforcing the PEP concept of an exercise intervention that is tailored for the 
mobility stage of each patient. No correlations between the AM -PAC score and age, 
sex or cancer stage (all p  > 0.05; ǀrǀ  < 0.30); some 75 year olds had better function than 
50 year old patients. This suggests that the AM -PAC score is well -suited and sufficient 
to assess physical function, and should be evaluated for appropriate tailoring of exercise 
interventions.  
2.5 Rationale for Conducting the Study  
Studies that have inve stigated the effect of exercise in lung cancer patients undergoing 
surgery have been center -based and resource intensive, and consequently have not been 
implemented in the clinical setting.65-67 Pre-operatively, effective exercise programs 
lasting 6 -12 weeks are not feasible since patients with lung cancer do not want to de lay 
surgery. In fact, one randomized controlled trial (RCT)38 was prematurely discontinued 
because neither patients no r providers were willing to delay surgery longer than 4 
weeks. Post -surgery, home -based exercise strategies capable of improving mobility 
and fatigue levels of patients following surgery for lung cancer a nd colorectal cancer 
45 have been prohibitively expensive because they required  supervised visits by a 
nurse.32 In addition, these programs have been “one size fits all,” lacking a personalized 
approach to optim ize adherence and efficacy.65-68  
To date, no attempt has been made to test a pragmatic and personalized exercise 
intervention (i.e., face to face visits at clinical contacts, telephone counseling in the 
home, and personalized exercise prescriptions) before and following surgery for

exercise in randomized controlled trials with cancer survivors (specifically non -breast 
cancer survivors) i s incomplete and inconsistent.69 To establish consistency in the 
exercise prescription while accommodating the exercise to match the patient’s level of 
mobility, a validated basic mobility assessment tool to create modes and dosages of 
exercise that can be imple mented across the continuum of the pre - and post -operative 
surgical experience in lung cancer patients. The Activity Measure -Post Acute Care™ 
(AM -PAC) (described in Figure 2) will be used as the basic mobility assessment tool 
that prompts the prescribed exercise mode and dose for the patient. The AM -PAC has 
been developed as a pragmatic measurement system that can be used across care 
settings and a very broad range of impairmen ts, limitations and diagnoses.70 The PEP 
Study’s approach with the use of AM -PAC will address a gap in the care of lung cancer 
patients, i.e., the underutilization of exercise because it is clinically not pragmatic and 
it is not known how a nd when to implement exercise.71   
2.6 Rationale for the PEP Intervention Design  
Dr. Ulric h’s previous work with the empirically validated MotivAction intervention 
will serve as the foundation for the PEP intervention, which will be adapted for lung 
cancer patients. The Health Action Process Approach (HAPA ) describes a general 
framework for sel f-regulation and behavior change among individuals with chronic 
illness.72-78 The overarching conceptual basis i s the social cognitive model 74-76 which 
posits that high levels of both motivation and self -efficacy are necessary for behavior 
change.29 Thus, in the HAPA model, a key element for lasting behavior change is a 
motivational shift that instigates a decision and commitment to change. In the absence 
of such a shift, skill training is viewed as premature.74,79,80 As such, the PEP 
intervention focuses on both enhancing the motivation to achieve and maintain change, 
as well as developing the self -efficacy and skills necessary to do so. Many interventions 
focus largely on either motivation or problem -solving/skills t raining despite the strong 
theoretical and empirical bases for doing both. When motivation is addressed, the focus 
is typically on initiating a change attempt, with little attention given to the motivation 
to maintain change. Specific components of the PEP  intervention include: 
individualized tailoring of the exercise prescription; individualized tailoring of the 
counseling based on motivation and self -efficacy to engage in exercise including the 
use of simple motivational interviewing (MI) 79 techniques (e.g., reflective listening, 
avoiding argumentation; developing discrep ancy); identifying barriers to exercising 
and problem -solving solutions; use of goal setting and self -monitoring (including via 
the activity tracker); and, implementing specific strategies for improving self -efficacy 
(e.g., building a series of small achie vable goals; practicing specific exercises during 
the face to face visits to increase mastery ( see Figure 1).  
In sum, the PEP intervention is a directive but patient -centered approach designed to 
enhance motivation for change, and increase self -efficacy i n a non -confrontational 
manner. Several meta -analyses  and systematic reviews have supported the efficacy of 
both social cognitive and MI -based interventions for behavior change in general and 
with respect to cancer patients specifically.81-85

2.7 PEP Study Pilot  
In order to test the feasibility of patient recruitment  and study implementation , a pilot 
study was conducted (IRB 91478 , The PEP Study: Precision Exercise Prescription 
among lung cancer patients , approved 7/3/2016).  
Between 7/7/2016  and 10/11 /2016 , n=18 lung cancer patients we re recruited into the 
intervention program at their pre -surgery consult with Dr. Varghese . Every eligible 
patient was approached, and all patients approached (100%) agreed to participate in the 
intervention. Their physical function  was assessed with 6MW test, SPPB, and AM -
PAC score. The testing and precise exercise prescription was implemented within 
normal clinic workflow and clinic space by a trained physical therapist (Dr. Barnes)  
using existing space in the clinic of Thoracic Surgery.  The intervention included 
individually -prescribed exercise modes (mobi lity, flexibility, callisthenic, aerobic and 
resistance) and dosages (low, moderate, high) tailored to the patient’s AM -PAC 
mobility stage.  
The baseline observed 6MW distance varied from 209 -679m with a mean distance of 
467±119m. Normal 6MW distance for h ealthy 60 -69 year olds is 572m for men and 
538m for women. For ten patients, post -operative 6MW distances were obtained prior 
to 10/15 (max. follow -up time 20 post -operative days within the pilot). Compared to 
comparable control patients (for whom 6MW dist ances at comparable pre - and post -
time points were available) PEP patients maintained their physical function and 
experienced a lesser reduction in 6MW distance (median 6.8% decline in PEP and 
18.7% in controls, see Figure 1). Although this comparison is n ot based on a 
randomized study, it is notable that the decrease (47m) in 6MW distance in the controls 
exceeded the minimal clinically important distance, despite the time points achieved at 
this point being very early in the intervention process. To date, only one patient has 
dropped out (5.5% drop -out rate).  
A follow -up phone evaluation of the PEP intervention showed that patients planned to 
exercise an average of 4.7 days per week and 93% agreed (86% strongly) that exercise 
should be part of their cancer  treatment; 86% also strongly agreed with the statement 
that they believe that the exercise program will have a positive effect on their cancer 
treatment. Several patients noted that they loved being in the program and the effort of 
our team. They emphasiz ed that the exercise intervention helped them immensely with 
recovery from surgery.

Page 17 of 44 In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate that: (1) our team has successfully 
worked together on the PEP study intervention, generated pilot data, and two scien tific 
abstracts ;90,91 (2) lung cancer patients differ dramatically in their functional status, 
independent of age, sex and stage, requiring individualized interventions; (3) the PEP 
intervention was feasible within the existing workflow of a high -volume su rgical clinic, 
with only the addition of a physical therapist to manage the intervention; (4) the PEP 
intervention is welcomed by patients and appears to show early efficacy; and (5) our 
assumptions for anticipated patient recruitment (65%) and drop -out ra tes (15%) are 
conservative. Overall, this pilot work sets the base for a successful clinical trial . 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Description  
This is a Phase 3 study aimed at investigating the effect s of a personalized exercise 
program (PEP) in NSCLC patients (stage I, II,  IIIa) and secondary lung cancer patients 
undergoing surgical treatment at the University of Utah  and comparing the intervention 
to the current standard of care (no exercise program) .  
Eligible p atients will be randomized between two arms  (1:1 ratio) prior to the surgery 
and will be followed for 6 months post -surgery : 
 An Intervention Arm (referred to in materials as Group 1) which features pre - 
and post -surgery PEP interventions.  
 A Control Arm (referred to in materials as Group 2)  which doe s not include a 
personalized exercise program (the standard of care).  Patients randomized to 
the Control Arm will be given the opportunity to participate in a PEP -
intervention session providing exercise counseling after the 6 month assessment 
and will rece ive a free activity tracker for their participation.  
3.2 Number of Patient s 
The target enrollment for the randomized clinical trial is 200 patients ( approximately  
106 men and 94 women).  It is estimated that 300 patients will be approached about the 
study which will achieve a conservative recruitment rate of 65% .  
3.3 Number of Study Centers  
This study will open at a single center at the Huntsman Cancer Institute.  
3.4 Duration  
Participants will be recruited over the course of 33 months. The estimated total 
duration of the study from the first enrollment to the end of the last 6 -months follow -
up is 4 years .

Page 19 of 44 5 INTERVENTION  
5.1 Control Group  
Patient s randomized to the Control Group (Group 2) will not experience any changes 
in the standard of care for lung cancer patients according to their cancer stage.  Although 
patients are encouraged to increase walking both in the pre -surgery and post -surgery 
period, there is no formalized pre -surgery exercise program. Upon study completion 
(at the 6 month post -surgery follow -up visit), participants in the Control Group will be 
offered a PEP -intervention session with precision exercise counseling and receive a 
free activity tracker.  
5.2 Intervention Group  
The PEP intervention involves a combination of home -based exer cise as well as in -
patient exercise. The exercise modes will include basic transfer and calisthenics 
mobility, aerobic and resistance exercises and will be performed in various postures 
(supine, sitting, standing and walking) with variable challenges (leve l walking, 
bending, inclines, steps and squatting).  
For patients randomized to the Intervention Group (Group 1) , the PEP intervention will 
be personalized, implemented, and modified (based on the patients AM -PAC mobility 
stage) by a licensed physical thera pist in face -to-face meetings (~30 -40 minutes) . An 
exercise education manual, specifically developed for this study, will be used by the 
physical therapist to educate the patients on all aspects of starting and maintaining the 
exercise intervention.  
5.2.1 Inpat ient Sessions  
The post -surgery inpatient PEP intervention will be performed under the supervision 
of the physical therapist in accordance with the exercise education manual and the 
patient’s AM -PAC mobility stage.  
5.2.2 Home -Based Exercise  
The outpatient exercises will be performed both pre - and post -surgery and will be done 
at home, the HCI Wellness Center, or a recreational center.  
The study physical therapist will go over (verbally and in writing) the individual 
exercise modes and dosages to be performed at home. Although individually -
prescribed, the exercise mode and dosage will be standardized with respect to the 
patient’s AM -PAC mobility stage  (as shown in Figure 2) . For example, a patient in 
AM-PAC mobility stage 3 will progress  from walking on level surfaces for 10 minutes 
per day at a “somewhat hard” perceived exertion with the ability to talk but not sing 
during walking. The rate of steps/minute will be ~100. Additionally, this patient will 
also perform squatting exercise at t he same perceived exertion for short bouts that add 
up to 5 minutes per day. These aerobic and resistance exercises will be progressed to 
20 minutes and 10 minutes per day respectively as they progress to AM -PAC mobility 
stage 4.  
Protocol name: Precision Exercise Prescription Randomized Clinical Trial  
Version Date: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 20 of 44 Patients will be given acc ess to instruction  sheets  demonstrating exercise modes  along 
with exercise tools (e.g., light weights and external resistance bands), tracking 
diary/calendar and activity tracker  (see note below)  for the home -based exercise 
program.  
Telephone calls or Tel eHealth interactions between the participant and the physical 
therapist will take place weekly to answer questions , optimize patient engagement, and 
adjust exercise prescriptions remotely as needed.  
Ongoing monitoring of attitudes and barriers to exercise  will occur and strategies for 
encouraging uptake of the exercise intervention will be individually tailored. U of Utah 
TeleHealth capabilities, including video chat, will be used to augment telephone 
communications.  
Note : the activity tracker, a  consumer  wearable device (e.g., Fitbit Zip Wireless 
Activity Tracker) , will be used as a pragmatic motivational and self -monitoring tool to 
improve participant exercise efficacy and home exercise program adherence.86 
 
Figure 2: AM -PAC stages (according to Arbane) and corresponding exercise modes 
and dosages.  
5.2.3 Interruption and Discontinuation  
The PEP intervention is already personalized, implemented, and modified based on an 
individual’s patient characteristics. However, if, at any time during the study a 
participant develops an illness that contraindicates exercise in the opinion of the 
enroll ing physician  (includ ing but not limited to those described in exclusion criterion 
4.2.1) , the patient’s primary care physician will be consult ed regarding whether and 
when it would be safe to re -start the exercise program.  
Should any participant develop any condition that would limit their ability to fully 
participate in the prescribed protocol, the participant would be temporarily, or if 
necessary permanently, withdrawn from the study .

Page 27 of 44 9 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF ENDPOINT S 
9.1 Physical Function Performance  
The primary endpoint associated with the evaluation of improvement in mobility 
performance  is the result of the 6MW test (6MW distance) . The distance patients can 
walk indoors on a 25  meters level smooth -surfaced track over the course of 6 minutes 
will be measured at baseline as well as at the time of discharge and at the 2 and 6  
months follow -up. Medi an distances will be computed for each arm at the various time  
points and the expected post-surgery decline a nd recovery during follow -up will be 
compared between arms.  
A secondary endpoint associated with the evaluation of improvement in physical  
perform ance is the result of the short physical performance battery  test. The SPPB score  
(ranging from 1 to 12) will be obtained  for each patient at the time  points described 
above . Medians will be obtained and compared for each arm.  
9.2 Patient Report ed Outcome s 
Questionnaires aimed at measuring disease specific symptoms, multidimensional 
fatigue, common mental health issues (i.e., depression, anxiety, and alcohol  use), and 
hypothesized treatment mechanisms  will be obtained on this study  at base line, at 
discharge,  and at the 2 and 6 months follow -up. The effect of the PEP intervention on 
patient reported outcomes will be evaluated by comparison between each arm of the 
study.  
9.3 Respiratory Function Status  
The effect of the PEP intervention on r espiratory functional st atus will be evaluated by 
comparison of the following parameters between each arm of the study: FEV1, PEF, 
VC, IRV , and ERV . These will be measured at baseline, discharge, and at the 2 and 6  
months follow -up. 
9.4 Exploratory Objectives  
Data gathered from all p atients who received the PEP intervention and pertaining to the 
quality of the intervention, participation in the intervention, and attitudes toward 
exercise (obtained via questionnaires) will be analyzed.  
Additionally, t he effect s of the PEP intervention on the following will be evaluated by 
comparison between each arm of the study:  
 Rate of complications (pulmonary and cardiac events, other complications 
requiring treatment [e.g., liver dysfunction, gastric ulcer, wound infection, 
colitis, depression], rea dmissions, and deaths within the first 30 days after 
discharge) . 
 Length of stay post -surgical  intervention .  
Finally, the effects of the PEP intervention on the following will be evaluated by

biomarkers, in serum, plasma, and buffy coat.  
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDE RATIONS  
10.1 Randomization  
Randomization will have a uniform 1:1 allocation ratio with block sizes of 8.  The 
random allocation sequence will be stratified by pre -treatment AM -PAC stage  only; 
based on primary data (as described in section 2.4 ), the AM -PAC stage  is sufficient to 
assess physical function.  
10.2 Outcomes, Power , and Sample Size Considerations  
Objectives and endpoints are described in Section 1. Covariates used in sensitivity or 
mediation analysis of the objectives will be age, gender, baseline smoking st atus, 
primary or secondary lung cancer, neoadjuvant treatment, tumor stage, baseline level 
of outcome, pain, sleep.  
Power calculations are based on the group effect in an analysis of covariance for the  
6MW test at 8 weeks, with baseline 6MW test as covaria te. The planned sample size 
(n = 200) allows for a 25% dropout rate (the main reasons for drop outs observed during 
the pilot study  was found to be  complications or poor health status preventing follow -
up visit s as well as  distance to study site ), leaving at least 150 subjects evaluable for 
the primary endpoint. The hypothesis is  that the difference in the 6MW distance 
between the study arms (Intervention  vs. Control) will be ≥ 39.95 m. This effect size 
stems from a meta -analysis where 4 weeks of post -surge ry exercise training provided 
a 39.95 increase in the 6MW distance in NSCLC patients.87 Consistent with Arbane ,11 
SD = 100 m and correlation  = 0.5 between repeated 6MW test measurements on the 
same subject  are assumed . Power to detect the treatment effect was estimated by 
simulation (in R) of an analysis of covariance model with 6MW test at 2 months post -
surgery as outcome, treatment group as primary predictor and pretreatment 6MW test 
as covariate. Pre and post 6MW test was assumed to be bivariate normally distributed.  
10.3 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Analyses will include all patients that are evalu able for our primary endpoint (expected 
at least n=150). The primary outcome will be the group effect for an analysis of 
covariance model with 6MW test at 2 months post -surgery as outcome and 
pretreatment 6MW test as covariate, tested at the nominal two -sided 0.05 significance 
level. A sensitivity analysis will be performed with additional adjustment variables 
(listed as covariates in Section 10.1). Missing data will be handled using multivariate 
imputation by chained equations  88 as implemented in the R package “mice”.  
10.4 Other Endpoint Analys es 
The approach to testing for group di fferences for each continuous outcome (e.g., quality 
of life and fatigue summary scales, pulmonary function, length of stay after surgical 
Protocol name: Precision Exercise Prescription Randomized Clinical Trial  
Version Date: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 29 of 44 resection, cost) will be to test for the group effect in an analysis of covariance model 
with adjustment for covariat es listed in Section 10.1 as well as baseline values of the 
outcome variable when available.  
The proportion of patients who continue to smoke post -surgery is expected to be too 
small to include as a reliable adjustment variable or outcome (~ 5%).89 Former smokers  
will be tested  at the 6 month clinic visit to assess smoking recidivism (saliva). A 
separate descriptive analysis will be performed in the subset of smokers .  
An analogous approach will be used for endpoints coded as binary variables 
(complications, readmission) using logistic regression models instead of an alysis of 
covariance models. If diagnostics plots show significant deviation from model 
assumptions, th en a separate sensitivity analysis will be performed using appropriate 
robust regression methods such as those available in the “robustbase” package in R . 
The study design provides  96% power to detect a 10 point increase in FACT -L in the 
Intervention Group compared to the Control Group, similar to the effect of aerobic 
training on FACT -L reported in Jones.46 
For estimation of mediation, mixed effects regression analysis will be performed with 
random slope and intercept for each parti cipant and unstructured covariance matrix. 
The direct and indirect effects of the intervention will be examined. Indirect effects 
analysis can provide important information about underlying mechanisms (e.g. 
treatments could achieve the same outcome via dif ferent mechanisms). Particular 
attention will be paid to the potential mediating/moderating effects of pain and self -
efficacy. For indirect effects analyses, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to 
examine the robustness of effects under different assump tions regarding missing data. 
Gender -specific effects of the intervention  will also be investigate d.

Committee or Research Compliance Office personnel access to t he patient source 
documents, clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, and study documentation for the 
above -mentioned purpose. The Investigator further agrees to assist the site visitors in their 
activities.  
13 SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS  
13.1 Correlative Studies  
13.1.1  Blood  
Correlative blood samples will be taken at the pre -operative  visit as well as at the 2 
months post -surgery visit.  
One 10mL red top tube and one 10mL EDTA tube will be collected at each visit. Serum, 
plasma and buffy coat will be stored for future analysis.  
13.1.2  Saliva  
Patients will be asked to  collect a saliva sample at 6 months follow -up.  
14 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained from all research participants prior to performing 
any study procedures usi ng the most recent IRB approved version.  
14.2 Institutional Review  
This s tudy will be approved by the Institutional Review Board of University of Utah . 
14.3  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is established at Huntsman Ca ncer 
Institute (HCI) and approved by the NCI to assure the well -being of patients enrolled 
in Investigator Initiated Trials that do not have an outside monitoring review. Roles 
and responsibilities of the DSMC are set forth in the NCI approved plan. The ac tivities 
of this committee include a quarterly review of adverse events including SAEs, 
important medical events, significant revisions or amendments to the protocol, and 
approval of cohort/dose escalations. I f the DSMC and/or the PI have concerns about 
unexpected safety issues, the study will be stopped and will not be resumed until the 
Protocol name: Precision Exercise Prescription Randomized Clinical Trial  
Version Date: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 31 of 44 issues are resolved . The DSMC also reviews and approves audit reports generated by 
the Research Compliance Office.   
14.4 Adverse Events / Serious Adve rse Events  
An adverse event  is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not 
considered to be related to study drug. For the purposes of this study, the terms toxicity 
and adverse e vent are used interchangeably. Medical conditions/diseases present before 
starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the 
PEP regimen. Abnormal test results constitute adverse events only if they induce 
clinical sig ns or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy.  
For this low -risk study, information about a subset of adverse events of interest will be 
collected, recorded and followed as appropriate. This subset includes all injuries, 
events, and conditions which could be related to the PEP intervention and require 
medical attention.  
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non -directive questioning of the 
patient at each visit or phone contact during the study . Adverse events also may be 
detected when they are volunteered by the patien t during or between visits or through 
physical examination  or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event 
should be evaluated to determine:  
1. Its severity grade based on CTCAE v.4 (grade 1 -5). 
2. Its relationship to the PEP intervention (definite, probable, possible, unlikely, 
not related).  
3. Its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) . 
4. Action taken (no action taken; PEP intervention adjusted, temporarily 
interrupted, permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant 
medication taken; non -drug therapy given; hospitalization/prolonged 
hospitalization).  
5. Whether it constitutes an SAE.  
All adverse events will be treated appropriately. Such treatment may include changes 
in the intervention (as described in Figure 2 ). Once an adverse event is detected, it 
should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or 
more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to 
the PEP regimen , the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
14.5 SAE Reporting Requirements  
SAEs must be reported to the DSMC as well as the IRB and the FDA (when applicable) 
according to the requirements  described below:  
The Investigator (or a properly delegated study team member) must complete a  
MedWatch 3500A form and submit it to the Research Compliance Office  
(compliance@hci.utah.edu ) as soon as possible,  but no later than 10 business days of 
first knowledge or notification of the event (5 business days for fatal or life threatening 
event).  
Protocol name: Precision Exercise Prescription Randomized Clinical Trial  
Version Date: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 32 of 44 14.5.1  DSMC Notifications  
Upon receipt of the MedWatch 3500A, an HCI Re ssearch Compliance Officer will 
process and submit th e form to the proper DSMC member as necessary for this study.  
The RCO will summarize and present all reported SAEs according to the Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plan at the quarterly DSMC meeting.  
14.5.2  IRB Notifications  
Events meeting the University of Utah IRB reporting requirements (described at 
(https://irb.utah.edu ) will be submitted by the Investigator (or a properly delegated 
study team member) through the IRB’s electronic reporting system (ERICA) within 10 
working days . 
14.5.3  FDA Notifications  
Adverse events occurring during the course of a clinical study that meet the following 
criteria will be promptly reported to the FDA:  
 Serious  
 Unexpected  
 Definitely, probably, or possibly related to the intervention  
Fatal or life -threate ning events which meet the criteria above will be reported within 7 
calendar days after first knowledge of the event by the investigator; followed by as 
complete a report as possible within 8 additional calendar days.  
All other events that meet the criteria above will be reported within 15 calendar days 
after first knowledge of the event by the investigator.  
Prior to submission to the FDA, t he RCO will review the MedWatch report for 
completeness, accuracy and applicability to the regulatory reporting  requirements.  The 
MedWatch report will then be submitted to the FDA through the voluntary reporting 
method by the Regulatory Coordinator.  
14.6 Protocol Amendments  
Any amendments or administrative changes in the research protocol during the period, 
for which th e IRB approval has already been given, will not be initiated without 
submission of an amendment for IRB review and approval.    
These requirements for approval will in no way prevent any immediate action from 
being taken by the investigator in the interest s of preserving the safety of all patients 
included in the trial.  
14.7 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and 
treatment plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved  
by the IRB. Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can 
also undermine the scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification 
for the research.  Protocol deviations are unplanned and unintentional events .  
Protocol name: Precision Exercise Prescription Randomized Clinical Trial  
Version Date: 9/11/2017  
Principal Investigator: Cornelia Ulrich, MS, PhD  
Page 33 of 44 Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or 
scientific integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI within the context of the 
guidelines below. The IRB requires the prompt reporting  of protocol deviat ions 
which are:  
 Exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
 Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant, 
or  
 Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or place them at increased 
risk of harm - including physical, psychological, economic, or social 
harm), or  
 Possible serious or continued noncompliance  
14.8 FDA Annual Reporting  
This study is IND exempt therefore there are no annual reporting requirements to the 
FDA.   
14.9 Clinical Trials Data Bank  
The study will be registered on http://clinicaltrials.gov  and the NCI CTRP (Clinical 
Trials Reporting Program) by the Clinical Trials Office.

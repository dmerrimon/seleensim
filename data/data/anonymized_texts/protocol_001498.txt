Research Question and Aims  
 
Specific aims and Hypotheses : 
 Specific Aim 1: Identify Innate Cell Transcriptomic Signatures As sociated with Sex and Immune 
Response to Influenza Vaccines in the Elderly. To do this we will:  
• Aim 1.1 Test the hypotheses that vaccine type (MF59Flu vs HDFlu) and/or sex are associated with variations in innate cell immune outcomes (e.g., APC activation phenotype and cytokine/chemokine secretion).  • Aim 1.2 Test the hypothesis that the increased Ag dose in HDFlu results in greater activation/suppression of the innate genes/genesets previously associated with immune responses to SDFlu. We will also test the hypothesis that the MF59 adjuvant results in activation/suppression of additional specific innate genes/genesets compared to HDFlu (see Overview and Rationale of Specific Aim 1).  
• Aim 1.3 Test the hypothesis that innate immune cell transcriptomic signatures mediate the association of vaccine type (or sex) with innate cell immune outcomes.  • Aim 1.4 Test the hypothesis that the innate cell immune outcomes and transcriptomic signatures from Aim 1.3 will predict markers of humoral immunity (HAI Ab and B cell ELISPOT response).   Specific Aim 2: Identify CD4+ T Helper (Th) Cell Transcriptomic Signatures Associated with Sex and Immune Response to Influenza Vac cines in the Elderly. To do this we will:  
• Aim 2.1 Test the hypotheses that vaccine type (MF59Flu vs HDFlu) and/or sex are associated with variations in Th cell immune outcomes (e.g., Th phenotype and cytokine production).  • Aim 2.2 Test the hypothesis that the increased Ag dose in HDFlu results in greater activation/suppression of the Th cell genes/genesets previously associated with immune responses to SDFlu. We will also test the hypothesis that the MF59 adjuvant results in activation/suppression of additional specific genes/genesets in CD4+ Th cells compared to HDFlu (see Overview and Rationale of Specific Aim 2).  • Aim 2.3 Test the hypothesis that Th cell transcriptomic signatures mediate the association of vaccine type (or sex) with Th cell immune outcomes.  
• Aim 2.4 Test the hypothesis that the Th cell immune outcomes and transcriptomic signatures from Aim 2.3 will predict markers of humoral immunity (HAI Ab and B cell ELISPOT response).   Background:

 Scientific Premise of the Proposed Research. While older populations are at the highest health risk from 
seasonal influenza, these populations have poor immune responses to standard -dose seasonal influenza vac cine 
(SDFlu).1, 2 Our study is focused on two influenza vaccines for use in subjects ≥65 years of age: MF59Flu , an 
adjuvanted subunit vaccine (licensed in late 2015);3 and HDFlu , a split-virus vaccine containing 4x the 
hemagglutinin protein (licensed in 2009).4, 5 These vaccines have demonstrated greater immunogenicity than 
SDFlu in older populations, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms.5-16 For these two vaccines, 
systems biology studies designed to identify the mechanisms for improved immune response have never been conducted in older individuals, nor have sex -based differences been adequately studied. The goals of 
this proposed project are to examine inter-individual variations in innate and T helper (Th ) responses, and 
identify transcriptomic signatures associated with immune respons es (including correlates of  protective 
immunity) to influenza vaccines in older individuals.   This is important for the following reasons:  A. Public Health Importance. Seasonal influenza A is believed to kill betw een 3,000–49,000 annually,17 
resulting in over 250,000 excess hospitalizations and annual costs of >$90 billion in the US.18 Influenza 
morbidity and mortality increase significantly with age.19, 20 More than 90% of influenza -associated deaths 
occur in individuals ≥65 years of age, and are predominantly associated with influenza A/H3N2. 21 During 
the 2014–2015 influenza season, adults age ≥65 years had an influenza -related hospitalization rate of 314 per 
100,000 people—a record high since surveillance began in 2005.19, 20 The effic acy of influenza vaccines is 
diminished in older adults and varies widely (15% to 75%), averaging <50%.1, 2, 22, 23 Considering the unprece dented population growth in persons ≥65 years of age and the significant public health impact of 
influenza, it is imperative that influenza vaccine -induced immunity in older adults be better 
understood.24-26 Due to in-creased mortality in the elderly and cognizant of budgetary limitations, we will focus on influenza A/H3N2.   B. Knowledge Gap—Immune Response Differences to Adjuvanted vs. High -Dose Influenza Vaccines.  
HDFlu contains 60ug HA per influenza strain, and has been the focus of high-quality studies, including a study of 31,989 older individuals (≥ 65 years of age) tha t demonstrated higher immunogenicity (ratio of GMT 1.8) 
and 24% greater protection against influenza illness than SDFlu (15ug HA/strain/dose).5, 13, 14  MF59Flu also induces higher immunogenicity and longer persistence of Ab titers than non-adjuvanted SDFlu.6-12, 15, 27 A recent large study in 7,082 individuals (≥ 65 years of age) demonstrated significantly higher immunogenicity (p<0.001, seroconversion and HAI GMT) of MF59Flu vaccine compared to SDFlu (particularly against A/H3N2).15 A single small systems  biology study comparing MF59Flu and SDFlu in 
immunoimmature children (14 - to 24-months-old, n=90) identified significantly higher transcriptional responses 
to MF59Flu and identified early innate response signatures correlated with Day 28 Ab titers.28 Thes e include 
M16 (a module associated with TLR and inflammatory signaling); M11 (a module regulating monocyte function); M75 (a module controlling IFN-induced antiviral response); M156 (a module associated with Ab secreting cells); and S3 (a module with genes involved in immunoglobulin production). These genesets and those identified in other systems biology studies of influenza vaccine response will be evaluated for their influence on immune responses to MF59Flu and HDFlu in this proposal.   The underlying im munologic mechanisms  for the improved immunogen icity of MF59Flu and HDFlu are 
largely un known for older adults. Our pro posal will answer key questions (as illust rated in Figure 1) 
regarding in nate and Th immune responses to thes e vaccines, the underlying transcriptomic signatures, 
and their impact on humoral immunity in older adults. At a minimum, this proposal will fill the knowledge

  Page 3 of 37 
 gap by examining whether the higher immunogenicity of these vac cines is a result of greater 
activation/suppression of genes/genesets (mRNA and miRNA) previously associated with immune responses to 
SDFlu, or additional unsuspected genes/genesets controlling immune responses.   C. Knowledge Gap—Sex -Based Differences in Immune Responses to Influenza Vaccines. Studies of 
Multiple v accines (influenza, yellow fever, MMR, hepatitis A and B, herpes simplex [HSV] 2, rabies, 
smallpox, and dengue) demonstrate significantly higher Ab responses in females than males, as reported in a series of high-quality papers.16, 29-38 Sex- based differen ces in humoral immune responses are observed prior 
to puberty, during the reproductive years, and after reproductive senescence,29-38 suggesting that sex hormones are not the necessary —or sole—mediators of sex differences in humoral immune responses to vaccines.39, 40 
Despite significant evidence of immune response differences between the sexes, most vaccine studies do not analyze immune response outcome data by sex.41, 42  Across a cohort of 556 older (ages 50–64) and 558 younger (ages 18–49) subjects, the SDFlu vaccine in duced 
>1.5-fold higher A/H3N2-specific HAI Ab titers in women than men.29 Similarly, a study of SDFlu and HDFlu vaccine responses in 414 elderly subjects (ages 65–95) demonstrated higher rates of seroconversion in females than in males (p<0.05).31 However, no significant differences in Ab measures were found in cohorts of 494 and 158 older adults after receiving SDFlu,43, 44 and sex was also not reliably associated with seroprotection and/or Ab titers in children and young adults receiving MF59Flu.45 These publications demonstrate in-consistent —and sometimes conflicting —findings regarding sex -based effects on immune responses to 
influenza vaccine. Further research is needed, which is a stated priority for NIH research.  
Additionally, new vaccines containing the MF59 adjuvant are likely to alter the transcriptomic signatures associated with vaccine responses in elderly populations, and potentially alter the influence of sex on those 
responses. The current lack of knowledge is a critical barrier to understanding poor vaccine responses in the 
elderly, and such knowledge is foundational to the future development of new influenza vaccines.  
 D. Impact of this Work. Given the substantially diminished efficacy of influenza vaccines with age and the importance of developing improved influenza vaccines,46 data from our studies could be used to inform directed and rational development of next -generation influenza vaccines and/or therapeutics47-57— although the 
development of such a vaccine is not the  purpose of this proposal. Age -related immune dysfunction 
(immunosenescence) might be overcome by adjuvant stimulation of innate and/or Th cell -specific genes, which 
may be different in males and females (see Expected Results). For example, a TLR4 agonist GLA- SE has been 
shown to enhance Th1 responses to influenza vaccine in older adults.58 The identification of critical chemokine pathways involving CCR5 and its ligands (CCL5) (see Preliminary Data #7), predictive of influenza vaccine -
induced humoral immunity, may support the usage of CCR5 small molecule agonists/antagonists approaches in vaccines to modulate inflammatory response and T cell chemotaxis/activation for optimal Ab response.44, 59-62  
Study Design and Methods  
 Methods :   
 
Subject Recruitment, Enrollment and Screening  
 
We will screen and recruit 400 generally healthy  males and females  ages 65 and older who meet all in clusion 
and exclusion criteria an d are willing  to receive a flu vaccine.  
 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB 10429.00 9]  Effective: 10/10/2016 
 
  Page 4 of 37 
 We will also screen and recruit 20 generally healthy males and females ages 18 -40 as a control group. These 
subjects will only have a baseline blood draw (no flu vaccine administration and no follow-study visits). 
 Eligible s ubjects who consent and enroll into  the study will undergo a baseline blood draw (up to 108  mL) and 
then be randomly assigned to receive either the MF59 (Fluad) flu vaccine (N=200) or the High Dose (Fluzone) flu vaccine (N=200 ).  Subjects in the control group will undergo the baseline blood draw only (up to 108 mL) .  
They will NOT receive a flu vaccine. The following sections describe the remaining study visits for the subjects who are ages 65 and older.  Subjects will then be asked to come back for three additional blood draws after their flu vaccination : Day 1, 
Day 8, and Day 28 afte r vaccination.  Each blood draw will be up to 105mL of blood.  
 Flu vaccination can occur up to 2 weeks after the baseline blood draw. The Day 1 blood draw will occur the following day after vaccination. The Day 8 blood draw will occur 7-10 days after the vaccination. The Day 28 blood draw will occur 25-31 days after vaccination.    During the Baseline visit we will collect patient demographic information, height, weight, BMI , medication  
history, m edical information , and information on alcohol and smoking use. Patients will also be offered the 
CDC’s influenza vaccine -specific Vaccine Information Sheet that is routine ly provided to Mayo patients. 
 During the 3 follow- up visits we will collect weight, medication history and medical information.  
 Subjects will be remunerated $40 for each blood draw visit they complete.  We will also mail subjects, roughly a year after participation, 3 different sleep questionnaires as a way to assess sleep hygiene and immune response.       Resources: Potential participants will be identified through routine clinical appointments, advertising  with 
flyers, brochures , an EMR search to identify mail- merge candidates , and existing lists/databases of individuals 
interested in being contacted about participation in research studies. Subject recruitment and advertisement will occur on Mayo campus and at various sites off campus (e.g., retirement centers). Permission will be obtained from each location before recruitment begins. We will also use newspaper and social media advertisements.    
 Based on a 2016 census by the United States Government, there were between 30,447 - 54,748 people 65 yea rs 
of age or older in Olmsted County.    This project has been funded through the NIH through an R01 award.  
 The majority of the laboratory assays will be performed in the Vaccine Research Group Laboratory which occupies approximately 3,500 square feet on the sixth floor of the Mayo Clinic Guggenheim Research Building. Equipment not in this laboratory is readily available in institutional core laboratories and is freely shared.

Subject Information  
 Target accrual:  420.  This includes 400 subjects ages 65 and older (over-recruiting by 10% to account for 
subject drop-out and insufficient cell recovery from biospecimens) and 20 younger subjects (18- 40 years of age) 
as a control group.  Subject population:  Potential participants will be identified through routine clinical appointments, advertising  
with flyers, brochures, an EMR search to identify mail- merge candidates , and existing lists/databases of 
individuals interested in being contacted about participation in research studies. Subject recruitment and advertisement will occur on Mayo campus and at various sites off campus (e.g., retirement centers). Permission will be obtained from each location before recruitment begins.   Inclu sion Criteria :  
• Male or female adults ages 18-40 or  65 and  older at the time of enrollment  
• Eligible to receive Fluad ® (MF59Flu) or Fluzone® (HDFlu) if age 65 or older 
• No history of anaphylactic reaction to gelatin, neomycin, or other vaccine component 
• Not pregnant 
• No immunosuppression or immunodeficiency 
• No acute illness at time of vaccination  
• Determined by medical history and clinical judgment to be eligible for the study, by being generally healthy, with no autoimmune or immunosuppressive conditions and having stable current medical conditions (s ubjects with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change 
in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease 12 weeks before receipt of study vaccine, will be eligible. A change in dose or therapy within a category (e.g., change from one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to another) is allowed. A change to a new therapy category (e.g., surgery or addition of a new pharmacological class) is only allowed if it is not caused by worsening disease. A change to a new therapy category caused by worsening disease is considered significant and therefore ineligible for enrollment.

 Experimental Design : 
 
Below, we briefly describe the assays we will use to monitor/characterize transcriptional changes and specific 
innate immune response variables at three important time points as in -formed by other studies and our 
preliminary data: Baseline (Day 0) and Days 1 and 8 after vaccination.  The baseline blood draw allows us to 
ascertain each subject’s pre-existing immune status and provides a baseline upon which to evaluate immunologic changes caused by the vaccine.  The Day 1 blood draw allows us to examine early, inna te immune 
responses.  The Day 8 sample will be used to characterize plasmablast responses which are directly responsible for humoral immunity and the development of protective Ab titers.  The Day 28 blood draw will allow us to examine the peak adaptive imm une response. 
The assays will be performed either on T- and B- cell depleted PBMCs isolated at each timepoint (for APC im-
munophenotyping, mRNA, and miRNA) or on T- and B- cell depleted PBMCs stimulated in vitro with influenza 
A/H3N2 (for cytokine/chemokine secretion). This will allow us to capture the in vivo and in vitro effects of these two vaccines.  
 
The clinical characterization  of our study subjects will include demographic information, height, weight, 
medications, and medical conditions that do not me et exclusion criteria. We will also run a CBC to quantify 
blood leukocyte populations. 
 Secreted Cytokine/Chemokine Mediators . Meso Scale Discovery kits will be used to detect cytokines and 
chemokines in culture supernatants before and 24 hours after in vitro stimulation with influenza A/H3N2.  
Detection of Functional Innate Cell Subsets by Flow Cytometry . Cellular phenotypes of cells (before and 24 
hours after in vitro stimulation with influenza virus) will be characterized in Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8 
PBMCs by flow cytometry.259 We will examine the frequency of immune cell types, and characterize their activation by detecting the presence of cell surface markers, co -stimulatory molecules, and activation markers.  
Influenza A/H3N2 Ab Assay . The HAI Ab assay will be performed using standard protocols.262, 359, 369-
373 Given the known issues with some A/H3N2 strains, we will utili ze influenza antigen matching the vaccine 
strain and test the antigen for neuraminidase binding to RBCs.374, 375  CMV Serostatus . CMV Ab titers (IgG) will be measured by multiplex flow -based immunoassay (Bio- Rad).  
B Cell ELISPOT. Influenza- specific Ab -secreting cells/plasmablasts and memory IgG-like B cells will be 
quantified in PBMCs using ELISPOTPLUS for Human IgG kits (Mabtech) with (for memory B cells) or without (plasmablasts) R848/IL- 2 pre -stimulation.262, 361  
mRNA Transcriptomics .141 mRNASeq will be  performed in Mayo Clinic’s Medical Genome Facility on 
RNA samples extracted from PBMCs harvested at Baseline, Day 1 and Day 8. RNA libraries will be multiplexed with six samples per lane. Flow cells will be sequenced as 51x2 paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq. Base-calling will be performed using Illumina’s RTA version 1.17.21.3. We will use StringTie376, 377 to process the resulting BAM files and sQTLseekeR378 to evaluate alternately spliced transcripts.  miRNA Sequencing . RNA libraries will be prepare d with RNA extracted from Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8-
harvested PBMCs (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Kit, New England Biolabs). Following multiplex adapter ligation (24 samples/lane) and library enrichment by PCR, equimolar amounts of each library will be pooled, 
purified, and loaded onto flow cells for sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 2000, Illumina cBot and cBot Paired end cluster kit version 3). Bioinformatics analysis will use adapter trimmed reads and miRDeep2.379

  Page 12 of 37 
 The planned analyses for Aims 1 and 2 will follow the same strategies, so for Aim 2 analyses we point out the 
differences needed to adapt the analyses for Aim 2.  Aim 2.1 Test the hypotheses that vaccine type (MF59Flu vs HDFlu) or sex is associated with variations in Th cell immune outcomes: The analysis plans for Aim 1.1 will be followed, but using the Th phenotype and cytokine production outcomes, evaluating change from Baseline to Days 8 and 28.  Aim 2.2 Test the hypothesis that the expression of specific genes is associated with differences in Th cell immune outcomes: Analyses will parallel those for Aim 1.2, but use differential Th cell-specific gene and miRNA e xpression (change from Baseline to Days 8 and 28) as independent variables to evaluate for their 
association with change in Th cell immune responses.  Aim 2.3 Test the hypothesis that Th cell transcriptomic signatures mediate the association of vaccine typ e 
(or sex) with Th cell immune outcomes: Analyses will parallel those  described in Specific Aim 1.3. 
Aim 2.4 Test the hypothesis that Th cell immune outcomes and transcriptomic signatures from Aim 2.3 will predict markers of humoral immunity (HAI Ab and B cell ELISPOT response) : The analysis plans 
closely follow the mediation analyses described in Aim 1.4. We will test the hypothesis that Th immune response and their associated genes (Aim 2.3), predict humoral immunity (HAI Ab titer and B cell ELISPOT respo nse) at Day 28. We will also test the hypothesis that additional genes mediate humoral immunity 
independently of Th responses. To achieve this, we will treat Th responses as adjusting covariates, using the regression model: By adjusting for Th response, we seek genes/genesets that are only associated with humoral immune response.   Power:  See Specific Aim 1. We anticipate stronger signals in the transcriptomic data from purified CD4+ T 
cells compared to PBMCs. The increased signal to noise ratio will allow for detection of smaller effects.   Potential Limitations and Alternative Strategies for Aims 1 and 2.  False -positive associations will be controlled by our clearly defined analysis plan, the use of false-discovery 
rates to assess significance, and geneset/pathway analysis to maximize power and minimize false discovery.  
Statistical power to detect effects is driven by our sample size of 400 subjects, which is larger than most systems biology studies, including our prior study of SDFlu in older subjects where we and others were able to successfully identify transcriptomic signatures of vaccine response.16, 44, 59-61, 260, 261, 263, 264, 275, 280, 437 Accumulation of information across multiple genes increases the percent of variability explained by the model and hence increases the likelihood of detecting effects. Our analysis approach will also test the association of each innate and Th cell immune response with the expression of all genes in a specified geneset using kernel methods.438-441 Advantages of kernel methods are the following: 1) they allow for correlations among the different genes in a geneset; 2) they are robust to when some genes are positively associated with a response, others are negatively associated with a response, and other genes in the geneset are not associated; 3) and they allow adjustment for covariates. Finally, we will evaluate data -driven genesets using WGCNA to 
group genes into biological modules,118 which is an approach we have successfully used (see Preliminary Data).  
Separate mediation analyses will be performed for mRNA and miRNA. If we find both mRNA and miRNA to be separate mediators in our initial analyses, we will evaluate their joint effe cts as a pathway of mediators  using 
techniques developed by VanderWeele.106 Other co nfounding factors (e.g., immunosenescence, underlying 
medical co nditions, obesity, and CMV serostatus) will be evaluated in our analyses as potential confounders.  
 Expected Results and Impact of Findings for Specific Aims 1 and 2.  Our publications44, 59, 258, 259, 263-
265, 442, 443 and preliminary data indicate a high likelihood of identifying not only significant vaccine type-

  Page 13 of 37 
 and sex -specific differences in immune responses, but also transcriptomic signatures associated with those 
differences. Furthermore, the preliminary data from our mediation analysis support our hypothesis that changes 
in gene expression influence the effect of sex on immune response. We therefore anticipate identifying comparable sex -specific differences along with the genes/genesets  mediating those responses (i.e., 
transcriptomic signa tures), following receipt of MF59Flu and HDFlu. Pinpointing the innate and/or Th cell 
responses associated with humoral immunity to these vaccines facilitates our understanding of the critical pathways vaccines must trigger in order to elicit protective antibody titers.  Our data will also provide new insights into why men and women respond differently to influenza vaccines, and highlight the specific genetic pathways associated with MF59- and s ex-based immune response differ ences. 
Aims 1.1 and 2.1 may provide additional correlates of protection that can be used in conjunction with HAI titer to more accurately assess immune status. Understanding what genes and genesets are associated with the increased im munogenicity of MF59Flu and HDFlu (Aims 1.2 and 2.2) will inform functional studies verifying 
the mechanistic relationship between gene expression and immune function. For example, if TLR4 and TLR8 activation are strongly associated with increased APC acti vation and HAI titers, it suggests the use of a 
combination of GLA-SE (a TLR4 agonist) and CpG (a TLR8/9 agonist) might make an effective adjuvant. As another example, MF59 has been shown to enhance APC recruitment to the Ag site and transport of Ag to the draining lymph nodes. Due to reasons that are currently poorly understood, those processes are followed by enhanced Th cell responses and more robust (in terms of both titer and breadth of targets) Ab responses. Evaluating the transcriptomic changes occurring in innate and Th cells after MF59Flu vaccination is likely to identify gene expression patterns occurring in the APCs and responding T cells, providing critical clues regarding the nature of the interactions between these cell types, and may highlight the receptor -ligand pairs and 
downstream signaling cascades responsible for enhanced T cell responses. Such information allows for di rected 
and informed engineering of novel vaccine candidates and adjuvants. In the unlikely event that we do not identify vaccine type or sex -dependent differences, this finding will be interesting its own right, suggesting that 
further studies be conducted to find additional variables that do impact innate and/or Th responses to influenza A/H3N2.

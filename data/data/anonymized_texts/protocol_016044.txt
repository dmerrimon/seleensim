Title of the Protocol :  
An Open -Label Pilot Phase 2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and Safety of 
Aldoxorubicin  in Subjects with Unresectable Glioblastoma  Whose Tumors Have Progressed 
Following Prior Tr eatment with Surgery, Radiation and  Temozolomide  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy  of administration of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  to subjects with unresectable gliob lastoma (GBM) whose tumors have progressed 
following prior treat ment with surgery, radiation  and temozolomide , as measured by PFS according to 
the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology ( RANO ) Working Group Criteria  (see Appendix F) and 
OS.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the safety of ALDOXORUBICIN  in this 
population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal find ings on 
physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram ( ECHO ) evaluations, 
electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , weight , and the change in performance status as measured by the 
Karnofsky Performance Scale . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
ALDOXORUBICIN  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin.  
Patients with unresectable GBM  who have failed prior surgery, radiation  and chemotherapy with 
temozolomide  regimens  and bevacizumab  have a n extremely  poor prognosis with progression -free 
survival (PFS) of around 8 weeks  and median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8-16 weeks , 
depending on whether salvage therapy is administered.  Recently, we have demonstrated in an  
orthotopic xenograft model of GBM in mice that ALDOXORUBICIN  significantly retards the growth of 
the tumor and doubles the survival of animals when compared to treatment with either saline or 
doxorubicin .  We have also shown that this  molecule collect s inside the tumor  and not in normal brain 
parenchyma . Doxorubicin does not penetrate into either the tumor or the brain.  Thus,  
ALDOXORUBICIN  may be able to effectively treat patients with advanced GBM that have progressed 
after standard therapies .

 Phase of Development: 2 
 
Study D esign and Methodology:  
This is a phase 2  open -label , pilot  study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  administered at either 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) or  
250 mg/m2 (185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 , every 21 days until  
evidence of tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to either dose of ALDOXORUBICIN.  G-CSF (Neupogen or Neulasta) should  be 
administered as primary prophylaxis to all subjects according to the ASCO Guidelines (see  
Appendix E). 
Tumor response  (complete  response [CR] , partial response  [PR] and stable disease  [SD]) will be 
monitored at Screening , then every 6 weeks  ± 5 days using the RANO Working Group  Criteria  (see 
Appendix F) , and treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is observed, 
unacceptable toxicity occurs , or consent is withdrawn . Median PFS, PFS at 12 and 18 weeks , and  
6 months, SD rate at 12 weeks , and OS will be monitored as other primary objectives. Subjects will 
visit the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, including AEs, 
a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete bloo d count 
[CBC ], and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements , Karnofsky Performance Status  (see 
Appendix B) , documentation of corticosteroid usage  and ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac function 
will also be followed periodically using ECHO s.

Title of the Protocol :  
An Open -Label Pilot Phase 2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and Safety of 
Aldoxorubicin  in Subjects with Unresectable Glioblastoma  Whose Tumors Have Progressed 
Following Prior Tr eatment with Surgery, Radiation and  Temozolomide  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy  of administration of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  to subjects with unresectable gliob lastoma (GBM) whose tumors have progressed 
following prior treat ment with surgery, radiation  and temozolomide , as measured by PFS according to 
the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology ( RANO ) Working Group Criteria  (see Appendix F) and 
OS.  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the safety of ALDOXORUBICIN  in this 
population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on 
physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram ( ECHO ) evaluations, 
electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , weight , and the change in perfo rmance status as measured by the 
Karnofsky Performance Scale . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
ALDOXORUBICIN  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumo r by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin.  
Patients with unrese ctable GBM  who have failed prior surgery, radiation  and chemotherapy with 
temozolomide  regimens  and bevacizumab  have a n extremely  poor prognosis with progression -free 
survival (PFS) of around 8 weeks  and median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8-16 weeks , 
depending on whether salvage therapy is administered.  Recently, we have demonstrated in an 
orthotopic xenograft model of GBM in mice that ALDOXORUBICIN  significantly retards the growth of 
the tumor and doubles the survival of animals when compared to treatment with either saline or 
doxorubicin .  We have also shown that this  molecule collect s inside the tumor  and not in normal brain 
parenchyma . Doxorubicin does not penetrate into either the tumor or the brain.  Thus,  
ALDOXORUBICIN  may be able to effec tively treat patients with advanced GBM that have progressed 
after standard therapies .

 Phase of Development: 2 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 2  open -label , pilot  study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  administered at either 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) or  
250 mg/m2 (185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 , every 21 days until  
evidence of tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to either do se of ALDOXORUBICIN.  G-CSF (Neupogen or Neulasta) should  be 
administered as primary prophylaxis to all subjects according to the ASCO Guidelines (see  
Appendix E). 
Tumor response  (complete  response [CR] , partial response  [PR] and stable disease  [SD]) will be 
monitored at Screening , then every 6 weeks  ± 5 days using the RANO Working Group  Criteria  (see 
Appendix F) , and treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is observed, 
unacceptable toxicity occurs , or consent is withdrawn . Media n PFS, PFS at 12 and 18 weeks , and  
6 months, SD rate at 12 weeks , and OS will be monitored as other primary objectives. Subjects will 
visit the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, including AEs, 
a directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete blood count 
[CBC ], and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements , Karnofsky Performance Status  (see 
Appendix B) , documentation of corticosteroid usage  and ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac function 
will also be followed periodically using ECHO s.

Secondary Objectives:  
The secondary objectives of this  study are to evaluate the safety of ALDOXORUBICIN in this 
population assessed by the frequenc y and severity of adverse ev ents (AEs), abnormal findings on 
physical examination, laboratory  tests, vital signs, echocardio gram (ECHO) evaluations, 
electrocardiogram (ECG) result s, weight, and the change in performance status as measured by the 
Karnofsky Performance Scale.

Study Design and Methodology: 
This is a phase 2 open-label, pilot study evaluating the prelim inary efficacy and safety of 
ALDOXORUBICIN administered at either 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) or  
250 mg/m2 (185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intrav enously on Day 1, every 21 days until  
evidence of tumor progression, una cceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to either dose of ALDOXORUBICIN.  G-CSF (Neupogen or Neulasta) should be 
administered as primary prophyl axis to all subjects according t o the ASCO Guidelines (see  
Appendix E).  Note:  ALDOXORUBICIN, at higher doses, has been associated with  >20% 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutr openia. Therefore, the administr ation of G-CSF should occur 
even during Cycle 1 for subj ects receiving the 350 mg/m2 dose of ALDOXORUBICIN.  
Tumor response (complete respon se [CR], partial response [PR] a nd stable disease [SD]) will be 
monitored at Screening, then ever y 6 weeks (±5 days) using the RANO Working Group Criteria (see 
Appendix F), and treatment will c ontinue every 21 days until tu mor progression is observed, 
unacceptable toxicity occurs, or consent is withdrawn. Median P FS, PFS at 12 and 18 weeks, and  
6 months, SD rate at 12 weeks, and OS will be monitored as othe r primary object ives. Subjects will 
visit the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at w hich time safety monitoring, including AEs, 
a directed physical examination , laboratory evaluations (serum chemistry and complete blood count 
[CBC]), vital signs, weight measur ements, Karnofsky Performance  Status (see Appendix B), 
documentation of corticosteroid usage and ECGs will be performe d.  All subjects will have blood 
drawn for serum electrolytes to evaluate the anion gap prior to  each drug administration. Cardiac 
function will also be followe d periodically using ECHOs.

Title of the Protocol :  
An Open -Label Pilot Phase 2 Study to Investigate the Preliminary Efficacy and Safety of 
Aldoxorubicin  in Subjects with Unresectable Glioblastoma Multiforme Whose Tumors Have 
Progressed Following Prior Tr eatment with Surgery, Radiation and  Temozolomide  
Primary Objective s: 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the preliminary efficacy  of administration of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  to subjects with unresectable gliob lastoma multiforme (GBM) whose tumors have 
progressed following prior treat ment with surgery, radiation  and temozolomide .  
Secondary Objective s: 
The secondary objective s of this study are to evaluate the safety of ALDOXORUBICIN  in this 
population assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), abnormal findings on 
physical examination, laboratory tests, vital signs, echocardiogram ( ECHO ) evaluations, 
electrocardiogram  (ECG ) results , and weight , and the change in p erformance status as measured by 
the Karnofsky Performance Scale . 
Study Rational e and Significance:  
ALDOXORUBICIN  is a novel prodrug that binds covalently to albumin in the circulation. The drug is 
accumulated in tumors and doxorubicin is released in the tumor by cleaving the acid labile linker 
(EMCH) in the low pH tumor environment.  This carrier -linked prodrug has demonstrated enhanced 
anti-tumor activity with reduced toxicity in several murine models when compared with free 
doxorubicin.  
Patients with unresectable GBM  who have failed prior surgery, radiation  and chemotherapy with 
temozolomide  regimens  and bevacizumab  have a n extremely  poor prognosis with progression -free 
survival (PFS) of around 8 weeks  and median overall survival (OS) of approximately 8-16 weeks , 
depending on whether salvage therapy is administered.  Recently, we have demonstrated in an 
orthotopic xenograft model of GBM in mice that ALDOXORUBICIN  significantly retards the growth of 
the tumor and doubles the survival of animals when compa red to treatment with either saline or 
doxorubicin .  We have also shown that this  molecule collect s inside the tumor  and not in normal brain 
parenchyma . Doxorubicin does not penetrate into either the tumor or the brain.  Thus,    
ALDOXORUBICIN  may be able to  effectively treat patients with advanced GBM that have progressed 
after standard therapies .

 Phase of Development: 2 
 
Study Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase 2  open -label , pilot  study evaluating the preliminary efficacy and safety of 
ALDOXORUBICIN  administered at either 350 mg/m2 (260 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent ) or 250 
mg/m2 (185 mg/m2 doxorubicin equivalent) intravenously on Day 1 , every 21 days until evidence of 
tumor progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent. Subjects will be randomly 
assigned to eithe r dose of ALDOXORUBICIN.  G-CSF (Neupogen or Neulasta) should  be 
administered prophylactically according to the ASCO Guidelines (see Appendix E). 
Tumor response  (complete,  partial response  [PR] and stable disease  [SD]) will be monitored at 
Screening , then every 6 weeks  using the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology (RANO) Working 
Group  Criteria  (see Appendix F) , and treatment will continue every 21 days until tumor progression is 
observed, unacceptable toxicity occurs , or consent is withdrawn . Media n PFS, PFS at 12 and 18 
weeks , SD rate at 12 weeks , and OS will be monitored as other primary objectives. Subjects will visit 
the study site every 21 days for their IV infusions, at which time safety monitoring, including AEs, a 
directed physical exam ination , laboratory evaluations ( serum chemistry, complete blood count [ CBC ], 
and urinalysis ), vital signs, weight measurements , Karnofsky Performance Status  (see Appendix B) , 
corticosteroid usage  and ECG s will be performed.  Cardiac function will also be followed periodically 
using ECHO s.

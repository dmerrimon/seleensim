1.1. Primary Objectives  
 T o assess the safety of using continuous infusion Plerixafor  beginning one week prior to the 
e
nd of concurrent chemotherapy with Temozolomide and radiation  therapy  in patients with 
ne
wly diagnosed GBM.  
 
 T o assess the efficacy of Plerixafor as measured by progression free survival at 6 months 
(PFS6) from the start of irradiation.  
 
2. BACKGROUND 
 
2.1 Glioblastoma 
Althoug
h radiotherapy delays the recurrence of most glioblastomas (GBMs), these 
tumors invariably regrow and prove fatal for more than 75% of the patients by two years after 
diagnosis. Importantly, most recurrent tumors recur within the field of high dose radiation [ 1-4]. 
Thus, a
ny method of reducing local recurrences will improve the survival of GBM patients. 
Following irradiation, tumor recurrence requires the formation of new blood vessels. Inhibiting 
blood vessel growth will delay or prevent regrowth of GBM within an irradiated field and thus 
improve patient outcome. 
Though it is often unrecognized by investigators in the field, tumors have two main ways 
to grow blood vessels: By angiogenesis, the sprouting of endothelial cells from nearby blood 
vessels, and vasculogenesis, the formation of blood vessels by circulating cells, primarily of bone 
marrow origin. The presence of circulating proangiogenic cells was first demonstrated by 
Asahara and colleagues [ 5], and is now recognized as a way in which blood vessels can be 
for
med in damaged normal tissues and tumors, particularly following therapy [ 6, 7] . We have 
shown that local tumor irradiation, by killing the endothelial cells in and surrounding the tumor, 
abrogates local angiogenesis [ 8, 9]. The tumor must therefore rely on the vasculogenesis 
pa
thway for regrowth after irradiation. 
 
2.2 Plerixafor 
Plerixafor is a reversible inhibitor of the binding of stromal cell derived factor - 1α (SDF-1α), 
a
lso known as chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12) to its cognate receptor chemokine 
(C-X-C motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4).   
 
The FDA has not approved the drug or biologic for treatment of this indication to date.  
 
2.3 Rationale 
Our
 experimental studies suggest that post-irradiation tumor recurrences can be prevented or 
markedly delayed by blocking the influx of circulating proangiogenic cells including CD11b+ 
monocytes and endothelial cells into the tumor [ 9, 10].  Perixafor is a reversible inhibitor of 
binding and would prevent or markedly delay the influx of proangiogenic cells thereby 
preventing post-irradiation tumor recurrences in glioblastoma.

Safety (Phase I)  
E
fficacy (Phase II) 
P
hase I 
The Phase I is designed to evaluate safety. A total of 9  newly diagnosed patients will be enrolled 
withi
n four weeks of surgery (biopsy, partial resection or gross total resection). In order to 
mi
nimize the chances for local angiogenic migration into the irradiated field, irradiation will be 
administered to the area encompassed by T2 FLAIR imaging plus a 2 cm margin to 46 Gy with a 
focal boost to the enhancing area to 60 Gy over a six-week period. Temozolomide 75 mg/M2/d 
starting the day of radiotherapy will be administered for 42 days concurrent with irradiation.  
Eight days prior to irradiation completion, patients will have a PICC line placed. Seven days 
prior to irradiation completion, the continuous infusion of Plerixafor will be initiated using a 
step-wise dose escalation based on the modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) method.  All 
treatments will start one week prior to completion of radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide 
for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. This dose escalation study begins with an 
intermediate dose of 200 µg/kg per day for four weeks.  The first 3 patients will be enrolled at 
thi
s starting dose. Enrollment within a dose level will be staggered so that there is at least 1 week 
between patients. If tolerability and safety is established after the 4 week treatment period, then 
the fourth patient will be enrolled at the higher target dose of 400 µg/kg per day for four weeks.  
W
e will wait one week after the last infusion at one dose level before proceeding to the next 
dosa
ge level.  
If a patient experiences a DLT, then s/he will be removed from study and the next patient treated 
at the lower dose level as dictated by the mTPI table. 
Once the infusion phase is completed, patients will then receive adjuvant temozolomide in 
standard monthly dosages (i.e., 150 mg/m2 x 5 days), beginning at day 35 after finishing XRT (to 
e
nsure no overlap with Plerixafor).

Phase II  
If in the Phase I, patients achieve the highest AUC level (i.e., 400 μg/kg per day for 4 weeks) 
without significant toxicity, we will then conduct a lead-in Phase II study wherein an additional 
20 patients will be enrolled so that efficacy (i.e., PFS 6) can be measured. There will be no delay 
between enrolling patients in this group and multiple patients can be enrolled and treated at the 
same time. 
 
2.5 Correlative Studies Background 
We have recently developed and validated with several transplanted tumors in mice 
(including intracranially implanted human GBM) a new paradigm for the treatment by 
ra
diotherapy of solid tumors: Namely that post-irradiation tumor recurrences can be prevented or 
markedly delayed by blocking the influx of circulating proangiogenic cells- CD11b+ monocytes 
a
nd endothelial cells - into the tumor [ 9, 10]. The significance of our findings is illustrated by the 
fa
ct that our strategy to prevent GBM recurrence has been highlighted in recent commentaries in 
prominent biomedical journals [ 11]. Furthermore, our findings of the importance of CD11b+ 
monoc
ytes and/or macrophages to tumor response to irradiation have now been confirmed by 
others [ 12]. 
 
Our
 findings of relevance to the present proposal are summarized as follows: 
• We have shown that the clinically approved drug Plerixafor (AMD3100), which inhibits the 
int
eraction of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, CXCL-12) with its receptor, CXCR4, on 
bone
 marrow derived CD11b+ monocytes (which are highly proangiogenic) [ 13] both inhibits 
the r
adiation-induced influx of the CD11b+ monocytes and prevents tumor recurrence following 
sing
le or fractionated doses of irradiation (Figs 1A,C). We have confirmed the importance of the 
SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway for tumor recurrences by demonstrating that neutralizing antibodies to 
CXCR4 also inhibit tumor recurrence after irradiation (Fig 1D). In addition we have shown that 
neutralizing antibodies to CD11b+ monocytes can inhibit the recurrence of a human head and 
neck cancer in nude mice, as well as demonstrating that tumors in mice genetically deficient in 
CD11b+ cells are radiosensitive [ 10]. 
 
• We have demonstrated that blockage of angiogenesis following irradiation with the anti-
VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody DC101 is not as effective in potentiating the response to 
irradiation as is AMD3100 either by tumor recurrence or by inhibition of tumor blood flow 
following irradiation (Figs 1E,F). 
 
• We have shown that radiation selectively depletes the tumor vasculature thereby inducing 
tumor hypoxia and upregulating the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), 
which in turn transactivates SDF-1, the key chemokine responsible both for the mobilization of 
bone marrow derived proangiogenic cells and their retention in the irradiated tumor. [ 9, 10]. 
 
• W
e have demonstrated the importance of CD11b+ monocytes in tumor recurrences after 
irradiation in patients by showing that, as in mice, GBM recurrences in patients following 
irradiation have higher levels of CD11b+ monocytes than prior to therapy (Fig 2). 
 
•  We have demonstrated that irradiated tumors express elevated levels of SDF-1 and this 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015

brain tumors. 
 
 
 

    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 11 of 52  
 
Because the CXCR4 serves as a co-receptor, along with CD4, for the binding of human 
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) [ 17], initial Plerixafor clinical trials were conducted for 
the tr
eatment of HIV-1 infection [ 18]. In follow-up to the observation that Plerixafor given to 
he
althy volunteers and HIV-1 infected patients elicited increases in white blood cell (WBC) 
counts, studies have been done in healthy volunteers to assess the effect on circulating peripheral 
blood stem cells (PBSCs) [ 19]. Coincidentally, data emerged demonstrating that homing of 
C
XCR4-expressing stem cells to bone marrow is regulated, at least in part, through a 
chemoattractant effect of SDF-1α that is produced locally by bone marrow stromal cells [ 20]. In 
fa
ct, disruption of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 through G-CSF exposure [ 21] or with chemotherapy, 
re
sults in the appearance of both mature and pluripotent cells in the systemic circulation. Unlike 
the modes of action of either chemotherapy or cytokine growth factors, however, Plerixafor 
exerts its effect on PBSC mobilization as a direct consequent of its antagonism of CXCR4 [ 22]. 
S
ubsequent PBSC mobilization studies have shown Plerixafor to have a synergistic effect on the 
number
 of circulating progenitor cells when administered with G-CSF in patients with non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) [ 23, 24]. 
 
Pharmacokinetics of Plerixafor 
The kinetics of dosing of Plerixafor was first explored in humans in a phase I 
bioava
ilability study in 17 healthy volunteers; 12 by intravenous (IV) infusion (three subjects 
each at 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/kg), 5 by subcutaneous (SC) injection (two subjects at 40 µg/kg 
and three at 80 µg/kg) [ 25]. In this study, the C max and AUC 0-∞ demonstrated dose 
propo
rtionality across the four dose levels. However, a higher Cmax for IV administration was 
noted compared to SC administration (IV: 292.8 ± 67.0 and 503.9 ± 29.6, SC: 123.5 ± 27.9 and 
238.3 ± 17.3) for the 40 and 80 µg/kg dose levels, respectively. The bioavailability of Plerixafor 
was determined to be 80-90%. The pharmacokinetic behavior of Plerixafor is characterized by 
elimination from the plasma in a bi-exponential manner with a terminal elimination half-life of 
approximately 3.5-5 hours following a single dose. Plerixafor absorption following subcutaneous 
a
dministration is rapid and essentially complete, with peak plasma levels occurring within 0.5– 1 

    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 12 of 52 hour of dosing. The exposure-response relationship of Plerixafor in mobilizing CD34 + cells 
when administered as a single agent was also independently explored at doses ranging from 80-
320 µg/kg in 32 healthy volunteers [ 26] and from 40–320 µg/kg in 29 additional healthy 
volunt
eers [ 27]. In both studies, Plerixafor exhibited linear pharmacokinetics (PK) over the 
teste
d dose range (up to 320 µg/kg), consistent with previously reported PK results. Plerixafor is 
e
xtensively protein bound to both human serum albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein; however, 
protein binding does not appear to have a major influence on either antiviral activity, effect on 
stem cell mobilization or toxicity. Saturation of protein binding sites may occur at plasma 
Plerixafor concentrations in excess of those likely to be achieved in any ongoing or planned 
c
linical studies.  
The safety and the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Plerixafor with G-CSF in 
pa
tients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) was also evaluated in 
a phase II, open-label, single-arm study [ 28]. The patients were given G-CSF (10 µg/kg/day SC) 
for
 4 days in the morning and Plerixafor 240 µg/kg SC on the evening before each day o f 
a
pheresis. The PK profile of Plerixafor was characterized in 13 patients (5 with NHL and 8 with 
MM) a
nd, overall, parameters were comparable in the patients with NHL and those with MM. 
Plerixafor was rapidly absorbed after SC administration with no observable lag time, with peak 
plasma
 concentrations occurring 0.5 hour after administration in most patients. Plerixafor was 
ra
pidly cleared, with a median terminal half-life of 4.6 hours. The median maximum increase in 
the number of circulating cells from baseline was 4.2-fold (range, 3.0- to 5.5-fold); with the 
max
imum fold increase occurring approximately 10 hours after Plerixafor injection for all 
pa
tients. The Plerixafor PK and PD profiles in the study patients were consistent with those in 
he
althy volunteers and support the current dosing regimen and timing of apheresis.  
The primary route of elimination of Plerixafor is through the kidneys. A Phase I open-
labe
l study in healthy subjects was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
P
lerixafor in subjects with renal impairment [ 29]. All subjects received a single 240 µg/kg 
subcutaneous dose of Plerixafor. Subjects were stratified into 4 cohorts based on creatinine 
clearance determined from a 24-hour urine collection: control (>90 mL/min), mild renal 
impairment (51-80 mL/min), moderate renal impairment (31-50 mL/min), and severe renal 
impairment (<31 mL/min, not requiring dialysis). Eleven women (48%) and 12 men (52%), 
ranging in age from 35 to 73 years, were enrolled. Plerixafor clearance was reduced in subjects 
with re
nal impairment and was positively correlated with creatinine clearance. The mean area 
under the concentration-versus-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours postdose of Plerixafor in 
subj
ects with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment was 7%, 32%, and 39% higher, 
respectively, than that in subjects with normal renal function. Renal impairment had no effect on 
maximal plasma concentrations. The safety profile was similar among subjects with renal 
impairment and controls. No renal impairment-related trends in the incidence of adverse events 
(AEs) were apparent. A Plerixafor dose reduction to 160 µg/kg in patients with a creatinine 
c
learance value <or= 50 mL/min is expected to result in exposure similar to that in patients with 
normal to mildly impaired renal function, and became the basis for this dose recommendation in 
the FDA approved indication in NHL and MM, when added to G-CSF for mobilization.  
In a phase I trial evaluating single dose IV Plerixafor in healthy donors for stem cell 
ha
rvest and use in allogeneic transplant, pharmacokinetic evaluation demonstrated that C max 
following the 320μg/kg IV dose remained below 1.0 µg/mL whereas 400 μg/kg (N = 3) and 480 
μg/kg (N = 3) doses resulted in C max levels of 1.8-2.2 µg/mL.  
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 13 of 52  Finally, chronic administration of Plerixafor has also been evaluated by continuous 
infusion for
 10 days in HIV patients in an open-label dose escalation study with doses ranging 
from 2.5 to 160 µg/kg/h [ 30]. In this study, a 10 day infusion was administered via infusion 
pump at 40mL/hour (daily solutions prepared by dilution of a 10 mg/mL solution of Plerixafor in 
0.9% saline). Note that the total dose infused in this study was much higher than those doses 
p
roposed here (i.e., the highest dose over 4 weeks for our protocol will be 11,200 mcg/kg 
c
ompared to 38,400 mcg/kg total for the highest cohort in the cited study).  The median 
ter
minal elimination half-life was 8.6 hours (range: 8.1-11.1 hours). Cardiac toxicities were 
obse
rved in the HIV+ patients dosed to achieve C max levels above 2 µg/mL.  
 
Plerixafor for Stem Cell Mobilization 
Plerixafor is a bicyclam small molecule that selectively and reversibly inhibits CXCR4.  
In preclinical and clinical studies it was found to lead to a rapid increase in circulating 
hematopoietic progenitor cells and mature lymphocytes. 
 In a phase I clinical trial conducted in healthy volunteers, a single dose of Plerixafor by 
S
C injection (160 or 240 μg/kg) given alone or added to a mobilization regimen of daily G-CSF 
(10 μg/kg) for four days was shown to be generally safe and well-tolerated, as compared to a 
mobilization regimen consisting of G-CSF alone [ 31]. The most frequently reported AEs were 
inj
ection site reactions, GI effects, paresthesias, and headaches. Plerixafor augmented CD34+ 
c
ell mobilization by G-CSF on average 3.8 fold. More recently, the safety of Plerixafor 
administered as a single agent by injection was further explored in healthy volunteers at doses up 
to 480 μg/kg [ 32]. No dose limiting toxicity was observed, and common adverse events were 
diar
rhea, injection site erythema, perioral numbness, sinus tachycardia, headache, nausea, 
abdominal distention and injection site pain.  
 
Similar to the experience in healthy volunteers, phase I evaluation of a single injection of 
Plerixafor (160 or 240 μg/kg) given to 13 cancer patients (MM, n=7; NHL, n=6) was well 
tol
erated and only grade 1 toxicities were observed [ 33]. A rapid and statistically significant 
increase in the total WBC and PB CD34+ counts at both 4 and 6 hours following a single 
injection were noticed. The absolute CD34+ cell count increased from a baseline of 2.6 +/- 0.7/ 
μ
L (mean +/- SE) to 15.6 +/- 3.9/ μL and 16.2 +/- 4.3/ μL at 4 hours (P=.002) and 6 hours after 
inj
ection (P =.003), respectively. The absolute CD34+ cell counts observed at 4 and 6 hours 
following Plerixafor were higher in the 240 μg/kg group (19.3 +/- 6.9/ μL and 20.4 +/- 7.6/ μL, 
re
spectively) compared with the 160 μg/kg group (11.3 +/- 2.7/ μL and 11.3 +/- 2.5/ μL, 
re
spectively).  
Plerixafor was then studied for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization coupled with G-CSF 
for
 autologous stem cell transplantation. In a phase II, open label, crossover study in 25 patients 
with NHL and MM, patients received 3 days of G-CSF run-in, and then underwent mobilization 
with one regimen of either: (A) up to 4 days of 10 μg/kg of G-CSF or (B) up to 4 days of 
10 μg/kg of G-CSF plus 160 μg/kg of Plerixafor [34].  Patients were apheresed one hour after the 
dose
 of G-CSF alone or 6 hours after the morning G-CSF plus Plerixafor dose for up to 4 days to 
a
chieve a target of 5 x 106 cells/kg. After a rest period, patients received 3 days of G-CSF run-in, 
followed by the opposite regimen (A after B or B after A) and were apheresed in the same 
manner. The purpose was to determine safety, apheresis yields, and transplantation success. 
After the initial 8 patients were dosed at 160 μg/kg, the protocol was amended to increase the G-
CSF run-in from 3 to 4 days, and the Plerixafor dose to 240 μg/kg. Later, the protocol was 
fur
ther amended such that the G-CSF alone regimen was always used first. There was no drug-

lization with Plerixafor plus G-CSF compared to G-CSF alone. Nine patients (8 NHL and 1

im
proved when mobilized with Plerixafor plus G-CSF, with all patients achieving 2  106 
CD34+ cells/kg (range: 2.78 to 13.6 CD34+ cells/kg). The median day of polymorphonuclear 
leukoc
yte (PMN) engraftment was Day 10 and Day 17 for platelets, when using cells collected 
by Plerixafor plus G-CSF.  Durability of engraftment has been measured up to one year. 
 
Two phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative 
trials examined the ability of Plerixafor (240 μg/kg) plus G-CSF (10 μg/kg) vs. placebo plus G-
CSF (10 μg/kg) to mobilize CD34+ stem cells for autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation in patients with NHL (protocol 3101) and MM (protocol 3102), respectively. 
Patients were excluded if they previously attempted stem cell mobilization or received a prior 
stem cell transplant. 
 In 3101, the addition of Plerixafor to a G-CSF regimen significantly increased the 
propo
rtion of patients with NHL who were able to mobilize minimum (2 x 106 cells/kg) and 
tar
get (5 x 106 cells/kg) numbers of CD34+ cells for autologous transplant and allowed both 
tar
gets to be reached in significantly fewer apheresis days [ 35]. In 3102, the addition of 
P
lerixafor to a G-CSF regimen, compared with G-CSF alone, significantly increased the 
propo
rtion of patients with MM who were able to mobilize the target (6 x 106 cells/kg) number 
of CD34+
 cells needed for autologous transplant and allowed this target to be reached in 
sig
nificantly fewer apheresis days [ 36]. In both trials, hematopoietic stem cells mobilized with 
P
lerixafor + G-CSF were equally capable of prompt and durable PMN and PLT engraftment, 
c
ompared to cells mobilized with G-CSF alone.   
In the controlled Phase III studies in patients with NHL and MM (3101 and 3102), a total 
of 301 patients were treated in the G-CSF plus Plerixafor 240 μg/kg SC group and 292 patients 
we
re treated in the G-CSF plus placebo group. The safety profile of Plerixafor was consistent 
with tha
t observed in previous mobilization studies and adverse events that occurred more 
frequently with Plerixafor than placebo were: insomnia, headache, dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, 
flatulence, abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distention, dry mouth, stomach discomfort, 
constipation, dyspepsia, hypoaesthesia oral, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, hyperhidrosis, 
erythema, injection site reactions, fatigue, and malaise [ 35, 36]. Overall, the AE data, combined 
with t
he laboratory and vital sign findings, indicate that Plerixafor 240 μg/kg, in conjunction 
with G-
CSF for the mobilization and collection of CD34+ cells, is well-tolerated in patients with 
NH
L or MM undergoing autologous stem cell transplant. No notable differences in the incidence 
of AEs were observed across treatment groups from chemotherapy/ablative treatment through 12 
months post-transplantation.  
Plerixafor has been studied in over 2000 human subjects in over 78 clinical trials which 
ha
ve encompassed healthy volunteers, HIV infected patients, multiple myeloma patients, 
lymphoma patients, and patients with a variety of other malignancies.  Mozobil® (Plerixafor 
injection) has been approved by the FDA in combination with G-CSF to mobilize hematopoietic 
stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in 
patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM) based on phase III 
studies. Several reports have recently indicated that Plerixafor can also be safely administered 
with G-CSF in the context of a chemotherapy-based mobilization regimen [ 37-41 ]. Finally, 
based on favorable pharmacokinetic observations in healthy volunteers, the impact of 
intravenous Plerixafor in stem cell mobilization for cancer patients is now under investigation. In 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 15 of 52 a phase I/II study, escalating doses of intravenous Plerixafor (up to 400 μg/kg) alone or added to 
G-CSF were administered to 25 patients with NHL (n=15) or HL (n=10). In the phase I portion 
of the
 study, one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 2 chest pain) was observed at 320 μg/kg and no 
grade 3/4 toxicities occurred at 400 μg/kg. 24 of 25 patients (96%) met the goal collection of ≥ 
2.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and 21 of 25 patients (84%) collected ≥ 5.0 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg in a 
median 1 day of pheresis, including 6 of 6 patients in the 400 µg/kg cohort.   
 
Impact on Graft Composition and Transplant Outcomes 
Although collectively referred to as CD34+ progenitor or stem cells, the full repertoire 
and relative abundance of each cell type collected during PBSC harvest is thought to be 
governed by selection of the mobilization regimen. The relative importance of blood graft 
composition on hematopoietic reconstitution following autologous transplant has been recently 
reviewed [ 42]. A number of small studies indicate that cells mobilized with Plerixafor are 
phenotypically distinct from those derived through other mobilization approaches. In macaque, 
for
 instance, gene and micro-RNA expression profiling of Plerixafor-mobilized CD34(+) cells 
include more B-, T-, and mast cell precursors, whereas G-CSF-mobilized cells have more 
neutrophil and mononuclear phagocyte precursors [ 43]. When evaluated in both healthy donors 
and lymphoma patients, Plerixafor alone mobilizes more precursors of the plasmacytoid 
de
ndritic cell (pDC) lineage, relative to mobilization with G-CSF + Plerixafor or G-CSF alone . 
Author
s hypothesize that stem cell products enriched in pDCs may lead to improved immunity in 
the recipient after transplant and reduced incidence of CMV. The impact of Plerixafor on DC 
g
raft composition was corroborated in MM and NHL patients mobilized according to the 
approved indication. In terms of DC subsets, grafts mobilized with P+G contained similar % o f 
myeloid (MDC, Lin-CD11c+HLA-DR+CD123-) and BDCA3+ DCs. The percentage of 
plasmacytoid DCs (PDC; CD123+BDCA2+HLADR+) was significantly increased in the P+G 
grafts (median, 0.87% vs. 0.30%; p=0.002), leading to a significantly higher PDC/MDC ratio in 
the P+G group, 2.08 vs. 1.01, p<0.0001). It was also found that there were significantly more 
CD8+ IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secreting T cells in the P+G group as compared to the G 
group (median, 12.3% vs. 5.3%, p=0.01; and 5.9% vs. 2.8%, p=0.02, respectively). Again, more 
pDC cells, as well as CD34+CD45RA-CD123hi cells of unknown function, were also noted 
when Plerixafor was given intravenously at high doses with G-CSF, relative to G-CSF alone. 
La
stly, the addition of Plerixafor to G-CSF not only potentiates CD34+ peripheral stem cell 
y
ields, but also significantly increases the proportion of more primitive CD34+ CD38- subsets 
re
lative to G-CSF alone mobilization [ 44-46], the latter speculated to potentially promote 
superior engraftment after high-dose chemotherapy [ 47]. 
The functional consequence of qualitative differences in graft composition emerging 
from inclusion of Plerixafor in stem cell mobilization is not known. Human progenitor cells 
mobi
lized with Plerixafor were shown to more robustly repopulate NOD/SCID recipient mice, 
re
lative to cells derived through G-CSF mobilization in the same donors [ 48]. In the clinic, a 
higher median of absolute lymphocyte counts harvested through addition of Plerixafor to G-CSF 
mobilization compared with a control group mobilized with G-CSF alone (4.16 x 109 
lymphocytes/kg vs. 0.288 x 109 lymphocytes/kg; P < 0.0001) correlated with better outcomes in 
progr
ession-free survival after autologous transplant in NHL patients [ 49]. With a median 
follow
-up of 20 months (range, 4-24 months), no relapses were reported in the AMD3100 
(Plerixafor) group compared with 15 of 29 in the control group (P < 0.02). Despite various 
studies pointing to Plerixafor impacting the graft composition, meaningful differences in

a
pparent in either the NHL [ 35] or MM [ 36]  phase III trials. In fact, absolute CD34+ cell dose 
transplanted, rather than qualitative differences that may have resulted from either mobilization 
approach, was associated with better long-term platelet recovery after ASCT in those trials [ 50].  
 
Leukemia Stromal Interactions 
Similar to normal hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts express many of the same 
adhesion molecules such as CXCR4, VLA-4, VLA-5, and CD44 which allow them to interact 
with the marrow stroma [ 51-53]. The interaction of leukemic blasts with the marrow 
mi
croenvironment is postulated to be important in mediating disease resistance, a process 
commonly referred to as cell-adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) [ 54] which 
e
ventually promotes relapse. CAM-DR can provide protection from cell cycle-dependent 
chemotherapy through induction of quiescence of tumor cells, as well as through exposure to 
SDF-1  which activates the prosurvival PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, preventing apoptosis in 
c
ancer cells. The role of the SDF-1α/CXCR4 axis in mediating CAM-DR in malignancies is 
currently under investigation and provides a rationale for evaluating the potential activity of 
Plerixafor in chemosensitization.    
 
Pre-Clinical Studies of Chemosensitization with Plerixafor 
In preclinical models of leukemia, targeting the microenvironment with CXCR4 
antagonists was sufficient to overcome resistance to cytarabine [ 55] and also provided 
re
sponsiveness to antibody-mediated cytotoxicity [ 56]. Similarly, the addition of Plerixafor in a 
mous
e model of APL was able to enhance the efficacy of cytarabine therapy compared with mice 
leukemic treated with cytarabine alone, which resulted in reduced tumor burden and improved 
survival [ 57]. The median overall survival for the untreated control, Plerixafor alone, cytarabine 
a
lone, and cytarabine + Plerixafor cohorts were 18, 19, 23 and 30 days, respectively (cytarabine 
vs cytarabine + Plerixafor cohorts: p < 0.0006). A survival advantage was also noted in two 
xenograft models of ALL exposed to a CXCR4 antagonist followed by chemotherapy 
(vincristine or nilotinib), compared to chemotherapy alone [ 58]. Plerixafor alone had no 
de
tectable anti-tumor effect in these experiments. 
In BCR-ABL(+) leukemia (CML), Plerixafor was able to inhibit tumor cell chemotaxis 
a
nd confer added sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors Imatinib and Nilotinib [ 59]. Using a 
func
tional mouse model of progressive and residual disease of CML, Plerixafor was also able to 
mobi
lize leukemic cells in vivo , such that when added to nilotinib, the leukemia burden in mice 
was significantly reduced below the baseline level suppression achieved by nilotinib alone [ 60]. 
Overall, these results support the notion that CXCR4 inhibition in conjunction with targeted 
tyrosine kinase therapy may overcome drug resistance in CML and potentially suppress or 
eradicate residual disease. 
Disrupting the interaction of tumor cells to bone marrow niches also confers added 
sensitivity to therapy in multiple myeloma (MM). In a xenograft model, bortezomib-treated mice 
showed reduction in tumor progression compared with control (P = .041), and the mice treated 
with the combination of Plerixafor and bortezomib showed significant tumor reduction compared 
with contr
ol (P = .001) and bortezomib alone (P = .021) [ 61]. Tumor involvement in different 
orga
ns was also evaluated in the treated groups. The Plerixafor alone group was similar to that of 
the c
ontrol group in the BM, liver and spleen, indicating that mobilization of MM cells by 
Plerixafor does not lead to engraftment of MM cells into extramedullary sites. However, there 

    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 17 of 52 was a significant decrease of tumor cells present in BM, liver and spleen in the bortezomib-
treated group, and a significant decrease was further obtained in the group treated with the 
combination of Plerixafor and bortezomib [ 61]. 
C
ollectively these data suggest a pivotal role for the CXCR4/SDF-1 axis in sustaining 
viability of hematologic malignancies through interaction with the marrow microenvironment 
and provide a basis for evaluating Plerixafor as sensitization agent in the clinic.  
 
Clinical Experience with Plerixafor for Sensitization to Leukemia Treatment 
Elevated levels of CXCR4 expression on leukemic cells are associated with worse 
outcomes including shorter overall survival in AML [ 62-64]. Plerixafor has been shown to 
mobi
lize leukemic cells in humans [ 65] and was first reported to be used for sensitization in 
c
ombination with reinduction chemotherapy in an AML patient who had relapsed from prior 
allogeneic transplant [ 66].  
 
Formal clinical trial evaluation of Plerixafor given prior to salvage chemotherapy in 
re
lapsed or refractory AML patients has been evaluated in a phase I/II study [ 67].  A test dose of 
P
lerixafor was administered SC followed by a 24 hour observation period to analyze its effects 
on AM
L blasts in the absence of chemotherapy. Plerixafor was then given 4 hours prior to MEC 
c
hemotherapy (mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2/d, etoposide 100 mg/m2/d and cytarabine 1,000 mg/m2/d) 
daily for 5 days.  
Forty patients have been enrolled in the study with median age of 49 yrs (range 19-71). 
Baseline characteristics include 6 patients (15%) with secondary AML, 4 (10%) with prior 
transplant, 24 (60%) with intermediate and 10 (25%) with poor risk cytogenetics. Thirty-six 
pa
tients (90%) received Plerixafor + MEC as their 1st salvage regimen for relapsed disease with 
21 (5
3%) having a CR1 duration of < 12 months and 9 patients (6%) for primary refractory 
disease. The remaining four patients (10%) received the regimen as their 2nd salvage regimen. 
Three dose levels of Plerixafor: 80 , 160 and 240 µg/kg were tested in the phase I dose 
escalation. In the phase II, a total of 34 patients have been treated at the 240 µg/kg dose level. 
Common grade 3 adverse events consisted primarily of cytopenias and infections. No evidence 
of hyperleukocytosis or significant delays in neutrophil recovery (ANC >500/mm3, median 27d, 
range 21-37) or platelet recovery (plt >50k/mm3, median 26d, range 20-40d) were observed. Of 
the 32 patients evaluable for response at the 240 µg/kg dose level, a complete remission 
(CR+CRi) has been achieved in 50% of patients (CR=13, CRi=3) which compares favorably to 
historical CR rates of 25-35%. Treatment failure was due to persistent disease in 14 patients 
(44%) and early death due to complications from infection in 2 patients (6%). One year KM 
estimate of overall survival is currently 56%.  
Correlative studies demonstrated that Plerixafor mobilizes AML blasts (mean 2.5-fold 
incr
ease, range 0.9-7.3 fold) into the peripheral circulation peaking at 6-8 hours after 
administration. FISH performed in patients with informative cytogenetic abnormalities indicates 
that mobilization occurs equally in both non-leukemic and leukemic populations. Higher baseline 
surf
ace CXCR4 expression correlated with increased mobilization of AML blasts (Pearson's 
r=0.53, p=0.023) into the PB at 6 hrs post-Plerixafor. It was concluded that Plerixafor can be 
safely administered in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with AML [ 67].  
A phase I study is also being conducted to determine the MTD and safety of Plerixafor 
when combined with cytarabine and daunorubicin  (7+3 regimen) for newly diagnosed adult 
AML [ 68]. Plerixafor was given as a 30-min IV infusion, 4–5 hours before daunorubicin 
be
ginning on day 2 and repeated every day until day 7. Dose levels were from 240, 320, and 400 

    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 18 of 52 to 480 µg/kg. Three to 12 evaluable patients were enrolled in each cohort in a modified 3+3 
design. Twenty-three patients (median age 57 years) have been enrolled in 4 cohorts. Plerixafor 
infusion on day 2 caused a rise in PB AML blasts (mean 3.01-fold increase) peaking at 2–4 hours 
a
fter administration. On day 7, there was a mean 1.51-fold increase in PB AML blasts but far 
fewer total cells were detected.  
Eighteen (86%) patients experienced adverse events (AEs) that were reported as at least 
possibly related to Plerixafor. The majority was grade 1/2 in severity and mainly included 
gastrointestinal disorders. Four (19%) patients experienced Grade 3 Plerixafor-related AEs 
including febrile neutropenia (n=3), neutropenia (n=1), nausea (n=1), infections (n=2) and 
decreased appetite (n=1) commonly observed with 7+3 regimen. One (5%) patient (480 µg/kg 
cohort) experienced Grade 4 related AEs of thrombocytopenia and asymptomatic pulmonary 
embolism (while receiving medroxyprogesterone); the latter was the only possibly-related SAE 
reported. The median time to neutrophil (  0.5 x 109/L ) and platelet ( 100 x 109/L) recovery for 
responders was 19.5 (range 13–35) and 21 (range 17–37) days, respectively. There were 4 (17%) 
Plerixafor unrelated deaths (240 µg/kg): 1 within 30 days post induction due to an AE of acute 
respiratory distress syndrome and 3 due to disease progression > 3 months post induction. No 
DLTs have been reported.  
Of 21 patients with available data, 14 (67%) had complete response (CR), 2 had CR with 
incomplete count recovery (CRi), 2 had residual leukemia (RL), 2 had treatment failure (TF) due 
to resistant disease and 1 was not evaluable (NE) due to early death. Sixteen of 21 patients, 
majority of who had intermediate or poor risk cytogenetics, achieved a CR or CRi, with 
responses observed across all Plerixafor doses. Twice daily Plerixafor dosing and addition of G-
CSF to augment mobilization are being currently explored. 
Plerixafor is also being investigated as sensitization agent to conditioning chemotherapy 
in AML and MDS patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation [ 53]. In this Phase I/II study, 
G
-CSF is administered at a standard dose beginning on day -9 daily for 6 days, and Plerixafor 
from day -7 at one of the 4 dose levels 0 (control), 80, 160, or 240 µg/kg, 8 hours prior of each 
four daily doses of a standard preparative regimen consisting of 40 mg/m2 Fludarabine and 
130mg
/m2 IV Busulfan, days -6 through -3.  
To date, twenty seven patients have been enrolled in the study to date with a median age 
of 48 years (range 25-65).  Baseline characteristics include 13 patients (48%) with de novo 
AM
L, 6 (22%) with secondary AML, 5 with MDS and 3 with CML. Among the 24 AML/MDS 
patients, 14 (58%) had intermediate and 10 (42%) poor risk cytogenetics. Twelve patients (50%) 
had primary refractory AML, 5 were in 1st or 2nd relapse, 2 were untreated, and 3 were in CR1 
and 2 in CR2. The source of stem cells was sibling donor in 16 and unrelated donor in 11. After 
phase I Plerixafor dose escalation in 16 patients, 11 patients received 240 µg/kg in Phase II. 
Common grade ≥ 3 adverse events which consisted primarily of neutropenic fever, infections, or 
rash were seen in 24/27 (89%) patients. There were no toxicities ascribed to the G-
CSF/Plerixafor component of the regimen.  No evidence of significant delays in neutrophil 
(A
NC >500/mm3, median 12.5d, range 10-19) or platelet recovery (plt >20k/mm3, median 12d, 
range 9-74d) were observed.  Grade I-II GVHD was seen in 10/27 patients (37%), with no 
oc
currences of Grade III-IV GVHD. Of the 19 patients with active disease at study entry, 18 
achieved a CR. Treatment failure was due to persistent disease in 1 pt (4%), relapsed disease in 
10 patients (37%) and early death due to complications from intracranial hemorrhage in 1 patient 
(4%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all patients was 26.6 wks (95%CI: 18.1-33.9 

    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 19 of 52 wks) and 15.7 wks (95% CI: 12.1-26.6 wks) in relapsed patients. Median follow-up for all study 
patients was 19.14 wks (range: 0.7-54.6 wks).  
Correlative studies analyzed from 16 patients enrolled in the Phase I portion of the trial 
demonstrate that G-CSF/Plerixafor mobilizes CD34+ cells, with the mean fold increase of 5.9-
fold a
t 80 µg/kg Plerixafor; at 160 µg/kg, 13-fold; and at 240 µg/kg, 14.2-fold. Over time, the 
relative increase of FISH+ cells was significantly higher than that of FISH- cells, indicating 
pre
ferential mobilization of cytogenetically abnormal leukemic over normal  cells (p=0.005). 
The
 objective of the ongoing Phase II study is to determine if the combination of G-
CSF/Plerixafor with busulfan/fludarabine improves PFS compared to historical controls 
re
ceiving busulfan/fludarabine alone.  
Another study is aiming to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Plerixafor in 
c
ombination with bortezomib in patients who have active relapse/refractory MM [ 69]. Patients 
with active disease received Plerixafor at the recommended dose SC on days 1-6 of every cycle. 
P
lanned dose levels include 160, 240, 320, 400, and 480 µg/kg. Bortezomib was given at the 
recommended dose twice a week on days 3, 6, 10, and 13 every 21 days. Dose levels include 1.0 
and 1.3 mg/m2, 60-90 minutes after Plerixafor. Patients who had response or stable disease went 
on to re
ceive a total of 8 cycles without planned maintenance therapy. The median number of 
cycles on therapy was 3 (1–11). Dose limiting toxicities including insomnia, restlessness, and 
psychosis were observed in two patients at dose level 6 (Plerixafor 400 µg/kg and bortezomib 
1.3 mg
/m2). To further explore the safety of maximum tolerated dose, three additional patients 
were enrolled at dose level 5b (Plerixafor 320 µg/kg and bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2). O verall, the 
combination proved to be well tolerated. There were no grade 4 toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities 
included lymphopenia (40%), hypophosphatemia (20%), anemia (10%), hyponatremia (10%), 
hypercalcemia (10%), and bone fracture due to myeloma bone disease (10%). One patient came 
off treatment due to grade 2 painful neuropathy at cycle 5. Twenty-three patients were evaluable 
for response, including 1 (4%) complete response (CR), 1 (4%) very good partial response 
(VGPR) and 3 (13%) MR, with an overall response rate (including MR) of 5 (22%) in this 
relapsed and refractory population. In addition, 15 (65%) patients achieved stable disease (SD), 
with just 3 (13%) having progressive disease (PD) as their best response. The combination of 
Plerixafor and bortezomib is generally well tolerated with minimal neuropathy or other toxicities 
seen to date. The responses observed are encouraging in this relapsed and refractory population. 
Plerixafor was able promote transient de-adhesion of MM cells and accessory cells in viv o in 
most
 of the patients, indicating that chemosensitization can potentially be achieved in patients 
with MM using this approach. 
The toxicities and pharmacokinetics of the combination of Plerixafor and rituximab in 
pre
viously-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are being investigated in a 
phase I dose escalation study (Andritsos et al. 2010). Rituximab was administered three times a 
week as a 100 mg dose on day 1, followed by 375 mg/m2 IV for 12 total doses.  Plerixafor was 
a
dministered beginning with the 4th dose of Rituximab, 4 hours prior to the rituximab, in 4 
c
ohorts of patients receiving various doses: (1) 80 µg/kg, (2) 160 µg/kg, (3) 240 µg/kg, and (4) 
320 µg/kg.  Preliminary results from the study demonstrated that CLL cells were mobilized to 
the pe
ripheral blood in a dose-dependent fashion by Plerixafor. The combination of Plerixafor + 
ritux
imab in CLL patients with WBC < 50×109/L was well tolerated, and no dose limiting 
toxicities were reported. The most common adverse events that were reported were nausea, 
fatigue, chills, and diarrhea. CLL cells were mobilized following Plerixafor, and partial 
remissions were seen in a proportion of patients. In some cases, maximum responses were seen

ong
oing clinical trial.   
 
Plerixafor in Gliomas  
The presence and activity of the CXCR4 was also found to be critical for the growth of 
both malignant neuronal and glial tumors. In an intracranial xenograft of U87 glioma, 
antagonism of CXCR4 alone resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and increased apoptosis, 
compared to saline [ 70]. The anti-tumor effect of AMD3100 on glioma cells was associated with 
the dr
ug’s ability to attenuate the AKT and MAPK pathways downstream of CXCR4 signaling. 
In another orthotopic model of glioblastoma multiforme, inhibition of CXCR4 was found to 
s
ynergize with BCNU by inducing tumor regression in vivo , as a result of both increased 
apoptosis and decreased proliferation, and despite subtherapeutic doses of chemotherapy [ 71].  
I
n addition to directly conferring tumor cell responsiveness to therapy, a new mechanism 
of action for Plerixafor in tumor abrogation has recently emerged. A common pathway for tumor 
invasion or me
tastasis, as well as disease recurrence, is the appearance of new blood vessels 
forming as a consequence of hypoxic conditions in the tumor microenvironment.  
Revascularization at sites of hypoxia results from the recruitment and stimulation of 
CXCR4-positive bone marrow-derived progenitor cells through local upregulation of SDF1-α, 
which is in turn under positive regulation by HIF-1α [ 11, 72]. Of relevance, the process of 
va
sculogenesis initiated after radiation therapy in an intracranial xenograft model of 
glioblastoma was recently shown to be a potential mechanism for disease recurrence [ 10]. In this 
model, P
lerixafor was given chronically over a period that slightly overlapped with and extended 
bey
ond radiotherapy until hypoxia-induced SDF-1α levels resolved to baseline. In treated 
animals, disease recurrence was prevented, likely due to the mitigating effect of Plerixafor on the 
influx
 of bone marrow-derived cells to the brain. Effective abrogation of revascularization 
through CXCR4 antagonism was also recently demonstrated in xenograft models of lung and 
breast, overcoming both the concomitant stimulation of angiogenesis by paclitaxel and G-CSF 
[73]. Taken together, these observations suggest a potential role for Plerixafor in directly 
se
nsitizing gliomas, and perhaps other solid cancers, to therapy or promote tumor cell apoptosis 
through deprivation of essential new vasculature.   
 
Dose Selection in Combination with Chemotherapy 
In preclinical animal toxicology studies, DLTs were primarily adverse neurologic events, 
including severe dyspnea, tremors, ventral recumbency, which, at higher dosages, progressed to 
convulsions.  The MTD for these effects was approximately 70 mg/m2, which correlates with a 
dose of approximately 1800 μg/kg in humans. Early evidence of adverse neurologic effects, 
including
 diarrhea, muscle twitches, tremor, and tachycardia, were seen at doses of 17.5 to 35 
mg/m2. This is thought to scale to an approximate human equivalent dose of 470 to 940 μg/kg. 
The effects tended to resolve within hours of the dose and appeared to be related to Cmax. 
Plerixafor has been given at doses of up to 480 μg/kg SC and IV in healthy volunteers 
a
nd in cancer patients. A maximum tolerated dose has not been established. Higher doses of 
Plerixafor injection were evaluated in healthy volunteers in three cohorts of six subjects who 
e
ach received two different doses of Plerixafor separated by at least 2 weeks to allow for 
a
dequate pharmacodynamic wash-out [ 32]. The dosing cohorts evaluated were: 240 and 320 
µ
g/kg (cohort 1); 320 and 400 µg/kg; (cohort 2); and 400 and 480 µg/kg (cohort 3). Plerixafor 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 21 of 52 was considered reasonably safe with no dose-limiting toxicity and common adverse events that 
consisted of diarrhea, injection site erythema, perioral numbness, sinus tachycardia, headache, 
nausea, abdominal distention and injection site pain. No dose limiting toxicities occurred. Sinus 
tachycardia (all Grade 1) was observed in most subjects treated with 400 and 480 μg/kg doses of 
P
lerixafor, which were usually associated with activity and resolved quickly following rest. 
Since these events occurred soon after Plerixafor administration, they may be related to the 400 
a
nd 480 μg/kg doses of Plerixafor [ 32], which are higher than the 240 μg/kg dose used in the 
major
ity of other mobilization trials.   
Intravenous administration of Plerixafor has been evaluated in cancer patients to minimize 
discomfor
t, optimize normal and leukemia stem cell mobilization, and ease logistical problems in 
the timing of administration. The timing and magnitude of the peak leukemia cell mobilization in 
re
lation to the time of administration of the chemotherapeutic agents may be critical in the 
success of leukemia control.  Giving the Plerixafor IV may reduce the variability of the PK 
pa
rameters and the range of peak leukemia cell mobilization, thus allowing better timing of 
chemotherapy administration.

5. INVESTIGATIONAL AGENT/DEVICE/PROCEDURE INFORMATION 
5.1  Investigational Agent/Device/Procedure   
The
 drug Plerixafor (AMD3100) will be supplied in infusion ready vials containing 10 ml of 20 
mg/ml solution (which is stable for several months at room temperature) by Sanofi.  There are no 
known incompatibilities of the agent with commonly used intravenous solutions.  There is no 
need to administer the agent with food and there are no pre-medications necessary. There are no 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 26 of 52 restrictions against any medications and pre-medications may be used on an as needed basis. 
 
The four possible dose levels are: 
 200 µ g/kg per day for 2 weeks 
 200 µ g/kg per day for 4 weeks 
 400 µ g/kg per day for 4 weeks 
 100 µg/kg per day for 4 weeks 
 
The starting dose in the Phase I is 200 µg/kg per day for 4 weeks 
 
Dose will be based on weight at screening and will not be modified. Actual body weight will be 
used to calculate dose except in patients who are overweight. The dose of Plerixafor will be 
adjusted for patients who weigh > 30% over their Ideal body weight. IBW is calculated as follows: 
 
Males : IBW (kg) = 50.0 + [(2.3)(Height in inches – 60 inches)] 
=
 50.0 + [(2.3)(Height in cm)(0.39370079) - 60)] 
 
F
emales: IBW (kg) = 45.5 + [(2.3)(Height in inches – 60 inches)] 
= 45.5 +
 [(2.3)(Height in cm)(0.39370079) – 60)] 
 
 
The
 ABW is calculated as follows: 
ABW (kg) = IBW + 0.4(actual weight - IBW) 
 
Plerixafor will be prepared weekly by the investigational pharmacy, with each dose being 
prepared no more than 4 hours prior to its use.  Per Stanford Investigational Pharmacy policy, the 
pharmacy will prepare sterile products in an environment that complies with USP 797 
parameters . The IV admixture area is kept clean and orderly and a demarcation line identifies 
the separation of the anteroom from the buffer area. Corrugated boxes are not allowed in the 
anteroom. A clean cart/dirty cart system is used to transfer inventory and compounding  
supplies into and out of the cleanroom 
 
In
fusion bags will be changed every week while the patient is coming for follow up.  Plerixafor 
will
 be infused using a 0.2 micron in-line filter that will be changed with each new dose for all 
administrations.  The volume prepared by the investigational pharmacy will be determined to 
a
llow a fixed infusion rate of 1.5 mL/hour.   
 
As per previously published technique, Plerixafor will be suspended in normal saline to the final  
solution [30].  The minimum rate will need to be 0.5 mL/hour to keep the picc line patent 
howe
ver the rate of infusion will be modified accordingly per the volume used in the dilutent

location accessible only by authorized personnel. All drug supplies are to be used only for this 
protocol and not for any other purpose. 
 
5.3 Agent Ordering 
 
P
lerixafor will be ordered using the Investigator Sponsored Trial (IST) portal at 
http://www.saists.com .   
 
5.4 Agent Accountability  
All 
Plerixafor sent to the site will be accounted for. In addition, the volume of Plerixafor dispensed 
for
 each patient will be recorded on an Investigational Product Accountability Log and the volume 
administered documented on the case report form (CRF). An accurate record of the date and 
amount of Plerixafor dispensed to each patient will be available for inspection at any time. Partially 
used vials may be destroyed per institutional guidelines and documented. All unopened and unused 
vials of Plerixafor will be destroyed upon completion of the study protocol or if drug expires unless 
otherwise directed by the Sponsor. The study site will document all receipt, complete destruction, 
and return (if applicable) of Plerixafor. 
 
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS 
The
re will be no dose modifications or delays for an individual patient’s dose  except in the 
c
ircumstance of moderate to severe renal impairment.  If a patient has a Creatinine clearance less 
than or equal to 50 mL/min, the dose of Plerixafor will be reduced by one -third.   
 
6.1 Dose
 Limiting Toxicities 
DLT is defined as any  hematologic or non -he matologic  AE grade ≥3 with a suspected causal 
re
lationship to Plerixafor (including including ECG changes indicative of ischemia, ventricular 
tachycardia) . 
 P atients  will be monitored for DLTs for 5 weeks from the start of the Plerixafor infusion.  
 D LT’s in the first cohort may occur before or after 14 days. If a DLT occurs in weeks 3 
or 4 of treatment , we will treat next patient with a dose of 200 µg/kg/d x 2 weeks .  If a 
DLT occurs from the start of treatment through the second week of treatment , we will 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 28 of 52 treat next patients at a dose of 100 µg/kg/d x 4 weeks .If a patient experiences a DLT, the 
infusion will be discontinued. The next patient treated at the lower dose le vel as dictated 
by the mTPI table.   If an early dose limiting toxicity occurs at  lowest  dose level (200 
µ
g/kg/d x 2 wk or 100µg/kg x 4wks ) then the protocol wi ll be stopped at that point.    
 
6.2 In
fusion Reactions 
For the start of the Plerixafor infusion, all patients will be closely monitored on site for at least 6 
hours. All patients will be evaluated weekly by a physician for the duration of the infusion. 
 
All patients will be provided the contact information for the 24 hour on call pharmacist and 
neurology physician. 
 
For Grade 1 and 2 allergic reactions to Plerixafor infusion:  oral steroids or antihistamine.  Patients 
may be discontinued at investigator’s discretion  
For Grade 3 and higher allergic reactions: Standard allergy treatment could include intravenous 
solumedrol, intravenous Benadryl, and possibly epinephrine at the discretion of the treating 
physician. Plerixafor infusion will be discontinued. 
 
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
7.1 Potential Adverse Events 
Safety will be assessed by monitoring clinical and laboratory evaluations and AEs. 
 
Definitions 
 
Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the investigational 
product (active or placebo drug, biologic, or device) in a clinical investigation patient, which does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product. An AE can, therefore, 
be any unfavorable and unintended symptom, sign, disease or condition, or test abnormality 
whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
 
AE
s may include, but are not limited to: 
Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the patient and/or observed by the 
investigator or medical staff 
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities  
A significant worsening of the patient’s condition from study entry 
Disease signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities existing prior to the use of the 
study treatment that resolve but then recur after treatment 
Disease signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities existing prior to the use of the 
study treatment which increase in frequency, intensity, or a change in quality after 
treatment 
 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 29 of 52 Since prior studies using this medication have included premature ventricular contractions 
(PVCs), there will be a temporary interruption of plerixafor treatment for abnormalities in 
serum magnesium, calcium, or potassium at a Grade 2 or more severe.  The study 
medication may be resumed following correction of these electrolyte abnormalities as 
confirmed by repeat serum level testing.  Supplementation to include magnesium sulfate, 
calcium carbonate, or potassium chloride may be used as clinically indicated.   
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A SAE is any adverse event that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 De ath 
 A life -threatening experience 
 R equires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs existing hospitalization 
 A pe rsistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A c ongenital anomaly/birth defect 
 I mportant medical events that may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above 
 
Hospitalizations that occur under the following circumstances are not considered to be SAEs: 
 we re planned before entry into the clinical study; 
 a re for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its   treatment; 
 oc cur on an emergency or outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless  fulfilling 
the criteria above), are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied indication 
and not associated with any deterioration in condition. 
 
Severity 
The investigator will grade AEs using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (version 4.03, May 2009). Grades refer to the 
se
verity of the AE. The CTCAE v 4.03 displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical 
de
scriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: 
 
Grade  Description  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL)  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening hospitalization 
or prolongation of existing hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care 
ADL  
4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
 
Action taken 
The investigator should record what action, if any, was taken to the planned administration 
of the investigational product due to the AE (i.e., discontinuation, modification, or interruption of 
the treatment).  
 
    Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015   
 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 30 of 52 Relationship to the investigational product 
When recording and reporting an AE or SAE, the investigator will provide an assessment 
of the relationship between the AE or SAE and the study drug(s) and/or study procedure.  
Related AEs or SAEs are those that are judged to be possibly or definitely related by the 
investigator.  Unrelated AEs or SAEs are those that are judged to be unlikely or not related to the 
study drug(s) by the investigator.  Definitions of relationship criteria are as follows: 
 
Related 
Definitely related: There is strong evidence that there is a causal relationship between exposur e 
and AE 
 
Possibly related: There is some evidence supporting the possibility of a causal relationship 
between exposure and AE   
 
Unrelated  
Remote/Unlikely related: There is no evidence of a causal relationship between exposure and 
AE; however, such a relationship cannot be ruled out 
 
Unrelated: There is no suspicion of a causal relationship between exposure and AE 
 
 
Describe all known or potential risks associated with this Investigational 
Drug/Device/Procedure.  Include Adverse Event description, grade, expectedness, and attribution 
to the study treatment. 
 
The most common adverse reactions (>=  10%) reported in patients who received 
Moz
obil in conjunction with G-CSF regardless of causality and more frequent with Mozobil than 
placebo during hematopoietic stem cell mobilization and apheresis were diarrhea, nausea, 
fatigue, injections site reactions, headache, arthralgia, dizziness and vomiting.  Per label (USPI) 
serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic-type reactions, some of which have 
been life-threatening with clinically significant hypotension and shock, have occurred in patients 
receiving Plerixafor.  In randomized studies, 34% of patients with non-Hodgkins’s lymphoma 
and multiple myeloma had mild to moderate injection site reactions at the site of subcutaneous 
administration of Plerixafor. These included erythema, hematoma, hemorrhage, induration, 
inflammation, irritation, pain, paresthesia, pruritus, rash, swelling, and urticaria.  Mild to 
moderate systemic reactions were observed in less than 1% of patients approximately 30 min 
after Plerixafor administration. Events included one or more of the following: urticaria (n = 2), 
pe
riorbital swelling (n = 2), dyspnea (n = 1) or hypoxia (n = 1). Symptoms generally responded 
to treatments (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids, hydration or supplemental oxygen) or 
resolved spontaneously.  Vasovagal reactions, orthostatic hypotension, and/or syncope can occur 
following subcutaneous injections. In Plerixafor oncology and healthy volunteer clinical studies, 
less than 1% of subjects experienced vasovagal reactions following subcutaneous administration 
of Plerixafor doses ≤ 240 mg/kg. The majority of these events occurred within 1 hour of 
P
lerixafor administration. Other adverse reactions that occurred in < 5% of patients but were

constipation, dyspepsia, and musculoskeletal pain.  
In the study that assessed continuous infusion of Plerixafor over 10 days, four SA E’ s 
were noted: thrombocytopenia, infection of a PICC line and arrhythmia (> 25 PVC’s/min) and 
panic attack associated with paresthesias [18]. 
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting 
Adve
rse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.03.  This is an off-label indication for 
pler
ixafor. Investigators will reference safety information to assess expectedness: IB. All adverse 
events except those clearly attributable to the underlying disease will be reported, including 
definitely, probably and possibly related. Both Serious and Non-Serious Adverse Events will be 
clearly noted in source documentation and listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  
The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will assess each Adverse Event (AE) to determine 
whether it is unexpected according to the Informed Consent, Protocol Document, or 
Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will 
be tracked until resolution, or until 30 after the last dose of the study treatment.  
 
SAEs CTCAE Grade 3 and above, and all subsequent follow-up reports will be reported to the 
Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by the 
DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the 
IRB using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for 
deaths or life-threatening experiences. 
 
In addition, within 24 hours (US) or one business day (EU) of first knowledge of such serious 
and related adverse event, we will notify Sanofi via fax, attention Sanofi Pharmacovigilance 
(PV)
,  (US) or  or  via email at: 
Additionally, the Investigator will transmit to Sanofi PV an information copy of 
any such report sent to the governing regulatory authority, prior to or at the time of authority 
filing. The Investigator will make available to Sanofi promptly such records as may be necessary 
and pertine
nt to investigate any such expedited adverse event, if specifically requested by Sanofi. 
 
Furthermore, the Investigator will inform Sanofi of the following: 
 An y events that result in protocol amendments for safety reasons, as well as any safety 
re
lated regulatory action such as a clinical hold of the Research; 
 An y pregnancies occurring in patients who are exposed to the Product in connection with 
the Research. Please see section 10.2.1.3 for additional reporting guidance; 
 In addition, the Investigator will notify Sanofi within 24 hours (US) or one business day 
(EU) of first knowledge of any Product complaints (communication of dissatisfaction that 
alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, effectiveness, safety, 
labeling, purity, stability, and appearance) by fax to  (US)  or Sanofi 
Customer Services Europe,   
 The  Investigator will also inform Sanofi within 1 business day of becoming aware of any 
actions from any authority that may affect the performance of the Research

 CONFIDENTIAL    Page 32 of 52 Safety reporting rules are to be complied with, according to current PV specifications (QGSD-
007589).  Sponsor is to provide Sanofi with: results relevant to final diagnosis of any SAE; 
routine
 transmission of any overdose with plerixafor; periodic reports; study report must contain 
section with safety review and conclusion –to be reviewed by Sanofi before finalization. 
 
 
P
regnancy reporting  
All patients must agree to an effective method of contraception while on study treatment 
and for at least 3 months following Plerixafor treatment (including both female patients of child-
be
aring potential and male patients with partners of child-bearing potential). Effective birth 
control includes: a) birth control pills, depot progesterone, or an intrauterine device plus one 
barrier method, or b) two barrier methods. Effective barrier methods are: male and female 
condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides (creams or gels that contain a chemical to kill sperm). 
For patients using a hormonal contraceptive method, information about any interaction of 
Plerixafor with hormonal contraceptives is not known.  
The
 Investigator will inform Sanofi PV within 24 hours of the Investigator’s first 
knowledge of pregnancy in a female patient or the female partner of a male patient at any time 
after the first dose of Plerixafor.  Pregnant female patient(s) must not receive additional study 
tre
atment.  The pregnancy will be followed until the outcome is known (i.e., delivery, elective 
termination, spontaneous abortion).  The Investigator will obtain follow-up information no later 
than two months after the gestational period to obtain maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcome and 
any other relevant information.  If the pregnancy results in the birth of a child, additional follow-
up information may be requested.  The Investigator must complete as much information as 
possible on the relevant Pregnancy Notification Forms (PNF) A and B, and fax the forms to the 
Genzyme PV.

10.2.5 Response Review 
The
 Investigators delegated to do so, will evaluate the MRIs for response  
 
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol 
The
 protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the 
study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the Stanford 
IRB and Stanford Cancer Institute Scientific Review Committee (SRC).  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB prior to 
implementation.  The Protocol Director will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all 
participating investigators. 
 
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The
 Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the 
monitoring entity for this study. The DSMC will audit study-related activities to determine whether 
the study has been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, 
FDA regulations, and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the following types 
of do
cuments participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, 
and source documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and 
protocol deviations associated with the research to ensure the protection of human subjects.  Results 
of the DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the 
time of continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed. 
 
11.3 Data Management Plan 
The
 Protocol Director, or his designee, will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate participant 
case histories with observations and data pertinent to the study.  Study specific Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) will document treatment outcomes for data analysis.   Case report forms will be developed 
using the OnCore database system and will be maintained by  
 CRFs will be kept in a locked office, only accessible to the research team. 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 in t
he department of Biostatistics, Health Research and Policy will serve as the 
primary statistician.   

Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015        CONFIDENTIAL
   Page 39 of 52  
12.1 Statistical Design 
This 
is a dose-escalation study with three planned dose levels using the modified toxicity probability 
interval (mTPI).  The mTPI method is a competitor to the usual 3+3 dose escalation scheme and to the 
Continuous Reevaluation Method (CRM), mTPI has the advantage of having been peer-reviewed in 
both the statistical literature and in the oncology literature [74].  The design has the further advantage 
of 
allowing the investigators to conduct the study without constant reference to a biostatistician (as 
required by the CRM approach). It also allows for planned de-escalation as in this protocol 
 
Planned dose levels are 200 µg/kg/d x 2 wks (continuous infusion), 100 µg/kg/d x 4 wks, 200 
µ
g/kg/d x 4 wks, and 400µg/kg/d x 4 wks. The starting total dose will be the middle dose 200 
µg/kg/d x 4 wks.  
If a DLT occurs from Day 15-28, we will treat next patient with a dose of 200 µg/kg/d x 14 days. If a 
DLT occurs from day 0-14, we will treat next patients at a dose of 100 µg/kg/d x 28 days. If a patient 
experiences a DLT, the infusion will be discontinued. The next patient treated at the lower dose level 
as dictated by the mTPI table.  If an early dose limiting toxicity occurs at  lowest dose level ,200 
µ
g/kg/d x 2 wk or 100µg/kg x 4wks, then the protocol will be stopped at that point.    
 
The
 design is based on a Bayesian calculation of the posterior probability of toxicity at each dose.  The 
following settings have been used: 
* The target toxicity level.  In this study we use the same level of 30% as in [74], which also corresponds 
infor
mally to the target toxicity of the 3+3 design.  
* The precision for that target toxicity (here plus or minus 5 percentage points). 
* The maximum sample size across all dose (here 9). 
* Planned dose levels 200 µg/kg/d x 2 wks (continuous infusion), 100 µg/kg/d x 4 wks, 200 µg/kg/d x 
4 wks and 400µg/kg/d x 4 wks. The starting total dose will be the middle dose 200 µg/kg/d x 4 wks. 
 
The prior is a beta with parameters 1 and 1 (roughly equivalent to two observations, one of these a 
DLT).  Briefly, with the above settings, when the posterior probability falls below 0.25 (0.30-0.05), 
escalation to the next higher dose level is indicated; when the posterior probability falls above 0.35 
(0.30+0.05), de-escalation is recommended; otherwise the next patient is to be treated at the same dose 
level.  The rules for escalation and de-escalation for this design are contained in Table 12.1; they do 
not 
need to be modified during the course of the study.  At the end of the study the toxicity data at all 
doses is combined using the “pool adjacent violators” algorithm to make toxicity probabilities non-
decreasing; the maximum tolerated dose is calculated as the dose level that comes closest to the target 
toxicity level. 
 
Table 12.1 show the action to be taken as each patient becomes evaluable for toxicity. It is used for all 
dose
 levels as follows:   
 E means that the next patient is to be treated at the next higher dose.  If the current dose is the 
highest planned 400 µg/kg/d x 28 d, the next patient is to be treated at the same  dose level. 
 S  means that the next patient is to be treated at the same dose level. Note that a minimum of 3 
subjects must be studied at a dose before escalation is indicated.  
 D means that the next patient is to be treated at the next lower dose.  If the current dose is the 
Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015        CONFIDENTIAL
   Page 40 of 52 lowest planned 200 µg/kg/d x 14 d, the next patient is to be treated at the s ame dose level. 
 U means that the current dose level is too toxic.  No further patients are to be treated at this or 
at any higher dose level.  If the current dose level is the lowest planned (200 µg/kg/d x 2 wks 
total dose) no further patients will be treated. If the current dose level is not the lowest planned, 
the next patient should be studied at the next lowest dose ( 10 0 µg/kg/d x 4 wks) . 
 
These definitions are in accord with our reading of the code used to produce the simulations which 
validated the mTPI design. 
 
Toxicity will be monitored in the expansion phase at each increment of 5 patients.  If DLT is 
observed in one out of the first 5 patients, or 2 of the first 10, or 2 of the first 15, toxicity will be 
reviewed to assess whether the trial should continue.  This stopping rule has a 5% chance of being 
trigg
ered if the true DLT toxicity rate is 5%,  it has a 62% chance of being triggered if the true DLT 
ra
te is 20% and an 88% chance of being triggered if the true DLT rate is 30%. 
 
12.1.1 Randomization 
Not applicable. 
 
 12.2 Interim analyses 
Patient characteristics will be summarized using proportions for  categorical variables, means and 
standard deviations for continuous  variables (median  and inter- quartile rages for variables that 
exhibit  skewness).  Adverse events and qualifying DLT will be tabulated by  cohort, site and 
severity.  Proportions of these patients in each  response category will be tabulated; the combined 
proportion in  catego ries CR, CRi, PR, SD will be computed along with an exact 95%  confidence 
interval.  Duration of response progression -free survival and overall survival will be computed 
from  start of induction therapy and summarized with Kaplan -Meier estimates.  
 
12.3 Descriptive Statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis 
Not a
pplicable. 
 
12.4 Primary Analysis  
F
or the Phase II component, it is expected that no more than 50% of patients will have stable disease 
at 6 months (defined as stable MRI and clinical status, including being on a stable dose of steroids 
and not on bevacizumab). We will therefore consider this regimen of interest if significantly more 
than 50% of patients achieve this benchmark. 
 
12.4.1 Analysis Population 
A total of 9 patients will be treated in the Phase I com ponent wit h the first at t he starting dose of 200 
µg/kg/d x 4 wks .  If the regimen  prove s too toxic or if none of the dose levels appears to re ach 30% 
DLT, fewer patients may be treated.

Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015        CONFIDENTIAL
   Page 41 of 52   
 
 
12.4.2. Analysis Plan 
Since our primary objective in the Phase I component is to ascertain whether the highest dose is 
tolerated with acceptable side effects, this will be completed using the schema described in Table 
12.1. 
 
12.4.3.
  
Patients will be followed clinically, by ECG, and laboratory measures to ensure that no serious adverse 
e
ffects occur and that safety is established at the proposed treatment doses.   
 
12.5 Secondary Analysis 
Our
 Primary objective in the Phase II component is to assess progression free survival at 6 months. 
 
12.5.1 Analysis Population 
20 additional patients will be enrolled in the Phase II component of this study for determination of 
efficacy. 
 
12.5.2  Analysis Plan 
For the Phase II component, it is expected that no more than 50% of patients will have stable disease 
at 6 months (defined as stable MRI and clinical status, including being on a stable dose of steroids 
a
nd not on bevacizumab). We will therefore consider this regimen of interest if significantly more 
than 50% of patients achieve this benchmark. 
 
12.6  Sample Size 
12.6.1 Ac
crual estimates    
We expect to accrue the total number of 29 patients within the 36 month timeline proposed.  
 
12.6.2 S
ample size justification 
In collaboration with our statistician, it was determined that our sample size of 29 total patients would 
substantiate enough power to reach our points of analyses.   
 
12.6.3 Effect size justification 
This is a single-arm (non-randomized) study, therefore t he historical control rate has been used to 

Version # 11, Date: 04-29-2015        CONFIDENTIAL
   Page 42 of 52 determine our effect size justification.   
 
12.7 Criteria for future studies 
This i
s a pilot study with the expectation that no more than 50% of patients will have stable disease at 
6 months (defined as stable MRI and clinical status, including being on a stable dose of steroids and 
not on bevacizumab). We will therefore consider this regimen of interest if significantly more than 
50% of patients achieve this benchmark and would move further to future studies should this 
benchmark be reached.

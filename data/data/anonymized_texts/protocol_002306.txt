Study Design  
This multi -region, multi -center , ambulatory  study will be conducted in the US , Japan and 
Europe. Smokers  who are motivated to quit smoking within the next 30 days at screening 
will be enrolled  to reach approximately 950 subjects continuously abstinent from smoking 
from the actual quit dat e (AQD ) onwards at week 2 (V5) in order to achieve at least 190 
successful quitters to complete the study .  
Smokers who are not continuously abstinent from smoking (i.e., free from tobacco product 
use ( e.g., CC, pipes, cigars, snus) or any nicotine contain ing product (i ncluding electronic 
cigarettes)  other than nicotine replacement therapy  (NRT )), as assessed by the four criteria  
described in section 6.2, from their AQD  onwards  will be discontinued  from the study.   
NRT  use will be allowed  as per label  for up to 3 months  (+2 weeks)  after the start date of 
NRT to support the subject to remain abstinent from smoking.  NRT may be started at any 
time between the TQD and 1 week after the AQD. The start day of NRT will be counted as 
Day 1 of NRT use.  From tha t day on, the duration of NRT use must not exceed 3 months + 
2 weeks. NRT will be reimbursed.

Screening Period  
The Screening Period will take place 1 to 42 days prior to enrolment at V2 (Baseline).  
Eligibility of the subjects to participate in the study will be assessed during the Screening 
Visit ( V1). Subjects who are still eligibl e at the end of V1 will be provided with urine 
containers and instructions for the  24-hour urine home c ollection . Eligible subjects will be 
contacted  prior to V2  to confirm their eligibility  and to  take an appointment for V2 .  
Baseline Visit  - V2 (from check -in to check -out from the site)  
Twenty -four-hour urine collection will start in the morning of the day prior to V2 and end 
24 hours later in the morning of V2. Enrolment of the subject will take place after the 
subject ’s check -in on site with the cool ed urine container(s) filled with his/her 24 -hour urine  
and re -check of inclusion criteria n°4  and n°6 . All other procedures and data collection will 
be completed following the enrolment of the subject. All subjects will continue smoking 
their preferred br and of CC.  
Before check -out, subjects will be asked to define their target quit date (TQD) , the date from 
which the subject will  stop smoking. The TQD must be within 14 days after V2 . 
From Check -out of V2 to Actual Quit Date  (Day 1)  
This period aims to ide ntify subjects who are more motivated and more likely to quit as well 
as to remain continuously abstinent from smoking for the whole duration of the study. The 
period starts from check -out of V2 and ends with the AQD  (Day 1) including the TQD, V3 
and the Grace Period . This period might last up to 28 days for each subject.  
The subject will be asked to come to the clinic for V3 within 24 to 48 hours after their defined 
TQD. The goal of this visit will be to ensure that the subject has actually quit smoking a nd 
to provide him/her with the necessary support. From V3 onwards, smoking cessation (SC)  
counseling  and behavioral support will be provided to the subject according to the SC 
support plan . Additional SC support will be offered at any time as requested by the subject.  
A Grace Period  of a maximum of 14 days will be allowed after the TQD, during which 
occasional slips of smoking (defined as occasional use of nicotine  and/or tobacco -containing 
products) will be accepted. From the AQD  onwards , strict abstinence  from any tobacco - or 
nicotine -containing product (including electronic cigarette s) other than NRT  is required . 
Subjects will be asked to record their AQD and to communicate this date to the site in order 
to schedule following visits. The latest possible d ay for the AQD to occur is defined as the 
last day of the Grace Period  (i.e., TQD + 14 days) . 
The Smoking Abstinence Period (from the AQD up to the check -out of V1 7 [week 52])

From the AQD, subjects will be asked to come on site for at  week 1 (V4), at week 2 (V5) 
and then on a monthly basis at week 4 (V6 ), at week 9 (V7), at week 13 (V8), at week 17 
(V9), at week 22 (V10), at week 26 (V11), at week 30 (V12), at week 35 (V13), at week 39 
(V14), at week 43 (V15), at week 48 (V16), and at  week 52 (V17). Visits will be scheduled 
based on the AQD. A time window of ± 8 days is allowed for the visits, with the exception 
of V4 (± 3 days) and V5 (± 3 days).  
The V 8, V11, and V1 7 will correspond to full assessment visits at site(s) where 24-hour 
urine and blood sampling will be collected for analysis of biomarkers of exposure ( BoExp ) 
and clinical risk endpoints. The collection of the 24 -hour urine will start at home in the 
morning the day before the visit and will end 24 hours later in the  morning of the day of the 
visit to the clinic.  
The Safety Follow -Up P eriod and P hone Contact ( 28 days  after  the check -out of V17 [ V18 
(±3 days); week 5 6]) 
A subject who has completed V17 , or a subject who has been discontinued from the study 
prematurely (early termination) , will enter a 28-days Safety Follow -Up Period during which 
spontaneously reported new AEs/SAEs will be recorded, and the active follow -up of 
ongoing AEs/SAEs will be done by the sit e. All AEs will be followed -up until resolved, 
stabiliz ed (i.e., no worsening of the event), or a plausible explanation for the event has been 
found until the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period .  
At the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56 (V18  (±3 days )), the investigator will 
attempt to contact only the subject  who ha s previously completed V17  by phone to check  if 
all AEs/SAEs potentially occurring during the Safety Follow -Up period are fully reported  
and for self-reporting by the subject on continuous smoking abstinence . At the end of the 
Safety  Follow -Up Period, all ongoing AEs will be documented as “ongoing” and will not be 
followed -up by the Investigator . At the discretion of the Investigator , the subject will be 
refer red to his /her General Practitioner  for follow up on ongoing AEs.  
If the investigator can reach the subject who ha s previously completed V17  by phone at  the 
end of the Safety Follow -Up Period  in Week 56, the date of this phone call with the subject 
will be recorded as the date of the end of the study of the subject.  
If the investigator cannot reach the subject who has previously  completed V17 by phone at 
the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period  in Week 56  after a reasonable number of attempts , 
the date  of the last contact (e.g., last visit of the subject, last phone call w ith the subject) will 
be recorded as the date of the end of the study of the  subject.

coefficient of variation (CV) for data analyzed in the log scale; frequency counts and 
percentages  for categorical data) will be presented overall and at each time  point, where 
applicable. BoExp data will be analyzed in the logarithmic scale and s ummary estimates will 
be back -transformed to provide results in the original scale.  
Descriptive analysis wi ll be conducted in the population of continuous abstainers with no 
major protocol deviations. In subjects failing to abstain from smoking, only endpoint data 
assessed prior to the date of relapse will be included in the analysis.  
Descriptive statistics wi ll be provid ed for endpoint parameters and b aseline characteristics 
of the population retained in the study at each assessment time  point. Summary statistics of 
endpoints will also include the mean change fr om baseline, together with 95% confidence

interva l (CI). Absolute and percent change from baseline will be summarized for endpoints 
analyzed in the real and logarithmic scale, respectively.  
 
Exploratory Analysis  
For the clinical r isk endpoints, the smoking abstinence  (SA) effect over time will be 
predict ed by a model of the change from baseline adjusted for relevant population 
characteristics. The pattern and form of the change over time will be modeled using repeated 
measurement random -effects models. Sex, age, region, and other baseline variables will b e 
considered for inclusion in the model  using a backward elimination  approach . Goodness of 
fit will be evaluated by the analysis of residuals (model diagnostics) and by comparing the 
values predicted versus the observed parameter changes (calibration). Lea st square estimates 
of the effect of variables included in the model and the intercept will be reported together 
with the 95% CI.  
Safety Analysis  
Adverse event data will serve as the primary assessment of safety. Safety data will be listed 
and tabulated for the enrolled  population.  
Sample Size:  
Smokers willing to quit smoking within the next 30 days will be enrolled in this study. 
Enrolment will be allowed until approximately 950 subjects successfully abstain from 
smoking for at least two weeks after AQD.  Unsuccessful quitters ( i.e., subjects that smoke 
after the AQD) will be discontinued from the study.  
The sample size of this study is based on our current understanding of the effect and 
variability of SC from the results of the Lung Health Study  [1] in the subject intending to 
quit smoking at Baseline , since no data on the attrition rate at 12 months after 2 weeks of 
smoking cessation are available.  
In particular, a pproximately  190 subjects are needed to estimate the mean increase  from 
Baseline  of 1.98 [% pred.]  [1] in FEV 12 at V17, with a 90% probability of obtaining a margin 
of error (95% CI) of at most ±1 [% pred.]. The anticipated SD of the change from Baseline  
of 6.4  [% pred.] was estimated  using the  results of the Lung Health Study  [1] and includes 
an inflat ion of  10% in order to account for additional sources of variability, including the 
                                                 
2 Sample size calculations are driven by  FEV 1. Other endpoints are assumed to exhibit a larger  effect size than 
FEV 1 and thus would result in smaller sample size estimates.

multi -national nature of the study. As the primary population for analysis  will be successful 
quitters, this sample size was  increased to 950, to account for a predicted continuous 
abstinence rate  of 20 % expected at week 52 for subjects that successfully abstain from 
smoking for at least two weeks after. This is based on an assumed increase of 5% from the 
15% abstinence rate at week  52 expected for subjects at enrolment [2].

Explanation  of Terms  
The following special terms are used in this protocol:  
Baseline   Baseline  Visit is defined as V2 .  
Baseline value  Unless specified, baseline is defined as the last available value prior 
to TQD  or AQD, whichever comes first . 
Actual quit date  The AQD is the date recorded in the source document  on which the 
subject actually quits smoking and from which onwards total SA is 
expected.  AQD corresponds to the first day without any 
tobacco/nicotine use (except NRT).  
End of study  The individual end of the study for a subject who has previously 
completed V17 is defined as V18.  
The individual end of the study for a subject who has been 
discontinued from the study prematurely (early termination) is 
defined as the date of the early termination of the subject plus 28 
days of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  
The EOS of the entire study is the individual end of the study of the 
last subject.  
Lost t o follow -up (date)  When the PI(s) or designee(s) declare(s) a subject is lost to follow -
up, the lost to follow -up date will be recorded and will correspond 
to the date of the end of study of the subject.  
If the site has lost track of the subject but the s ubject has reached the 
maximum number of study days ( 465 days), then the PI(s) or 
designee(s) will declare the subject lost to follow -up at this date.  
Conventional cigarette 
(CC) The term ‘ conventional cigarette’ refers to  commercially available  
cigarettes (manufactured and hand -rolled)  and excludes  cigars, 
pipes, bidis, and other nicotine -containing products.  
Nicotine replacement 
therapy  The NRT consists of nicotine -containing products such as nicotine 
gum, lozenge, patches, inhaler or nasal sp ray. The NRT should be 
used as per country label  for up to 3 months  (+2 weeks)  after the 
start date of NRT . NRT may be started at any time between the TQD 
and 1 week after the AQD.

Target quit date  Date from which the smoker intends to quit smoking and may start 
treatment with his/her preferred NRT  as per country label , if any  and 
where applicable.  
Study completion  The study will be completed once the last successful quitter has 
reached  V18. 
Successful quitter  A successful quitter is defined as a subject  that was contin uously 
abstinent from smoking from AQD to V17, as assessed by the four 
criteria  described in section 6.2. 
Unsuccessful quitter  An unsuccessful quitter is defined as a subject that was not 
contin uously abstinent from smoking from AQD to V17, as assessed 
by the four criteria described in section 6.2.

1 ETHICS AND REGULATIO NS 
1.1 Institutional Review Board  (IRB)  / Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) Approval  
Prior to the start of the study, the clinical st udy protocol, together with its associated documents 
(informed consent form [ICF], subject information  sheet , subject recruitment procedures [ e.g., 
advertisements], written information to be provided to the subjects, available safety 
information, the  Inves tigator ’s and designee  curriculum vitae and/or other evidence of 
qualifications and any other documents requested by an Institutional Review Board [IRB]  or 
Independent Ethics Committee [IEC]), will be submitted for review and approval to the 
relevant IRB /IEC. The IRB /IEC shall be appropriately constituted and perform its functions in 
accordance with the International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) Tripartite Guidance for 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and local requirements, as applicable.  
Where applicabl e, and i n accordance with GCP and 21 CFR part 56, a written confirmation of 
the IRB approval should be provided to the Sponsor. This should identify the study (Principal 
Investigator and designee’s name, study number, and title) and the documents that have  been 
approved by the IRB, with dates and version numbers, as well as the date of approval. The 
composition of the IRB, including the name and occupation of the chairperson, will be supplied 
to the Sponsor together with a GCP compliance statement.  
The writ ten approval from the IRB /IEC will be filed in the Investigator file, and a copy will be 
filed in the study master file at the Sponsor or designated organization. The study must not 
start at a site before the Sponsor has obtained written confirmation of fa vorable 
opinion/approval from the concerned IRB /IEC. 
Any substantial change or addition to this protocol will require a written protocol amendment 
that must be approved by the Sponsor and the Investigator . All amendments will be submitted 
to the IRB /IEC, and substantial amendments will only be implemented after approval by the 
IRB/IEC. 
These requirements for approval should in no way prevent any action from being taken by the 
Investigator  or designee or by the Sponsor in order to eliminate immediate hazards  to the 
subjects. If such a change to the protocol is felt to be necessary by the Investigator  or designee , 
and is implemented for safety reasons, the Sponsor and the IRB /IEC should be informed 
immediately.  
The Investigator  is responsible for local reporti ng (e.g., to the I RB/IEC) of serious adverse 
events (SAEs ) that occur during the study, according to local regulations.

protocol agreed with the Sponsor and a pproved by the IRB /IEC. The Investigator  and the 
Sponsor must sign the protocol (and protocol amendments, if applicable) to confirm this 
agreement. A copy of the Declaration of Helsinki [3] is located  in the Investigator’s study file. 
1.3 Subject Information and Consent  
1.3.1  Informed Consent Form  for Study Participation  
Before or a tV1, the Investigator  or designee  will ensure  that each sub ject is given full and 
adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risks and benefits of 
the study, and the Investigator  or the designee will answer all questions the subject might have 
to his/her full satisfaction. The subject will have sufficient time for consideration of his/her 
participation in the study and will be notified that he/she is free to discontinue his/her 
participation at any time.  
Once the subject has received all the necessary information, and if he/she agrees to participate, 
this will be documented in the ICF which includes both the subject information sheet and 
informed consent by the date  and time perso nally signed and signature of both the subject and 
the person who conducted the  inform consent discussion  during the visit at V1. No study -
specific procedures will be performed before the ICF has been signed  (including date and 
time) . 
The signed and personally dated  original  and completed  ICF(s)  must be kept by the  
Investigator  and filed in the Investigator study file at the site  or with the subject’s files  and a 
copy must be given to the subject.  The subject will be informed that if he /she discontinues 
from the study, the data collected until the point of discontinuation will be maintained as part 
of the study data  and the samples collected prior to disco ntinuation may be analyzed, unless 
he/she refuses in writing .

Any additional analysis performed will be covered by data confidentiality, as for the main 
analysis described in this protocol.  
1.3.2  Informed Consent Form for Long -term Bio -Banking  
Separate ICF s will be signed  and personally dated  by the subject for th e collection of samples 
and their long -term bio-banking storage . The subject’s participation in  the study does not 
depend on his/her consent to these separate ICFs.  
 One separate ICF to obtain consent  for serum/plasma and urine collection and long -term 
storage for subsequent analysis of biomarkers of exposure ( BoExp ) and clinical risk 
endpoints  follo wing completion of this study. No genetic , transcriptomics and/or  
lipidomics testing will be done on these samples . 
 One separate ICF to obtain consent for collection and long -term storage  of blood / plasma  
samples for further transcriptomics  and lipidomics analys es.  
Transcriptomics, lipidomics and molecular analyses  will provide insight into the biological 
processes that take place following smoking cessation  (SC) . 
Each subject will be given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, 
purpose, possible risks and benefits of bio -banking, and the Investigator  will answer all 
questions the subject might have to his/her full satisfaction. The subject  will be notified that 
he/she is free to withdraw his /her consent  at any time. Once the subject has received all the 
necessary information, and if he/she agrees to participate, this will be documented by the date  
and time personally signed and signature of  both the subject and the personnel who conducted 
the informed consent discussion. The subject’s consent to collection of any samples for long -
term storage in a bio -bank is not a requirement for his/her participation in the study (section  
1.3.1 ). 
1.3.3  Amendment to the Informed Consent Form

2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Background  
Cigarette smoking causes pulmonary  diseases , cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and other 
serious diseases in smokers  [4]. There is no safe cigarette , and the b est way for smokers to 
reduce the adverse health consequences of smoking is to quit. Despite the risks which are 
attributable to smoking, some smokers cannot refrain from smoking or decide to continue 
smoking. For those smokers who are not able or not will ing to quit, Philip Morris International 
(PMI) is developing alternative approaches by developing products with the potential to reduce 
the risks of tobacco -related diseases. These products are referred by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA ) as modified  risk tobacco products  (MRTP)  [5].  
The disorders induced by conventional cigarettes ( CC) smoking are complex, as there are 
multiple causal chains , and tobacco -related disease s develop over many years. The exposure 
to harmful and potentiall y harmful constituents (HPHCs) contained in cigarette smoke affects 
multiple organ systems, disease pathways, and mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative 
stress, platelet activation and lipid metabolism which occur simultaneously . It is well-known 
that there is a  dose-response relationship between cigarette smok e exposure and smoking -
related diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD), CVD and lung cancer  
[6, 7]. However, t here is no single clinical risk endpoint or biomarker that is considered as a 
validated surrogate measure reflecting the biological process, physiological system, and/or a 
mechanism of action that is associated with or known to contribute to smoking -related 
diseases.   
The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) refer s to smoking cessation as the “gold standard” for the 
assessment of a reduced risk products  (RRP) , providing “an aspirational goa l for risk and 
exposure.”  [6].  
It has been shown that s everal functional and biological markers  (clinical risk endpoints ) 
associated with  smoking -related adverse health effects are favorably changed after SC in both 
the short and long term  [8-10]. These  effects are sufficiently sensitive to changes in smoking 
status to suggest that they can be used for the risk asse ssment of candidate MRTPs . Thus, 
conventional c igarette (CC) smoking and SC are considered natural benchmarks for assessing 
the exposure and risk reduction potential of candidate MRTPs [5, 11]. The observation of 
clinical risk endpoints  after switching from CC to a candidate MRTP  in comparison to SC 
should be a reasonable indicator for disease risk  reduction  to the individual smoker. The 
clinical risk endpoints selected for this study are the markers with the strongest scientific 
evidence of favorable  changes following SC.

2.2 Purpose  of the Study  
There is sufficient literature reporting favorable changes in clinical risk endpoints with S C, 
however the observation time period of one year of continuous abstinence is often sparse or  
even  not available, and the currently available information is derived from multiple clinical 
studies making it difficult to compare the findings.  
The primary o bjective of the SCR  Study is to establish data on changes on a broad range of 
BoExp and Clinical Risk Endpoints as observed after 12 months of smoking cessation.   
This study will serve two purposes: 1) to be used as a benchmark in the context of candidate 
MRTP assessments ( i.e., to allow comparison between the risks and benefits from the use of a 
candidate MRTP compared to SC), and 2) corroborate and supplement the existing data on 
biological and functional health  effects of SC.   
The primary objective clearly differentiates the SCR study from other Smoking Cessation 
studies where testing the efficacy of a smoking cessation treatment (i.e. drug or behavioral 
cessation support) is the primary objective.  
2.3 Anticipated Benefits and Risks  
2.3.1  Anticipated Benefits  
Extensive SC support (SC counseling , behavioral support ( BS) and training on the use of 
nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT)  will be provided  over the duration of the study.  The 
combination of these different methods of smoking cessation support ha s been shown to 
markedly increase the success rate of quitting smoking. S ubjects who participate in this study 
will also benefit from repeated  and extensive  health check -ups, which may help to uncover 
undiagnosed medical conditions.  
2.3.2  Anticipated Forese eable Risks due to Study Procedures  
The risk related to study  procedures ( e.g., blood samples ) are deemed to be part of procedures 
routinely performed during normal or extended health examinations by the subject’s health 
care professional.   
Administration of sal butamol/albuterol for the spirometry testing may potentially elevate blood 
pressure, increase the heart rate and cause  tremor, inner agitation, palpitation due to sinus 
tachycardia, muscle cramps or headaches. However , these effects are limited after singl e use 
and only more frequent following repeated use and oral administration. Salbutamol/albuterol

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This multi -region, multi -cente r, ambulatory study will be conducted in the US, Japan and 
Europe. Smokers who are motivated to quit smoking within the next 30 days at the S creening 
Visit will be enrolled to reach approximately 950 subjects continuously abstinent from 
smoking from AQD on wards at week 2 (V5) , in order to achieve at least 190 successful quitters 
expected to complete the study . Once ap proximat ely 950 subjects will reach V5, screening and 
enrolment will be stopped. Subjects already enrolled in the study at that point in time and that 
are between V2 and V5, will be kept in the study and allowed to progress over Visit 5. On the 
contrary, on -going subjects that have completed screening visit and are before visit 2 will be 
discontinued from the study and classified as screen failu res. 
Smokers who are not continuously abstinent from smoking ( i.e., free from tobacco product use 
(e.g., CC, pipes, cigars, snus) or any nicotine containing product (including electronic 
cigarettes) other than NRT) ) from their AQD  onwards will be discontinued from the study  (see 
sections 5.3 and 6.2) . 
NRT use will be allowed as per label for up to 3 months  (+2 weeks)  after the start date of NRT 
to support the subject to remain abstinent from smoking. NRT may be started at any time 
between the TQD a nd 1 week after the AQD. The start day of NRT will be counted as Day 1 
of NRT use.  From that day on, the duration of NRT use must not exceed 3 months + 2 weeks.  
NRT will be reimbursed.

Screening Period  
The Screening Period will take place 1 to 42 days prior to enrolment at V2 (Baseline). 
Eligibility of the subjects to participate in the study will be assessed during the Screening Visit 
(V1). Subjects who are still eligible at the end of V1 will be provided with urine containers 
and instructions fo r the 24 -hour urine home collection. Eligible subjects will be contacted prior 
to V2 to confirm their eligibility and to take an appointment for V2.  
Baseline Visit  - V2 (from check -in to check -out from the site)

Twenty -four-hour urine collection will star t in the morning of the day prior to V2 and end 24 
hours later in the morning of V2. Enrolment of the subject will take place after the subject ’s 
check -in on site with the cooled urine container(s) filled with his/her 24 -hour urine and re -
check of inclusio n criteria n°4 and n°6. All other procedures and data collection will be 
completed following the enrolment of the subject. All subjects will continue smoking their 
preferred brand of CC.  
Before check -out, subjects will be asked to define their target quit date (TQD), the date from 
which the subject will stop  smoking. The TQD must be within 14 days after V2.  
From Check -out of V2 to Actual Quit Date  
This period aims to identify subjects who are more motivated and more likely to quit as well 
as to remain conti nuously abstinent from smoking for the whole duration of the study. The 
period starts from check -out of V2 and ends with the actual quit date (AQD) (Day 1) including 
the TQD, V3 and the Grace Period . This period might last up to 28 days for each subject.  
The subject will be asked to come to the clinic for V3 within 24 to 48 hours after their defined 
TQD. The goal of this visit will be to ensure that the subject has actually quit smoking and to 
provide him/her with the necessary support. From V3 onwards, SC counseling  and BS will be  
provided to the subject according to the SC support plan. Additional SC support will be offered 
at any time when requested by the subject.  
A Grace Period of a maximum of 14 days will be allowed after the TQD, during which 
occasional slips (defined as occasional use of nicotine  and/or tobacco -containing products day) 
of smoking will be accepted. From the AQD onwards, strict abstinence from any tobacco - or 
nicotine -containin g product (including electronic cigarette s) other than NRT is required. 
Subjects will be asked to record their AQD  and to communicate this date to the site in order to 
schedule following visits.  The latest possible day for the AQD to occur is defined as th e last 
day of the Grace Period  (i.e., TQD + 14 days) . 
The Smoking Abstinence  Period (from the AQD up to the check -out of V17 [week 52])  
From the AQD, subjects will be asked to come on site for at week 1 ( V4), at week 2 ( V5) and 
then on a monthly basis at week 4  (V6 ), at week 9 ( V7), at week 13 ( V8), at week 17 ( V9), at 
week 22 ( V10), at week 26 ( V11), at week 30 ( V12), at week 35 ( V13), at week 39 ( V14), at 
week 43 ( V15), at week 48 ( V16) , and at week 52 ( V17). Visits will be scheduled based on 
the AQD. A  time window of ± 8 days is allowed for the visits, with the exception of V4 (± 3 
days) and V5 (± 3 days).  
The V8 , V11 , and V17 will correspond to full assessment visits at site(s) where 24 -hour urine 
and blood sampling will be collected for analysis of BoExp and clinical risk endpoints. The

collection of the 24 -hour urine will start at home in the morning the day before the visit and 
will end 24 hours later in the morning of the day of the visit to the clinic.  
The Safety Follow -Up Period and Phone Contact ( 28 days  after  the check -out of V17 [V18 
(±3 days); week 56])  
A subject who has completed V17, or a subject who has been discontinued from the study 
prematurely (early termination), will enter a 28 -days Safety Follow -Up Period during which 
spontane ously reported new AEs/SAEs will be recorded, and the active follow -up of ongoing 
AEs/SAEs will be done by the sit e. All AEs will be followed -up until resolved, stabilized (i.e., 
no worsening of the event), or a plausible explanation for the event has been  found until the 
end of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  
At the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56 (V18 (±3 days) ), the investigator will 
attempt to contact only the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone to check if all 
AEs/SAEs potenti ally occurring during the Safety Follow -Up period are fully reported and for 
self-reporting by the subject on continuous smoking abstinence. At the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period, all ongoing AEs will be documented as “ongoing” and will not be followed -
up by the Investigator. At the discretion of the Investigator, the subject will be referred to 
his/her General Practitioner for follow up on ongoing AEs.  
If the investigator can reach the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone at the 
end of the  Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56, the date of this phone call with the subject 
will be recorded as the date of the end of the study of the subject.  
If the investigator cannot reach the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone at the 
end of the  Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56 after a reasonable number of attempts, the date 
of the last contact (e.g., last visit of the subject, last phone call with the subject) will be recorded 
as the date of the end of the study of the subject.  
The individual end of the study for a subject who has previously completed V17 is defined as 
V18.  
The individual end of the study for a subject who has been discontinued from the study 
prematurely (early termination) is defined as the date of the early termination of the  subject 
plus 28 days of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  
The EOS of the entire study is the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period of the last subject.

4.2 Rationale for Study Design  
This clinical study aims at understanding the clinical, biological and functional changes after 
one year of smoking  cessation in healthy subjects. Healthy subjects will be included in this 
study, since the impact of potential diseases on the study endpoints is difficult to evaluate . 
The minimum age of 30 years old in the inclusion crite ria was selected based on the legal age 
of smoking in some of the chosen countries  (20 years old) and to account for the 10 years of 
smoking history.  
This study is of non -investigational nature and will be used to establish a benchmark to 
compare the risk s and benefits for a smoker switching from a CC to a candidate MRTP  
compared to smoking cessation. No control arms are required.  
Since l iterature [12] indicates that > 40% of subjects who remain tobacco free at 2 weeks 
continue to remain tobacco free for > 6 months, whereas > 80% of those who relapse in the 
first 2 weeks are smoking at 6 months , a period starting from check -out of V2 and ending with 
the V5 including the TQD, V3, the Grace Period and AQD has been implemented in th e study 
design to evaluate smoking abstinence status and to select the subjects who are more likely to 
remain smoking abstinent for the whole duration of the study. Subjects discontinued from the 
study between AQD and V5 will be replaced in order to achiev e approximately 950 subjects 
who are continuously abstinent from smoking at V5. From V5 onwards, subjects will not be 
replaced.  
To help smoker s quitting tobacco, subjects will be provided with SC support  and NRT  (if 
requested by the subject) . NRT are recom mended as SC aids in Europe  [13], Japan [14] and 
US [15], in addition to SC support . Other drugs to aid SC have been approved in several 
count ries ( e.g., bupropion and varenicline). However, since information on their effect on the 
selected clinical risk endpoints  is sparse , their use will not be allowed in this study.  
Twenty -four hour-urine that will be collected in this study is the standard  method to measure 
the levels of excretion of BoExp.  
As part of the characterization of the study population it is important to measure variables that 
have been shown to be related to nicotine dependence and product reinforcing value. Based on 
prior tobac co research these factors include age, gender, ethnicity, educational and socio -
economic status  (SES) , tobacco use history, expectations of the effects of the products tested, 
nicotine exposure, health and mental health status and use of psychoactive subst ances. In order 
to capture  such data and allow compar ing populations across studies , subjects will be asked 
questions about their socio -economic status.

4.3 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The clinical risk endpoints to be assessed are selected based on a) th eir association with 
smoking -related diseases b) their association with smoking status, c) their reversibility upon 
SC/abstinence, and d) their suitability to be measured with valid and robust methods in clinical 
studies, e) timeframe of reversibility of m easure in the perspective of the study duration . These 
clinical risk endpoints are associated with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, genotoxicity 
and xenobiotic metabolism as presented in Appendix 4 . 
The BoExp (list in Appendix  5) measured in this study were selected based on the following 
criteria:  1) HPHCs to be assessed in this study are derived from the list of HPHCs 
recommended for lowering in cigarette smoke as defined by the World Health Organization 
(WHO [16] and the draft guidance on Reporting Harmful and Potentially Harmful Constituents 
in Tobacco Products and Tobacco Smoke  [17]; 2) the HPHC should be specif ic to the source 
of exposure with other sources being minor or non -existent; 3) the BoExp to an HPHC should 
be easily detectable using reliable, reproducible, precise analytical methods; 4) the HPHC 
should reflect a specific toxic exposure or be a reliable  surrogate of exposure to HPHCs; 5) 
The list of HPHCs should include HPHCs from both gas and particulate phase; 6) The list of 
HPHCs should include a broad variety of chemical classes and organ toxicity classes 
(carcinogen, cardiovascular toxicant, respira tory toxicant, reproductive and development 
toxicant, addiction potential) and 7) represent HPHCs formed at different temperature levels.  
All questionnaires utilized for this study, except the  cough -VAS  and the socio -economic  
questionnaire, are available as validated questionnaires.  
4.4 Study Duration  
The maximum total duration of the study  for a subject  will be 66 weeks . A Screening Period 
of up to 42 days will be followed by V2, plus a period of a maximum of 28 days until the AQD  
including the TQD visit and the Grace Period , followed by a  52-week smoking abstinence  
period  in an ambulatory setting  and a 28-days Safety Follow -Up Period ending after a phone 
contact with successful quitters in Week 56  (V18 (±3 days )). The EOS  of the entire study will 
be defined a s the end of the Safety Follow -Up Period  of the last subject .

observed, all subjects continuously abstinent from smoking , as assessed by the four criteria  
described in section 6.2, will be retained in the study . 
Smoking cessation support  will be provided to the subject to prevent him/her from smoking 
during the study ( section 1.1). 
5.3 Discontinuation of Subjects from the Study  
Discontinued sub jects will include both subjects who withdraw from the study (subject’s 
decision) or subjects who are removed from the study  (e.g., subject who are not continuously 
abstinent  from smoking after AQD , section 6.2). A subject can only be discontinued from the 
study after enrolment.  
Subjects will be informed that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time. Subjects 
should be questioned for the reason of premature withdrawal  from the main study , although 
they are not obliged to disclose it.  
If the subject withdraws his/her consent for the main study  (main ICF) , the Investigator  or 
designee needs to document if:  
 If applicable, the subject still consents for long -term bio -banking . 
 Whether the subject requested withdrawal of Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA ) authorization  (for the US sites  only). 
 The subject agrees to undertake the early termination procedures ( section 9.6) 
This information  need s to be fully documented in the source document  and CRF .  
When a subject is discontinued  from the study,  he/she will be asked to perform the examination 
procedure s planned in section 9.6 as soon as possible after the time of discontinuation  unless 
the subject refuses to perform the assessments  in writin g.  
Subjects discontinued  from the study cannot re -enter the study.  
Subjects must be discontinued  from the study for any of the following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of informed consent.  
 Any AE or condition (including clinically relevant changes in a laboratory pa rameter) 
which at the discretion of the  Investigator  or designee  no longer justifies the subject’s 
participation in this study.  
 Pregnancy test  is positive  (section 8.5 for further details on the management of 
pregnancies ).

 The Sponsor , the Investigator  or designee  terminates the study.  If the Sponsor , the 
Investigator  or designee  decides to prematurely ter minate the study,  the subject will be 
promptly informed.  The Investigator  or designee should  report the fact and the reason of 
termination in writing to the IRB  or IEC. 
 Discontinuation  is considered to be in the best interest for the subject himself/herself or for 
other subjects  participating to the study , as judged by the investig ator or designee . 
 Non-compliance with continuous smoking  abstinence  (see section 6.2), as assessed by the 
following four criteria : 
1. Self-reporting by the subject of  use of  any of the following product from 
AQD onwards:  
 Tobacco product, such as CC, snus, cigars.  
 Nicotine -containing products, other than NRT.  
 NRT continued after the allowed timeframe, i.e. 3 months (+2 weeks)  
after the start date of NRT.  
 Electronic cig arettes (with or without nicotine) . 
2. Smoking abstinence v erification by exhaled CO breath test at each visit from 
V4 onwards (CO breath test is > 10 ppm)  
3. Smoking abstinence v erification by urine cotinine test in spot urine at site at 
each visit from V 10 onwards (urine cotinine test is ≥ 100 ng/ml) . 
4. Smoking abstinence verification by analysis of the free cotinine concentration  
(part of the nicotine equivalents)  in 24-hour-urine collected at Visit 11  (urine 
cotinine concentration is ≥ 50 ng/mL ). 
If any one of these four criteria  is met, the subject must be discontinued.   
  
Subjects may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons  on the judgment 
of the  Investigator  or designee : 
 Non-compliance to the study procedures  other than compliance to continuous smoking 
abstinence . 
 Use of medication supportive to smoking cessation , other than NRT , from the TQD 
onwards.  
Subjects discontinued  from enrolment  to V5 will be replaced in order to achieve approximately 
950 subjects who  are continuously abstinent from smoking at V5. From V5  onwards , subjects

document and in the CRF . 
5.4 Assessments at Visit 17 to be performed if Total NNAL is abov e 
the cut-off at Visit 11 
Analysis of Total NNAL will be performed by a central laboratory to determine which 
assessments will be performed at Visit 17. The concentration of Total NNAL will be 
determined in 24-hour urine collected at Visit 11 (cut-off < 75.9 pg/mL)  [18]. If the 
concentration of Total NNAL is ≥ 75.9 pg/mL , the subject will remain  in and continue with  
the study , unless the subject is discontinued for other reasons . Howe ver, for this subject , only 
the following  assessments at Visit 17 will be performed:  
 Smoking cessation support 
 Prior/Concomitant medication 
 Pregnancy test (all female subjects) 
 Vital signs 
 CO Breath test 
 Cotinine test in spot urine (cut-off < 100 ng/mL) 
 AE/SAE recording. 
5.5 Lost to Follo w-up 
Reasonable number of attempts to contact the subject (including written correspondence and 
phone calls) should be done and documented in the source documents by the site. The date of 
the last contact (e.g. last visit, last phone call) should also be recorded in the source document . 
When the PI(s) or designee(s) declare(s) a subject is lost to follow-up, the lost to follow-up 
date will be recorded and will correspond to the date of the end of study of the subject.  
If the site has lost track of the subject but the subject has reached the maximum number of 
study days (4 65 days), then the PI(s) or designee(s) will declare the subject lost to follow-up 
at this date.

6 RESTRICTIONS AND  SUPPORT  DURING THE STUDY  
6.1 Smoking Cessation Support  
Information on the risk of smoking and SC advice will be provided to the subject. The approach 
to SC support including SC counseling and behavioral support in this study will be explained 
and the benefits and risks of using NRT discussed with the subject. The Investigator or 
designee  will provide  information on the different NRTs available and the Investigator or 
designee  and the subject will agree on which NRT will be used as supportive  medication.  The 
subject  may choose to not use NRT and to rely on smoking ce ssation  counseling  and behavioral 
support  only. 
Once the NRT is selected, the subject will be advised on how to use the NRT as per approved 
country label  and for up to 3 months  (+2 weeks)  after the start date of NRT . NRT may be 
started at any time between the TQD and 1 week after the AQD.   
If the NRT selected ( e.g., gum, lozenge, patch, nasal spray, depending on the availability in 
the country of study) is not available over the counter, the Investigator or designee  will 
prescribe the selected NRT as per local country regulations. The  combin ed use of NRT ( e.g., 
patch and gum together) or the switch from one NRT to another one will be allowed in this 
study as per country label ( e.g., NRT combined use for EU allowed, but not in JP)  and for up 
to 3 months  (+2 weeks)  after the start date of NRT . No medication supportive for SC other 
than NRT ( e.g., bupropion or varenicline) will be allowed.  
A SC specialist ( e.g., psychologist) may be contacted and will be available upon the subject’s 
request, or if considered necessary, upon the request of the Investigator  or designee.  
Smoking cessation support, including SC counseling  and behavioral support, will be provided 
at each visit  and in -between visits throughout the study from the TQD onwards as defined in  
the SC support plan (separate document) and whene ver requested by the subject.  
6.2 Compliance  
Compliance  with continuous smoking abstinence is defined by the four following criteria:  
1. No self -reporting by the subject of  use of  any of the following product from AQD onwards:  
- Tobacco product, such as CC, snus, cigars.  
- Nicotine -containing products, other than NRT.  
- NRT continued after the allowed timeframe, i.e. TQD + 3 months (+2 weeks).  
- Electronic cigarettes (with or without nicotine).

If any of these four criteria  is not met , the sub ject must be discontinued  (see section 5.3) . 
6.3 Restrictions  
6.3.1  Smoking Restrictions  
Subjects will be allowed to use their own brand of CC until their AQD. Occasional slips of 
using CC during the Grace Period between TQD and AQD is allowed as described in sectio n 
4.1. The use of NRT between the TQD and AQD while no full smoking abstinence is a chieved 
will depend on the NRT country label.  From their AQD, use of any tobacco, nicotine 
containing product othe r than NRT , as well as e -cigarettes will not be  allowed in this study.  
At Screening Visit (V1) and V2 pre- and post -bronchodilator spirometry will be done  after at 
least 1 hour of not  smoking  (section 7.4.7.1 ). 
6.3.2  Dietary Restrictions  
Subjects have to fast for 10 hours prior to blood draws for:  
 Hematology and clinical chemistry s afety laboratory  except at the Screening Visit (V1) . 
 Clinical risk endpo ints. 
 Serum/plasma /blood  bio-banking . 
Subjects do not have to fast prior to the timepoints for the urine analysis  of the safety panel . 
6.4 Concomitant Medication  
For the definition of pr ior and concomitant (ongoing medications), please see section 7.4.3 . 
Medication will be allowed during the study and  will carefully be monitored by the Investigator  
or designee . The Investigator  or designee is responsible for the medical care including 
medication of the subjects during their participation in th e study. Any decisions regarding the 
prescri ption  of medication will be made in the best interest of the subject.  Any use of 
concomitant medication , including NRT,  must be fully documented in the source document  
and recorded into the CRF . For NRT, the Investigator or designee will instruct the subject to

overview of all study assessments  is shown in the schedule of events (Appendix 1 ). Site 
personnel will adhere to the site’s standard operating p rocedures (SOPs) for all activities. 
Appropriate medical advice will be provided to the subject in case of any medi cal findings 
requiring health care.  
7.1 Informed Consent  and Guidance  
Prior to any study assessments being performed, the subject will be asked to provide his /her 
written consent to participate to the study (ICF) ( section 1.3). All assessments must start after 
the time of ICF signature by the subject for study participation.  
In addition to the ICF for study participation, the subject will be asked to provide his /her 
separate consent for sample bio-banking  (section 1.3.2 ): 
 ICF for the additional bio -banking of serum/plasma/urine samples for further 
measurements of clinical risk endpoints  and BoExp . 
 ICF for  the additional bio -banking of blood and plasma sample s for further transcriptomics  
and lipidomics  analysis.  
The subject’s participation in the study does not depend on his/her consent for bio -banking and 
will be separate d from the consent for study participation. The different  consents will be 
captured in the CRF . 
7.2 Information on the Risk of Smoking and Smoking Cessation 
Advice  
Each subject will be given information on the risks of smoking and SC advice at V1 , V2 and 
in case of discontinuation . Information will be given on an individual basis during a face -to-
face meeting between the subject and the Investigator  or designee , and may additionally be 
given in a group session. Details of the interviews will be recorded in the source document .  
7.3 Smo king C essation  Support  
Smoking cessation support, including SC counseling and behavioral support, will be provided 
at each visit and between visits throughout the study  and whenever requested by the subject 
(section 6.1). General recommendations on SC support are provided  in the SC support plan 
(separate document) .

concomitant disease. This also applies to clinically relevant findings in laboratory values, vital 
signs, spirometry  and ECGs detected at V1 . Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
detected during the study which was not present at V1 must be documented as an AE. 
Worsening of a pre -existing condition from V1 onwards will also be documented as an AE.  
The results of the clinical assessmen ts described in this section will be recorded in the CRF . 
7.4.1  Demographic Data  
Demographic data (se x, age, race and/or ethnicity ) will be recorded .  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.4.2  Questions on Smoking History /Habits  and Intention to Quit Smoking .  
Subjects will be asked the following questions about their smoking history and habits:  
5. Have you smoked for at least the past 10 years? (yes/no)  
6. How many years have you smoked? (numeric response, 2 digits)  
7. On average, how many cigarettes per day have you smoked over the last year? (numeric 
response, 2 digits)  
8. On average, how many cigarettes per day have you smoked since you started smoking? 
(numeric respons e, 2 digits)  
9. On average, how would you describe your e -cigarette use over the last year? (check

See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.4.3  Medical History and Pr ior and Concomitant  Medications  
Relevant medical history and any concomitant disease will be documented at V1. Medical 
history is defined as any condition that started and ended prior to V1. A concomitant disease 
is defined as any condition that started prior to and is still ongoing at V1, or is detected at V1 . 
Medications will be allowed and carefully monitored during the study by the Investigator  or 
designee . The Investigator or designee  is responsible for the medical care including medication 
of the subjects during their participation in the study. Any decisions regarding the prescribed 
medications will be made in the best interest of the subject. Any use of concomitant medication 
must be fully documented in the source document and transcribed into the CRF.  
All m edication taken 4 weeks prior to V1 (prior medications) and all concomitant medication 
taken during the study will  be documented  in the source documentation and recorded in the 
CRF . Medication  which was started prior  to V1 and which is  still being taken by the subject 
during the study as well as medication that is initiated after V1 will be considered as a 
concomitant medication . This applies to both prescription and over -the-counter  products  (e.g., 
vitamins) . NRT will be recorded as a concomitant medication.  
Records of medication  taken include the drug name (preferably both generic and trade name), 
route of administration ( e.g., oral, intravenous), total daily dose/unit ( e.g., expressed in mg, 
mL or IU), indication, the start and if applicable, the stop date (day, month and year). Any 
therapy changes (including changes of regimen) during the study have to be documented. Any 
concomitant medication that is still being taken by th e subject at the EOS will be recorded in 
the CRF .

Appropriate medical advice will be provided to the subject in case any medical findings 
requiring health care  are identified . 
Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated from the body weight and height using the following 
formula:  
BMI =  weight in kilograms  
————————      ( kg/m² )  
height in  meters²  
At V1, BMI will be calculated from the height and weight recorded at V1 . At the following 
visits, B MI will be calculated from the height at V1  and body weight recorded at each 
respective visit.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.4.6  Vital Signs  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and respiratory rate will be measured . All 
measurements will be made after the subject has rest ed for at least 5  minutes in a supine 
position.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.4.7  Other Clinical Assessments  
7.4.7.1  Lung Function  Testing

Joint Task Force on the standardization of spirometry. Spirometry testing will be managed by 
a central provider, including the provision of equi pment and site manual. The Pulmonary 
Function Testing ( PFT) manual will include information on equipment, procedures, subject 
instructions and precautions.  
The spirometry tests will include the recording of FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1/FVC ratio and FEF 25 -
75. All spir ometry tests will be performed as des cribed in the Investigator PFT site manual  
[20]. 
All spiromet ry testing must be pe rformed at least 1 hour after smoking  (if applicable) .  
Pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry testing  
Pre and post- bronchodilator spirometry assessments  will be performed. Each assessment 
requires at least three valid spirometry tests.  The ratio of FEV 1/FVC will be calculated from 
the highest  acceptable  FEV 1 and the highest  acceptable  FVC , respectively.   
The results from FEV 1 and the ratio FEV 1 to FVC at V1  will be used for eligibility criteria to 
assess spirometry and asthma conditions.  
For all the other visits, pre - and post -bronchodilator spirometry will be used t o describe the 
changes in pre - and post -bronchodilator spirometry measurements over the duration of the 
study. Values for FEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25 -75 will be recorded. The ratio FEV 1/FVC will be 
calculated from the highest  acceptable  FEV 1 and the highest acceptable FVC respectively . In 
case, the tests do not meet the acceptability criteria the s ubject will need to come back within 
a 5-day window to repeat the tests.  More details will be provided in the Pulmonary Function 
Testing (PFT) manual.  
All post -bronchodilator spirometry testing will be performed 15 -30 minutes post 
administration of around 400 µg of salbutamol /albuterol  (usually equivalent to 4 puffs 
assuming 100 g/puff). The time of salbutamol /albuterol  inhalation and time of spirometry 
assessment will be recorded in the source document.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
Lung volume measurements using multiple breath helium dilution technique   
All lung volumes measurements will be done pre -bronchodilator.  
Lung  volume measurem ents will be conducted as part of the lung function tests in selected and 
specialized centers and the following values will be recorded: VC, FRC, IC and TLC.  If 
required, a second trial can be performed. Between trials, a minimum waiting time of 4 min utes 
is required . For FRC, the mean value will be used if more than one attempt is performed . TLC 
is evaluated at FRC plus IC . VC will be the highest from FRC -He if more than one attempt is

He wash in . 
The helium dilution technique will be used in accordance with the recommendations of the 
American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society  (ATS/ERS) Joint Task Force on the 
standardization of the measurement of lung vo lumes  [21]. This technique is a closed -circuit 
system where a spirometer is filled with a mixture of helium and oxygen. The  closed -circuit 
rolling seal spirometer will be filled to a starting volume of six liters with a mixture of 
containing helium, oxygen and balance room air. Oxygen will be set to 30% so that all test 
subjects will be comfortable; exact contents will be anal yzed. The subject will be asked to seal 
their lips around the mouthpiece and breathe normally on the closed -circuit while the helium 
mixes and equilibrates. During this time carbon dioxide will be removed by a chemical 
absorber and oxygen will be automatic ally replaced. Once equilibration has occurred, the 
subject will be asked to perform one or more vital capacity efforts to end the test . 
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.4.7.2   Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiogram (ECG ) recordin g will be performed as per the site’s local practice. A 
standard 12 -lead ECG will be recorded after the su bject has rested for at least 5 minutes in a 
supine position.   
The following parameters will be documented: heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT 
interval, and QT interval corrected by the ECG machine according to Bazett’s formula and 
Federici’s formul a. Every ECG has to be assessed as normal, abnormal – clinically not 
relevant, or abnormal – clinically relevant. A diagnosis has to be provided on the eCRF for all 
ECGs assessed as abnormal – clinically relevant. All ECG print -outs will be interpreted by a 
qualified physician. Any print -outs of ECGs on thermo -sensitive paper must be photocopied 
and stapled together for inclusion in the source documents and signed by Principal Investigator 
or designee.

See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.5.2.3  Urine Cotinine Tests 
In this study, urine cotinine will be analyzed in three different ways. Two different test s will 
be used at site and a third analysis will be carried out by a central laboratory.  
A urine cotinine test will be performed to confirm the subject’s smoking status  as smoker at 
Screening and Baseline Visits . The test must detect cotinine with a cotinine threshold of ≥  200 
ng/mL.  
Another  urine c otinine test in spot urine at site will be used to verify continuous smoking 
abstinence at each visit from V10  onwards. The cut -off value defined for this smoking 
abstinence verification is  < 100 ng/mL .  
Repeat testing for the urine cotinine test in spot urine at site is permitted in case of unclear 
result s. 
Subjects who have completed the study before the effective date of the current study protocol 
(Final Version 7.0) without having ever been tested for co tinine in urine by the urine co tinine 
test (cut-off < 100 ng/ml) in spot urine at site will not be recorded as subjects with a protocol 
deviation hereof.   
Subjects who have already performed one or several Visit s from Visit 10 onwards before the 
effective date of the current study protocol (Fina l Version 7.0) without having been tested for 
cotinine in urine by the urine cotinine test (cut-off < 100 ng/ml)  in spot urine at site  will not be 
recorded as subjects with a protocol deviation hereof.

The urine cotinine test used at Screening  and at Basel ine and the one used at each visit from 
V10 onwards are two different test s and cannot be exchanged.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
A third analy sis of cotinine  in urine  will be performed by a central laboratory as a criteri on for 
discontinuation (see section 5.3 and 6.2), i.e. free cotinine concentration (part of the nicotine 
equivalents) will be determined in 24-hour urine collected  at Visit 11 . If the concentration of 
free cotinine is ≥ 50 ng/mL, the subject will be discontinued at the time the results are made 
available.  
7.5.2.4  Urine Pregnancy Testing  
All f emale subjects will perform pregnancy  tests. Female subjects with a positive pregnancy 
test at V1 or V2 will not be enrolled and will be considered  as screen failure s. In case of a ny 
positive urine pregnancy test, the Investigator  or designee will inform the subject about the 
risks associated with smoking during pregnancy.  
All pregnancies detected du ring the study must be reported and handled as described in section  
8.5.

For normalization of clinical risk endpoints measured in urine, creatinine will also be measured 
in the 24 -hour urine samples.  
The COHb test should be conducted in timely conjunction with th e CO breath ( section 7.5.3.1 ). 
The samples will be collected irrespective of the time.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of a ssessment.  
7.6.1.2  CYP2A6 activity test  
CYP2A6 activity will be measured in plasma using the molar metabolic ratio of trans -3’-
hydroxycotinine to cotinine  [22]. CYP2A6 activity drives the metabolism of nicotine to 
cotinine and subsequent metabolites.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.6.2  Sample Handling, Storage, and Ship ment  
All blood and urine samples will be tested at a central laboratory. The  urine preg nancy tests  
and cotinine dipstick  tests will be done by personnel at the study sites.  
Detailed procedures for collection and handling of samples are described in a separate 
Investigator Laboratory  Manual (ILM). Safety laboratory samples will be destroyed as per the 
laboratory’s standard procedures . All primary and back -up samples for the as sessments of 
clinical risk endpoints  and BoExp  (except bio -banking samples)  of discontinued subjects  will 
be destroyed after all bioanalytical report s have been finalized  or the database has been locked , 
whichever comes last.  Personnel at the facility/ -ies where  samples are stored will be informed 
in writing by the Sponsor when destruction of the samples will be allowed.

The bioanalytical lab(s) will be listed in the ILM. 
7.6.3  Blood Samples  
Blood samples will be collected by qualified and trained site personnel.  Subjects should be in 
a seated position during blood collection. The maximal total volume of blood drawn for each 
subject will be around 3 75 mL, which includes about 65 mL for safety and repeated analysis, 
about 50 mL for long -term storage of the bio -bank ing samples for further analysis of BoExp 
and clinical risk endpoints (only if additional consent is given) and 40 mL for long -term storage 
bio-banking samples for further analysis of transcriptomics and lipidomics (only if additional 
consent is given) ( section 7.6.5 ). 
The blood sampling for transcriptomics & lipidomics, and the data related to these samples 
will be anonymized. Anonymized data and samples are initially single or double coded where 
the link between the subjects’ identifiers and the unique c ode(s) is subsequently deleted.  
7.6.4  Urine Samples  
7.6.4.1  Spot Urine Samples   
Spot urine  samples will be used for the urine drug screen, urine cotinine tests, urine pregnancy 
test and safety urin e analysis.  
7.6.4.2  24-hour Urine Collection  
Twenty four -hour urine fraction w ill be collected.  
The day before the visit, s ubject s will start collection of 24 -hour urine  at home . Subjects will 
discard their first void in the morning. The collection period will start immediately after. Aft er 
24-hour ± 1 hour of urine collection , in the morning of the visit, subjects will empty their 
bladder again and this urine will be used as the final portion of the 24 -hour urine sample.  
During the collection period, a ll urine passed must be collected and put into the sampling 
container . No urine m ust be passed into the toilet. The start and the end time of  urine collection 
will be recorded by the subject in a form and checked by the site staff.  The volume of 24 -hour 
urine will be measured by the site staff upon collection of urine containers from t he subjects.  
For assessment of urine BoExp, creatinine, 8 -epi-PGF 2α and 11 -TBX-B2, albumin and sample 
for bio -banking  (if consent received) , aliquots from the 24 -hour urine collection will be taken. 
In the table of assessments , for the 24 -hour urine collection , the dot corresponds to the day on 
which the 24 -hour urine collection period ends.

7.6.5  Bio-banking for Long Term Storage of Blood and Urine  
If a subject gives consent for sample bio -banking for further analysis of BoExp  and clinical 
risk endpoints , additional  samples of urine (from the 24 -hour urine collection) and 
serum/plasma ( 50 mL of blood in total) will be collected as follows:  
 From  the 24-hour urine collections  5 aliquots of 10 mL  urine for each visit . 
 Serum/plasma: at each visit 2 tubes with about 5 mL of blood each will be filled  and 
centrifuged : from one tube , two aliquots of 1 mL  plasma and from the second tube 2 
aliquots of 1 mL  of ser um will be collected and stored . 
If a subject gives consent for sample bio -banking of whole blood /plasma  for further 
transcripto mics & plasma for lipidomics analysis,  an additional 9 mL of blood wil l be collected 
for each assessment : 5 mL for transcriptomics wi ll be aliquoted in 2 tubes  (2.5 mL of 
blood/tube) ; for lipidomics, the 4 mL of blood will be centrifuged and the plasma aliquoted in 
2 tubes  of 500 l each .  
The samples intended for sample bio-banking will be kept frozen, separate d from the other 
samples collected, and will be shipped to a central storage facility according to the ILM. After 
the final CSR is signed, samples of plasma/serum/blood will be stored for a maxim al period of 
5 years  and samples of urine will be stored for a ma ximal period of 2 years. The blood /plasma  
bio-banking for transcriptomics  and lipidomics  will be stored for a maximum period of 5 years.  
If a subject withdraws his/her consent for sample bio -banking the facility  at which the samples 
are stored will follow their procedures for destruction of banked samples  as stated in  section 
1.3.2 . 
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.7 Other Study Procedures  
7.7.1  Questionnaires  
The subject questionnaires and the cough -VAS used in this study will be entered by the subject 
directly in a subject  reported outcomes (SRO ) device or on paper copy. All subject reported 
outcome data as well as instructions will be provided in the subject’s local language.  The 
questionnaires and the cough -VAS will be reviewed for completeness by the study site staff 
and subjects will be requested to complete any missing information.

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A.  
Symptoms or worsening of symptoms documented on any of the questionnaires or on the VAS 
do not need to be documented as additional AEs because  the questionnaires and the cough -
VAS will be anal yzed as part of the final report. However, it is at the discretion of the 
Investigator  or designee to decide whether to document such symptoms as additional AEs. The 
main source for AE collection will be the face -to-face interview between the subject and the 
study site staff, using open, non -directive questions ( section 8.2). 
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.7.1.1  Prochaska ‘Stage of Change’ Questionnaire: Intention to Quit Smoking  
The Prochaska ’s ‘Stage of Change’ questionnaire will be used to assess the smokers’ ment al 
state for the intention to quit ( Appendix 2  for staging algorithm; [23, 24].There are 5 stages of 
change: 1. Precontemplation , 2. Contemplation . 3. Preparation . 4. Action . 5. Maintenance . In 
the Precontemplation  stage, the individual does not recognize smoking as a problem.  
In the Contemplation  stage, the individual is gathering information about smoking, such as 
contacting a he alth care provide r or a tobacco quit line for information on the effects of 
smoking or smoking cessation consequences . During this stage, the stress and inconvenience 
of quitting smoking is greater than the immediate and possible long -term health effects of 
continu ing smoking. In the Preparation stage , intention and behavior begin to come together 
and the subject is preparing to enter into action in the next 30 days. It is necessary for the 
subject to recognize the benefits of not smoking, before a subject can enter the Action  stage 
and as a result, change s his/her smoking behavior. After six months of not smoking, the 
individual reaches the Maintenance  stage when different skills may be needed to prevent 
relapse from  smoking.   
All subjects who are planning to quit smoking within the next 30 days will be eligible for the 
study regardless of having one day of quit attempt over the past year.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.7.1.2  Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (revised version)  
Potential nicotine dependence will be assessed via a questionnaire using the Fagerström test 
for nicotine dependence (FTND) in its revised version  [25]. 
The questionnaire consists of six questions which will be answered by the subject 
himself/herself. The scores obtained o n the test allow the classification of nicotine dependence 
in three  different  levels: mild (0 -3 points), moderate (4 -6 points), and severe ( 7-10 points ). 
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.

7.7.1.3  Assessment of Cough -VAS 
Subjects will be asked to assess the respiratory symptom ‘cough’ on a VAS, on three Likert 
scales, and with an open question. Assessm ent of cough will be con ducted irrespective of the 
time. 
Subjects will be asked if they have experienced a regular need to cough, e.g., whether they 
have coughed several times in the previous 24 hours prior to assessment. If the answer is ‘yes’, 
subjects w ill be asked to complete a VAS, 3 Likert scales  and to answer the open question.  
On the VAS, subjects will assess how bothersome their cough was during the previous 24  
hours. The VAS ranges from ‘not bothering me at all’ to ‘extremely bothersome.’  
Furtherm ore, subjects will assess the intensity and frequency of cough and the amount of 
sputum production during the previous 24 hours on Likert scales.  
The intensity of cough will be assessed on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1  = 
very mild – 2 = mild – 3 = moderate – 4 = severe – 5 = very severe.  
The frequency of cough will be assessed on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 
1 = rarely – 2 = sometimes – 3 = fairly often – 4 = often – 5 = almost always.  
The amount of sputum production  will be assessed on a 4 -point Likert scale ranging from 0  to 
3, with 0 = no sputum – 1 = a moderate amount of sputum – 2 = a larger amount of sputum – 
3 = a very large amount of sputum.  
Finally, subjects will be asked to share any other important observat ions with the staff about 
their coughing.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.7.1.4  Socio -Economic Status  
The SES information will be  collected  in the following countries: US, UK, Poland , Germany  
and Japan.  
As part of the characterization of the study population it is important to measure variables that 
have been shown to be related to nicotine dependence and  tobacco  product reinforcing value. 
Based on prior tobacco research these factors include age, gender, ethnicity, tobacco use 
history, educational as well as socio -economic status.  
SES information is recorded in similar manner in the clinical program, in behavioral research 
and will be eventua lly assessed in post-market ing studies. In order to evaluate factors affecting 
the success for a 12 -month S C, the socio -economic status constitutes an important 
demographic parameter . Socio -economic status  data will be reported across the randomized

clinic al studies and will be collected in observational pre - and post -market ing studies. At V1 
the subjects will be informed in detail s about the exams and evaluations planned during the 
study, and similarly notified about the SES assessment s which will be done at V2 . After having  
provided informed consent at V1, the subjects will be enrolled in the study.  
Subjects will be asked a series of questions related to their education, occupational status, size 
and annual income of their household. These data will be use d to create a measure for SES that 
categorizes subjects into low, moderate and high SES [26]. If the subject does not want to 
answer the questionnaire, he/she will not be withdrawn from the study.  
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.  
7.7.1.5  Lifestyle Assessment  
Subjects will be asked questions to capture baseline covariates such as diet, alcohol intake, 
sleep deficit, exercise and exposure to pa ssive smoking . 
See Appendix 1  for the timepoints of assessment.

8 ADVERSE EVENT S 
8.1 Definition s 
8.1.1  Adverse Events  
Since no investigational products will be used in this study, any health -related event occurring 
during  the study will be reported.  
For the purpose of this study an AE is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence that may 
present itself during the conduct  of a study and which may or may not have a causal 
relationship with the study procedures. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease.  
8.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A SAE is defined as , but is not limited to, any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 Results in death  
 Is life -threatening  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  
 Is a congenita l anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE , when, based on appropriate medical judgment, an 
SAE may jeopardize the subject or the subject may requir e medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definitions.  
Any pre -planned hospitalizations that are known at the time of signing the ICF will not be 
recorded as an SAE; however they will be recorded as  AE only. Any AE that occurs during 
this pre -planned hospitalization will be considered according to the above definitions.  
8.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
The Investigator  or designee is respo nsible for obtaining, assessing  and documenting all AEs 
during the study.

Confidentiality Statement  
Data and information contained in this document are considered to constitute trade secrets and confidential 
commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A.  
8.2.1  Collection of Information  
Adverse event information will be collected from the time of signature of the ICF onwards 
until EOS either by the Investigator  or designee via spontaneous reporting or by the use of 
consistent, open, non -directive questions from s tudy site staff ( e.g., “Have you had any health 
problems since the previous visit/How are you feeling since you were last asked?”). The main 
source for AE collection will be face -to-face interview(s) with the subject.  
Information recorded will include: ver batim description of the AE, start and stop dates and 
times, seriousness, severity (intensity), action taken ( e.g., whether or not the AE led to the 
subject’s withdrawal from the study), and outcome ( e.g., resolved, withdrawal due to AE).  
For each AE, the intensity will be graded on a 3 -point intensity scale (mild, moderate, severe) 
using the definitions provided in section  8.2.3 . 
Any exacerbation/worsening or increased frequency of an AE or pre -existing condition shall 
be evaluated and recorded.  
Correct medical terminology/concepts are preferred when recording AE terms, and 
abbreviations must be avoided. Wherever possible, a diagnosis is to be used to describe an AE 
as a diagnosed medical condition rather than individual signs and symptoms ( e.g., record 
‘pneumonia’ rather than ‘fever’, ‘cough’, ‘pulmonary infiltrate’ or ‘septicemia’ rather than 
‘fever’ and ‘hypotension’ following blood sample).  
Any AE that meets the serious ness criteria must be recorded both on the AE report form of the 
CRF  and on a separate SAE report form ( section 8.2.3 ). 
8.2.2  Perio d of Collection  
From the time of signature of the ICF onwards until EOS, all AEs (includes SAEs) will be 
collected by the study site staff as described below.  
8.2.2.1  Screening Period  
All existing health conditions identified during the Screening Period will be recorded as 
concomitant disease and the subject’s eligibility for Baseline to the study will be reviewed. 
Any AEs which occur during the Screening Period will be captured by the study site staff and 
assessed by the Investigator  or designee in order to esta blish relationship or relatedness in 
respect to study procedures. All collected  AEs will be reported in the CSR and  will be  in 
accordance with the respective regulatory guidelines.

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A.  
8.2.2.2  From Enrolment until the End of the Study  
Any new, clinically relevant, a bnormal finding detected during the study or worsening of a 
pre-existing condition/concomitant disease will be documented as an AE and/or SAE . 
All ongoing AE s at the EOS  will not be followed -up by the I nvestigator or designee . At the 
discretion of t he Investigator , the subject will be refer red to his /her General Practitioner  for 
follow up on ongoing AEs  (section 8.3). 
8.2.3  Intensity of Adverse Event  
For each AE, the i ntensity will be evaluated  by the Investigator  or designee on a 3 -point 
intensity scale (mild, moderate, severe) using the following definitions:  
Mild :    The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily activity.  
Moderate :  The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still able to function.  
Severe :   The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.  
Change in severity (intensity) needs to be documented.  
8.2.4  Relationship to Study Procedures  
In general, all AEs and/or SAEs wi ll be assessed by the Investigator  or designee as either 
‘related’ or ‘not.  
Not related : The temporal relations hip of the clinical event to study procedures  makes a 
causal relationship unlikely, or, concomitant medication, therapeutic interventions, or 
underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Related : The temporal relationship o f the clinical event to study procedures  makes a causal 
relationship possible, and concomitant medication, therapeutic interventions, or underl ying 
conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
Any SAEs reported or observed during the study after signature of the ICF until EOS, whether 
or not attributable to any medication or to any  study procedures must be reported by the  
Investigator  or other study site staff within 24 hours after first awareness by any party 
involved in the study  to United BioSource Corporation (UBC) Safety and to the Sponsor.  
An SAE report form must be faxed or e -mailed as an attachment to:

The Investigator or designee is responsible for local reporting ( e.g., to the IRB/IEC) of SAEs 
that occur during the study, according to local regulations.  
Any SAE will be reported to the competent authorities by the Sponsor as per local 
requirements.  
Any additional/follow-up information that becomes available after the initial SAE report form 
has been completed will be forwarded to UBC Safety and the Sponsor within 24 hours after 
first awareness by any person at the site using a follow-up to the existing SAE report form. 
The follow-up SAE report form must include the minimum information required as described 
in the safety management plan for form completion and only modified or new information 
needs to be specified. Information provided in the follow-up SAE report form supersedes any 
information that was initially reported. 
All SAEs will be followed up by the Investigator or designee and/or UBC Safety until their 
resolution or until the Investigator or designee considers the event to be stabilized ( i.e., no 
worsening of condition), or until an acceptable explanation has been found ( e.g., a chronic 
condition). 
The SAE report form to be used in this study is provided as a separate document and included 
in the study master file. All SAEs will be recorded, in addition to the SAE report form.

8.4 Reporting of Other Events Critical t o Safety Evaluations  
8.4.1  Abnormal Results of Laboratory Tests  
Any clinical safety laboratory test result that is outside of the normal reference range will be 
reviewed by the Investigator  or designee and assessed for clinical relevance. If an abnormal 
laborato ry result is detected after Screening  and considered clinically relevant (see below) , this 
should be recorded as  an AE. 
The grading scheme shown in Appendix 6  [27] will be used by the Investigator  or designee to 
assess abnormal laboratory AEs as follows:  
 All Grade 1 abnormal laboratory values will be evaluated by the  Investigator  or designee 
with respect to baseline value and clinical relevance. If considered to be cl inically relevant 
the Investigator  or designee must report it as an AE. All Grade 2 and higher abnormal 
laboratory values must be reported as , or linked to , an AE/concomitant disease.  
 If a subject has Grade 2 and higher abnormal laboratory values at V1 it is at the discretion 
of the  Investigator  or designee to enroll the subject or not. This decision must be 
documented in the source document  and captured in the CRF . A grade 2 and higher 
laboratory abnormal value at V1 must be recorded as concomitant disease.  
 If there is any worsening in grade from Grade 2 and above during the study the Investigator  
or designee must report this worsening as an AE.  
 Where there is no grading available, the abnormal laboratory value will be evaluated by 
the Investigator  or designee and assessed for clinical relevance. If considered to be 
clinically relevant, the  Investigator  will report it as an AE.  
 Any other abnormal clinical laboratory result (including those that are not part of the core 
safety assessments) can, at the discretion of the Investigator  or designee, be reviewed and 
assessed. Even if they do not meet the criteria of the CTCAE grading scheme (please see 
above), the Investigator  or designee may consider them to be of clinical relevance and, if 
they are, must re port them as AEs.  
 In general, laboratory values will be recorded as ‘increased <lab parameter>’ or ‘decreased 
<lab parameter>’ to ensure consistency of recording/coding.  
All other information ( e.g., intensity, seriousness, outcome) will be assessed as for other AEs.

8.5 Reporting and Follow -Up of Pregnancies  
All subjects who are diagnosed as pregnant after enrolment (V2) will be discontinued from the 
study . Smoking cessation counseling  will be provided  to those  subjects  who are still abstinent 
from smoking and will be referred to the respective health care facility/health care provider  for 
further support . In case a subject has relapsed to smoking and is diagnosed as pregnant, advice 
on the risk of smoking and smoking cessation advice will be provided and subjec ts will be 
referred to the respective health care facility/health care provider for further support.  
Pregnancy Forms will be filled but no follow -up on pregnancy outcome will be performed.  
The Investigator  or designee is responsible for informing the IRB /IEC of any pregnancy that 
occurs during the study and its outcome, according to local regulations.  
8.6 Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation  
Subjects who are discontinued from the study because of an AE , will undergo the early 
termination procedures as described in section 9.67 as soon as possible. The Investigator  or 
designee and/or UBC Safety will follow up these AEs until they have  been resolved, stabilized 
(i.e., no worsening of condition), or until an acceptable explanation has been found.

9 STUDY ACTIVITIES  
A detailed schedule of assessment s can be found in Appendix 1 .  
In general, if no start time for the procedures is provided, the procedure can be performed at 
any time during the day , but should be done at the similar or comparable time for each visit . 
For the details on the procedures, see the related section s. 
9.1 Screening Visit (V1) 
The Screening (V1)  will be performed within 6 weeks ( 1 to 42 days) prior to V2. First, the ICF 
along with study information should be given to the subject. When/if the ICF is  signed,  dated 
and timed,  the other screening procedures can be performed in the order deemed most practical. 
While it is recommended to complete as many  screening procedures as possible in one day, it 
is permissible to complete those over more than one da y. Smoking is allowed during screening.   
Table 3 shows the procedures for V1. The sequence of assessments/events is given just for 
illustrative purpos es. It will be at the discretion of the site after signature of the ICF.

no worsening of the event), or a plausible explanation for the event has been found until the 
end of the Safety Follow -Up Period.  
At the end of th e Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56 (V18 (±3 days) ), the investigator will 
attempt to contact only the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone to check if all 
AEs/SAEs potentially occurring during the Safety Follow -Up period are fully reported a nd for 
self-reporting by the subject on continuous smoking abstinence. At the end of the Safety 
Follow -Up Period, all ongoing AEs will be documented as “ongoing” and will not be followed -
up by the Investigator. At the discretion of the Investigator, the su bject will be referred to 
his/her General Practitioner for follow up on ongoing AEs.  
If the investigator can reach the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone at the 
end of the Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56, the date of this phone call with the subject 
will be recorded as the date of the end of the study of the subject.  
If the investigator cannot reach the subject who has previously completed V17 by phone at the 
end of the Safety Follow -Up Period in Week 56 after a reasonable number of attem pts, the date 
of the last contact (e.g., last visit of the subject, last phone call with the subject) will be recorded 
as the date of the end of the study of the subject.

responsible for the monitoring of the study. Monitoring will be performed according to  the 
CRO’s SOPs and as per the agreed monitoring plan with the Sponsor.  
The Investigator  or designee shall permit the Monitor to review study data as frequently as 
considered necessa ry to ensure that data are being recorded in an adequate manner and that 
protocol adherence is satisfactor ily met. 
The Investigator  or designee shall access medical records for the Monitor in order that entries 
in the CRF s may be verified. The Investigator  or designee , as part of his/her  responsibilities, 
is expected to ensure that the study adheres to GCP requirements.  
An Investigator’s meeting will be held prior to the site initiation visit. During this meeting, the 
general training of the study procedure s and specific training on selected procedures will be 
done and documented.  
Subsequent to the Investigator’s meeting, and before the first subject is screened and included 
in the study, a site initiation visit will be conducted by the Monitor and, if neces sary, with the 
Sponsor or its authorized representative. The purpose of the site initiation visit is described in 
the monitoring plan.  
During the study, the Monitor will have regular contact with the study site, including interim 
monitoring visits. The pur pose of these visits is described in the monitoring plan.  
Communication by telephone, mail  and e -mail may be used as needed to supplement site visits. 
The Investigator  and study personnel will cooperate with the Monitor, provid e all appropriate 
documentati on and will be available to discuss the study.  
The Monitor and the Sponsor’s personnel will be available between visits , should the 
Investigator  or other staff at the sites need information and /or advice.  
Site visits will be made at regular intervals durin g the study. The frequency of the monitoring 
visits will be defined in the monitoring plan agreed with the Sponsor.  
The Investigator , or a designated member of the Investigator ’s staff, must be available during 
the monitoring visit to review t he data and r esolve any queries  and to allow direct access to the 
subject’s records for source data verification.

11 DATA MANAGEMENT ACTI VITIES  
All data management activiti es will be described in detail s in the Data Management Plan  
(DMP)  and documents specified therein.  The electronic systems used, CRF  and SRO , to collect 
subject data will be FDA 21 CFR Part 11 compliant.  
11.1 Data Capture  
11.1.1  Case Report Forms and Study Records  
With  the exception of the SRO  data, all results from the clinical assessments will be recorded 
in the source data file by the  Investigator  or his authorized designee (s), and then captured in 
the CRFs  at the study site. Trained study personnel will be responsible for capturing the data 
from the observations, tests and assessments, specified in the protocol, in the source documents  
and transferring the data to the CRF according to the CRF Completion Gui delines.  
The Investigator or designee  has the ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of 
all data relat ed to the clinical study and ensuring that the data are accurate, authentic/original, 
legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and av ailable when required. The CRF must be 
signed by the Investigator or designee  to attest that the data contained in the CRF are true and 
accurate. Any corrections made to source documents and/or CRFs must be recorded, without 
obscuring the original values , and must be accompanied by the date of change, reason for 
change and identification of the person making the change. The CRF data will be verified 
against the source documents at the study site by the Monitor . Instances of missing or unclear 
data will be d iscussed with the Investigator or designee  for resolution. All SRO questionnaires  
will be provided to the subject in his/her  local language . 
11.1.2  Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations are defined as deviations from the study  procedure s as defined in this 
docu ment, including but not limited to any violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
assessments not performed or performed outside the scheduled time windows, or use of drugs 
that are known to affect study endpoints . 
All protocol deviations will be entered i nto the clinical trial management system (CTMS) or 
other approved format.  
Information from the source document s will represent the primary source of protocol 
deviations. Information following site monitoring and other manual reviews will be 
documented in t he site visit reports, follow -up letters, audit documentation, or other manual

12 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
12.1 General Consid erations  
Full details of the statistical analysis will be given in a SAP. Any changes to the planned 
statistical methods will be documented in the clinical study report. The statistical evaluation 
will be performed using SAS®, version 9.2 or later.   
The data from this study could be used for the purpose of providing data for the design and 
interpretation of assessment studies of PMI candidate modified risk tobacco products.  
12.1.1  Stratification Criteria  
For the analysis of the study endpoints, the following  stratification criteria will be used:  
1. Sex (male; female)  
2. Region ( US, EU, JP)  
12.1.2  Definitions for Statistical Data Analysis  
Baseline:  
Unless specified, baseline is defined as the last available time  point prior to TQD . 
12.1.3  Descri ptive Statistics  
All data will be presented in listings, ordered by region, study center, and subject, unless 
otherwise specified.  
In general, summary statistics will be stratified by region  and sex at Baseline.  
Descriptive statistics (number of subjects [n], number and percent of subjects  with missing 
data, the arithmetic mean, arithmetic standard deviation (SD), median, first and third quartiles, 
minimum and maximum for continuous data, including geometric mean and coefficient of 
variation (CV) for data analyzed in the log scale; frequenc y counts and percentages for 
categorical data) will be presented overall and at each time point, where applicable.  
Apart from FEV 1, WBC,  HbA1c, LDL -C, Apo A1, Apo B and HDL -C, for other clinical risk 
endpoints  and BoExp, the geometric mean and CV will be p resented in addition to the 
(arithmetic) mean and SD.  Absolute and percent change from Baseline will be summarized for 
endpoints analyzed in the real and logarithmic scale, respectively.  
Descriptive statistics of endpoint parameters will be presented at each assessment time  point.

without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A.  
12.1.4  Handling of Missing Values and of Values outside the Detection Limits  
Descriptive summaries will be provided for the evaluable data with no imputation.  
Missing values for the endpoints analyzed via the mixed model method will no t be directly 
imputed as they are handled within the analysis itself.  
Values below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be imputed using 0.5 x LLOQ. 
For values above the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ), the ULOQ will be used for 
calculation and reporting in summary tables. The number of values below LLOQ or above 
ULOQ will be presented in each summary table. If 50% or more data are below LLOQ or 
above ULOQ, only the number (%) of value below LLOQ or above ULOQ will be reported in 
the summarie s, together with minimum (if no value below LLOQ is present) and maximum (if 
no value above ULOQ are present) of the observed values.  
For questionnaire data, total scores and domain or subscale scores may use a certain degree of 
imputation by averaging acr oss individual item scores.  
Further details will  be provided in the SAP.  
12.1.5  Significance Level for Inferential Analysis  
This study has no formal pre -specified hypotheses associated with the study objectives. 
However, 95% CI will accompany all effect estimates .  
12.2 Determination of Sample Size and Power Consideration  
Enrolmen t is planned for approximately 950 adults with at least 2 weeks of abstinence after 
the AQD . Unsuccessful quitters  will be discontinued  from the study.  Subjects who 
discontinued the study after V5 will not be replaced.  
Since no formal hypotheses have been formulated for the objectives, sample size calculations 
are based on precision of effect estimates for FEV 1. Other endpoints are assumed to exhibit a 
larger  effect size than FEV 1 and thus would result in smaller sample size estimates.  The sample 
size of this study is based on our current understanding of the effect and variability of SC from 
the results of the Lung Health Study [1] in the subjec t intending to quit smoking at B aseline , 
since no data on the attrition rate at 12 months after 2 weeks of smoking cessation are available.  
In particular, a pproximately  190 subjects are needed to estimate the mean increase  from 
Baseline  of 1.98 [% pred.]  [1] in FEV 14 at V17, with a 90% probability of obtaining a margin 
                                                 
4 Sample size calculations are driven by  FEV 1. Other endpoints are assumed to exhibit a larger  effect size than 
FEV 1 and thus would result in smaller sample size estimates.

of error (95% CI) of at most ±1 [% pred.]. The anticipated SD of the change from Baseline  of 
6.4 [% pred.] was estimated  using the  results of the Lung Health Study [1] and includes an 
inflat ion of  10% in order to account for additional sources of variability, including the multi -
national nature of the study. As the analysis will only be conducted in successful quitters, this 
sample size was  increased to 950, to account for a predicted continuous absti nence rate  of 20% 
expected at week 52 for continuous quitters after 2 weeks from AQD. This is based on an 
assumed increase of 5% from the 15% abstinence rate at week 52 expected for subjects at 
enrolment  [2]. Sample size calculations are conducted using SAS® version 9.2 for the 95% CI 
of the mean differences between paired observations (proc power onesamplemeans ) [28]. The 
SAS® implementation of the method published by Beal [29] is adopted to esti mate the 
probability of obtaining at most the target 95% CI of ±  1 [% pred.].  
The overall enrolment and attrition rate will be monitored during the recruitment phase of the 
study  and sample size may be adapted to ensure at least 1 90 successful quitters complete  V17.  
12.3 Analysis Populations  
Descriptive summaries will be produced and analyse s will be conducted in enrolled subjects 
who continuously abstaine d from smoking (quitters) for at least 13  weeks ( V8), with no major 
protocol deviation s which impact dat a evaluability (to be defined in the SAP) . In enrolled 
subjects failing to continuously abstain from smoking after V8, only endpoint data assessed 
prior to  the date of relapse will be included in the analysis .  
Descriptive summaries and analysis will also be conducted in the subgroup of subjects who 
completed the 1 -year continuous SC (completers).

commercial information, and the legal protections provided to such trade secrets and confidential information are 
hereby claimed under the provisions of applicable law. No part of this document may be publicly disclosed 
without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A.  
12.5.2  Baseline Comparability  
Study endpoints at baseline will be summarized as reported in section 12.1.3  for the quitters in 
the analysis population and in the subgroup of completers . There wi ll be no formal comparison 
of endpoint values a t Baseline, that is, no statistical hypothesis testing  will be performed . 
12.5.3  Descriptive Summary  
Study endpoints across time will be summarized by study visit as reported in section 12.1.3  for 
the analysis population and in the subgroup of completers . Summary statistics of endpoints 
will also include the mean change from Baseline, together with 95% CI.  A similar approach 
will be used to analyze the relative change from Baseline for those BoExp having at least 50% 
of the measured values above the limit of quantification ( LOQ ).  
12.5.4  Exploratory Analysis: Random Coefficient Modeling  
For clinical risk endpoints associated with CVD , respiratory diseases, airway inflammation, 
genotoxicity  and xenobiotics , the pattern and form of the endpoint change over time will be 
modeled using random  measurement effects models  in the analysis population and in the 
subgroup of completers . Sex, cigare tte consumption at Baseline , age, region, and other 
Baseline variables will be considered for inclusion in the m odel.  A backward elimination 
procedure will be used to identify independent predictors of risk markers (to be defined in the 
SAP) . Goodness of f it will be evaluated by the analysis of residuals (model diagnostics) and 
by comparing the values predicted versus the observed parameter changes (calibration). Least 
square estimates of the effect of variables included in the model will be reported togeth er with 
the 95% CI. 
12.5.5  Confirmatory Analyses  
No confirmatory analysis is foreseen in this study although data will be used to evaluate the 
effect of SC for benchmarking purposes in the context of PMI products assessment programs. 
The details of the methods us ed to evaluate the reference effect of SC for specific endpoints 
and population characteristics will be provided in separate analysis plans, and results will be 
reported separately.  
12.6 Safety Endpoint(s)  
In general, all safety data will be listed by region  for the overall screened population, and 
tabulated by region for the enrolled population using the approach described in section 12.1.3 .

Safety summaries will also be produced for overall , and by region from V2 to V1 8 for the 
enrolled population.  
Adverse event data will serve as the primary assessment of safety. Other safety variables 
monitored in this study include: vital signs (systolic a nd diastolic blood pressure , pulse rate, 
respiratory rate),  ECG data,  clinical c hemistry , hematology, concomitant medications, and 
urine analysis safety panel,  physical examination.  
The number and percentage of subjects with AEs and SAEs will be tabulated by Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA)  system organ class and preferred term . 
Summaries will also be presented for AEs leading to withdrawal, AEs leading to death, AEs 
by severity, and laboratory AEs. Tabulations will be performed for bot h the number of subjects 
experiencing an event and the number of events.  
Descriptive statistics will be summarized for laboratory parameters, ECG, respiratory 
symptoms, and vital signs. The number and percentage of subjects with clinical findings  will 
be summarized  and s hift tables showing change from Baseline of clinical findings will be 
provided for: ECGs, physical examinations and laboratory parameters (both shifts in normal 
ranges and toxicity grades).   
12.7 Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analysis of the  data is foreseen.  Data m onitoring will be performed 
according to CRO 's SOPs and as per the agreed monitoring plan with PMI.   
Interim data sets will be extracted for the purpose of providing data for the design  and 
interpreta tion of assessment studies of PMI candidate MRTPs . For this purpose, the analysis 
methods are detailed in a separate SAP.

All information obtained during the conduct of the study with respect to the subject s' state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. A statement to this effect will be written in the 
information provided to the subject. An agreement to disclose any such information will be 
obtained from the subject in writing and signed by the subject , in compliance with all local and 
national data protection and privacy legislation.  
The name of the subjects participating in this study will be kept confidential . Subjects will be 
identifiable by the Sponsor (or Sponsor’s authorized representative) on CRFs and other 
documents by their subject (or randomization) number/code, sex and age, but not by name, 
initial, or any other details relating to identifiable person ( e.g., address, social security nu mber, 
medical chart number, etc.). The assignment of a sub ject number/code for subject identification 
will be based on the appropriate data protection rules.   
The blood samples for transcriptomics & lipidomics , and the data related to these samples will 
be anonymized. Anonymized data and samples are initially single or double coded where the 
link between the subjects’ identifiers and the unique code(s) is subsequently deleted. This is 
applicable for the blood bio -banking for transcriptomics & lipidomics only.  
Any documents that allow full identification of the subject ( e.g., the subject’s signed ICF) must 
be maintained in confidence by the Investigator . If any document relating to this study shows 
a subject’s name or any other details relating to an identifiable person ( e.g., address, social 
security nu mber, medical chart number, etc. ), the name or other identifiable details must be 
obscured before a copy of that document is supplied to the Sponsor or the Sponsor’s aut horized 
representative.

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 4 (131)Synopsis -Statistical methods and sections 8.1, 9.3: Statist ical Considerat ions and End of 
Study  Timelines were revised based on the results of the FLAURA study .
Sections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 were updated to include the results of the FLAURA study  and the 
latest results from the safet y data cut -off. The reference to Soria et al 2018 was added.
Figure 1 was amended to include the who le blood sample taken at progression.
Sections 3.1 and 3.2:
Inclusio n #2: was modified to reflect the specificity o f country  regulat ion for legal age.
Inclusio n #5: was modified fo llowing AstraZeneca commit ment to FDA request to c larify 
the tests to be used to select patients for enrolment in the study .
Inclusio n #6 and Exclusio n criteria #19: were modified to align wit h the FLAURA proto col. 
The part about the CNS metastasis was revised and moved to Exclusion criteria #19.
Section 3.6 : rem oved ‘Corneal ulcerat ion’ to reflect the TAGRISSO Core Data Sheet 
(CDS). Added ‘Grade 3 or higher adverse react ion that does not improve to Grade 0 -2 after 
withhol ding for up to 3 weeks’ to be consistent with Section 6.8.
Table 1, Table 2, Sections 5.2.4, 5.2.6.1, 6.8.4 :
An extensive ophthalmo logical  assessment pri or to the start of treatment with osimertinib is 
no longer requi red according to the CDS. Th e effect of osimert inib on eyes is no longer 
under review and therefore the requirement to collect photographs of any eye effects has 
been remo ved. A general eye examinat ion is performed as part of the Physical Examinat ion.
Assessment of left ventricular f uncti on by  Echocardi ogram  or MUGA is no l onger requi red 
in all pat ients prior to the start of treatment with Osimert inib. Left ventricular funct ion 
assessment i s now only  required in pat ients with pre-exist ing cardiac disease that does not 
meet the criteri a for the study  exclusio n but m ay worsen on treatm ent wi th osimert inib.
Table 2 and Sections 5.3.2, 5.4: the study  design has been changed to allow real time 
analysis of the tissue and blood sample taken at the time of progression on osimertinib. An 
additional whole blood sam ple is requi red. The analysis will use a Next Generation 
Sequencing (NGS) panel to ident ify the mechanism o f resistance to first -line osimert inib. 
The results of these tests will be provided to the sites to inform the cho ice of treatmen t after 
osimert inib.
Section 4.3.1 : following phrase “ Patients will be followed for the earlier of first subsequent 
anticancer treatment (including surgical) after discontinuing osimert inib or death” removed 
as it is m ore appropri ate in Sect ion 4.3.2 where it is already menti oned.

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 6 (131)inclusio n criterion relating to coagulation (and warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate) was 
originally included based on in vitro results in human hepatocy tes which showed a potential 
for increasing the messenger ri bonucleic acid (mRNA) of cy tochrom e P450 (CYP) 3A 
enzymes via pregnane X receptor (PXR) induction. Therefore, all pathways that depend on 
PXR (including CYP2C9) were thought to have potential for induct ion with a resul tant 
impact on warfarin. However, a cl inical study  with the CYP3A substrate simvastatin 
(Reference Study  14) showed no potenti al interact ion and induct ion was also minimal. 
Similarly, another PXR substrate (Pgp study; Reference Study 36) also showed minimal 
induct ion. Other PXR substrates, inc luding CYP2C, are unlikely  to have an interacti on and 
therefore this inclusio n criterion is not required.
Sections 3.1 and 5.3.1: inclusio n criterion 7 and mandatory  tissue co llection details below 
were am ended to further define the requirements of suffici ent tissue samples for this study .

primary  tumour or m etastati c tum our ti ssue, wi thin the 60 day s prior to study  entry  and at or 
after RECIST 1.1-defined progre ssion. An archival biopsy is acceptable as lo ng as there has 
been no intervening anticancer treatment since the time the biopsy was obtained to 
enrolment in this clinical study and as long as it was within 60 days o f study  entry . For 
patients who meet the except ion to exclusio n criterion #11 (Secti on 3.2), a fresh tissue 
biopsy must be obtained after the completion o f chem otherapy  and before osimertinib 
treatm ent.A sufficient tissue sample would consist of formalin -fixed, 
paraffin -embedded tumour tissue blocks, or at least 15 re- cut unstained sections from 
formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tumour tissue block, presented on slides. Each 
section should be 5 μm thick.
The Investigator will be asked to provide formalin -fixed, paraffin- embedded tumour tissue 
blocks, or a minimum o f 10, but when available, at least 15 re -cut unstained sections fro m 
formalin-fixed paraffin -embedded tum our ti ssue block, presented on slides. Each sect ion is 
to be 5 μm thick.
Section 3.2: exclusio n criterion 11 was updated as patients who have had prior 
chemotherapy will no longer be allowed to participate in this study : 11. Patients who have 
received previ ous treatm ent for metastati c or stage IV disease *
* Prior chem otherapy  may affect the resistance profile under study; however, patients who 
have received prior chemotherapy  may be permitted if the patients have not received more 
than 4 cy cles of firs tline chemotherapy wit h a limit of 20% of the total enrolment. The site 
must get Sponsor approval before consent ing patients who have received prior 
chemotherapy (Section 3.3).
Subsequently, references to the except ion rem oved from  excl usion criterion 11 above have 
been remo ved throughout the protocol (previously included in Sect ions 3.1, 3.3, 4.1 
and5.3.1).

Approximately  150 patients with epidermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation -positive 
locally advanced or metastatic non -small cell lu ng cancer will be recruited from mult iple 
centres globally .
Phase of development II
Study design
This is a phase II, open -label, single -arm tissue and plasma acquisit ion study  assessing the 
efficacy , safety and underlying resistance mechanisms of osimerti nib (80 m g orally , once 
daily) as first -line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR 
mutati on-positive non -small cell lung cancer who are EGFR ty rosine kinase inhibitor 
treatm ent-naïve and eligible for first -line treatment.
It has been determined that approximately  150 patients need to be recruited to fulfil the 
objectives of the study. EGFR mutation status should be determined based on a tumour biopsy 
or plasma sample by a local laboratory  certified by Clinical Laboratory  Improveme nt 
Amendments (United States of America [USA] sites) or an accredited local laboratory  (sites 
outsi de of  the USA).

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 29 (131 )Duration of treatment
Treatment with osimertinib 80 mg once daily will comm ence f ollowing enro lment. A cycle of 
treatm ent is defined as 28 days of once daily treatment with osimert inib (Cycle 1 to Cycle 6 
inclusive). From Cycle 7 to 3.5 y ears (Day  1277), a cy cle is defined as a 56 -day treatm ent 
period. From  3.5 y ears to di sease p rogressi on, a cycl e is defined as a 70 -day treatm ent peri od. 
Patients m ay continue to receive osimertinib as long as they  are continuing to show clinical 
benefit, as judged by the Invest igator, and in the absence of discont inuat ion criteria.
Investigational product , dosage and mode of administration
Osimert inib is an oral , potent, sel ective, irreversible inhibitor of both EGFR ty rosine kinase 
inhibitor sensit ising and resistance mutations in non- small  cell lung cancer wi th a significant 
select ivity margin o ver wild t ype EGFR. Osimert inib (80 mg orally, once daily) will be 
administered. Doses may be reduced to 40 mg if needed for the management of toxicit y.
Statistical methods
The final analysis will be performed at study  end (see Secti on 9.3 for definit ion of “end of 
study”), and when approximately 50 patients have evaluable paired biopsies upon progression. 
Assuming a 70% rate of patients having a biopsy at both baseline and progression, and wit h an 
assumed technical failure rate of 30% of the samples (assum e an overall failure rate of 51%), 
then we should expect approximately 50 evaluable pai red bi opsies to be available when 
approximately  103 o f the 150 patients have progressed, which would be expected to occur 
approximately  38months after the first patient is enro lled. This calculat ion assumes pat ients 
are recruited over 12 months, exponent ially distributed progressi on times wi th a 19 -month 
median and a 2- piece recrui tment function that assumes an exponent ially distributed 
recrui tment rate.
This is an explo ratory  study  which m ay inform  other studi es in the osimert inib development 
programme and therefore earlier interim analyses may be performed, such interim analyses 
may not be reported in a formal clinical study  report (CSR) .
Recrui tment of  150 patients is appropri ate to characterise the frequency o f tumour geneti c and 
proteomic markers at disease progression regardless of their prevalence. The following table 
displays the precisio n of the est imated proportion, for example, when 50 evaluable paired 
biopsies are available.

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 40 (131 )1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and Rationale for Conducting This Study
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
Epiderm al growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibit ion is the standard of care (SoC) for locally 
advanced or metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with EGFR -activating 
mutati ons. In approximately 50 to 60% of patients, resistance to EGFR ty rosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) agents develops by acquiring a T790M mutation (amino acid subst itution at 
position 790 in EGFR, from a threonine to a methionine) ( Cross et al 2014, Kuiper et al 2014 , 
Li et al  2014 , Oxnard et al 2011 , Yu et al 2013).
Multiple clinical tri als in pat ients with an activating mutation of the EGFR gene have 
compared different first - or second -generation oral EGFR TKIs. Several studies have 
consistent ly demonstrated that EGFR TKIs (gefit inib, erlotinib, and afatinib) produce higher 
response rates (RRs), longer progression -free survival (PFS), and improve qualit y of life 
compared wi th standard pl atinum -based doublet chemotherapy  in pat ients with good 
perform ance status (Grade 0 -2) whose tumour harbours an acti vating (sensit ising) EGFR 
mutati on. RRs and m edian PFS intervals for gefit inib, erlotinib, and afat inib are 55% to 74% 
and 9 to 10 months, 58% to 83% and 9 to 13 months, and 58% to 61% and 9 to 11 months, 
respectively  (Asami andAtagi2016 ). Based on the resul ts of previ ous prospective studies, 
these EGFR TKIs seem to demonstrate comparable efficacy wit h regard to RR and PFS in 
patients wi th locally adva nced or m etastati c EGFR -mutated NSCLC.
Osimertinib Mechanism of Action
Invest igators should be familiar with the current Investigator Brochure (IB).
Osimert inib (AZD9291, TAGRISSO) is an oral, potent, irreversible EGFR -TKI select ive for 
EGFR -TKI-sensit ising and T790M resistance mutations wit h a significant select ivity margin 
over wild t ype EGFR. As a result, osimert inib can effect ively block EGFR signalling both in 
EGFR single mutant cells wit h activat ing EGFR mutations and in double mutant cells bearing 
both the primary EGFR -activat ing and secondary resistance T790M mutation. Osimert inib is 
currently under invest igation as a treatment option in 1) patients with advanced T790M 
mutati on-positive NSCLC who have previously failed an EGFR TKI; 2) patients with 
advanced EGFR -mutated NSCLC who are treatment -naïve; and 3) in combinat ion with novel 
agents for patients with EGFR TKI -resistant NSCLC.
Osimert inib is approved for:
the adj uvant treatm ent after com plete tum our resecti on in pat ients with NSCLC whose 
tumours have EGFR exon 19 delet ions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.
the first -line treatment of pat ients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose 
tumours have EGFR exon 19 delet ions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.
the treatment of pat ients with locally -advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M mutation -
positive NSCLC whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy .

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 41 (131 )Experience with osimertinib in NSCLC
Clinical experience wit h osimert inib is described in the current version of the IB . Please refer 
to the IB for details o f the clinical programme.
In the phase I/II AURA study  (D5160C00001), osimert inib was administered to patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation -positive (EGFRm+) NSCLC 
(Gil- Bazo andRolfo 2016 ). Promising efficacy results were observed in 127 patients 
evaluable for response among the 138 patients wi th T790M mutation-positive di sease 
confirmed by cent ral testing who were previously treated with an EGFR TKI: object ive 
response rate (ORR) was 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 52% -70%), and disease control 
rate (DCR; complete response + partial response + stable disease) was 95% 
(95% CI, 90% -98%). In the 138 pati ents wi th detectable T790M mutation-positive disease, the 
median PFS based on 30% maturit y of data was 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 -not reached), and 
88% of these patients had an est imated duration of response ( DoR) of 6 months or l onger 
(Jänne et al 2015).
Promising evidence of efficacy has also been observed in pat ients with treatm ent-naïve 
NSCLC treated with osimertinib as the first -line EGFR TKI. Results are available fro m 
2phase I expansio n cohorts in which pat ients received osimert inib as first -line treatment in 
the AURA study  (n = 60; 30 patients on 80 mg per day  and 30 patients on 160 mg per day ). 
The m edian fo llow-up at the data cut- off (DCO ) date of 04 Jan 2016 was 16.6 months. The 
overall RR was 77% (95% CI, 64% -87%), which was amongst the best reported for first -line 
therapy  of EGFR -mutated l ocally  advanced or metastati c NSCLC. The overall DCR was 
98% (95% CI: 89% -100%). The maximum DoR wa s 22.1 months (patient ongoing in 
response at 04 Jan 2016). The median PFS was 19.3 months; data were immature with respect 
to DoR and PFS, but the lower 95% CIs for the median were 12.5 months for DoR and 
13.7 months for PFS. The percentage of patients re maining progression -free at 12 months was 
72% (95% CI: 59% -82%) and 55% (95% CI: 41% -67%) at 18 months. The drug was well 
tolerated wi th few adverse events (AEs), particularly at the approved 80 mg dose, where just 
10% of patients required dose reduction t o manage toxi cities. Ini tial data suggest that patients 
who had disease progression did not have a T790M mutation as the mechanism o f resistance, 
suggest ing that first -line treatment with osimert inib may be beneficially changing the bio logy 
of the di sease.
First -line EGFRm NSCLC
In a phase III study  (FLAURA study; D5160C00007), a total of 673 patients with 
locally -advanced or m etastati c EGFRm NSCLC have been dosed with first -line treatment in 
the FLAURA study  (in both the Gl obal cohort and the China cohort) (Soria et al 2018).
Of the 556 patients rando mised in the Global cohort, 279 received osimert inib 80 mg once 
daily  and 277 received the SoC (gefit inib or erlotinib). At data cut- off 1 (DCO1) 
(12June 2017), the data provided strong evidence for the clinical benefit of osimert inib for the 
first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumours 
have EGFR with Ex19Del or L858R activating mutations, with a median Invest igator -

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 42 (131)assessed PFS of 18.9 months with osimertinib and 10.2 months with SoC, representing an 8.7-
month improvement for osimertinib compared with SoC (p < 0.0001; hazard ratio [HR] 0.46; 
95% CI 0.37, 0.57).
Data from the FLAURA study also confirmed the superior CNS efficacy results in first-line 
setting that have been reported in later lines of therapy with osimertinib. There was a 
statist ically signif icant (p = 0.014) and clinically meaningful improvement in CNS PFS in the 
osimertinib arm compared with the SoC arm based on CNS Blinded Independent Central 
Review (BICR; HR: 0.48 [95% CI: 0.26, 0.86]), indicating a 52% reduction in the risk of CNS 
disease progression or death in the osimertinib arm compared to the SoC arm.
At DCO2 (25 June 2019), final overall survival (OS) analysis in the global study, 
321/556 patients had died ( ). The HR 
for OS was 0.799 (adjusted 95.05% CI: 0.6406, 0.9968), signifying a 20% lower risk of death in the osimertinib arm compared with the SoC arm. The difference between treatment arms in 
favour of osimertinib was statistically significant, as the p-value of 0.0462 was below the 
pre-defined level of 0.0495 required at this analysis. Median OS was 38.6 (95% CI: 34.5, 41.8) months in the os imertinib arm, and 31.8 (95% CI: 26.6, 36.0) months in the SoC arm, a 
difference of 6.8 months. Post-progression outcomes showed a clinically relevant longer time 
from randomisation to TFST or death for patients on osimertinib compared to patients on SoC (HR: 0.478 [95% CI: 0.3927, 0.5810]; 2-sided p < 0.0001). There was also a clinically 
relevant longer time to second subsequent therapy for patients on osimertinib compared to 
patients on SoC (HR: 0.687 [95% CI: 0.5610, 0.8424]; 2-sided p = 0.0003).
Adjuvant EGFRm NSCLC
The effectiveness of osimertinib in the adjuvant setting was investigated in the Phase III 
ADAURA study, which investigated the use of osimertinib versus placebo in patients with stage IB-IIIA NSCLC with a centrally confirmed common EGFRm mutation (Ex19del and/or 
L858R, either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations), who had undergone 
complete tumour resection, with or without postoperative adjuvant platinum-based 
chemotherapy. A total of 682 patients were randomised to treatment, of whom 337 osimertinib 
arm patients and 343 placebo arm patients received  at least 1 dose of study treatment. At the 
DCO of the primary analysis (17 Ja nuary 2020), in patients with stage II-IIIA disease, a 
statist ically si gnificant and clinically meaningful improvement in DFS for patients randomised 
to receive osimertinib versus placebo was observed (HR: 0.17; 99.06% CI: 0.11, 0.26; 
p < 0.0001). A greater proportion of osimertinib arm patients was alive and disease-free at all assessed t imepoints compared wi th those in the placebo arm. At the DCO of the DFS analysis 
(11 April 2022), the DFS HR for HR for patients with stage II-IIIA disease was 0.23 (95% CI: 
0.18, 0.30), demonstrating a clinically meaningful 77% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence or death for patients randomised to os imertinib compared with patients randomised 
to placebo.CCI

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 44 (131)Osimertinib 80 mg, oral, once daily has an acceptable safety profile in patients receiving 
treatment for NSCLC, in both the adjuvant and advanced NSCLC treatment settings. In the 
pivotal osimertinib clinical development programme to date (n = patients), the majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Grade 1 or 2 in severity. The most commonly reported ADRs were diarrhoea (47%) 
and rash (45%), paronychia (33%), dry skin (32%), and stomatitis (24%). Other ADRs 
associated with administration of osimertini b included interstitial lung disease (ILD) or 
ILD-like adverse reactions (eg, pneumonitis), QTc interval prolongation, keratitis, 
haematological effects, erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and aplastic anaemia.
Based on the available clinical trial data, cardiac failure is considered to be an important 
potential risk; however, a causal relationship between changes in cardiac contractility and osimertinib has not been established. In the placebo-controlled ADAURA study, 1.6% (5/312) 
of patients treated with osimertinib and 1.5% (5/331) of patients treated with placebo 
experienced LVEF decreases greater than or equal to 10 percentage points and a drop to less than 50%.
1.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses and Control Groups
Study D5160C00007 A Phase III, Double-Blind Randomised Study to Assess the efficacy and safety of osimertinib versus SoC EGFR TKI as first-line treatment in patients with EGFRm+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (FLAURA) has demonstrated a significant benefit for 
osimertinib vs SoC EGFR TKIs with respect to efficacy endpoints. It is hypothesised that 
osimertinib may deliver this clinical benefit in the first-line setting by preventing the most common type of EGFR TKI resistance observed in NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR TKI 
resistance (T790M-mediated resistance).
This study is an uncontrolled, single-arm study in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
EGFRm+ NSCLC. The study will investigate whether the use of osimertinib as first-line 
therapy will result in favourable efficacy due to delayed T790M-mediated resistance. 
Additionally, while it is known that 50% to 60% of patients receiving first- and second-generation EGFR TKIs first-line will progress on treatment due T790M-mediated 
resistance, the mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib first-line are not well characterised, 
and this study aims to investigate these further.
The primary objective of this study is to examine and compare the tumour molecular profile at 
or after the point of disease progression with  that prior to treatment initiation in patients 
receiving osimertinib as first-line EGFR TKI therapy. To gain a better understanding of resistance mechanisms in patients receiving osimertinib treatment, tumour tissue and plasma 
samples will be examined for tumour genetic and non-genetic aberrations that may be 
important in determining response and resi stance to treatment. Tw o mandatory  tumour 
biopsies will be taken: the first biopsy before initiating osimertinib treatment and the second 
biopsy at any time between Investigator-assessed, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid CCI

Once -daily doses of 20, 40, 80, 160 and 240 mg of osimertinib were evaluated in the dose

pharmacokinet ic, and preliminary efficacy data, 80 mg once daily was selected as the 
recommended phase II dose. Efficacy  of osime rtinib 80 m g as first -line treatment in pat ients 
with EGFRm+ l ocally  advanced or m etastati c NSCLC wi th respect to m PFS has been 
demonstrated in the first analysis o f data from  the FLAURA study . Please refer to the IB for 
additional details. No dosage adj ustment is requi red due to pati ent age, body  weight, gender, 
ethnicit y, or sm oking status. All pat ients will receive 80 mg once daily in this study . If 
patients continue to show clinical benefit to treatment as judged by the Investigator, patients 
may cont inue to receive osimertinib bey ond RECIST 1.1 -defined progression. Therefore, 
there is no maximum durat ion of treatment.
1.3 Benefit/Risk and Ethical Assessment
Please see the current edit ion of the IB (Sections 5.2 and 5.4) for the most recent summary  of 
the risks of osimertinib.
Preclinical data and clinical efficacy and safet y data fro m the FLAURA study  
(D5160C00007) support the hy pothesis that osimertinib mo notherapy  is an effect ive first-line 
treatm ent of NSCLC tum ours driven via the EGFR pathway .
The safet yprofile of osimert inib in the first -line setting in the FLAURA study was favourable 
with the m ajority of toxicities being Grade 1 or 2 EGFR- related AEs, i e, diarrhoea, dry  skin 
and paronychia ( Soria et al  2018 ). The safet y profile of osimert inib in the first -line setting was 
consistent with the exist ing safet y profile for osimertinib in the second line and later setting. 
All tri als of osimert inib, incl uding the present study , exclude pat ients with clinically 
significant toxi cities rel ated to pri or treatm ents and they  exclude pati ents wi th a history  of ILD 
or clinically act ive ILD as this is an unco mmo n but well documented EGFR -related toxici ty.
It is therefore, reasonable and appropriate to evaluate osimert inib monotherapy  as first -line 
treatm ent in EGFRm+ NSCLC pat ients, according to the proposed study  design.
1.4 Study Design
This is a phase II, open -label, single -arm tissue and plasma acquisit ion study  assessing the 
efficacy  and safety  of osimert inib (80 mg orally, once daily) as first -line treatment in 
EGFR TKI treatm ent-naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic EGFRm + NSCLC, 
and the underlying resistance mechanisms to treatment ( Figure 1 ).

natural disaster, or public health crisis
The gui dance given below supersedes instructions provided elsewhere in this CSP and should 
be implemented only during cases of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis 
(eg,during quarant ines and result ing site closures, regional travel restrict ions, and 
considerations if site personnel or study  patients becom e infected wi th SARS -CoV -2 or 
similar pandemic infect ion) which would prevent the conduct of study -related activit ies at 
study  sites, thereby  com promising the study  site staff or the pati ent’s abilit y to conduct the 
study . The Invest igator or designee should contact the study Sponsor to discuss whether the 
mitigation plans below sho uld be implemented.
To ensure continuit y of the clinical study  during a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h 
crisis, changes m ay be implemented to ensure the safet y of study  patients, m aintain 
compliance wi th Good Clinical Practice, and minimis e risks to study  integrity.
Where allowable by  local heal th authori ties, Ethics Committees, healt hcare provider 
guidelines (eg, hospital policies) or local government, these changes may  include the 
following opti ons:
 Obtaining consent/reconsent for the mit igation procedures (note, in the case of 
verbal consent/reconsent, the ICF should be signed at the patient’s next contact with 
the study  site).
 Rescreening: Addit ional rescreening for screen failure and to confirm eligibilit y to 
participate in the clinical study  can be performed in previously  screened patients. 
The Investigator should confirm this wit h the designated Study Physician.
 Hom e or Rem ote vi sit: Perf ormed by  a site qualified HCP or HCP provided by  a 
third-party  vendor.
 Telemedicine visit: Remote c ontact wi th the pati ents using tel ecommunicat ions 
techno logy including phone calls, virtual or video visit s, and m obile heal th devices.
 At-home invest igational product ( IP)administration: Performed by a site qualified 
HCP, HCP provided by a third -party  vendor, or by the patients or the patient’s 
caregiver, if possible. Addit ional inform ation related to the visit can be obtained via

Invest igators should keep a record, the patient screening log, of pat ients who entered pre -study  
screening.
The Investigators will:
1. Determine patient eligibilit y (see Sect ion 3.1and Section 3.2) .
2. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the potenti al patient or thei r guardi an/legal 
representative before any study  specific proc edures are performed.
3. Assign potential pat ient a uni que enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’ 
(generated in the Interactive Vo ice Response System/Interactive Web Response 
System  [IVRS/IWRS]).
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study, then his /her enro lment code cannot be 
re-used.
3.4 Procedures for Handling Incorrectly Enrolled Patients
Patients who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study  medicat ion. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Pati ents who are 
enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria must not be init iated on 
treatm ent, and m ust be wi thdrawn from  the study .
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s enrolled in error, or incorrectly

study  treatm ent. Patients should refrain fro m donating sperm fro m the start of 
dosing unt il 4 months after discont inuing study treatment.
3. Once enro lled, all pat ients must try  to avoi d concomi tant use of medicat ions, herbal 
supplements, and/or ingestion o f foods that are known to be strong inducers o f 
CYP3A4 whenever feasible, but patients may  receive any  medicati on that is 
clinically indicated for treatment of AEs. Such drugs must have been discont inued 
for an appropri ate peri od before they  enter screening and for a period of 3 weeks 
after the l ast dose of osimert inib. All conco mitant medicat ions should be captured 
on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Guidance on medicines to avoid, 
medicat ions that require c lose monitoring, and on washout periods is provided (see 
Appendix E).
4. If medically feasible, patients taking regular medication, with the except ion of 
potent induc ers of CYP3A4 (see above), should be maintained on their regular 
medicat ion throughout the study  period. Patients taking concomitant medicat ions 
whose disposit ion is dependent upon Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) 
and/or P -glycoprotein (P -gp), and w hich have a narrow therapeutic index should be 
closely  monitored f or signs of  changed tol erabili ty as a resul t of increased exposure 
of the concomitant medication while receiving osimert inib. Guidance on 
medicat ions to avo id, medicat ions that require close monitoring and on washout 
periods i s provi ded (see Appendix E).
Patients taking rosuvastatin should have creatine phosphokinase levels mo nitored 
(due to BCRP -mediated increase in exposure). If the pat ient experiences any 
potenti ally relevant AEs suggest ive o f muscle toxicit y including unexplained 
muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly if accompanied by malaise or 
fever, rosuvastatin must be stopped and a ny appropriate further management should 
be taken.
Patients who have received prior treatment with immune -onco logy (IO) therapi es 
shoul d be cl osely m onitored f or an appropri ate period of time after the last dose of 
the IO treatm ent, i n accordance with the respect ive IO label, as immune -mediated 
adverse reactions with the IO therapy  may occur at any  time during or after 
discontinuat ion of therapy . The stop date of the prior IO drug therapy  shoul d be 
captured i n the eCRF.

3.6.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product
At any time, pati ents are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study  (ie, IP and 
assessments; see Section
 3.7) without prej udice to further treatment. A patient that decides to 
discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If 
possible, they  will be seen and assessed by an Investi gator(s). AEs will be followed up (see 
Secti on 6); all study  drugs shoul d be returned by  the pati ent.
Study  procedures rel ated to seri ous adverse events (SAEs) and anticancer treatment must be 
captured un til the patient no longer has RECIST 1.1 assessments (disease progression or 
perm anent wi thdrawal from  the study ).
If a patient is wit hdrawn from the study , see Secti on 3.7.
3.7 Criteria for Withdrawal
3.7.1 Screen failures
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and 
therefore m ust not be treated in the study.
These pat ients should have the reason for study  withdrawal  recorded as ‘Screen failure’ 
(ie,the potential pat ient who does not meet one or more criteria required for participat ion in a 
trial). For those pati ents, only demography  data and rea son for discont inuat ion will be 
recorded. Supporting safet y information can be collected in case of a SAE, if applicable.
Patients who init ially fail screening due to out of range laboratory  values will be allowed to 
repeat the laboratory  assessment wi thinthe Screening Peri od, and if the repeat laboratory  
values are compliant with the inclusion/exclusio n criteria, the patient may  be enrolled into the

CONFIDENTAIL AND PROPRIETARY 59 (131 )3.7.2 Withdrawal of informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (IP and assessments) without 
prejudice to further treatment. Withdrawal of consent should be clearly documented in the 
patient not es and in the eCRF.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs. The Invest igator will fo llow-up AEs outside of the clinical study .
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/he r enrolment code cannot be 
re-used. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.
3.8 Discontinuation of the Study
The study  may be stopped if, in the judgement of AstraZeneca, trial pat ients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that:
 Meet individual stopping criteria or are otherwise considered significant
 Are assessed as causally related to study  drug
 Are not considered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for th e pati ent at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ust be docum ented.
4 STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCEDURES
The Schedule o f Assessments for the screening visit is shown in Table 1.  On study  
assessments are shown in Table 2 .
4.1 Screening/Enrolment Period
At screening, consent ing patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibilit y criteria. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study .
Procedures will be performed according to Table 1 within 28 days prior to Day  1.
The fo llowing assessments need to be repeated for patients where > 28 day s will  have l apsed 
since their last Screening Period to t he date of proposed enrolment.

Twelve -lead ECG will be performed at the vis its indicated in the Study  Plan.
Twelve -lead ECGs will be obtained after the patient has been resting semi -supine for at least 
10 minutes prior to times indicated. All ECGs should be recorded with the patient in the same 
physical posit ion. For each time po int one ECG recording should be taken. A standardised 
ECG machine should be used and the patient should be examined using the same machine 
throughout the study  if possible.
After the paper ECG has been recorded, the Invest igator or designated physician will review 
the ECG and may refer to a local cardio logist if appropri ate. A copy  of the ECG shoul d be 
filed in the patient’s medical records. If an abnormal ECG finding at screening or baseline is 
considered to be clinically significant by  the Investigator, i t shoul d be reported as a concurrent 
condi tion. For all ECGs, details of rhy thm, ECG interval s and an overall evaluat ion will be 
recorded.
If there is a clinically  significant abnormal ECG finding during the treatment period, this 
shoul d be recorded on the AE eCRF, according to standard AE collect ion and reporting 
processes. A 28- day follow-up assessment will be required if an on -treatm ent assessment was 
abnorm al at the time of discont inuat ion of study  therapy , to confirm reversibilit y of the 
abnorm ality.

5.3 Other Assessments
5.3.1 Resistance profiling
The samples will be co llected and stored in a central laboratory/repository. Further details on 
sample processing, handling, and shipment are provided in the Laboratory  Manual.
Mandatory tissue collection
The first mandatory tumour tissue bi opsy will be collected at scree ning for baseline resistance 
profiling. Tumour tissue may be an archival or fresh tissue sample. An archival tissue sample 
is acceptable as long as there has been no intervening anticancer treatment since the biopsy 
was acquired and enrolment into this stu dy, and as l ong as i t is within 60 days of study  entry .
The Investigator will be asked to provide formalin -fixed, paraffin- embedded tumour tissue 
blocks, or a at least 15 re -cut unstained sections from formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded 
tumour ti ssue block, presented on slides. Each sectio n is to be 5 μm thick.
Biopsy  samples taken from  bone metastasi s and cytol ogy samples are unsuitable for testing 
and should not be provided. Samples may be co llected from primary or metastatic tumour 
deposi ts. The m andatory  screening tumour biopsy  must not be taken from a previously  
irradi ated l esion. The bi opsy  must not be taken from the lesio n(s) selected for inclusio n 
criterion #6 (unless only one measurable lesio n exists, in which case the baseline tumour 
assessment scans are to be done at least 14 days after the screening biopsy).
The second mandatory  tumour ti ssue biopsy will be performed any  time between 
Invest igator -assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progressio n and before the start of any  new 
anticancer treatment . If a pati ent di scont inues osimertinib before RECIST 1.1-defined 
progression, the second biopsy will not be performed.
Optional tissue collection
Patients will  be asked to consent to provide addit ional tumour tissue during treatment. The 
biopsy may  be perf ormed betw een Day 15 and Day 21 of  Cycle 1.

6.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is the development of any un toward m edical  occurrence in a subject or clinical study  
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended 
sign (eg, an abnormal la boratory  finding), symptom (eg, nausea, chest pain), or disease 
temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal product, whether or not considered related 
to the m edicinal product.

Date 14 April 2023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 72 (131 )The term  AE is used to include both serious and non -serious AEs and can i nclude a 
deteri oration of  a pre -exist ing medical occurrence. An AE may  occur at any  time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been administered.
6.2 Definitions of Serious Adverse Event
A SAE is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i e, run -in, treatment, washout, fo llow-up) 
that fulfils one or more of the fo llowing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -subject hospi talisati on or prol ongat ion of exist ing hospitalisat ion
 Results in persistent or significant di sabili ty or incapaci ty
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may  require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SAE, see Appendix Bto the Clinical Study  
Protocol .
6.3 Recording of Adverse Events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs will be co llected fro m the time of signature of informed consent throughout the treatment 
period and including the fo llow-up peri od. The safety  follow
-up peri od is defined as 28 days 
after study  drug i s discont inued.
SAEs o ccurring in the safet y follow-up peri od shoul d be reported to AstraZeneca in the usual 
manner (see Section 6.4).
Following di scontinuati on of  study  treatm ent, SAEs considered related to study  procedures 
shoul d cont inue to be collected while pat ients are followed up for disease progression as 
outlined in Table 2.
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the patient’s last visitin the study are fo llowed up by  the 
Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
AstraZeneca retai ns the right to request additional informat ion for any  patient with ongoing 
AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .

 AE caused patient’s withdrawal fro m study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collecte d for SAEs:
 Date AE m et cri teria for seri ous AE
 Date Invest igator became aware of SAE

It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of 
intensity whereas seri ousness is defined by the criteria in Sect ion 6.2. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Secti on
 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 74 (131 )disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it s atisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there i s a reasonable possibilit y that the event may  
have been caused by the invest igational product?’
For SAEs, causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  procedures . 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any  study  procedure the causal relationship is 
implied as ‘yes.’
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix B.
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent or care provider or reported i n response to the 
open question fro m the study  site staff: ‘Have y ou had any  heal th probl ems since the previous 
visit/you were last asked?’ , or revealed by  observati on will be collected and recorded in the 
eCRF. When co llecting AEs, the recording o f diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of  the di agnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom  will be recorded separately .
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from the protocol -mandate d laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in 
the CSR. Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated parameters should 
therefore only  be reported as AEs if they  fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuat ion oftreatm ent wi th the IP unl ess clearly  due to disease progression of disease 
under study  (see Secti on
 6.3.8 ).
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/ vital sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion. Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator 
uses the cli nical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anaemia versus low Hb value). In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non -mandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.

Version 7.0
Date 14 April 2023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 75 (131 )6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs. Please refer to Appendix Dfor further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry  and evaluat ion of Hy’s Law (HL).
6.3.8 Disease progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condi tion attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied. It may be an increase in the severit y of the 
disease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of new, 
or progression o f exist ing metastasis to the primary cancer under study shoul d be considered 
as disease progressi on and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease 
progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study .
6.3.9 New cancers
The development of a new cancer should be regard ed as an AE and will generally  meet at 
least one of the serious criteria. New cancers are those that are not the primary  reason for the 
administration of the study  treatm ent and have been identified after the patient’s inclusio n in 
this study . They  do not include metastases of the original cancer .
6.3.10 Handling of deaths
All deaths that occur during the study , or wi thin the fo llow-up peri od after the administration 
of the l ast dose of IP (28 days post last dose of IP), should be reported as follows:
 Death, which is unequivocally due to disease progressio n, should be co mmu nicated 
to the study  monitor at the next m onitoring visi t and shoul d be docum ented in the 
eCRF m odule, but shoul d not be reported as a SAE during the study .
 Where death is not clearly  due to dise ase progression of the disease under study  the 
AE causing the death should be reported to the study  monitor as an SAE wi thin 
24hours. The report should contain a comment regarding the co -involvement of 
progression of disease, if appropriate, and should as sign a single primary cause of 
death together with any  contributory  causes.
 Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as a SAE but every  effort 
shoul d be made to establish a cause of death. A post -mortem may be helpful in the 
assessment of the cause of death, and if performed a copy  of the post -mortem 
resul ts (wi th transl ation of important parts into English) should be reported in an 
expedited fashio n to an AstraZeneca representative within the usual t imeframes.
6.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Eve nts
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the eCRF.

theappropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day , ie, immediately but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site within 
1calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant informat ion is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately . Invest igators or other site personnel inform AstraZeneca 
representatives of any  follow-up inform ation on a previously reported SAE within one 
calendar day , ie, immediately  butno later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of 
it.
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an autom ated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study  site staff reports a 
SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study  site staff how to proceed.
The reference document for de finition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug.
6.5 Overdose
A maximum tolerated dose has not been established for osimertinib. An overdose is any dose 
which exceeds the daily dose that is defined in the clinical study  protocol .
Such ov erdoses should be recorded as follows:
 An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE m odules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
 An overdose without associated symptoms is only  reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives 
immediately , or no later than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site.

For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 da ys.
6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca during the 
course of the study  and wi thin 6 weeks of the last dose of osimertinib.
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study  IP should be discont inued 
immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicio n that the IP under study  
may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive medicat ion. Congenital 
abnorm alities/birth defects and spontaneou s miscarri ages shoul d be reported and handled as 
SAEs. Elective abortions wit hout complicat ions should not be handled as AEs. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abno rmality) shoul d be f ollowed up and docum ented even if the pat ient 
was discont inued from the study.
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study  or wi thin 6 weeks of the final dose of the 
IP, then the Invest igator or other site personnel informs the a ppropri ate AstraZeneca 
representatives within 1 day , ie, immediately, but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
beco mes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safet y data entry  site wi thin 1 or 
5calendar days for SAEs (see Section
 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.
6.6.2 Paternal exposure
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not consi dered to be an AE. However, the outcome of all 
pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elect ive terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth 
or congenital abnormalit y) shoul d if possible be followed up and documented.
To capture informat ion about a pregnancy from the partner of a male patient, the male 
patient’s partner consent must be obtained to collect informat ion related to the pregnancy  and 
outcom e; the m ale pat ient shoul d not be asked to provide this informat ion. A consent form 
specific to this situatio n must be used. The outcome of any concept ion occurring fro m the date 
of the first dose until 4 months after dosing ends should be followed up and documented.

SAE associated with the event of medicat ion error, drug abuse, or misuse (see Sect ion 6.4) 
and within 30 days for all other event s.
6.7.2 Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the pati ent.
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy o f the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error.
 Occurred
 Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
 Did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name confusio n
 Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly , even if i t was not actually  
given to the patient
 Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route dose (error greater than +/
-
10%), or wrong site of administration
 Drug not taken as indicated, eg, tablet disso lved in water when it shoul d be taken as 
a solid tablet
 Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature

 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or SoC m edicat ion in 
open -label studi es, even if an AstraZeneca product, patient failed to return unused 
medicat ion or em pty packaging.
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as AEs, but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.
If a medicat ion error occurs in t he course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day, ie, immediately 
but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representat ive works with the Invest igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 or 5 calendar days if there is a SAE associated with

If Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction 
improves to Grade 0- 2 after withholding 
of osimertinib for up to 3 weeksOsimertinib may be restarted at the 
same dose (80 mg) or a lower dose 
(40 mg)

6.8.1 Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis -like toxicity
If new or worsening pulmo nary symptom s (eg, dyspnoea) or radio logical abnorm ality 
suggest ive of ILD is observed, an interruption in study treatment dosing is recommended, and 
the AstraZeneca study  team  shoul d be informed. It is strongly recommended to perform a full 
diagnosti c workup, to exclude alternat ive causes such as lymphangit ic carcino matosis, 
infect ion, allergy , cardi ogenic oedema or pulmo nary haem orrhage. The results of the full 
diagnosti c workup (including high -resolution CT [HRCT], blood and sputum culture, 
haematological parameters) will be captur ed in the CRF. In the presence of confirmatory 
HRCT scans where other causes of respiratory  symptom s have been excluded, a diagnosis of 
ILD should be considered and study  treatm ent permanent ly discont inued.
In the absence of a diagnosis of ILD, study  treat ment may be restarted following consultat ion 
with the AstraZeneca Study  Team  Physician.
6.8.2 QTc prolongation
In light of the potential for QT changes associated with osimertinib, electrolyte abnormalit ies 
(hypokal aemia, hypo magnesaemia, hypocalcaemia) must be corrected to be within normal 
ranges prior to first dose and electrolyte levels monitored during study treatment.
Patients wi th QT interval corrected using Fridericia’s correction (QTcF) prolongat ion to 
> 500 msec should have study treatment interrupted an d regul ar ECGs performed unt il

Patients present ing with signs and symptoms suggestive of keratit is such as acute or 
worsening: eye inflammat ion, lacrimat ion, light sensit ivity, blurred visio n, eye pain and/or red 
eye shoul d be referred prom ptly to an ophthalmo logy specialist.
6.8.4 Erythema multiforme, Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal 
necrolysis
Case reports of EM and TEN have been unco mmo nly reported, and SJS have been rarely 
reported, i n associ ation with osimert inib treatment. Before init iating treatment, patients should 
be advised o f signs and symptoms of EM, SJS and TEN. If signs and symptoms suggest ive of 
EM develop, close patient monitoring and drug interruption or discont inuat ion of o simert inib 
shoul d be considered. If signs and symptoms suggestive of SJS appear, osimert inib shoul d be 
interrupted. Osimertinib should be discontinued immediately if diagnosis of SJS or TEN is 
confirmed.
6.8.5 Aplastic anaemia
Rare reports of aplast ic anaemia ha ve been reported in associat ion with osimert inib treatment. 
Some cases had a fatal outcome. Before init iating treatment, patients should be advised of 
signs and symptoms of aplast ic anaemia including but not limited to persistent fever, bruising, 
bleeding, pallor. If signs and symptoms suggestive of aplast ic anaemia develop, close patient 
monitoring and drug interruption or discontinuation of osimertinib should be considered. 
Osimert inib shoul d be discont inued in pat ients with confirmed aplast ic anaemia.
Permanent discontinuation due to toxicity
Patients experiencing ILD, QTc prolongat ion with signs/symptom s of seri ous arrhy thmia or 
Grade 3 or higher adverse react ion that does not improve to Grade 0 to 2 after withholding for 
up to 3 weeks will not be permit ted to restart study treatment.
6.8.6 Changes in cardiac contractility
Based on the available clinical trial data, a causal relat ionship between effects on changes in 
cardi ac contractilit y and osimertinib has not been established. In patients with cardiac risk 
factors and those with condit ions that can affect LVEF, cardiac monitoring, including an 
assessment of LVEF at baseline and during treatment, should be considered. In patients who 
develop relevant cardiac signs/symptoms during treatment, cardiac monitoring including 
LVEF assessment should be considered.

a single daily  dose of 80 m g or 40 m g. Osimert inib tablets are packed in high -densi ty 
polyethylene bottles with desiccant and child -resistant cl osures.
Addit ional information about the IP m ay be found in the IB.
7.2 Dose and Treatment Regimens
Osimert inib is administered as 80 mg once daily . Osimert inib can be taken wit hout regard to 
food.
Doses should be taken approximately  24 hours apart at the sam e time po int each day. Doses 
shoul d not be missed. If a patient misses taking a scheduled dose, within a window of 
12hours, i t is acceptable to take the dose. If it is more than 12 hours after the dose time, the 
missed dose should not be taken, and patients should be instructed to take the next dose at the 
next scheduled t ime. If a patient vo mits after taking their osimertinib, they  shoul d not m ake up 
for this dose, but should take the next scheduled dose.
The dose of 80 mg osimertinib daily  can be reduced to 40 mg osi mertinib once daily under 
circumstances described in Sect ion 6.8. Further dose reductions are not possible. Once a dose 
has been reduced, it should not be re -escalated at future cycles.
Any change fro m dosing schedule, dose interruptions or dose reductions should be recorded.

8 STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA
8.1 Statistical Considerations
The primary  aim of the study  is to examine the molecular profi le of patients at the point of 
disease progressi on and to com pare i t to the profile pri or to i nitiation of treatm ent in patients 
receiving osimertinib as first -line therapy. A co mprehensive statist ical analysis plan (SAP) 
will be prepared and finalised pri or to the final analysis. All analyses will be performed by  
AstraZeneca or its representatives.
The final analysis will be performed at study  end (see Secti on 9.3for definit ion of “end of 
study”), and when approximately 50 patients have evaluable paired biopsies upon progression. 
Assuming a 70% rate of patients having a biopsy at both baseline and progression, and wit h an 
assumed technical failure ra te of 30% of the samples (assume an overall failure rate of 51%), 
then we should expect approximately 50 evaluable pai red bi opsies to be available when 
approximately  103 o f the 150 patients have progressed, which would be expected to occur 
approximately  38months after the first patient is enro lled.
This calculat ion assumes patients are recruited over 12 months, exponent ially distributed 
progression t imes with a 19 -month median and a 2 -piece recrui tment function, assuming an 
exponent ially distributed recrui tment rate.
The first 100 patients to be enro lled within the first 5 months (ie, fro m first pati ent inclusio n to 
the timing of the global protocol amendment). This will be fo llowed by a pause in recruit ment 
of 6 months to account for the issue and approval of the gl obal protocol  amendment. Thi s will  
further be fo llowed by 1 month of recruit ment to enro l the remaining 50 patients, assuming an 
exponent ially distributed recruit ment rate to account for the regional differences in approval 
times and slow uptake of recrui tment following the protocol amendment.
This is an exploratory  study  which m ay inform  other studi es in the osimert inib development 
programme and therefore earlier interim analyses may be performed, such interim analyses 
may not be reported in a fo rmal CSR.
If a patient progresses in the ELIOS study  and then enrols in a subsequent AZ study , and if 
appropriate consent is provided, the bio marker results fro m a progression biopsy (generated in 
either the other study  or ELIOS), m ay be shared between bot h studies and the data may be 
analysed as part of the ELIOS study .

8.3 Definitions of Analysis Sets
The primary  analysis set (PAS) will include all patients with evaluable paired biopsies. This 
analysis set will be used for the analysis of the primary  endpoint. The full analysis set will 
include all pat ients who receive at least one dose of osimert inib and will be used for all other 
efficacy  and safety  analyses.
8.3.1 Primary analysis set
The PAS will include a ll pat ients with eval uable pai red bi opsies, which are defined as follows: 
the first biopsy taken prior to osimertinib treatment and the second biopsy taken at any t ime 
between Invest igator -assessed, RECIST 1.1-defined progression and before the start of any 
new ant icancer treatment. If the Invest igator judges the patient to have progressed but the 
programmat ically defined RECIST progression does not occur, the patient will st ill be 
considered evaluable. This analysis s et will be used for the analysis o f the primary  endpoint.
8.3.2 Full analysis set
The full analysis set will include all pat ients who receive at least one dose of osimert inib. The 
full analysis set will be used for all efficacy and safet y analyses.
8.4 Outcome Measu res for Analyses
8.4.1 Calculation or derivation of primary endpoint variables
The primary  endpoint is the proportion of patients with a given genet ic and proteomic marker 
(including, but not limited to, EGFR mutations, HER2, and cMET expressio n and/or 
amplifica tion) at the point of disease progression as defined by the Investigator; the cho ice of 
markers is dependent on the profile co mpar ison at the point of disease progression and prior to 
treatm ent init iation. The number of patients with a given genet ic and pr oteomic marker will be 
divided by the number of patients who have evaluable biopsies and have progressed according 
to the Invest igator to calculate the proportion with a given marker at progression.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 87 (131 )8.4.2 Calculation or derivation of efficacy variables
Investiga tor RECIST based assessments
From  the Investi gator’s review of the imaging scans, the RECIST tumour response data will 
be used to determine each pat ient’s visit response according to RECIST version 1.1. At each 
visit, patients will be programmat ically assi gned a RECIST 1.1 visit response of co mplete 
response, partial response, stable disease or progressive disease depending on the status of 
their disease co mpared with baseline and previous assessments. If a patient has had a tumour 
assessment, which cannot be evaluated, then the patient will be assigned a visit response of 
not evaluable (unless there is evidence o f progression in which case the response will be 
assigned as progressive disease).
Please refer to Appendix Ffor the definit ions of complete response, partial response, stable 
disease and progressive disease.
Progression -free Survival
PFS i s defined as the time from first dose of osimertinib u ntil the date of RECIST 1.1-defined 
progression or death (by  any cause in the absence of progression) regardless of whether the 
patient wi thdraws from therapy  or receives another anticancer therapy  prior to progressi on. 
Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of analysis will be censored at the time o f 
the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable RECIST assessment. However, if the 
patient progresses or dies after 2 or more missed visits, the patient will be censored at the time 
of the latest eval uable RECIST assessment. If the patient has no evaluable visit s or does not 
have baseline data, they  will be censored at day  1 unless they  die wi thin 2 visi ts of baseline.
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan/assessment dates not, visit dates. RECIST 
assessments/scans contribut ing towards a particular visit may be performed on different dates. 
The fo llowing rul es will  be applied:
 Date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the dates of the 
component that tri ggered the progression
 When censoring a patient for PFS the patient will be censored at the latest of the 
dates contribut ing to a particular overall visit assessment
Objective Response Rate
ORR rate i s defined as the number (%) of patients with at least one vi sit response of com plete 
response or partial response that is confirmed at least 4 weeks later. Data obtained up unt il 
progression, or last evaluable assessment in the absence of progression, will be included in the 
assessment of ORR. However, any  com plete response or partial response, which occurred 
after a further anticancer therapy  was received, will not be included in the numerator for the 
ORR calculat ion.
In the case where a patient has 2 non -consecut ive visit responses of partial response, then, as 
long as the time between the 2 visits of partial response is greater than 4 weeks and there is no

responder. Similarly, if a pat ient has visit responses of complete response, not evaluable, 
complete response then, as long as the time between the 2 visits of co mplete response is 
greater than 4 weeks, then a best response of complete response will be assigned.
Duration of Response
DoR will be defined as the time fro m the date of first documented response, (that is 
subsequent ly confirmed) unt il date of documented progression or death in the absence of 
disease progressi on, the end of response should coincide wit h the date of progression or death 
from any cause used for the PF S endpoint. The time of the init ial response will be defined as 
the latest of the dates contribut ing towards the first visit response of partial response or 
complete response. If the response is not confirmed, it will not be included.
If a patient does not progress fo llowing a response, then their DoR will use the PFS censoring 
time.
Disease control rate
DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have a best overall response of co mplete 
response or partial response or stable disease.
Time to treatment discontinuation or death
TTD i s defined as the time fro m the date of first dose of osimertinib to the earliest of 
treatm ent discont inuat ion or death. Any pat ient not known to have discont inued treatment or 
not known to have died at the time of the analysi s will  be censored at the last known time to 
have not discont inued treatment, ie, the last fo llow-up vi sit where this was confirmed.
Time to first subsequent therapy or death
The TFST will be defined as the time fro m the date of first dose of osimert inib t o the earlier of 
the date of anticancer therapy  start date following study  treatm ent di scontinuati on, or death. 
Any pat ient not kn own to have had a subsequent ant icancer treatment or not known to have 
died at the time of the analysis will be censored at th e last known time to have not received 
subsequent ant icancer treatment, ie, the last fo llow-up vi sit where this was confirmed.
8.4.3 Calculation or derivation of safety variables
Safety and tol erabilit y will  be assessed in term s of AEs, deaths, l aboratory  data, ECG, and 
vital signs. These will be collected for all pat ients.
Adverse events
AEs (both in terms of Medical Dict ionary for Regul atory  Activities [MedDRA] preferred 
terms and CTCAE Grade) will be listed individually by pat ient.
Any AE occurring before treatm ent wi th osimertinib will be included in the data list ings but 
will not be included in the summary tables of AEs.

Study Code D5161C00003
Version 7.0
Date 14 April 2023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 89 (131 )Any AE occurring wit hin 28 days of discont inuat ion of osimertinib will be included in the AE 
summaries. Any  events in this peri od that o ccur after a patient has received further therapy for 
cancer (fo llowing discont inuat ion of osimertinib) will be flagged in the data list ings.
Other significant adverse events
During the evaluat ion of the AE data, an AstraZeneca medically qualified expert w ill review 
the list of AEs that were not reported as SAEs and AEs leading to discont inuat ion. Based on 
the expert’s judgement, significant AEs of particular clinical importance may, after 
consultation wit h the Gl obal Patient Safety  Physician, be considered other significant adverse 
events (OAEs) and reported as such in the CSR. A similar review of laboratory data/vital 
signs (according to vi tal sign data collected) will be performed for ident ificat ion of OAEs.
Examples of these could be marked haematologica l and other laboratory  abnorm alities, and 
certain events that lead to intervent ion (other than those already classified as serious), dose 
reducti on or si gnificant addi tional treatm ent.
8.5 Methods for Statistical Analyses
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variables
The proporti on of  patients wi th a given genet ic and proteomic marker at the point of disease 
progression will be calculated and presented alongside the associated exact bino mial 95% CIs. 
If a reasonable proportion of patients have a given marker at baseline, t he difference in the 
proporti on of  patients with that m arker between progression and baseline, together with its 
95% CI, may also be calculated.
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variables
Secondary  variables PFS, DoR, TTD, and TFST will be summarised using a Kaplan -Meier 
plot from which the m edian and event rates from clinically  important l andmarks such as 1 and 
2 years will be calculated. The standard error of the natural log of survival t ime will be used to 
calculate CIs. The CI for the median will be calculated by  determining the earliest and latest 
survival times whose 95% CIs contain 0.5. If the 95% CI for survival at the largest event time 
contains 0.5 then the upper confidence limit will be described as Not Calculated.
For DoR only  those pati ents who hav e responded (a confirmed response) will be included.
ORR and DCR will be summarised as the proportion of pat ients with a response or disease 
control  along wi th the associ ated exact bino mial 95% CIs.
8.5.3 Subgroup analysis
A full list of exploratory  subgroup ana lyses will be defined in the SAP but will include, if 
numbers allow, comparing groups of patients with different patterns of genet ic and proteomic 
markers at disease progression according to:

patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study ) including verificat ion of inf ormed consent of participat ing pat ients. Thi s 
will require direct access to all original records for each patient (eg, clinic charts)
 Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the patient’s bio logical 
samples is reported and bio logical samples ar e identified and disposed of/destroyed 
accordingly, and the action is documented, and reported to the patient
The AstraZeneca representative may apply a risk -based monitoring approach during visits: 
source document review (a holist ic review of source docum ents to determine source adequacy , 
overall eligibilit y, Good Clinical  Practi ce (GCP), protocol compliance, and patient safet y 
throughout the study ), and source document verification (cross -checking specific variables in 
the source documents against th e eCRF to confirm the accuracy o f data transcript ion).
The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visit s if the Invest igator(s) or other 
staff at the centre needs information and advice about the study  conduct.
9.2.1 Source data
Refer to the Clinical Study  Agreement for l ocati on of  source data.
9.2.2 Study agreements
The Principal Invest igator at each/the centre should comply wit h all the terms, condit ions and 
obligat ions of the Clinical Study  Agreement, or equivalent, for this study . In the event o f any 
inconsistency between this Clinical Study  Protocol and the Clinical Study  Agreement, the 
terms of Clinical Study  Protocol  shall  prevail wi th respect to the conduct of the study  and the 
treatm ent of patients and in all other respects, not relat ing to study conduct or treatment of 
patients, the term s of the Clinical Study  Agreement shall prevail.
Agreements between AstraZeneca and the Principal Investigator should be in place before any 
study -related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled.
9.2.3 Archiving of study documents
The Investigator fo llows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study  Agreement.
9.3 Study Timetable and End of Study
A pat ient is considered to have completed the study  when he/she has progressed or died.
The end o f the study  is defined as when the earliest of these scenarios is met:
All enrolled pat ients com plete thei r parti cipat ion in the study  either through disease 
progression or withdrawal for other reasons.
The study  will end in by Q2 2023, as it is est imated that by then th ere will be sufficient 
data to support study  endpoints. If, at this time (Q2 2023 or at another time if AstraZeneca

there are ongoing patients who are drawing benefit  from study  treatm ent, they  will be 
switched to commercial supply and/or another study  to ensure continuat ion of treatment, 
and the study  will close using the available data for the final analysis. A CSR will be 
written at this time, including all data coll ected during the study .
For any  patients who continue in progression fo llow-up, any  addi tional safet y data will be 
collected and summarised in the CSR.
The study  may be terminated at individual centres if the study  procedures are not being 
perform ed accord ing to GCP, or if recruit ment is slow. AstraZeneca may also terminate the 
entire study  prem aturely  if concerns for safety  arise wi thin this study  or in any other study  
with osimertinib.
The study  may be terminated at individual centres if there are no ongo ing pat ients.
9.3.1 End ofStudy Definition
For the purpose of Clinical Trial Transparency the defini tion of  the end of the study  differs 
under Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )and European Union ( EU)regulatory  
requi rements:
European Unio n requirements define study  com pletion as the l ast vi sit of the l ast pati ent 
for any  protocol  related activit y.
Food and Drug Administration requirements defines 2 complet ion dates:
Primary Co mpletion Date –the date that the final patient is examined or receives an 
intervent ion for the purposes of final co llection of data for the primary  outcom e 
measure, whether the clinical study  concl uded according to the pre -specified protocol 
or was terminated. In the case of clinical studies wit h more than one primary  outcom e 
measure with different complet ion dates, this term refers to the date on which data 
collect ion is co mpleted for all o f the primary  outcomes.
Study  Com pletion Date –is defined as the date the final pat ient is examined or 
receives an intervention for purposes of final collection of data for the primary and 
secondary  outcom e measures and AEs (for example, last patient ’s last visit), whether 
the clinical study  concl udes according to the pre -specified protocol or is terminated.
The study  may be stopped if, in the judge ment of AstraZeneca, study patients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings.
As thi s study  is event driven, the accrual of the predetermined number of events included in 
the study  endpoints will determine the duration of the data co llection phase of the study . There 
will be a final DCO, defined by  when approximately  50 pati ents have evaluable paired 
biopsies upon progression. At this time, the clinical database will clo se to new data.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 98 (131 )Appendix ARegulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
A 1 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations
This study  will be conducted in accordance wit hthe protocol and with the fo llowing:
Consensus ethical principles derived from international guidelines including the 
Declaration of Helsinki as amended at 64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, 
Brazil, October 2013 and CIOMS International Ethical Guidelin es
Applicable ICH GCP Guidelines
Applicable laws and regulations
The protocol, revised protocol, ICF, IB, and other relevant documents (eg, 
advert isements) must be submitted to an IRB/IEC by the Invest igator and reviewed and 
approved by the IRB/IEC before the study  is init iated.
Any revised protocol will require IRB/IEC and applicable Regulatory  Authori ty approval  
before implementation of changes made to the study design, except for changes necessary 
to eliminate an immediate hazard to study  patients.
Astra Zeneca will be responsible for obtaining the required authorisations to conduct the 
study  from the concerned Regulatory  Authori ty. This responsibilit y may be delegated to a 
Contract Research Organisat ion (CRO), but the accountabilit y remains wi th AstraZene ca.
The Investigator will be responsible for providing oversight of the conduct of the study at 
the site and adherence to requirements of 21 Code of Federal Regulat ions 312.120, ICH 
guidelines, the IRB/IEC, European Regulat ion 536/2014 for clinical studies (if 
applicable), European Medical Device Regulat ion 2017/745 for clinical device research 
(if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations.
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs
Prom pt notificat ion by the Invest igator to AstraZeneca of an SAE is essent ial so that l egal 
obligat ions and ethical responsibilit ies towards the safet y of patients and the safet y of a 
study  interventi on under clinical invest igation are met.
AstraZeneca has a legal responsibilit y to notify both the local regulatory  authori ty and 
other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a study  intervent ion under clinical 
investigat ion. AstraZeneca will co mply with country -specific regulatory  requi rements 
relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory  authorit y, IRB/IEC, and Investigators.
For all studies except those utilising medical devices, Invest igator safet y reports m ust be 
prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction according to local regulatory  
requi rements and S ponsor policy and forwarded to Invest igators as necessary.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 99 (131 )Adherence to European Medical Device Regulat ion 2017/745 for clinical device research 
(if applicable), and all other applicable local regulations.
An Invest igator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific sa fety informat ion (eg, summary or list ing of SAEs) fro m AstraZeneca will 
review and then file it along wit h the IBand will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.
Regulatory Reporting Requir ements for  Serious Br eaches
Prom pt notificat ion by the Invest igator to AstraZeneca of any (potential) serious breach 
of the protocol or regulat ions is essential so that legal and ethical obligat ions are met.
A ‘serious breach’ means a breach likely to affect to a significant degree the safet y and 
rights of a patient or the reliabilit y and robustness of the data generated in the clinical 
study .
If any (potential) serious breach occurs in the course of the study , Invest igators or other 
site personnel will inform the appropriate AstraZe neca representatives immediately after 
they become aware of it.
In certain regions/countries, AstraZeneca has a legal responsibilit y to notify both the local 
regul atory  authori ty and other regul atory  agencies about such breaches.
AstraZeneca will comply wi th country -specific regulatory  requi rements rel ating to 
serious breach reporting to the regulatory  authori ty, IRB/IEC, and I nvestigators. If 
EU Clinical Trials Regulation 536/2014 applies, AstraZeneca is required to enter 
details o f serious breaches into t he EMA CTIS. It is important to note that redacted 
versio ns of serious breach reports will be available to the public via CTIS.
The Investigator should have a process in place to ensure that:
The site staff or service providers delegated by the Invest igato r/inst itution are able to 
ident ify the occurrence of a (potential) serious breach.
A (potential) serious breach is pro mptly reported to AstraZeneca or delegated party, 
through the contacts (email address or telephone number) provided by AstraZeneca.
A 2 Financ ial Disclosure
Invest igators will provide AstraZeneca with sufficient, accurate financial information as 
requested to allow AstraZeneca to submit complete and accurate financial cert ificat ion or 
disclosure statem ents to the appropriate Regulatory Authori ties. Invest igators are responsible 
for provi ding informat ion on financial interests during the study  and f or one y ear after 
completion of the study .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 105 (131 )Appendix BAdditional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definiti on of a Serious Adverse Event
Life-threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patientwas at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
patient’s death. ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not in itself a SAE, although the reasons for it 
may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical operations 
planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease existed before 
the patientwas enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteriorate in an unexpected way  
during the study .
Important Medical Event or Medical Intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical e vents may not be immediately life -threatening or resul t in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardise the patient or may  require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious. These 
shoul dusually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at -home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion) o r 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 106 (131 )A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y, consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may  have been caused by the drug.
 Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
 Consistenc y with known drug profile. Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 De-challenge expe rience. Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
 No al ternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetio logy 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge experi ence. Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally  recommend or support a 
re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests. A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confir med the 
relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni sedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if, fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relat ionship for the individual case. The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal rela tionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgement. With limited or insufficient informat ion in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 107 (131 )B 1 Medication Error, Drug Abuse and Drug Misuse
Medication Error
For the purposes of this clinical study  a medicat ion error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for AstraZeneca study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient or has 
the potenti al to cause harm  to the pati ent. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of  efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staf f or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error: 
Occurred
Was i dentified and intercepted before the pa tient received the drug
Did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
Drug name confusio n
Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if i t was not actually  given to 
the pati ent
Drug not administered as indicated, eg, wrong route, dose (error greater than +/ -10%), or 
wrong si te of administrati on 
Drug not taken as indicated, eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as a 
solid tablet 
Drug not stored as instructed, eg, kept in the refrigerator when it should be at room 
temperature 
Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IVRS/RTSM errors)
Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IVRS/RTSM errors)
Examples o f events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
Errors related to or resulting fro m IVRS/RTSM - including those which led to one of the 
above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
Patient acci dentally missed drug dose(s), eg, forgot to take medicat ion
Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging

medicat ion error.
Drug Abuse
For the purpose of this study , drug abuse is defined as the persistent or sporadic intent ional, 
non-therapeut ic excessive use of AstraZeneca study drug for a perceived reward or desired 
non-therapeut ic effect.
Any events of drug abuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forwarded to 
the DES using the Drug Abuse Report Form . This form should be used both if the drug abuse 
happened in a study  patient or if the drug abuse regards a person not enrolled in the study  
(such as a relative o f the study  patient).
Examples of drug abuse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent of getting a perceived reward (by the study  patient or a 
person not enrolled in the study )
The drug in the form o f a tablet is crushed and injected or snorted with the intent of getting 
high.
Drug Misuse
Drug misuse is the intent ional and inappropriate use (by  a study  patient) of  AstraZeneca study  
drug for m edicinal purposes outside of the authorised product informat ion,or for unauthorised 
AstraZeneca study  drug, outsi de the intended use as specified in the protocol, and includes 
deliberate administration o f the product by  the wrong route.
Events of drug misuse, with or without associated AEs, are to be captured and forw arded to 
the DES using the Drug Misuse Report Form. This form should be used both if the drug 
misuse happened in a study  patient or if the drug misuse regards a person not enrolled in the 
study  (such as a rel ative of the study  patient).
Examples of drug mi suse include but are not limited to:
The drug is used with the intent ion to cause an effect in another person
The drug is so ld to other people for recreational purposes 
The drug is used to facilitate assault in another person
The drug is deliberately admi nistered by the wrong route
The drug is split in half because it is easier to swallow, when it is stated in the protocol 
that it must be swallowed whole

Labelling and Shipment of Biohazard Samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 3
categori es. For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to risk 
groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions in the 46thedition (2005). 
Infectious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exem pt. There i s 
no di rect rel ationship between ri sk groups and categori es A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, w hen exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category  A pathogens are, eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
 Are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA In structi on 602
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are, eg, hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
HIV ty pes 1 and 2. They  are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name:
 UN 3373 –Biological Substance, Category  B
 Are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt –all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
 Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or exem pt under IATA regulations
 Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient temperature 
in IATA 650 compliant packaging
 Biological samples transported in dry -ice require addi tional dangerous goods

criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanation for the elevat ions in liver biochemistry  
other than drug- induced liver injury (DILI) caused by the investigational medicinal product 
(IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting AEs and SAEs according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line wit h 
standard safet y reporting processes.
D 2 Definitions
Potential Hy’s Law
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x ULN together 
with total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 x ULN at any  point during the study  following the start of study  
medicat ion irrespect ive of an increase in alkaline phos phatase (ALP).
Hy’s Law
AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.
For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincident with (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 112 (131 )D 3 Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3 x ULN
 AST ≥ 3 x ULN
 TBL ≥ 2 x ULN
The Investigator will remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the 
identification criteria are met , where this i s the case the Invest igator will:
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw)
 Com plete the approp riate unscheduled laboratory  electroni c case report form (eCRF) 
module(s) wi th the ori ginal  local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator will 
without delay :
 Determine whether the patie nt meets PHL cri teria (see D2within this appendix for 
definit ion) by  reviewing l aboratory  reports from  all previ ous visi ts
The Investigator will wit hout delay review each new laboratory  report and if the ident ificat ion 
criteria ar e met will:
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see D2within this appendix for 
definit ion) by  reviewing l aboratory  reports from  all previ ous visi ts
 Prom ptly enter the laboratory  data into the laboratory  eCRF
D 4 Follow -up
D4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Not Met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 113 (131 ) Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol
D4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
 Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any  study  visit prior to starting s tudy 
treatm ent (see D6)
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central study  team
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to 
this contact the Invest igator will:
 Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medical ly 
indicated
 Invest igate the aetiology o f the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician
 If at any  time (in consultat ion with the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standar d reporti ng procedures
D 5 Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Stud y 
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the 
IMP. The AstraZeneca Global Clinical Lead or equivalent and Global Safet y Physician will 
also be involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate.
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
If there is an agreed alternat ive explan ation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative expl anati on on the 
appropriate eCRF

Study Code D5161C00003
Version 7.0
Date 14 April 2023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 114 (131 ) If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the eCRF 
accordingly and fo llow the AstraZeneca standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard processes
The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria 
apply
As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment of ‘related’ 
should be assigned
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alterna tive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causalit y assessment as per above
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessar y 
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to determine 
whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the 
review amending the reported term if an alternative explanat ion for the liver 
biochemi stry elevat ions is determined
D 6 Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Are Met 
Before and After Starting Study Treatment
This sect ion is applicable to patients who meet PHL criteria on study  treatm ent having 
previously met PHL criteria at a study  visit prior to starting study  treatm ent.
At the first on study  treatm ent occurrence of PHL cri teria being met the Invest igator will:
 Determine if there has been a significant change in the patients’ condit ion#compared 
with the l ast visit where PHL criteri a were m et#
If there is no significant change no action is required
If there is a significant change notify  the AstraZeneca representative, who will 
inform  the central  Study  Team , then foll ow the subsequent process described in 
D4.2of this appendix
# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST, or TBL) in isolat ion or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associ ated symptom s. The determinat ion of

D 7 Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potenti al Hy’s Law
This sect ion is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has 
already met PHL cri teria at a previous on study  treatm ent visi t.
The requi rement to conduct fo llow-up, revi ew and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternat ive cause identified for the previous occurrence.
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being 
met and answer the fo llowing quest ion:
 Was the alternat ive cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL cri teria being met found 
to be the di sease under study , eg, chroni c or progressing malignant disease, severe 
infect ion or liver disease, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to starting stu dy 
treatm ent and at their first on study  treatm ent visi t as described in D6.
If No: fo llow the process described in D4.2of this appendix
If Yes:
Determine if there has been a significant change in the patient’s condit ion#compared wi th 
when PHL criteria were previously met
 If there is no significant change no action is required
 If there is a significant change fo llow the process described in D4.2of this appendix
# A ‘significan t’ change in the patient’s condit ion refers to a clinically  relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms. The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator; this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

Medications
The use of any  natural /herbal  products or other “folk remedies” should be discouraged, but 
use of these products, as well as use of all vitamins, nutri tional supplements, and all other 
concomitant medicat ions must be recorded in the eCRF.
E 1 Drugs inducing CYP3A4 metabolism that AstraZeneca strongly 
recommends are not combined with osimertinib
Osimert inib is metabo lised by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes.
A drug -drug interaction study  of osimertinib evaluated in patients showed that there is 
potenti al for osimertinib being a vict im when co -administered with strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 (osimertinib concentrations are decreased when co -dosed with rifampicin).
The fo llowing potent i nducers of CYP3A4 must not be used during this study  for any  patient 
receiving osimertinib.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 120 (131 )Appendix FGuidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumour Response 
Using RECIST 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumours)
F 1 Introduction
This appendix details the implementation o f RECIST 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer et al  2009 ) 
for the D5161C00003 study  with regards to Invest igator assessment of tumour burden 
including protocol -specific requirements for this study .
F 2 Definition of Measurable, Non -Measurable, Target and 
Non-Target Lesions
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study . Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesio n which has not been 
previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy  during the Screening Period.
Measurable:
A lesio n, not previously irradiated and not chosen for biopsy during the Screening Period, that
can be accurately measured at baseline as ≥10 mm in the lo ngest di ameter (except lymph 
nodes which must have short axis ≥15 mm ) with CT or MRI and which is suitable for accurate 
repeated m easurem ents. If only one measurable lesio n exists, it is acceptable to be used (as a 
target lesio n) as l ong as i t has not been previously irradiated and baseline tumour assessment 
scans are done at least 14 days after the screening biopsy is performed.
Non-measurable:
 All other lesio ns, including small lesio ns (lo ngest di ameter < 10 mm or pathological 
lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis at baseline*)
 Truly non -measurable lesio ns include the following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusio n, inflammatory  breast di sease, lymphan gitic 
involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses / abdo minal organo megaly ident ified by 
physical examinat ion that is not measurable by  CT or MRI
 Previously  irradiated l esions**
 Skin l esions assessed by clinical examinat ion
 Brain metastasis
 Lesio ns biops ied wit hin the Screening Period (exception: if only one measurable lesio n 
exists, i t is acceptable to be used [as a target lesio n] as l ong as i t has not been previously  
irradi ated and baseline tum our assessment scans are done at least 14 days after the 
screening biopsy is performed)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 121 (131 )*Nodes with < 10 mm short axis are considered non -patho logical and should not be recorded 
or fo llowed as a non -target l esion (NTL).
**Localised post -radiation changes which affect lesion sizes may  occur. Therefore, l esions 
that have been previously irradiated will not be considered measurable and must be selected as 
NTLs at baseline and fo llowed up as part of the NTL assessment.
Special cases:
 Lytic bone lesio ns or mixed ly tic–blast ic lesio ns, with ident ifiable so ft tissue 
components, can be considered measurable if the soft tissue component meets the 
definit ion of measurabilit y. Blast ic lesio ns are considered non -measurable.
 Cystic met astases can be considered measurable lesions if they meet the criteria for 
measurabilit y from a radi ological  point of view, but if non -cystic lesions are present 
in the same patient, these should be selected as target lesio ns.
Target lesions:
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns (with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ), representative 
of all lesio ns involved suitable for accurate repeated measurement, should be identified as 
target lesio ns (TL) at baseline.
Non-target lesions:
All other lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be ident ified as NTL at 
baseline.
F 3 Methods of Assessm ent
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterise each 
ident ified and recorded lesio n at baseline and during fo llow-up visit s.
A summary  of the m ethods to be used for RECIST assessment is provided below and those

Version 7.0
Date 14 April 2023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 122 (131 )F3.1 Computed Tomography or Magnetic Resonance Imaging
CT and MRI are generally  considered to be the best currently  available and reproducib le 
methods to measure TL selected for response assessment and to assess NTL and ident ificat ion 
of any new lesio ns.
In the D5161C00003 study  it is recommended that CT examinat ions of the chest and abdo men 
(including liver and adrenal glands) and pelvis, will be used to assess tumour burden at 
baseline and fo llow-up visi ts. CT examinat ion with intravenous contrast media administration 
is the preferred method. MRI should be used where CT is not feasible or is medically 
contraindicated. For brain lesio n asse ssment, MRI is the preferred method although CT is 
acceptable.
F3.2 Clinical Examination
In the D5161C00003 study , clinical examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TL. 
Clinically detected lesio ns can be selected as TLs if they are assessed by CT or MRI s cans. 
Clinical examinat ion can be used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence of new lesio ns.
F3.3 X-ray
F3.3.1 Chest X -ray
In the D5161C00003 study , chest x -ray assessment will not be used for assessment of TL as 
they will be assessed by CT examinat ion or MRI examinat ion. Chest x -ray can, however, be 
used to assess NTL and to ident ify the presence o f new lesio ns.
F3.3.2 Plain X- ray
In the D5161C00003 study  plain x -ray may be used as a m ethod of assessment for bone NTL 
and to i dentify the presence o f new bone lesio ns.
F3.4 Ultrasound
In the D5161C00003 study , ultrasound examinat ion will not be used for assessment of TL and 
NTL as i t is not a reproducible method, does not provide an accurate assessment of tumour 
size and it is subject ive and operator dependent. Ultrasound exa minat ion can, however, be 
used to i dentify the presence of new lesio ns. If new clinical symptoms occur and an 
ultrasound is performed, then new lesio ns shoul d be confirmed by  CT or MRI examinat ion.
F3.5 Endoscopy and Laparoscopy
In the D5161C00003 study , endosc opy and laparoscopy  will not be used for tumour 
assessments as they are not validated in the context of tumour assessment.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 123 (131 )F3.6 Tumour Markers
In the D5161C00003 study  tumour m arkers will  not be used for tum our response assessments 
as per RECIST 1.1.
F3.7 Cytology and Histology
In the D5161C00003 study  histol ogy will not be used as part of the tumour response 
assessment as per RECIST 1.1.
Cytological confirmat ion of the neoplast ic origin of any effusio n that appears or worsens 
during treatment is required when the me asurable tum our has m et cri teria for response or 
stable disease. In such circumstances, the cy tology is necessary  to different iate between 
response / stable disease (an effusio n may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive 
disease (if the neoplas tic origin o f the fluid is confirm ed). Where cy tology findings are not 
available, any  effusi on that si gnificant ly worsens (fro m trace to l arge) or appearance of 
clinically significant effusio n (requi ring change in drug therapy ) during the study  treatm ent 
will be considered to be progression of NTL, or disease progression due to new lesio ns.
F3.8 Isotopic Bone Scan
Bone l esions i dentified on an isotopic bone scan at baseline and confirmed by CT, MRI, or 
x-ray at baseline shoul d be recorded as NTL and followed by  the same method as per baseline 
assessment.
In the D5161C00003 study  isotopi c bone scans may  be used as a m ethod of assessment to 
ident ify the presence o f new bone lesio ns at fo llow-up vi sits. New lesio ns will be recorded 
where a positive hot -spot that was not present on the baseline bone scan assessment is 
ident ified on a bone scan performed at any t ime during the study . The Invest igator should 
consider the posit ive hot -spot to be a significant new site of malignant disease and represent 
true disease progr ession in order to record the new lesion. Confirmat ion by CT, MRI, and 
x-ray is recommended where bone scan findings are equivocal.
F3.9 FDG -PET Scan
In the D5161C00003 study  FDG -PET scans m ay be used as a m ethod for i dentifying new 
lesions, according wi th the following al gorithm: new lesio ns will be recorded where there is 
positive FDG uptake* not present on baseline FDG -PET scan or in a locat ion corresponding 
to a new l esion on CT/MRI at the sam e follow-up visit. If there is no baseline FDG -PET scan 
available, and no evidence of new lesio ns on CT/MRI scans then fo llow-up CT/MRI 
assessments should be cont inued, scheduled as per protocol or clinical indicated, in order to 
confirm new lesio ns.
*A posi tive FDG -PET scan lesio n shoul d be reported only  when an uptake greater than twice 
that of the surrounding tissue is observed.

Version 7.0
Date 14 April 2 023
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 124 (131 )F4.1 Schedule of Evaluation
Baseline assessments should enco mpass all areas of known predilection for metastases in the 
disease under evaluation and should addit ionally in vestigate areas that m ay be involved based 
on si gns and symptom s of individual pat ients and should be performed no more than 28 day s 
before the start of study  treatm ent (refer to Study  Plan and Section 5.1from the study  
protocol ). Follow -up assessments will be performed every  8 weeks (± 7 days) (relat ive to 
study  enrolment) up to 3.5 years (1277 day s) and every  10 weeks (± 14 day s) from Day 1278 
to progression as defined by RECIST 1.1 even if a patient discont
inues treatment prior to 
progression or receives other anticancer treatment. Any other sites at which new disease is 
suspected should also be adequately imaged at follow -up.
If an unscheduled as sessment was performed and the pat ient has not progressed, every  attem pt 
shoul d be made to perform  the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visit s. This schedule 
is to be followed in order to minimise any  unintenti onal bias caused by  som e patients bei ng 
assessed at a different frequency  than other pati ents.
F4.2 Target Lesions
F4.2.1 Documentation of Target Lesions
A maximum of 5 measurable lesio ns, with a maximum o f 2 lesions per organ (including 
lymph nodes), representative of all lesions invo lved should be iden tified as TL at baseline. 
Target l esions shoul d be selected on the basis of their size (longest diameter for non -nodal  
lesions or short axis for nodal lesio ns), but in addit ion shoul d be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesio n 
does not l end i tself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest 
lesion, which can be measured reproducibly, should be selected.
The site and locat ion of each TL should be documented as well as the longest diameter for 
non-nodal  lesions (or short axis for lymph nodes). All measurements should be recorded in 
millimetres. At baseline the sum o f the diameters for all TL will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum of dia meters. At follow -up visi ts the sum of diameters for all TL will be 
calculated and reported as the follow -up sum  of diam eters.
Special cases:
 For TL measurable in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the longest diameter. For 
pathol ogical lymph nodes measurabl e in 2 or 3 dimensions, always report the short 
axis.
 If the CT/MRI slice thickness used is > 5mm, the minimum size of measurable 
disease at baseline should be twice the slice thickness of the baseline scan.
 If a lesio n has co mpletely disappeared, the longest di ameter shoul d be recorded as 
0mm.

parts.
 If 2 or more TL merge then the sum of the diameters of the combined lesio n shoul d 
be recorded for one of the lesio ns and 0 mm  recorded for the other lesion(s).
 If a TL i s believed to be present and is faint ly seen but too sm all to measure, a 
defaul t value of 5 mm  shoul d be assi gned. If an accurate measure can be given, this 
shoul d be recorded, even if it is below 5 mm.

of the si ze of  the l esion.
 When a TL has had any intervent ion eg, radi otherapy , embo lisation, surgery , during 
the study , the si ze of the TL should st ill be provi ded where possi ble.
F4.2.2 Evaluation of Target Lesions
This sect ion provi des the definit ions of the criteria used to determine object ive tumour visit 
response for TL.
Table F 2 Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all tar get lesions since baseline. Any 
pathological lymph nodes selected as target lesions must have a 
reduction in short axis to < 10 mm
Partial Response (PR) At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of TL, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of dia meters
Stable Disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for progressive disease
Progressive Disease (PD) At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5mm
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant if any of the target lesions were not assessed or not 
evaluable or had a lesion intervention at this visit. Note: If the sum 
of diameters meets the PD criteria, PD overrides not evaluable as a 
target lesion response

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 126 (131 )F4.3 Non-target Lesions
F4.3.1 Evaluation of Non -target Lesions
All oth er lesio ns (or sites of disease) not recorded as TL should be ident ified as NTL at 
baseline. Measurements are not required for these lesio ns, but their status should be fo llowed 
at subsequent visits. At each visit an overall assessment of the NTL response shoul d be 
recorded by  the Investi gator. Thi s sect ion provi des the defini tions of  the cri teria used to 
determine and record overall response for NTL at the invest igational site at each visit.
Table F 3 Evaluation of Non -target Lesion s
Complete Response (CR) Disappearance of all non -target lesions since baseline. All lymph 
nodes must be non -pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD Persistence of one or more NTL.
Progression (PD) Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal 
progr ession may be due to an important progression in one lesion only 
or in several lesions. In all cases the progression MUST be clinically 
significant for the physician to consider changing (or stopping) 
therapy.
Not Evaluable (NE) Only relevant when one or some of the non -target lesions were not 
assessed and, in the Investigator's opinion, they are not able to provide 
an evaluable overall non -target lesion assessment at this visit.
To achieve ‘unequivocal progressio n’ on the basis of non -target l esions, there m ust be an 
overall level o f substant ial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target lesio ns, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficient ly to merit 
discontinuat ion oftherapy . A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target l esions is 
usually not sufficient to qualify  for unequivocal progression status.
F4.4 New Lesions
Details o f any new lesio ns will also be recorded with the date of assessment. The presence of 
one or more new lesio ns is assessed as progression.
A lesio n identified at a follow -up assessment in an anatomical locat ion that was not scanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesio n and will indicate disease progression.
The finding of a new lesio n shoul dbe unequivocal: ie, not attributable to differences in 
scanning technique, change in imaging modalit y or findings thought to represent something 
other than tumour.
If a new lesio n is equivocal, for example because of its small size, the treatment and tumo ur 
assessments should be cont inued unt il the new lesion has been confirmed. If repeat scans

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 127 (131 )confirm there is a new lesio n, then the progression date should be declared using the date of 
the init ial scan.
F4.5 Symptomatic Deterioration
Symptom atic deteri oration is not a descriptor of an object ive response: it is a reason for 
stopping study  therapy .
Patients wi th ‘symptom atic deterioration’ requiring discont inuat ion of treatment without 
objective evidence of disease progression at that time should continue to undergo tumour 
assessments where possible unt il objective disease progression is observed.
F4.6 Evaluation of Overall Visit Response
The overall visit response will be derived using the algorithm shown in Table F 4.
Table F 4 Overall Visit Response
Target lesions Non-target lesions New lesions Overall response
CR CR No CR
CR NA No CR
CR Non-CR/Non -PD No PR
CR NE No PR
PR Non-D or NE No PR
SD Non-PD or NE No SD
NE Non-PD or NE No NE
PD Any Yes or No PD
Any PD Yes or No PD
Any Any Yes PD
CR = complete response, PR = partial response, SD = stable disease, PD = progressive disease, NE = not 
evaluable, NA = not applicable (only relevant if there were no NTLs at baseline).

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 128 (131 )Appendix GDefinition of Women of Childbearing Potential and Highly 
Effective Contraceptive Methods
Definition of Women of Childbearing Potential
Women of Childbearing Potential (WO CBP):
Women between menarche and menopause who have not been permanent ly or surgically 
sterilised and are capable of procreation.
Women NOT of Childbearing Potential:
Women who are perm anent ly or surgically sterilised or postmenopausal (definit ions bel ow):
Perm anent sterilisa tionincludes hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy and/or bilateral 
salpingectomy  but excludes bilateral  tubal  occl usion. Tubal  occl usion is considered a highly  
effect ive method of birth control but does not absolutely exclude possibilit y of pregnanc y. 
(The term  occl usion refers to both occluding and ligating techniques that do not physically  
remove the ovi ducts).
 Women who have undergone tubal occlusio n should be managed on trials as if they 
are of W OCBP (eg, undergo pregnancy testing, as required by the study  protocol )
 Women will  be considered postmenopausal if they are amenorrhoeic for 12 months 
without an al ternat ive medical cause. The following age -specific requirements 
apply:
─Women under 50 y ears ol d will  be consi dered postmenopausal if they have been 
amenorrhoei c for 12 m onths or more fo llowing cessation o f exogenous hormonal 
treatm ents and wi th luteinising horm one and fo llicle -stimulat ing hormone levels in 
the postm enopausal  range
─Women 50 y ears of age or m ore will be considered postmenopausal i f they have 
been amenorrhoeic for 12 months or more fo llowing cessat ion of all exogenous 
horm onal treatm ents
Highly effective contraception methods
Highly effect ive method of birth control is defined in Note 3 in Internat ional Conference on 
Harm onisat ion Guidance M3 (Nonclinical Safet y Studi es for the Conduct of Human Clinical 
Trials for Pharmaceut icals) as one that results in a low failure rate (eg, less than 1 percent per 
year) when used consistent ly and correctly .
Note that women should have been stable on thei r chosen m ethod of bi rth control  for a 
minimum o f 2 weeks before entering the trial. Generic names and examples of trade names 
are given. As trade names may vary , Invest igators should check the generic name of any 
contraception to ensure suitabilit y.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 129 (131 )Highly effect ive contraception methods are:
 Total  sexual abst inence (abst inence must be for the total duration o f the trial and the 
follow-up period)
 Vasectomised sexual partner plus male condo m (with patient assurance that partner 
received post-vasectomy confirmat ion of azoospermia)
 Tubal occlusio n plus m ale condom
 Intrauterine device (IUD) –provided co ils are copper -banded, plus male condom
 Intrauterine system (IUS) levonorgestrel IUS (eg, Mirena), plus male condo m
 Medroxy progesterone inject ions (Depo -Provera) plus male condo m
 Etonogestrel implants (eg, Implanon, Norplan) plus male condo m
 Norm al and l ow-dose combined oral contraceptive pills, plus male condom
 Norel gestromin / ethinyl oestradio l transdermal system plus male condom
 Intrav aginal  device (eg, ethinyl oestradiol and etonogestrel) plus male condom
 Cerazette (desogestrel) plus male condom (Cerazette is current ly the only highly 
efficacious progesterone -based pill)
Unacceptable Contraception Methods
The fo llowing m ethods are cons idered not to be highly effect ive and are therefore not 
acceptable contraceptive methods in AstraZeneca clinical trials:
 Triphasic combined oral  contraceptives
 All progesterone -only pills except, Cerazette
 All barri er methods, if intended to be used alone
 Non-copper containing IUD
 Fertilit y awareness methods
 Coitus interruptus

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 130 (131 )Appendix HChanges Related to Mitigation of Study Disruptions Due to 
Cases of Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public Health 
Crisis
Changes below should be implemented only during study  disrupti ons due to any  of or a 
combinat ion of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (eg, during quarant ines and 
resul ting site closures, regional travel restrictions and considerat ions if site personnel o r study  
patients beco me infected with SARS -CoV -2 or similar pandemic infect ion) during which 
patients m ay not wi sh to or m ay be unable to vi sit the study  site for study  visit s. These 
changes should only be implemented if allowable by lo cal/regi onal guideli nes and fo llowing 
notification fro m the Sponsor and instructions on how to perform these procedures will be 
provi ded at the time of implementation.
Please note that during civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis, so me study  
assessments and procedures may  not be conducted due to internat ional or local po licies or 
guidelines, hospital or clinic restrict ions and other measures implemented to ensure the 
patient’s safet y. If in doubt, pl ease contact the AZ Study  Physician.
H 1 Reconsent of Study Pati ents During Study Interruptions
During study  interrupti ons, i t may not be possible for the patients to complete study  visits and 
assessments on -site and al ternat ive means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be 
necessary , eg, rem ote vi sits. Reconsent should be obtained for the alternat ive means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in the sect ions below. Local and regional regulat ions and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study  patients shoul d be checked and fo llowed. Reconsent may  be verbal  if 
allowed by  local and regi onal guidelines (note, i n the case of verbal reconsent the ICF should 
be signed at the patient’s next contact with the study site). Visit ing the study  sitesfor the sol e 
purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avo ided.
H 2 Rescreening of Patients to Reconfirm Study Eligibility
Addit ional rescreening for screen failure due to study  disrupti on can be performed in 
previously screened pat ients. The Invest igator shou ld confirm this wit h the designated Study  
Physician.
In addit ion, during study  disrupt ion there may be a delay between confirming eligibilit y of a 
patient and ei ther enrolment into the study  or commencing of dosing with study  interventi on. 
If this delay  isoutsi de the screening window specified in Table 1 and Table 2 , the pati ent will 
need to be rescreened to reconfirm eligibilit y before commencing study  procedures. This will 
provi de another opportunit y to rescreen a patient in addit ion to that detailed in Sect ion3.7.1 . 
The procedures detailed in Table 1 and Table 2 must be undertaken to confirm eligibilit y 
using the same rando mization number as for the patient.

 Amendment 3  Amendment number:  
Rationale/background for changes:  
 
The protocol has been amended to reflect the following changes and provide the 
following clarifications / corrections.  
 
The Bisgaard and Jackson asthma case definitions were adapted so as to integrate 
asthma treatment adv ances while preserving the case definitions’ core intent.  
 
The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) asthma case 
definitions, which facilitate a wider range of international results comparisons, were 
added.  
 
Throughout the docume nt, text has been consolidated and clarified for consistency with 
these changes and to better facilitate uniform, harmonized implementation of the 
protocol. Beginning with Section 2.0, text pertaining to the primary study has been  
shaded in grey  to differe ntiate it from text pertaining to the extension study. Some 
details regarding (a) recruitment into the primary study and (b) primary study visits and 
procedures have been moved from the body of the document to newly created 
Appendices.  
 
Text that has been added or moved appears in boldface italics . A detailed summary of 
changes (including deletions) appears in Appendix G.

 15-DEC -2017  9 SYNOPSIS  
Detailed  Title  A prospective, epidemiological, interventional, multi -country 
based, cohort study to assess the disease burden of respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV) associated, suspected lower respiratory 
tract infections (LRTIs) in newborns, from birth up to 2 years of 
age and population attributable risk percent of RSV LRTI on  the 
development of wheeze and asthma from birth up to 6 years of 
age. 
Rationale for the 
study (Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  This study aims to assess the incidence an d associated 
healthcare utilization of RSV -associated, suspected LRTI 
in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years 
of age, and also to assess the accuracy of a newly 
developed LRTI case definition and severity scale , 
compared to two existing  scales developed by the World 
Health Organization (WHO) [ Modjarrad, 2016] and 
Nokes , 2008 . 
 
This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI 
in early life (up to 2 years of age) accounts for the total 
burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth bi rthday, 
and test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – 
those of Bisgaard, Jackson and International Study of 
Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC).  
 
The LRTI case definition and severity scale to be used in this 
study has been developed as a consensus model derived from 
existing definitions in the literature, and existing guidelines by 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinical staff, taking into account the 
advice of a panel of international RSV experts.  
 
Considering asthma case definitions, this study anticipates that 
one (Bisgaard) will be more specific and another (Jackson) 
more sensitive. Although it is likely that the third symptom - 
based case definition (ISAAC ) will be the most sensitive and 
least specific of all three definitions, its incorporation will 
facilitate wider international results comparisons.  
 
If, in future, a maternal and/or pediatric RSV vaccine is 
introduced, results of this study may be used to  evaluate post - 
vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI and/or wheeze 
and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

Primary study 
(Amended 15 -DEC - 
2017)  Co-Primary  
In a cohort of infants followed -up from birth up to 2 years of 
age: 
• To determine the total health burden* of  RSV -associated 
RTI with a suspicion of involvement of the lower 
respiratory  tract.  
 
*Health burden refers to burden of the disease imposed on the 
study population in terms of incidence of the disease and 
associated healthcare utilization in any healthcare setting.  
 
• To assess the performance of the LRTI case definition and 
severity scale for RSV associated  cases.  
Secondary  
In a cohort of infants foll owed -up from birth up to 2 years of 
age: 
• To determine the total health burden of  non-RSV -associated 
RTI with a suspicion of involvement of the lower 
respiratory  tract.  
• To evaluate the association between RSV -associated LRTI, 
RSV -associated severe LRTI and RSV neutralizing 
antibodies in the baseline cord blood samples collected from 
subjects, at  birth.  
• To determine the prevalence of RSV infection, at 2, 4, 6, 12, 
18 and 24 months in a randomly selected sub -cohort of 
subjects by assessing antibodies in  serum.  
• To assess the between calendar year variability in the 
incidence rates of RSV -associated  LRTI.  
Tertiary  
In a cohort of infants followed -up from birth up to 2 years of 
age: 
• To explore the association of co -infections with the 
incidence of RSV -associated LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as 
determined by the LRTI case definition and severity scale) 
using xTAG™ respiratory viral panel (RVP) fast  assay.  
• To explore the association of RSV and other respiratory 
viruses with the incidence of LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as 
determined by the LRTI case definition and severity  scale) 
using xTAG™ RVP Fast  assay.

(as determined by the LRTI case definition and severity 
scale).  
• To explo re the impact of changes to the symptoms and 
threshold levels of symptoms in the LRTI case definition 
and severity  scale.  
• To assess the impact of potential RSV risk factors (e.g. 
complications at birth, family history of respiratory disease, 
living environ ment and household composition, breast 
feeding, passive smoking, day care attendance) on the 
incidence and severity of RSV -associated  LRTI.  
• To explore the impact of variations in cord -blood sample 
collection variables on the stability of test  results.

wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday associated 
with RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of  life. 
• To determine the population attributable risk percent of 
recurrent wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday 
associated with RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years  of 
life. 
Tertiary  
 
In a cohort of infants followed -up from birth up to 6 years of 
age:

Discussion of 
study design 
(Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  Surveillance Plan:  
• Surveillance for RSV Lower Respiratory Tract Infection  (RSV 
LRTI), and wheeze during the Primary Study  period.  
• Surve illance for wheeze and asthma during the extension study 
period.  
Safety Follow -up: 
Study Procedure related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) to be 
reported throughout the study.  
The multi -country design of both the primary and extension studies 
will provide ro bust, multinational estimates of the incidence of RSV - 
associated LRTI during the first two years of life and assess the 
amount of wheeze and asthma that may be attributable to those early 
RSV -LRTI infections.  
The Primary study will determine the incidence  and associated 
healthcare utilization of RSV -associated LRTIs in infants from birth 
up to the age of 2 years, and assess the performance of a new LRTI 
case definition and severity scale. Using a cohort representing the 
general population of newborn infant s, the study is designed to 
identify RSV -associated LRTI cases at any severity, and will not be 
limited to those that require hospitalization and/or other essential 
medical care. This will provide a comprehensive and accurate measure 
of the overall burden of disease, whereas many previous case -control 
or hospital -based cohort studies were limited to the hospitalized cases 
of RSV -associated  LRTI.  
The association of other respiratory viruses with RSV -associated 
LRTI and/or severe LRTI, and the impact of poten tial RSV risk 
factors on the incidence and severity of RSV -associated LRTI will 
also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ 
demography and lifestyle factors will be collecte d at baseline, and 
followed up quarterly for changes, during the regular follow -up 
contacts.

Endpoints for 
the Primary 
Study 
(Amended 15 - 
DEC -2017)  At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as soon as possible 
thereafter), surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopped. Consenting, 
eligible subjects from participating study centers will be enrolled in 
the study extension and followed for the occurrence of wheeze and 
asthma. This will permit an assessment of the proportion of wheeze 
and asthma from birth until the sixth birthday that may be attributable 
to RSV LRTI and RSV infection in the first two years of life. It will 
also test the performance of the different asthma case definitions.  
Target enrollment for the primary study will be 2400 subjects to 
obtain approximately 1920 fully evaluable subjects at primary study 
completion.  
Target enrollment for extension period will be maximum 2400 
subjects (all su bjects participating in the primary study, meeting all 
inclusion and no exclusion criteria for the extension ). 
Co-Primary  
• Occurrence of RSV as confirmed by  RT-qPCR.  
• Occurrence of different types of healthcare  utilization*.  
*Healthcare utilization includes primary, secondary and tertiary care 
settings such as self -care with over -the-counter [OTC] drugs, general 
practitioner (GP) visits, emergency room (ER) visits, hospital visits, 
etc. 
• Occurrence of LRTI/severe LRTI as classified by the LRTI case 
definition and severity  scale.  
• Occurrence of LRTI/severe LRTI as classified by the existing 
comparator LRTI case definition by WHO and by Nokes et al. 
Secondary  
• Levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies in the cord blood samples 
collected at  birth.  
• Levels of RSV neutralizing antibodies in the blood samples 
collected at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.  
• Occurrence of LRTI/severe LRTI cases as classified by the  LRTI 
case d efinition and severity scale, in the subgroups of subjects 
recruited from Months 1 -6 and  13-18.

1.1. Background (Amended  15-DEC -2017)  
 
1.1.1.  RSV 
 
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of respiratory diseases. RSV is a 
highly contagious seasonal pathogen that is transmitted from person -to-person via direct 
or close contact with contaminated secretions, including respirato ry droplets or fomites 
[Canducci , 2008]. RSV belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae and is one of the only two 
human pneumoviruses that have been currently recognized (the other being 
metapneumovirus). There are two major gene tic RSV subtypes, A and B. These subtypes 
co-circulate, and the predominance of one over the other varies by year and geographic 
location [ Graham , 2011].  
 
RSV is found across the globe with incidences varying between countries and regions 
and even within a country or a region over multiple seasons. In areas of the inner tropics 
with perennial high rainfall, RSV seasonality is less clear -cut. Countries close to the 
equator have a distinct pattern of RSV transmission, with most cases appearing in one 
half of the year, but not in the other. But neither temperature nor rainfall appears to be the 
main determinant of the timing of these outbreaks [ Weber , 1998]. Seasonal epidemics of 
RSV occur most frequently in the cold season in regions with temperate and 
Mediterranean climates and in the rainy season in tropical countries with seasonal 
rainfall. Roughly the RSV season runs from Octob er to March in the temperate areas of 
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and from May to September in the Southern Hemisphere 
(SH). But the exact timing of RSV circulation varies by geographic location and also by 
year [ Mullins , 2003; Weber , 1998; Law, 2002].  
 
RSV infections result in high rates of hospitalization in infants, a large disease burden 
among infants and young children, and excess mortality in the elderly [ Graham , 2011]. 
RSV infects 50 -70% of infants during the first year of life and essentially all children will 
have had an RSV infection by their third birthday [ Hall, 2004]. In the early months of 
life, infants may have protection against RSV through the maternal antibodies transferred 
to them during pregnancy. High titers of maternally derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies 
[Roca , 2002] have been shown to be inversely ass ociated with the incidence of RSV 
associated -acute LRTI during the first 6 months of life, whereas incomplete transfer of 
maternally derived RSV -neutralizing antibodies has been implicated in the increased risk 
of severe RSV infection in preterm infants [ de Sierra , 1993]. Previous infection with 
RSV does not prevent subsequent infections. Therefore, re -infection with RSV occurs 
throughout an individual’s lifetime and is common in all age groups [ Simoes, 1999; 
Krilov , 2011].  
 
Globally, it is estimated that in children below 5 years of age, RSV causes >30 million 
acute lower respiratory infections (LRTI) each year resulting in more than 3 million 
hospitalizations, maki ng it the most common cause of hospitalization for LRTI or all 
cause from any single pathogen in this age group [ Nair, 2010]. RSV is the most common 
cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children less than 1 year of age wor ldwide, with

 15-DEC -2017  30 highest risk in children less than 6 months of age [ Nair, 2010; Langley , 2011]. A United 
States (US) based study conducted in children less than 18 years of age, found RSV in 
58% of the hospitalizations for LRTI compared to parainfluenza virus 1 -3 in 17%, 
influenza A/B in 21%, adenovirus in 2% and rhinovirus in 2% [ Henrickson , 2004]. On a 
community level, a US day -care based study assessing the causes of respiratory tract 
infection (RTI) in children less than 1 year of age found that RSV infection was present 
in 11% of the cases, compared to rhinov irus in 35%, adenovirus in 22%, human 
coronavirus in 15%, parainfluenzavirus in 12%, human meta -pneumovirus in 4% and 
influenza A in 2% [ Fairchok , 2010]. This difference between community and hospital 
proportions of RSV relat ed infections indicates the propensity of RSV to cause more 
serious cases of RTI, mainly LRTI, compared to other viruses.  
 
Viral co -infections with RSV are also common. Evidence about the severity of co - 
infections compared to single viral infections is co nflicting, as the severity of co -infection 
may depend on the pathogens involved [ Fairchok , 2010]. In a study conducted on dual 
respiratory infections it was concluded that dual viral RTIs had higher hospitalization 
rates than single infections [ Drews , 1997]. Some examples of viruses which may exist as 
co-pathogens with RSV include, human Metapneumoviruses, human Bocaviruses and 
human Coronaviruses [ Canducci , 2008].  
 
Currently available estimates of RSV disease burden are most often centred on healthcare 
usage, particularly RSV -associat ed hospitalizations. Also, there is no widely supported  
guideline from regulatory authorities or transnational expert bodies on a case definition of 
RSV -associated LRTI in children. As a result, prospective, cohort -based epidemiol ogical 
studies using a consistent case definition for RSV -associated LRTI are rare and there is 
no obvious case definition to be used uniformly as the outcome measure in clinical trials. 
Although the hospitalized cases represent the most severe cases of RS V disease, variation 
between medical practice policies, quality of the healthcare system and access to 
adequate healthcare can all influence whether a subject with RSV -associated LRTI is 
hospitalized or not. Therefore, hospitalization is not an ideal deter minant of the disease 
severity and a more objective scoring system for the disease severity is needed. Several 
studies have attempted to develop a severity score or a model, but this has not lead to a 
validated model, accepted as the universal gold standar d [Nokes , 2008].  
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI 
case definition [ Modjarrad , 2016]. The latter includes clinical features considered to be 
objec tive, easily standardized, generalizable across settings, and generally accepted 
markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
1.1.2.  Asthma  
 
Infant respiratory viral infection and childhood asthma are the most common acut e 
and chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life RSV LRTIs being 
strongly associated with increased asthma risk.

 15-DEC -2017  31 Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors 
and/or events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma 
inception in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be 
defined best by the concept of cytokine dysregulation; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and 
some form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time - 
period in the development of the immune system or the lung [ Leman ske, 2002].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by the population - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the cumulative 
incidence of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and 
approximately 9 to 17% in the second year of life. Among infants with LRTI, the 
prevalence o f RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of life. Thus, 
the phenotype of asthma after infant RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of early 
childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk estimated at about 13% in 
several diverse popul ations [ Feldman , 2015].  
 
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this first important line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response re lationship between infant respiratory viral infection 
severity and asthma risk, with increasing infant infection severity associated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [ Feldman , 2015].  
 
The Childhood Origi ns of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and 
define the importance of these three factors on asthma pathogenesis and to test 
different asthma case classifications [ Lemanske , 2002; Lema nske , 2005; Bisgaard , 
2011; Jackson , 2008; Jackson , 2012; Bønnelykke , 2015]. These studies have used 
similar albeit slightly diff erent case definitions on asthma diagnosis. The International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) takes a slightly different parent - 
based questionnaire approach toward assessing asthma prevalence in young children.  
 
These definitions are wi dely used in epidemiological literature of asthma etiology in 
children. The Bisgaard definition [ Bisgaard , 2011] has multiple criteria that are 
assessed by the physician from records. Therefore the advantage of this definitio n is 
that the same objective criteria are applied to ascertain each case of asthma. However, 
its application may be challenging in some settings if routine medical records do not 
fully capture the necessary information in source. The Jackson definition [ Jackson , 
2008] includes the criteria of health care provider (HCP) diagnosis of asthma and 
prescription of 2 agonists. This definition is therefore influenced by any differences in 
local practice of asthma diagnosis and manage ment of wheeze. However, its advantage 
is that it captures the reality of diagnosis and treatment. ISAAC uses simple, robust, 
primarily symptom -based questions that are administered solely to the parents.  
ISAAC’s strength is that its definitions are not af fected by differences in local asthma 
treatment practices; however, its lack of clinical case confirmation may decrease its 
precision. The ISAAC questionnaire has been used to assess pediatric asthma 
prevalence in at least 42 countries across the globe [ Pearce , 2007].

 15-DEC -2017  32 1.2. Rationale for the study (Amended  15-DEC -2017)  
This study aims to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of RSV - 
associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of 
age, and a lso to assess the accuracy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and 
severity scale , compared to two existing scales developed by the World Health  
Organization (WHO) [ Modjarrad , 2016 ] and [ Nokes , 2008 ]. 
This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI in early life (up to 2 years of 
age) accounts for the total burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth bi rthday, and 
test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – those of Bisgaard, Jackson, and  
ISAAC.  
The LRTI case definition and severity scale to be used in this study has been developed 
as a cons ensus model derived from existing definitions in the literature, and existing 
guidelines by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinical staff, taking into account the advice of a 
panel of international RSV experts.  
Considering asthma case definitions, this study antici pates that Bisgaard will be more 
specific and Jackson more sensitive. Although it is likely that the ISAAC symptom - 
based case definitions will be the most sensitive and least specific of all three 
definitions [ Yang , 2011], its incorporation will facilitate wider international results 
comparisons. Hence, this study will assess the performance of the different case 
definitions since this will help planning for phase 3 clinical trials of RSV vaccines.  
If, in future, a maternal and/or pediatric RSV vaccine is introduced, results of this 
study may be used to evaluate post -vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI 
and/or wheeze and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

3.2. Discussion of study  design  
The multi -country design of both the primary and extension studies will provide robust, 
multinational  estimates of the incidence of RSV -associated LRTI during the first two 
years of life and assess the amount of wheeze and asthma that may be attributable to 
those early RSV -LRTI infections.  
 
 
3.2.2.  Extension Study  
 
At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as soon as possible thereafter), 
surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopped. Consenting, eligible subjects from 
participating study centers will be enrolled in the study e xtension and followed for the 
occurrence of wheeze and asthma (applying 3 different asthma case definitions). This 
will permit an assessment of the proportion of wheeze and asthma from birth until the 
sixth birthday that may be attributable to RSV LRTI and  RSV infection in the first two 
years of life. It will also test the performance of the different asthma case definitions 
(Table 5 ). 
 
4. CASE DEFINITIONS (AMENDED  15-DEC -2017)  
 The Primary study will determine the incide nce and associated healthcare utilization of 
RSV -associated LRTIs in infants from birth up to the age of 2 years, and assess the 
performance of a new LRTI case definition and severity scale. Using a cohort 
representing the general population of newborn inf ants, the study is designed to identify 
RSV -associated LRTI cases at any severity, and will not be limited to those that require 
hospitalization and/or other essential medical care. This will provide a comprehensive 
and accurate measure of the overall burd en of disease, whereas many previous case - 
control or hospital -based cohort studies were limited to the hospitalized cases of RSV - 
associated LRTI.  
The association of other respiratory viruses with RSV -associated LRTI and/or severe  
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the var ious analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  Primary Study  3.2.1.

Normal ranges for RR and Sa02  Table 3  Potential LRTI:  
 
Suspected involvement of the lower respiratory tract if a child with clinical signs of RTI, 
defined as either a runny nose, blocked nose or cough, is believed to have difficulties in 
breathing in the opinion of the investigator/study staff, based on the sy mptoms reported 
by the parent(s)/LAR(s) during the surveillance phone contacts. Difficulty in breathing as 
suspected by the investigator/study staff through reported symptoms will then be 
objectively confirmed by the investigator/study staff by means of pu lse oximetry and RR 
at an examination visit. If at least one of these parameters is outside of the pre -defined 
normal range (Refer to Table 3 ), the case will be considered as an LRTI for the 
surveillance part of the study.  
 
A subject is considered to have difficulty in breathing if he/she shows signs of:  
 
• Wheezing or  stridor  
• Tachypnea  
• Flaring (of  nostrils)  
• Chest  indrawings

RR= Respiratory Rate; SaO2= Blood Oxygen Saturation; min = minutes  
 
During the surveillance for LRTI, any potential LRTI that is not found to meet the criteria 
for an LRTI may need a subsequent objective assessment by the investigator/study staff.  
 
Note: The investigator/study staff will do an initial assessment of a case reported for the 
examination visit as either RTI or LRTI, only to determine further study activities. The 
final classification of all the cases reported as either, RTI, LRTI or seve re LRTI will be 
done during statistical analyses as per the definitions given below.  
 
CASE DEFINITIONS FOR DATA ANALYSIS:  
 
LRTI case definition and severity scale  
 
During the analysis of the study on the full dataset available for  each case, all cases 
identified during the surveillance for LRTI will be definitively classified as either RTI, 
LRTI or severe LRTI according to the LRTI case definition and severity scale described 
in Table 4 , and also accor ding to the classification of WHO and the classification used by 
Nokes et al [Modjarrad , 2016; Nokes , 2004] (see below).

Case definition of LRTI and severe LRTI by Nokes et al.  
 
LRTI is diagnosed when a child has a history of acute cough or difficulty in breathing 
and  1 of the following:  
• Fast breathing for age (  60 breaths/minimum if the child is < 2 months old or  50 
breaths/minimum if the child is 2 –11 months old)  
• Indrawing,  or 
• Low oxygen  saturation  (< 90%)  by pulse  oxymetry  or inability  to feed (prostration  or 
unconsciousness), when accompanied by a clinical diagnosis of LRTI or 
bronchiolitis.  
Severe LRTI was diagnosed when a child had LRTI meeting second and/or third bullet  
above.  
 
Case definition of LRTI by WHO (2015) [ Modjarrad , 2016]  
 
LRTI is diagnosed when a child <5 years presents with cough and/or difficulty in 
breathing has the following symptoms:  
 
• Fast breathing, (> 60 per minute in a child < 2 months of age, > 50 per minute in a 
child 2 to 11 months of age and; > 40 per minute in a child 12 to 59 months of age), 
or 
• Oxygen saturation < 95% by pulse  oximetry.  
Severe LRTI is diagnosed when a child has  LRTI and 1 or more of the following features 
of severe disease:  
 
• Oxygen saturation < 93% by pulse  oximetry.  
• Lower chest wall  in-drawing.  Table  4 LRTI case definition and severity  scale

Detection of RSV by reverse transcription -quantitative real time polymerase chain 
reaction (RT -qPCR) in swab sample collected within 72 hours of first identifica tion of a 
potential LRTI by the investigator/study staff during an active or passive surveillance 
study contact.  
 
Start date of the LRTI case:  
 
The start date of the case is defined as the point at which the LRTI was first identified as 
a potential LRTI by the investigator/study staff during an active or passive surveillance 
study contact, and if the LRTI is subsequently confirmed by the investiga tor/study staff 
(according to the LRTI case definition and severity scale for surveillance) during the 
examination visit (off -site/site).  
 
End date of the LRTI case:  
 
End date of the case is defined as the point at which the subject is considered symptom - 
free of difficulty in breathing, based on the data provided by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in the 
diary card and any additional data obtained from healthcare providers involved in 
management of the case.  
 
New case of LRTI:  
 
A new, single case of LRTI is any occur rence of an LRTI case meeting the LRTI case 
definition and severity scale with an interval of at least 7 symptom free days since the last 
episode of LRTI that was diagnosed.  
 
4.2. Extension  Study

6. CONDUCT OF THE  STUDY  
 
6.1. Regulatory and ethical considerations, including  the 
informed consent  process  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Guideline for  Good Clinical Practice (GCP) or other applicable 
guidelines, all applicable subject privacy requirements and the guiding principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki.  
 
The study has been designed and will be conducted in accordance with the ICH 
Harmonized Tr ipartite Guideline for clinical investigation of medicinal products in the 
paediatric population (ICH E11) and all other applicable ethical guidelines.  
 
GSK will obtain favourable opinion/approval to conduct the study prior to a site initiating 
the study i n that country or will document that neither a favourable opinion nor an 
approval to conduct the study is needed.  
 
Conduct of the study includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
 
• Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) review and 
favourable opinion/approval of study protocol and any subsequent  amendments.  
• Subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) informed  consent.  
• Investigator reporting requirements as stated in the  protocol.  
GSK Biologicals will provide full details of the above procedures to the investigator, 
either verbally, in writing, or both.  
 
Freely given and written (or witnessed thumb printed consent in case of an illiterate 
subject) informed consent must be ob tained from each subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) or the 
impartial witness, as appropriate, prior to participation in the study.  
 
GSK Biologicals will prepare a model Informed Consent Form (ICF) which will embody 
the applicable ICH GCP or other applicable guidel ines, and GSK Biologicals required 
elements. While it is strongly recommended that this model ICF be followed as closely as 
possible, the informed consent requirements given in this document are not intended to 
pre-empt any local regulations which require additional information to be disclosed for 
informed consent to be legally effective. Clinical judgement, local regulations and 
requirements should guide the final structure and content of the local version of the ICF.  
 
The investigator has the final respon sibility for the final presentation of the ICF,

Active surveillance: Follow -up contacts will be made by the investigator/study staff with the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the 
subjects at predefined intervals (to be confirmed based on the local settings) from Visit 2 up to study conclusion.  
Passive surveillance: Follow -up contacts made by the parent(s)/LAR(s) with the study investigator/study staff in case of 
development of RTI symptoms or increase in severity of existing symptoms after the previous reporting of the 
initial symptoms.  
2 The ex amination visit (off -site/site) will be applicable only for subjects with a suspicion of LRTI.  
3 Whenever required healthcare utilization data should be completed or confirmed with the healthcare provider involved 
in the management of the case.  
4 Selected subjects will be randomized to the time point at which a single blood sample needs to be collected; 2, 4, 6, 
12, 18 or 24 months. The sample can be collected between the intervals of  1 week. E.g. Month 2  1 week, Month 4  
 1 week. Randomization will be done using a second phase application of SBIR.  
5 Refer to APPENDIX E for the active contact schedule.  
6 Diary card can be collected by mail or in person depending on local best practice.  
7 Visit 2 can take place anytime within 5 working days after birth.  
Refer to Section 6.5 for additional details.  
 
6.4.2.  Extension Study (approximately 2 years of age up to the 6th 
birthday)  
Table 8 presents the list of procedures for the extension study.  
Note that although extension study enrolment ideally occurs at the time of the subjects’ 
second birthdays, enrolment into, and first contact for, the extension study may tak e 
place at any time between the end of the primary study and the subject’s 6th birthday.  
After the first extension study contact, subjects will be contacted around the time of 
each subject’s birthday and (approximately) quarterly during the intervals betwe en (a) 
first contact and next birthday; (b) subsequent birthdays.  
Site staff may contact subjects more frequently than indicated in Table 8 if consistent 
with the language of the local ICF and considered necessary by the study  physician. 
Parents will be encouraged to seek a clinical assessment of their child in between 
quarterly contacts and/or during quarterly contacts whenever their child develops 
wheezing and/or breathing difficulties.  
Refer to Section 6.6 and the SPM for additional details .

6.5. Detailed description of study procedures for the Primary 
Study period (from birth up to 2 years of  age) 
 
6.5.1.  Informed consent  
 
The signed/witnessed/thumb printed informed consent of the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) 
must be obtained before study par ticipation. Refer to Section 6.1 for the requirements on 
how to obtain informed consent.  
 
• In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births ), an ICF needs to be signed  for 
each expected child before the start of  delivery.  
• In case of unexpected twins (or other multiple births ), only the children for whom an 
ICF has been signed before birth can be enrolled. This should occur as per the birth 
order.  
 
6.5.2.  Check inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable before  birth  
 
Check all applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable before birth as described 
in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.4.1  before enrollment. A pre -selected child who does not meet the 
eligibility criteria should be considered a screening failure.  
 
6.5.3.  Subject number allocation and registration in  SBIR -Screening  
 
Subject numbers will be assigned sequentially to subjects whose parent(s)/LAR(s) have 
consented for their child participation in the study, according to the range of subject  
numbers allocated to each study center.  
 
• In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births ), a subject number will be 
assigned sequentially to each child for whom the consent has been obtained, a s per 
the birth order, where the first born will be associated with the lowest subject 
number, the second born with the successive subject number,  etc. 
After obtaining the ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be entered in to 
the SBIR scree ning module. SBIR will control the recruitment rate as per an allocated 
target.  
 
6.5.4.  Collection of expected birth  date 
 
Record the expected delivery date as required in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
6.5.5.  Collection of cord blood sample  
 
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Management in the SPM for general handling of 
blood samples.  
 
A volume of up to approximately 10 mL of whole cord blood sample will be collected 
from all subjects at birth, which should yield up to approximately 3 mL of serum. In case

less than 3 mL of whole blood is collected, the subject will be considered a screening 
failure and the sample collected needs to be discarded according to local procedure.  
 
Details of the sample collection such as duration of processing steps and storage 
conditions need to be collected and recorded in the eCRF in order to allow adjustment for 
these variables in the primary analyses and to explore the impact of collection variables 
on the measured antibody titer.  
 
Cord blood samples collected will provide RS V- antibody levels in the child, at birth.  
 
6.5.6.  Check inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable after birth  and 
re-sign-off the  ICF 
 
Check all applicable inclusion and exclusion criteria applicable after birth as 
described in Sections 5.3.1  and 5.4.1  before enrollment.  
 
The informed consent should be updated with relevant personal identifiers as applicable 
by local requirements. The ICF should be re -signed off by the investigator/study staff and 
subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) and witness (when required) not later than 5 worki ng days 
after the birth of the subject.  
 
Any pre -selected subject not meeting the eligibility criteria should be considered a 
screening failure, and the cord blood sample collected should be discarded.  
 
6.5.7.  Collection of medical history, demographic and lifestyle 
characteristics  
 
Obtain the family medical history, demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the  subject 
as required by the eCRF, by interviewing parent(s)/LAR(s) and/or reviewing the medical  
records and record data collected in the subject’s eCRF. This includes family history of 
respiratory disease, living environment and household composition, breastfeeding, 
passive smok ing and day -care attendance.  
 
6.5.8.  Collection of data on child at birth and  delivery  
 
Information about the delivery and the newborn (including medical care provided 
immediately after birth and planned to be provided subsequently) should be collected 
from the parents/LAR and completed and/or confirmed from an original source accessed 
through a person involved in the delivery of the subject or from any authorized person 
representing the healthcare organization that is i n charge of the source and the collected 
data should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
 
6.5.9.  Registration in  SBIR -enrollment  
 
After obtaining the updated ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be 
entere d in to the SBIR enrollment module. SBIR will randomize the subject to a time 
point for blood sample collection if the subject is part of the sub -cohort the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should be informed about this allocation.

6.5.10.  Distribution of diary cards to record symptoms and healthcare 
utilization  
 
The investigator/study staff will provide diary cards to the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) as 
needed to record relevant symptoms and healthcare system utilization during the course 
of the case. The diary card provided needs to be filled by the parent(s)/LAR(s) only in 
case the investigator/study staff concludes tha t their child has developed an RTI with 
suspicion of difficulty breathing, leading to an examination visit (off -site/site) during the 
study follow -up period.  
 
6.5.11.  Blood sampling  
 
Refer to the Module on Biospecimen Ma nagement in the SPM for general handling of 
blood samples.  
 
A volume of approximately 3.5 mL of whole blood sample will be collected from a sub - 
cohort of subjects at randomly allocated time points to obtain approximately 1 mL of 
serum.  
 
Selected subjects will be randomized to the time point 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 or 24 months at 
which a single blood sample should be collected from them. The sample should be 
collected between the intervals of  1 week e.g. Month 2  1 week, Month 4  1 week in 
order for the subjec ts to be included in the analyses. Subjects born at a gestational age of 
less than 36 weeks will be excluded from this blood sampling. Randomization will be 
done using a second phase application of SBIR.  
 
Blood samples collected will be used to assess RSV antibody levels in the subjects.  
 
6.5.12.  Ascertain RTI symptoms and potential difficulty in breathing and 
assessment of need for examination visit  (off-site/site)  
 
During each active or passive follow -up contact, the investigator/study staff should 
confirm with the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject, if the subject developed new RTI 
symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose), and any signs of difficulty in breathing 
(during  and between contacts). In case there is any current sign or suspicion of difficulty 
in breathing in a child with symptom(s) of RTI at the time of the contact, the 
investigator/study staff should instruct the parent(s)/LAR(s) to start completing the diary 
card and schedule an examination visit (off -site/site) as soon as possible, but no later than 
72 hours after the contact. Performing the visit as soon as possible is important to assess 
the need for medical care, to ensure that early symptoms are captured and also to collect 
an optimal biological sample for detection of RSV. Active surveillance contacts required 
by the surveillance schedule and each passive surveillance contact, whether or not it 
triggers an examination visit, will be recorded in the site’s  source documentation and in 
the eCRF. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the study team as soon as 
possible if the severity of the already existing symptoms in the child increases, or if the 
child who did not have signs of difficulty breathing  develops the symptom.

The active and passive surveillance contacts can also be made with person designated by  
the parent(s)/LAR(s) (e.g. grandparents, nanny) as long as the parent(s)/LAR(s) have 
approved the same. If need ed, a field worker can also be assigned to support the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) and/or person designated by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in completing the 
diary card.  
 
The investigator/study staff should also collect any further identifying data (e.g. official 
name, socia l security number) that becomes available for a subject during the course of 
the study at regular surveillance contacts, and record it in a supporting site document.  
 
6.5.13.  Recording of data on changes to baseline medical and 
demographic data  
 
On a quarterly basis, the investigator/study staff should expand a regular surveillance 
contact by asking the parents/LARs for changes to the baseline medical, demographic 
and lifestyle  characteristics data collected at Visit 2. This includes at least;  
 
• diagnosis of chronic  diseases  
• medical events requiring hospitalization  
• vaccinations received (on disease level, not full vaccination  details)  
• start/stop attendance of day -care and other c hanges in daily  care 
• start/stop  breastfeeding  
• changes to household composition and/or living conditions 
This data will be recorded in a quarterly surveillance  eCRF.  
 
6.5.14.  Examination during (off -site/site) visit and collection of all 
disease  symptoms  
 
The examination visit can be an on -site or off -site visit. An off -site visit is preferred in 
order to avoid influencing the pattern of healthcare utilization for the disease.  
Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects can however be requested to bring their child to the 
study center for the site examination visit e.g. if this would be the normal standard of  care 
to provide given the situation, if this will significantly expedite the timi ng of the visit, or 
if it is unlikely that the off -site examination visit can occur at all within the required 
timeframe. If the reported symptoms are already of a level of severity that urgent care is 
indicated, the parent(s)/LAR(s) should be redirected t o the proper location to receive this 
care (e.g. ER) and an examination visit could be scheduled to take place there at a 
suitable time. During the examination visit (off -site/site), the investigator/study staff 
should objectively confirm the RTI and diffi culty breathing experienced by the subject 
and if the symptoms meet the LRTI case definition for surveillance. Data should be 
collected on all the clinical symptoms present in the child including a measurement of the 
temperature, RR and pulse oximetry. The  data collected should be recorded in the 
subject’s  eCRF.

For any case for which an examination visit is done (off -site/site), at least the following 
characteristic but not limited to, will be reported in the eCRF:  
 
• Date of telephone  contact.  
• Date of  visit.  
• Start and end date of the  case.  
• Nasal swab sample  number.  
• Clinical symptoms (Eg: irritability, cyanosis) as assessed by the investigator/study 
staff during examination visit (off -site/site), and as subsequently assessed from the 
diary card, and/or confirmed with any healthcare provider involved, during  disease 
course.  
• SaO2 as assessed by investigator/study staff during the examination visit (off - 
site/site), and as subsequently assessed by any healthcare provider involved, during 
disease  course.  
• Temperature as measured by the investigator/study staff dur ing the examination visit 
(off-site/site), and as subsequently assessed from the diary card, and/or confirmed 
with any healthcare provider involved, during course of the  disease.  
• RR as assessed by investigator/study staff during the examination visit (off -site/site), 
and as subsequently assessed by any healthcare provider involved, during disease  
course.  
• Healthcare utilization during disease course as assessed from the diary car d and/or 
confirmed with any healthcare provider  involved.  
Note:  
 
Healthcare utilization (or healthcare setting availed) refers to self -care with OTC drugs, 
GP visits, ER visits, hospital visits, etc.  
 
Data from healthcare providers (such as temperature, RR , SaO2, symptoms and 
diagnosis) is to be regarded as a valuable, but optional extra, if this data is available and 
shared by the applicable healthcare provider.  
 
A case eCRF needs to be created for each scheduled examination visit and data collected 
up to case resolution will be entered. Cases will be allocated with a unique case number 
that is a sequential number per subject.  
 
6.5.15.  Data collection on disease course and healthcare utilization 
before and during the examination visit  (off-site/site)  
 
Data on disease course recorded by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card until 
the examination visit should be assessed and recorded by the investigator/study staff in 
the subject’s eCRF.  
 
Data provided by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card on healthcare utilization should 
be confirmed by direct contact of the investigator/study staff with the healthcare

providers involved in management of the case (e.g. GP, hospital staff), and recorded in 
the eCRF. Where possible, the data on healthcare utilization should be made more 
complete so as to bes t capture the healthcare utilization in the eCRF. Any clinical 
diagnoses for the respiratory infection (e.g. pneumonia, bronchiolitis) made by the 
contacted healthcare providers, should be collected and recorded in the eCRF as well as 
the symptoms assessed  in support of this diagnosis (especially measured RR and SaO2).  
 
Note: In case of any discrepancies between healthcare utilization data recorded in the 
diary card and as provided (and supported with source documentation) by the HCPs, the 
data from the HCP will be used in the eCRF.  
 
Data from healthcare providers (such as temperature, RR, SaO2, symptoms and 
diagnosis) is to be regarded as a valuable, but o ptional extra, if this data is available and 
shared by the applicable healthcare provider.  
 
6.5.16.  Collection of nasal swab  samples  
 
• Nasal  sampling:  Cells  and secretions  from  the nose will be collected  by using  sterile 
swabs for all the subjects who are reported for an examination visit (off -site/site) 
(this includes subjects with no confirmed  LRTI).  
Full details for obtaining nasal swabs are  provided in the Module on Biospecimen 
Management in the SPM accompanying this protocol.  
 
6.5.17.  Return Diary card at completion or at case  resolution  
 
The diary card will be collected at completion.  
 
• Regular completion is after the standard diary card duration of 14  days.  
• If a surveillance case eCRF is ‘closed’ due to a subsequent examination visit for the 
same case, the diary card relating to the ‘closed’ eCRF is stopped prematurely and  a 
new 14 -day d iary card is started (see also Section 3-examination  visit).  
If the subject is not free of the symptoms asked for in the diary card at the end of Day 14, 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) should continue to assess the symptoms until no mor e symptoms are 
present, and record in the diary card, the date at which no more symptoms were observed 
in the child.  
 
6.5.18.  Confirmation and expansion of data on healthcare utilization 
occurring after the examination v isit (off -site/site) and  collection 
of any further, relevant data on disease course with HCPs 
involved in subject care  
 
Data on disease course recorded by the subject’s parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card until 
diary card completion/case resolution should b e assessed and recorded by the 
investigator/study staff in the subject’s eCRF.

Data provided by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card on healthcare utilization should 
be confirmed by direct contact of the investigator/study staff with the healthcare 
providers involved in management of the case (e.g. GP, hospital staff), and recorded  in 
the eCRF. Wherever possible, the data on healthcare utilization should be made more 
complete so as to best capture the healthcare utilization in the eCRF. Any clinical  
diagnoses for the respiratory infection (e.g. pneumonia, bronchiolitis) made by the 
contacted healthcare providers should be collected and recorded in the eCRF as well as 
the symptoms assessed in support of this diagnosis (especially measured RR and SaO2).  
 
Note: In case of any discrepancies between healthcare utilization data recorded in the 
diary card and as provided (and supported with source documentation) by the HCPs, the 
data from the HCP will be used in the eCRF.  
 
Data from healthcare providers (such as temperature, RR, SaO2, symptoms and 
diagnosis) is to be regarded as a valuable, but optional extra, if this data is available and 
shared by the applicable healthcare provider.  
 
6.5.19.  Recording of SAEs related to study  procedure  
 
• Refer to Section 7.2 for procedures for the investigator to record SAEs. Refer  to 
Section 7.3 for guide lines on how to submit SAE reports to GSK  Biologicals.  
• The subjects’ parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately should the subjects manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as 
serious.

Samples will not be labelled with information that directly identifies the subjects but will 
be coded with the identification number for the subject (subject number).  
 
• Collected samples will be used for protocol mandated research. In addition, these 
sample s may be used to perform research related to the improvement, development 
and quality assurance of the laboratory tests described in this protocol. This may 
include the management of the quality of these tests, the maintenance or 
improvement of these tests , the development of new test methods, as well as making 
sure that new tests are comparable to previous methods and work  reliably.  
• It is also possible that future findings may make it desirable to use the samples 
acquired in this study for future research,  not described in this protocol. Therefore,  
all subjects in countries where this is allowed will be invited to give another specific 
consent to allow GSK or a contracted partner use the samples for future research 
including development of tests and their quality assurance. Future research will be 
subject to the laws and regulations in the respective countries and will only be 
performed once an independent Ethics Committee or Revie w Board has approved 
this research.  
Information on further investigations and their rationale can be obtained from GSK 
Biologicals.  
 
Any sample testing will be done in line with the consent of the individual subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s).  
 
Refer also to the Investigator Agreement , where it is noted that the investigator cannot 
perform any other biological assays except those described in the protocol or its 
amendment(s).  
 
Collected samples will be stored for a maximum of 20 years ( counting from when the last 
subject performed the last study contact), unless local rules, regulations or guidelines 
require different timeframes or different procedures, which will then be in line with the 
subject consent. These extra requirements need to  be communicated formally to and 
discussed and agreed with GSK Biologicals.  
 
6.7.1.  Use of specified study  materials  
 
When materials are p rovided by GSK Biologicals, it is MANDATORY that all samples 
(including serum samples) be collected and stored exclusively using those materials in 
the appropriate manner. The use of other materials could result in the exclusion of the 
subject from the Acc ording -To-Protocol (ATP) analysis (See Section 9.4 for the 
definition of study cohorts/data sets to be analysed). The investigator must ensure that 
his/her personnel and the laboratory(ies) under his/her supervision comply wi th this 
requirement. However, when GSK Biologicals does not provide material for collecting 
and storing samples, appropriate materials from the investigator’s site must be used.

7. SAFETY  
SAEs, which in the opinion of the investigator are related to the study p rocedures (e.g. 
blood sample and nasal swab sample collection), will be recorded throughout the study 
period.  
 
The investigator or study staff is/are responsible during the study for the detection and 
documentation of events meeting the criteria and defini tion of an SAE as provided in this 
protocol.  
 
Each subject’s parent(s)/ LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator 
immediately should they/the subject manifest any signs or symptoms they perceive as 
serious/ of concern or indicating a change in their health status.  For nasal swab samples:  
 
• RT-qPCR assay for the detection of RSV and determination of RSV su btype  (A/B).  
• xTAG™ RVP Fast assay for the detection of the following 17 viruses and  subtypes.  
 RSV  
 Influenza A, including subtypes H1 and  H3

 7.1. Safety  definitions  
 
7.1.1.  Definition of an  SAE 
 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 
a. Results in death,  
b. Is life-threatening,  
NB: The term ‘life -threatening’  in the definition of ‘serious’ refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolong ation of an existing hospitalization,  
NB: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been admitted at the 
hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have 
been appropriate in the physician’s office or in an ou t-patient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospitalization are also considered AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event 
will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitaliz ation’ 
occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or 
diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is 
NOT considered an SAE.  
d. Results in  disability/incapacity,  
NB: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncompli cated headache, nausea,  
vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained 
ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardise the  
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious.  
Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an ER 
or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result 
in hospitalization.  
 
7.1.2.  Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments 
qualifying as SAEs  
 
In absence of dia gnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, 
haematology, urinalysis) or other abnormal assessments that are judged by the

 15-DEC -2017  64 investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as SAEs if they meet the 
definition of an SAE (refer to Section 7.1.1 ). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory  
findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly 
worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as SAEs. However, clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are 
associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more 
severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start 
of the study and do not worsen, will not be re ported as SAEs.  
 
The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgement in deciding 
whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is clinically 
significant.  
 
7.2. Detecting and recording  SAEs  
 
7.2.1.  Time periods for detecting and recording  SAEs  
 
SAEs related to study participation will be collected and recorded from the time of the 
first study visit until the subject is discharged from the study.  
 
In order to fulfil international reporting obligations, SAEs that are related to study 
participation (i.e., protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, a change from existing 
therapy) will be collected and recorded from the time when the subject parent(s)/ LAR(s) 
have consented their child’s/children’s participation in the study until she/he is 
discharg ed from the study.  
 
7.2.2.  Evaluation of  SAEs  
 
7.2.2.1.  Active questioning to detect  SAEs  
 
Each subject’ s parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately 
should the subject manifest any signs and symptoms (s) they perceive as serious.  
 
All SAEs either observed by the investigator or his/ her staff or reported by the subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) spontaneously or in response to a direct question will be evaluated by 
the investigator. The nature of each event, date and time of onset, outcome, intensity and 
possible relationship to the study procedures should be established.  
 
When an SAE  occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative 
to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding the SAE 
in the  eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s medical 
records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriately completing the eCRF. However, 
there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of 
the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals.

 15-DEC -2017  65 The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on 
signs, symptoms, and/ or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis should 
be documented as the SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
 
7.2.2.2.  Assessment of  causality  
 
The investigator should assess the causality of each SAE. The investigator will use 
clinical judgement to determine the relationship between the SAEs and study  
participation. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, other 
concomitant therapy and other risk factors will be considered and investigated.  
 
There may be situations when a SAE has occurred an d the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However it is very 
important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event 
prior to submission of the SAE report to GSK Biologic als. The investigator may change 
his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and update the SAE 
information accordingly.  
 
If an event meets the criteria to be considered as ‘serious’ (see section 7.1.1 ), additional 
examinations/tests will be performed by the investigator in order to determine ALL 
possibly contributing factors to each SAE.  
 
Possibly contributing factors include:  
 
• Medical  history.  
• Concomitant medication.  
• Protocol required  procedure.  
• Other proc edure not required by the  protocol.  
• Other cause  (specify).  
 
7.2.2.3.  Assessment of  outcomes  
 
The investigator will assess the outcome of all SAEs recorded during the study as:  
 
• Recovered/resolved.  
• Recovering/resolving.  
• Not recovered/not  resolved.  
• Recovered with sequelae/resolved with  sequelae.  
• Fatal (SAEs  only).  
 
7.3. Reporting of  SAEs  
All SAEs occurring up to 30 days after the study procedure and considered related to 
study participation must be recorded on the SAE form, irrespective of intensity.

SAEs that occur in the time period defined  in Section 7.2.1  will be reported promptly to 
GSK within the timeframes described in Table 11 once the investigator determines that 
the event meets the protocol definition of an SAE.

7.3.2.  Contact information for reporting SAEs to  GSK  
 
 
 
 
7.3.3.  Completion and transmission of SAE reports related to study 
participation to GSK  
 
Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a study subject, the 
investigator (or designee) must complete the information in the electronic SAE report 
WITHIN 24 HOURS. The SAE report will always be completed as thoroughly as 
possible wit h all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does not have all 
information regarding an SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours. Once 
additional information is received, the report should be updated WITHIN 24  HOURS.  
 
The investigator will always provide an assessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report.  
 
7.3.3.1.  Back -up system in case the electronic SAE reporting system does not 
work  
 
If the electronic SAE reporting system does not work, the investigator (or designee) must 
complete, then date and sign a paper SAE report and fax it to the GSK Biologicals 
Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department within 24 hours.  
 
This back -up syst em should only be used if the electronic SAE reporting system is not 
working and NOT if the system is slow. As soon as the electronic SAE reporting system 
is working again, the investigator (or designee) must complete the electronic SAE report  Back -up Study Contact for Reporting SAEs  Study Contact for Reporting SAEs

information reported through the electronic SAE reporting system.  
 
7.3.4.  Updating of SAE after freezing of the subject’s  eCRF  
 
When additional SAE information is received after freezing of the subject’s eCRF, new 
or updated information should be recorded on a paper report, with all changes signed and 
dated by the investigator. The updated report should be faxed to the GSK Biologicals 
Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study Contact for Reporting 
SAEs (see the Sponsor Information ) within the designated reporting time frames 
specified in Table 11 . 
 
7.3.5.  Regulatory reporting requirements for  SAEs  
 
The investigator will  promptly report all SAEs to GSK Biologicals in accordance with 
the procedures detailed in Section 7.3.1 . GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to 
promptly notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a product under epidemiological investigation. Prompt 
notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs is

7.4.1.  Follow -up of SAEs  
 
7.4.1.1.  Follow -up during the  study  
 
After the initial SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject 
and provide further relevant information on the subject’s condition to GSK Biologicals  
(within 24 hours for SAEs, refer to Table 11 ). 
 
All SAEs documented at a previous visit/ contact and recorded as not recovered/ not 
resolved or recovering/ resolving will be reviewed at subsequent visits/ contacts until the 
end of the study.  
 
7.4.1.2.  Follow -up after the subject is discharged from the  study  
 
The investigator will follow -up subjects:  
 
• With SAEs until the event has resolved, subsided, stabilized, disappeared, or  until 
the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to  follow -up. 
If the investigator receives additional relevant information on a previously reported SAE, 
he/ she wi ll provide this information to GSK Biologicals using a paper SAE report.

of additional clinical examinations/ tests and/ or evaluations to elucidate as fully as 
possible the nature and/ or causali ty of the SAE. The investigator is obliged to assist. If a 
subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, 
GSK Biologicals will be provided with any available post -mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
 
8. SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL 
(AMENDED  15-DEC -2017)  
 
8.1. Subject  completion  
 
 
A subject who is available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol for the 
extension study is considered to have completed the extension study.  
 
8.2. Subject  withdrawal  
Subjects who are withdrawn from the study because of study procedure related SAEs 
must be clearly distinguished from subjects who are withdrawn for other reasons.  
Investigators will follow subjects who are withdrawn from the study as the result of a  
study procedure related SAE until resolution of the event (see Section 7.4.1.2 ). 
Withdrawals will not be replaced.  
From an analysis perspective, a ‘withdrawal’ from the study refers to any su bject who 
was not available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol.  
 
All data collected until the date of withdrawal/last contact of the subject will be used for 
the analysis.  
 
A subject is considered a ‘withdrawal’  from the study when no study procedure has 
occurred, no follow -up has been performed and no further information has been collected 
for this subject from the date of withdrawal/last contact.  
 
Information relative to the withdrawal will be documented in the  eCRF. The investigator 
will document whether the decision to withdraw a subject from the study was made by 
the, by the subject’s parent(s) or LAR(s), or by the investigator, as well as which of the 
following possible reasons was responsible for withdrawal : 
 
• SAE.  
• Non-serious  AE. 
• Protocol violation  (specify).  
• Consent withdrawal, not due to an  AE*.  A subject who is available for the concluding contact foreseen in the protocol for the 
primary study is considered to have completed the primary study.

Table 13 shows the exact 95% confidence interval (CI) (Poisson exact distribution and 
normal approximation of the Poisson distribution accounting for a design effect of 4.18) 
for a ra nge of expected incidence rates of RSV that we can reasonably estimate between 
10 and 50 per 1000 children -years in the first year of birth. With an overall sample size of 
about 320 evaluable subjects by country during the first year of enrollment and with  a 
follow -up period of 1 year after the last subject is recruited, the CI for an expected RSV - 
associated LRTI hospitalization rate of 20 cases per 1000 children -years is respectively 
[6.9; 40.8] for the exact Poisson distribution and [0; 51.7] for the nor mal approximation 
with design effect of 4.18.  RSV-associated LRTI hospitalization rates in industrialized countries 
(per 1000 children -years)  Table 12  Different RSV -associated LRTI hospitalization rates have been reported in industrialized 
countries. We observe incidence rates between 16.9 and 44. 1 per 1000 children -years in 
the age group of infants below 6 months of age, between 5.1 and 14.2 per 1000 children - 
years in the age group of infants between 6 -11 months and between 0.4 and 3.7 per 1000 
children -years in the age group of children between 12-23 months [ Table 12 ]. These rates 
are similar to the ones measured in several studies conducted in developing countries

Design effect calculated from 1000 simulations and for different 
hypothesis  Table 14  Each simulation consists of creating ‘ c’ clusters whose size and inc idence vary around a 
given value. Then the above formula was applied to estimate the design effect in the 
simulation. Table 14 shows the median result of 1000 simulations (with 5th and 95th 
percentile). The design effect [ Bennett , 1991] can be estimated as following once the 
intra-cluster correlation value is known or can be assumed:  
DE = 1 + (b – 1) ρ 
 
Where, ρ is the intra -cluster correlation and b is the average number of subjects sampled 
per cluster. According to the results of simulations, we could assume that the intra -cluster 
correlation of 0.02 (See Table 14 below) and considering 12 clusters of 160 subjects, we 
expect that the design effect will take a value of 4.18 . Where, ‘ c’ is the number of clusters, ‘x i’, and ‘y i’ are number of children -years and 
number of cases, respectively in the ‘ith’ cluster, ‘ n’ is the total number of children -years 
and ‘ p’ is the overall proportion ‘ ∑ yi/∑xi’.

Few active studies reported the overall RSV -associated LRTI incidence rates (with or 
without hospitalization). According to the results observed in a birth cohort conducted in 
Kenya [ Nokes , 2008] we expect tha t the RSV -associated LRTI rate will be 8 times 
greater than the hospitalization rate.  
 
As the subjects may dropout from the study due to a variety of reasons, e.g. migration 
from the study area, the sample size has been increased to accommodate the same.  
Assuming a drop -out rate of about 20% during the course of follow -up approximately 
400 subjects by country/region and 2400 subjects overall will need to be recruited.

Data transformations and derived variables will be described in the SAP. However, 
they may include the following:  
 
• Age of the subject at time of th e LRTI case will be expressed in months and will be 
computed as the difference between the start date of the LRTI case and the date of 
birth.  
• Age of the subject at time of blood sample collection will be expressed in months 
and will be computed as the difference between the sample collection date and the 
date of  birth.  
• Age of the mother at the time of childbirth will be expressed in years and wi ll be 
computed as the difference between the birth date of the subject and the birth date of 
the mother.  
• Duration of the study for each subject will be computed as the difference between 
the date of last contact (i.e., active or passive surveillance contac t or the date of the 
censoring) and the date of enrollment (date when ICF was first signed by the 
subject’s  parent[s]/LAR[s]).  
 
• All potential LRTI cases identified during the surveillance period will be classified 
as RTI, LRTI or severe LRTI according to t he LRTI case definition and severity 
scale (refer to Section 4). The cases will also be classified according to the 
classification of WHO and by Nokes et al [Modjarrad , 2016; Nokes , 2004]. First 
time, the classification will be done at visit level, i.e. according to the data collected 
at the initial visit and, if applicable, at each additional examination visit. Finally, a 
classification at case level will be done co nsidering the most severe classification 
from all visits.  
 
9.5.1.  General considerations for statistical  analyses  
 
The primary analyses will at least be performed on the PPS cohort or sub -cohort. If more 
than 5% of the subjects are eliminated from the total enrolled cohort, then all analyses 
may also be performed on the total enrolled cohort in addition to the PPS cohort or sub - 
cohort.  
 
When mentioned below in the upcoming an alyses sections, analysis by subgroups may 
include:  
 
• Age categories  
• Hemisphere/Region/Country  
• Birth on -season or  off-season  
• Collection time of swabs (72 hours/48 hours from the start date of the case (date  of 
the call), 72 hours/48 hours from the reported onset of  symptoms).

suspicion of involvement of the lower respiratory tract, overall and by subgroups.  
 
• To assess  the performance  of the LRTI  case definition  and severity  scale  for 
RSV -associated  cases.  
Incidences rates will be calculated as the number of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI 
as classified by the LRTI case definition and severity scale and also as classified by the 
comparator case definitions (WHO and Nokes, et al [ Modjarrad , 2016; Nokes , 2004]),

Comparison of two classifications for severe/Non -severe LRTI  Table 15  Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare the different case 
definitions of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI and key healthcare utilization and 
health outcomes (the hospitalization status, (P) intensive care unit [ICU] attendance, 
clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis or pneumonia, death) overall and by age categories.

• Positive predictive value (PPV): TP/  (TP+FP)  
• Negative predictive value (NPV): TN/  (TN+FN)  
• Proportion  of overall  agreement,  which  is the proportion  of cases  similarly  classified:  
(TP + TN)/  (TP+FP+FN+TN).  
• Cohen’s kappa coefficient. The magnitude of the kappa coefficient represents the 
proportion of agreement great er than that expected by  chance.  
The same analysis will at least be performed for all the following combinations 
(reference vs. alternative classification):  
 
• Health/healthcare utilization outcome vs. LRTI case definition and severity  scale.  
• Health/healthca re utilization outcome vs. WHO case definition [ Modjarrad , 2016].

Descriptive statistics of the different types of healthcare utilization will be provided 
(proportions, duration, etc.) among non -RSV -associated RTI with a suspicion of 
involvement of the low er respiratory tract, overall and by subgroups.  
 
• To evaluate the association between RSV -associated LRTI, RSV -associated 
severe LRTI and RSV neutralizing antibodies in the baseline cord blood 
samples collected from subjects, at  birth.  
The impact of the lev el of RSV neutralizing antibodies in the baseline cord blood samples 
on the risk of having a RSV -associated LRTI and RSV -associated severe LRTI will be 
assessed through a statistical model.  
 
Incidence rates will be calculated overall and by level of antibodies in the cord blood 
sample, as the number RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI as classified by the case 
definition and severity scale over the number of children -years observations.  
 
• To determine the prevalence of RSV infection, at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months in 
a randomly selected sub -cohort of subjects by assessing antibodies in  serum.  
The primary analysis will be based on ATP sub -cohort for this objective.  
 
Infection by RSV will be assessed (with 95% CI) by time point as the proportion of 
samples with a positive score of antibody titer after adjusting for baseline antibody results 
over th e total number of samples.  
 
Scores will be determined based on the measured antibody titer vs. the expected antibody 
level at the time of sampling based on the individual baseline (cord blood) value and the 
average, modelled decay rate.  
 
• To assess the between calendar year variability in the incidence rates of RSV - 
associated LRTI.  
Incidences rates will be calculated as the number of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI 
as classified by the case definition and severity scale, over the number of  children -years 
observations, in the subgroups of subjects recruited from months 1 -6 and from months 
13-18. 
 
9.7.3.  Tertiary Objectives  
 
• To explore the association of co -infections with the incidence of RSV -associated 
LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as determined by the LRTI case definition and 
severity scale) using xTAG™ RVP Fast  assay.  
For each of the other respiratory viruses, incidence rates w ill be calculated as the number 
of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI cases associated co -infected with the virus over the 
number of children -years observations.

For each of the respiratory viruses, incidence rates will be calculated as the number of 
LRTI/severe LRTI cases associated with the virus over the number of children -years 
observations.  
 
• To explore the association of RSV viral load with the incidence of RSV - 
associated RTI, LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as determined by the LRTI  case 
definition and severity  scale).  
Descriptive analyses (mean, median, min, max) of viral load assessed by the RSV RT- 
qPCR of RSV RTI, RSV LRTI and severe LRTI cases will be tabulated.  
 
• To explore the impact of changes to the symptoms and threshold levels of 
symptoms in the LRTI case definition and severity  scale.  
Frequency tables will summarize the proportion of RSV -associated LRTI/ severe LRTI 
cases associated with a list of symptoms and clinical parameters, overall and by age 
categories.  
 
This will help us to determine potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition 
and severity scale. Incidence rates of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI will be 
calculated for any proposal of modification of the LRTI case definition and severity 
scale.  
 
• To explore the impact of variations in cord -blood sample collection variables on 
the stability of test  results.  
The measure d maternal antibody levels will be assessed versus variability in sample 
collection variables. This involves assessment versus various continuous and categorical 
variables and an overall comparison between samples as classified ‘according to 
recommended pr ocedure’ and ‘not according to recommended procedure’.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels by duration of the processing step and overall 
process duration will be analysed graphically and by log -linear regression.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels by storage condition or tube type will be analysed 
graphically and by group statistics (mean, 95% CI). Group means will be compared by t - 
test to assess the statistical significance of differences.  
 
The measured matern al antibody levels in samples collected ‘according to recommended 
procedure’ and ‘not according to recommended procedure’ will be analysed graphically 
and by group statistics (mean, 95% CI). Group means will be compared by t -test to assess 
the statistical significance of any difference.  
 
• To assess the impact of potential RSV risk factors (e.g. complications at birth, 
family history of respiratory disease, lifestyle characteristics and household 
composition, breast feeding, passive smoking, day care attendan ce) on the 
incidence and severity of RSV -associated  LRTI.  
The incidence of any, severe, non -severe RSV -associated LRTI will be analysed using a 
Poisson regression model including potential risk factors.

9.8. Analysis of Objectives for the Extension  study  
 
9.8.1.  Primary objectives: none  
 
9.8.2.  Secondary objectives  
 
Data for secondary endpoints may be pooled across the primary and extension periods. 
Additional details are provided in the SAP.  
 
9.8.2.1.  To determine the population attributable risk of wheeze and asthma 
from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the first two 
years of  life. 
 
The incidence rate of medically attended wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring hospital 
admission, and prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma may be calculated 
and stratified by country.  
 
The population attributable risk may be calculated by subtracting the incidence rate in the 
subjects who did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the fir st two years of life from the 
incidence rate in all subjects including both who had and who did not have RSV clinical 
LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
Details will be provided in the SAP. An example follows.  
 
The population attributable risk of medica lly attended wheeze may be calculated as:  • To assess the natural decay of maternal antibody levels using a single follow -up 
blood sample collected from a randomly selected sub -cohort of subjects at 2, 4, 
6, 12, 18 and 24 months.  
The primary analysis will be based on ATP sub -cohort for this objective.  
 
The decay of maternal antibody levels over time will be analysed graphically and by a 
log-linear regression. A true, natural decay curve will be explored by stochastically  
reducing the sample to uninfected subjects only. The following steps will be taken to 
identify, confirmed and suspected infected subjects to eliminate these from the sample;  
 
• Subjects with an RSV positive nasal swab during the study before time of sampling 
will be  eliminated.  
• A sensitivity analysis of the decay curve will be explored in sub -sample c onsisting of 
the subjects born ‘off -season’ as these have the lowest likelihood of having been 
infected.  
• Subjects with an antibody titer at the sampling time that is more than 2 -fold above 
the expected value based on their baseline (cord blood) value and t he established 
decay curve will be considered to have been infected, eliminated and the decay  curve 
refined.  
• Step 3 is repeated up to 5 times until the most accurate decay curve is  established.

 Ip-Iu 
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not  have 
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of medically 
attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had and who did not have RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life. The above population attributabl e risk 
formula may be further adapted to best accommodate the data and their required 
analytic assumptions (e.g., a modified formula may be used for population attributable 
risk calculations involving recurrent outcomes).  
 
9.8.2.2.  To determine the population attributable risk percent of wheeze and 
asthma from birth until sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the 
first two years of  life. 
 
The population attributable risk percent together with 95% CI of medically attended 
wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring hospital admission, and prescription of medications 
for wheeze and asthma may be calculated overall and by age strata (0 -2 years, 2 -4 yea rs 
and 5 -6 years), respectively.  
 
The population attributable risk percent may be calculated by dividing the population 
attributable risk by the incidence rate in all the subjects including both who had a nd who 
did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
For example, the population attributable risk percent of medically attended wheeze may 
be calculated as:  
 
(Ip-Iu)/Ip*100  
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not have 
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of medically 
attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had and  who did not have RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life. As with the population attributable risk, the 
above formula may be adapted, as appropriate, to best suit the data . 
 
The detail for calculating the CI for both population attributable risk s and population 
attributable risk percent will be provided in the SAP. 
 
9.8.3.  Tertiary  objectives  
 
9.8.3.1.  To explore the association of RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of 
life and other potential risk factors for wheeze and  asthma  
 
Endpoints such as medically attended wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring hospital 
admission, and prescription of medicatio ns for wheeze or asthma may be calculated as 
recurrent events and stratified by country.  
 
Occurrence/recurrence rates will be calculated overall and by subgroups for each of the 
outcomes, as relevant. Multivaria ble Poisson regression or other appropriate models

such as, but not limited to, family history of asthma, and/or allergies, contact with pets, 
child hist ory of allergy, eczema or atopic dermatitis, etc., will be explored, respectively.  
 
9.8.3.2.  To explore the performance of asthma case  definitions.  
 
The number and percentage of children with diagnosis of asthma (case definition s 1, 2, 
and 3 will be described for each applicable age; the number and percentage of children 
with recurrent wheeze at each applicable age will be described overall and by coun try in 
frequency tables.  
 
The risk of asthma at the age of 6 years using case definitions 1, 2 and 3 (occurring from 
2nd to the 6th birthday) will be analyzed using multivaria ble logistic regression model  
including RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life and other potential risk factors 
listed above, respectively.  
 
• Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare asthma case 
definitions 1, 2, and 3 to each  other.  
• Cohen’s kappa (or othe r appropriate) coefficient may be used for the comparisons . 
The magnitude of the kappa coefficient represents the proportion of agreement 
greater than that expected by  chance.  
 
9.9. Interpretation of  analyses  
All analyses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise overall occurrences, patterns  
and potential differences between groups in the endpoints related to the objectives.  
The tertiary objective ‘To expl ore the impact of changes to the symptoms and threshold 
levels of symptoms in the LRTI case definition and severity scale’ will be assessed if we 
detect potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition and severity scale, such 
as clearly under or  overestimated incidence rates of LRTI/ severe LRTI compared to the 
rates in the literature or a lack of discriminative power between severe and non -severe 
cases. This decision will not be taken on specific pre -defined thresholds.  
 
9.10.  Conduct of analyses  
Analytic plans may be modified as appropriate to accommodate final sample sizes and 
data distributions. Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan 
outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the final study report.  
 
9.11.  Sequence of  analyses  
An interim analysis will be performe d after data lock at the end of recruitment (expected 
after 18 months) or in June 2015 whichever occurs first, on the data collected for the 
subjects recruited in the first year of the study (approximately 1600). This interim 
analysis will be performed to obtain preliminary indications of the results in very young 
infants. These preliminary results will be used for potential adjustment of the LRTI Case

*Based on the preliminary results of the interim analyses it was decided that the 
incidence rate would be more robust if all subjects completed the primary study until 2 
years of age . 
 
Final analysis will be performed on all the data collected and cleaned in the study, at the 
end of the extension period which is expected to occur 7 years after study start. An 
integrated  study report presenting the consolidated analysis for the entire study duration 
(primary and extension study period [as applicable]) will be written and made available 
to the investigators.  
 
 
9.11.2.  Statistical considerations for the extension  study  
 
All statistical analyses pertaining to the extension study will be performed on data 
collected and cleaned for the subjects who re -consented for the extension.  
 
An interim analysis for the extension study will be conducted near the midway point of 
extension s tudy data collection, after all subjects have reached four years of age (and 
completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that contact). The interim 
analysis will be purely descriptive, no adjustment of the type I error is foreseen.  
 
Final extension study analysis will be conducted after all subjects have reached six 
years of age (and completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that 
contact).  
 
10. ADMINISTRATIVE  MATTERS  
To comply with ICH GCP or other applicable guidelines administrative obligations 
relating to data collection, monitoring, archiving data, audits, confidentiality, ownership 
and publications must be met.  Statistical analyses for the interim ana lysis will be performed on all the data collected and 
cleaned for the subjects recruited in the first year of the study, at the end of recruitment  
(expected after 18 months) or in June 2015 whichever occu rs first.

 15-DEC -2017  84 10.1.  Remote Data Entry  instructions  
Remote Data Entry (RDE), a validated co mputer application, will be used as the method 
for data collection.  
 
In all cases, subject initials will not be collected nor transmitted to GSK. Subject data 
necessary for analysis and reporting will be entered/transmitted into a validated database 
or dat a system. Clinical data management will be performed in accordance with 
applicable GSK standards and data cleaning procedures.  
 
While completed eCRFs are reviewed by a GSK Biologicals’  Site Monitor at the study 
site, omissions or inconsistencies detected by subsequent eCRF review may necessitate 
clarification or correction of omissions or inconsistencies with documentation and 
approval by the investigator or appropriately qualified desi gnee. In all cases, the 
investigator remains accountable for the study data.  
 
Once the database is archived and the clinical study report is complete and approved by 
all parties, each participating investigator will be provided with a CD -ROM of the final 
version of the data generated at his/her investigational site.  
 
10.2.  Study monitoring by GSK  Biologicals  
GSK will monitor the study to verify that, amongst others, the:  
 
• Data are authentic, accurate, and  complete.  
• Safety and rights of subjects are being  protected.  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol, any other 
study agreements, GCP and all applicable regulatory  requirements.  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution ( where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents.  
 
The investigator must ensure provision of reasonable time, space and qualified personnel 
for monitoring visits.  
 
Direct access to all study -site related and source data is mandatory for the purpose of 
monitoring review. The monitor will perform a RDE review and a Source Document 
Verification (SDV). By SDV we understand verifying RDE entries by comparing them 
with the  source data that will be made available by the investigator for this purpose.  
 
The Source Documentation Agreement Form describes the source data for the different 
data in the RDE. This document should be completed and signed by the site monitor and 
invest igator and should be filed in the monitor’s and investigator’s study file. Any data 
item for which the RDE will serve as the source must be identified, agreed and 
documented in the source documentation agreement form.  
 
For RDE, the monitor will mark comple ted and approved screens at each visit.

 15-DEC -2017  85 Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the monitor will conduct site 
closure activities with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate, in accordance with 
applicable regulations, GCP, and GSK procedures.  
 
10.3.  Record  retention  
Following closure of the study, the investigator must maintain all site study records  
(except for those required by local regulations to be maintained elsewhere) in a safe and 
secure location. The records must be easily accessible, when needed (e.g., audit or 
inspection), and must be available for revie w in conjunction with assessment of the 
facility, supporting systems, and staff. Where permitted by applicable laws/regulations or 
institutional policy, some or all of these records can be maintained in a validated format 
other than hard copy (e.g., microf iche, scanned, electronic); however, caution needs to be 
exercised before such action is taken. The investigator must ensure that all reproductions 
are legible and are a true and accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and 
retrieval standards,  including re -generating a hard copy, if required. Furthermore, the 
investigator must ensure that an acceptable back -up of the reproductions exists and that 
there is an acceptable quality control procedure in place for making these reproductions.  
 
GSK will inform the investigator/institution of the time period for retaining these records 
to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. However, the 
investigator/institution should seek the written approval of the Sponsor before proceeding 
with the disposal of these records. The minimum retention time will meet the strictest 
standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated by ICH GCP or other applicable 
guidelines, any institutional requirements or applicable laws or regulations, or GSK 
standards/procedures; otherwise, the minimum retention period will default to 15 years.  
 
The investigator/institution must notify GSK of any changes in the archival 
arrangements, including, but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility and transfer of 
ownership of the records in the event the investigator leaves the site.  
 
10.4.  Quality  assurance  
To ensure compliance with GCP or other applicable guidelines and all applicable 
regulatory requirements, GSK may conduct a quality assurance audit. Regulatory 
agencies may also conduct a regulatory inspection of this study. Such audits/inspections 
can occu r at any time during or after completion of the study. If an audit or inspection 
occurs, the investigator and institution agree to allow the auditor/inspector direct access 
to all relevant documents and to allocate his/her time and the time of his/her staf f to the 
auditor/inspector to discuss findings and any relevant issues.

 15-DEC -2017  90 APPENDIX A  LABORATORY  ASSAYS  
Neutralization assay  
 
The Serum Neutralization assay is a functional assay that measures the ability of serum 
antibodies to neutralise the cytopathic effects of RSV (for example, strains A and B) on 
the host cell line, hence RSV replication. In the first s tep of the assay, a specific quantity 
of a replication capable RSV virus and a defined dilution of serum are mixed and 
incubated. Each serum dilution is tested in duplicates. During the second step, the virus - 
serum reaction mixture is transferred on the h ost cells and only non -neutralized virus is 
able to infect and replicate in the host cells. This leads to the formation of a given number 
of plaque forming units (PFU) on the cell monolayer that can be detected using a 
fluorochrome -tagged anti -RSV antibody . The neutralising titer is determined by 
calculating the serum dilution inducing a 60% inhibition in PFUs compared to a cell 
monolayer infected with virus alone, without serum.  
 
RT-qPCR assay  
 
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B ribonucleic acids (RNAs) extracted fr om the nasal swabs are 
detected in a duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and fluorescent 
probes designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid protein. The process 
involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to comple mentary 
deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) by reverse transcription and detection by real - time PCR 
reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV viral load is reported 
as copies of RSV RNA per mL of  sample.  
 
xTAG™ RVP Fast assay  
 
xTAG™ RVP  Fast assay is a qualitative nucleic acid multiplex tests intended for the 
simultaneous detection and identification of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids in 
nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs from individuals suspected of respiratory tract infections. A 
multiplexed PCR reaction is performed to amplify the regions of interest in the target 
human or infectious agent genes. The PCR reaction is treated to remove excess 
nucleotides and primers. The PCR reaction is then subjected to a primer extension step 
that is  specific for the allele or the infectious agent that is being analyzed: Allele Specific 
Primer Extension (ASPE) or Target Specific Primer Extension (TSPE). The 5’ end of the 
ASPE or TSPE primers is attached to an xTAG universal tag sequence. The 5’ univer sal 
tag sequence is hybridized to the complementary anti -tag sequence coupled to a particular 
xMAP bead set. The hybridized beads are read by the xMAP system and results are 
analyzed by the data analysis software.

 15-DEC -2017  92 APPENDIX  C OVERVIEW OF RECRUITMENT PLAN (PRIMARY 
STUDY) (AMENDED 15 -DEC -2017)  
• Subjects  will be pre -selected to be enrolled in the study, by obtaining the informed 
consent from the parent(s)/LAR(s) during pregnancy, after 20 weeks of gestation 
and before the start of delivery, to include their child in the study at birth. On 
obtaining the co nsent, the subjects will be checked for inclusion and exclusion 
criteria applicable before birth. A pre -selected child not meeting the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be considered a screening  failure.  
• On receiving consent, subject numbers will be assigned sequentially to each 
subject, according to the range of subject numbers allocated to each study  center.  
• After birth, the final inclusion and exclusion criteria will be checked and the 
informed consent will be updated with, time and date of birth and any other 
potentially relevant identifiers as applicable by local requirements and re -signed. 
Any pre -selected subject not meeting the eligibility criteria will be considered a 
screening  failure.  
• Subject recruitment is intended to occur over a period 18 months or until the 
planned target enrollment has been met. Assuming no delays in recruitment, two - 
thirds of the subjects (1600) will be recruited in Year 1 and the remaining one - 
third of th e subjects (800) in the first half of Year 2 of the study. In case of any 
delays in recruitment for the first two -thirds of the subjects, the study duration will 
be extended until all these subjects have completed follow -up to 2 years of age. 
Delays in the  recruitment of the last one -third of the subjects will be absorbed by a 
shorter follow -up period for these subjects, unless the decision is taken after the 
interim analysis to extend the study to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of 
follow -up. 
• The recruitment will be performed using a first application of SBIR where  subjects 
will be entered on obtaining ICF and recruitment is controlled on the monthly 
recruitment rate. The aim is to attain a reasonably stable n umber of subjects per 
month over the full recruitment period in order to achieve an equal spread in the 
age of subjects at first exposure to an RSV season. Recruitment will be actively 
controlled through the SBIR system on country level according to agreed  targets, 
actual recruitment rates, and further recruitment potential, so as to achieve a 
sufficient population on a regional level. With concurrent recruitment across the 
globe (with different seasonality) and an intended, steady recruitment over 18 
month s, the following population is to be  included;  
 Subjec ts from NH during first 6  months  
 Subjects from SH during first 6  months  
 Subjects from NH during second 6  months  
 Subjects from SH during second 6  months  
 Subjects from NH during third 6 months; repeat of first 6 months  NH

PRIMAR Y STUDY VISITS (AMENDED  15-DEC - 
2017)  
 
 
 
 
 • Eligibility criteria applicable before birth will be assessed. A pre -selected child who 
does not meet the eligibility criteria will be considered a screening  failure.  
• The expected delivery date will be collected as required by the  eCRF.  
• After obtaining the ICF and confirming eligibility, the subject needs to be entered 
into the randomization syste m on internet (SBIR) screening module. SBIR will 
control the recruitment rate as per an allocated  target.  
• The study site will contact the pregnant mother at their own discretion to monitor 
the status of the  pregnancy.  
Visit 2 (enrollment visit commencing a t birth):  
 
• During this visit, and before any study follow -up procedures are performed (no 
later than 5 working days after birth of the subject), the informed consent will be 
updated with relevant personal identifiers as applicable by local requirements and 
re-signed by the parent(s)/LAR(s), investigator and witness (when required). The 
investigator/study staff should also collect any further identifying data (e.g. official 
name, social security num ber) that becomes available for a subject during the 
course of the study, at regular surveillance contacts and record it in a supporting 
document.   In case of anticipated twins (or other multiple births), an ICF needs to be 
signed for each expected child before the start of delivery. A subject number 
will be assigned sequentially to each child as per the birth order, where the 
first born will be assoc iated with the lowest subject number, the second born 
with the successive subject number,  etc. 
 In case of unexpected twins (or other multiple births), only the children for 
whom an ICF was signed and subject number was assigned before birth can 
be enrolled . This should again occur as per the birth  order.  Study visit schedule related to the primary study (from birth up to the age of 2 years):  
Visit 1 (screening visit):  
• Informed consent will be obtained by the investigator/study staff for each subject 
from the parent(s) /LAR(s) of the subjects during pregnancy, after at least 20 weeks 
of gestation and before the start of delivery, to include their child in the study, at 
birth.  
• On obtaining the consent, one subject number will be assigned to each unborn 
child and recorded in the ICF and the copy of the ICF will be provided to the 
parent(s)/LAR(s). A sequential allocation of subject numbers will be assigned 
according to the range of subject numbers allocated to each study  center.

• A baseline cord blood sample of up to approximately 10 mL will be collected at 
birth from all live born infants recruited at Visit 1 in the  study.  
• Eligibility of the infants for the study wi ll be confirmed as per the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria that can be assessed only after birth. If the subject is found to be 
ineligible during this assessment, the cord blood sample that was collected will be 
discarded and the subject will be considere d a screening failure. Eligibility 
(including the updated ICF) needs to be definitively confirmed not later than 5 
working days after the birth or the subject will automatically become a screening 
failure. Eligibility also needs to be definitively confirme d before any other study 
procedure is performed.  
Refer to section 5.3 and 5.3.2  for details on the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
• After obtaining the updated ICF and confirming eligibility, th e subject needs to  be 
entered in to the SBIR enrollment module. SBIR will randomize the subject to a 
time point for blood sample collection. If the subject is part of the sub -cohort, 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should be informed about this  allocation.  
• Information about the delivery and the newborn (including medical care provided 
immediately after birth and planned to be provided subsequently) will be collected 
by the study team from the parents/LAR, and if possible, completed and/or 
confirmed with an o riginal source accessed through a person involved in the 
delivery of the subject or from any authorized person representing the healthcare 
organization that is in charge of the  source.  
• The parent(s)/LAR(s) will be interviewed to obtain information on the f amily 
medical history and demographic and lifestyle characteristics of the subject as 
required by the  eCRF.  
• Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects will be instructed when to contact the 
investigator/study staff and will be provided with diary cards to record sym ptoms 
and healthcare utilization over the course of the disease when instructed to do so 
by the investigator/study staff. For details refer to ‘surveillance contacts (active 
and passive surveillance)’  below.  
Visit 3 (blood sample collection):  
 
• This visit will be applicable only for a sub -cohort of subjects. At the time point 
randomly allocated to each subject selected for a blood draw (2, 4, 6, 12, 18 or 24 
months), an off -site or site visit needs to be scheduled and a single follow -up blood 
sample of 3.5 mL should be collected from the subjects between the intervals of  1 
week, to be included in the analyses e.g. Month 2  1 week, Month 4  1 week. For 
details refer to Table 1 . Children who are born with a gestatio nal age of less than 
36 weeks will be excluded from this  sub-cohort.

APPENDIX  E ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING LRTI 
SURVEILLANCE, INCLUDING ACTIVE 
SURVEILLANCE CONTACT SCHEDULE 
(PRIMARY STUDY) (AMENDED  15-DEC -2017)  
Surveillance contacts (ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SURVEILLANCE)  
 
In order to optimize the reporting procedures of suspected LRTI cases and to ensure 
that the maximum number of cases are timely identified and reported to the study sites, 
both active and passive surveillance will be conducted.  
 
• Passive surveillance by ‘self ’-report of symptoms by parent(s)/LAR(s) of the 
subjects is key for timely identification of a potential LRTI case. Parent(s)/LAR(s) 
need to contact the investigator/study staff as soon as the child experiences new 
RTI symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose), irrespective of the appearance 
of signs of difficulty in breathing, which will be determined by the 
investigator/study staff on  contact.  
• For the active surveillance, parent(s)/LAR(s) of all the subjects will be contacted 
by the investigator/study st aff on a regular basis (active follow -up schedule will  be 
confirmed based on the local settings and seasonality) to identify any potential 
LRTI case and to remind the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects to report any new 
sign of RTI symptoms (cough, runny nos e, blocked nose) as soon as possible 
themselves.  
Note: A child experiencing RTI symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose) with any 
signs of difficulty in breathing will be considered a potential LRTI case.  
 
During each active or passive follow -up contact,  the investigator/study staff will:  
 
• Confirm with the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject, if the subject developed new RTI 
symptoms (cough, runny nose, blocked nose) and if he/she has developed any  signs 
of difficulty in breathing (during and between contacts ). 
 
  In case there is any current sign or suspicion of difficulty in breathing in a 
child with symptom(s) of RTI at the time of the contact, the investigator/study 
staff will instruct the parent(s)/LAR(s) to start completing the diary card and 
will schedule an examination visit as soon as possible, but no later than 72 
hours after the con tact. Performing the visit as soon as possible is important to 
assess the need for medical care, to ensure that early symptoms are captured, 
and also to collect an optimal biological sample for the detection of  RSV.  
The examination visit can be an on -site or off -site visit. An off -site visit is 
preferred in order to avoid influencing the pattern of healthcare 
utilization for the disease. Parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects can however 
be requested to bring their child to the study center for the site 
examin ation visit e.g. if this would be the normal standard of care to 
provide given the situation, if this will significantly expedite the timing of 
the visit, or if it is unlikely that the off -site examination visit can occur at

all within the required timeframe. If the reported symptoms are already of 
a level of severity that urgent care is indicated, the parent(s)/LAR(s) 
should be redirected to the proper locatio n to receive this care (e.g.  
Emergency Room [ER]) and an examination visit could be scheduled to 
take place there at a suitable time.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• If during the contact, the investigator/study staff schedules an examination visit 
(off-site/site), the parent(s)/LAR(s) are instructed to start completion of the diary 
card.  Parent(s)/LAR(s) need to fill the diary card until Day 14 from the day the 
investigator/study staff have instructed them to initiate the diary card, unless the 
investigator/study staff informs them otherwise (e.g. in case of a second 
examination visit). I f the symptoms last for more than 14 days the 
parent(s)/LAR(s) should continue to assess the symptoms until no more symptoms 
are present, and record in the diary card, the date at which no more symptoms 
were observed in the child.  
• For any reported illness, the investigator/study staff should assess the need for any 
intervention and provide the same as part of regular healthcare or instruct/advise 
the parent(s)/LAR(s) where to obtain this care.  
• The active and passive surveillance con tacts and completion of diary card can also 
be made by/with person designated by the parent(s)/LAR(s) (e.g. grandparents, 
nanny) as long as the parent(s)/LAR(s) have approved the same. If needed, a field 
worker can also be assigned to support the parent(s) /LAR(s) and/or person 
designated by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in completing the diary card.  
• On a quarterly basis, an active surveillance contact will be expanded to obtain 
updated information on the demographic, lifestyle and general medical 
characteristics of the subject as required by the  eCRF.  
Refer to phone script provided along with the protocol for details. 
Examination visit (off -site/site):  
• A case eCRF needs to be created for each scheduled examination visit and data 
collected up to case resolution will b e entered. Examination visits will be allocated 
with a unique visit number that is a sequential number per  subject.  
• During the examination visit (off -site/site), the investigator/study staff will 
objectively confirm the RTI and difficulty breathing (i.e. involvement of lower   The surveillance contact and the decision that an examination visit is 
indicated should be recorded in the eCRF. Refer to ‘examination visit’ for 
next steps.  
 In case the symptoms do not include current signs of RTI and difficulty in 
breathing, this surveillance/episode will be recorded in the site’s source 
documentation and i n the eCRF, but no examination visit will be scheduled. 
Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be instructed to contact the study team as soon as 
possible if the severity of the already existing symptoms in the child increases

Note: The investigator/study staff will do an initial assessment of a case reported for 
the examination visit as either RTI or LRTI, only to determine further study activities. 
The final classification of all the cases repor ted as either RTI, LRTI or severe LRTI 
will be done during statistical analyses (as per the LRTI case definition and severity 
scale and comparative scales).  
 
• Nasal swabs will be collected for all the subjects who are reported for an 
examination visit (off -site/site) (this includes subjects with no confirmed  LRTI).  
• Data on disease course and healthcare utilization recorded by the subject’s 
parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary card until the examination visit will be reviewed and 
recorded by the investigator/study s taff in the subject’s  eCRF.  
• During subsequent regular surveillance contacts (active and passive) after an 
examination visit, the status and evolution of the case will be followed, and 
parent(s)/LAR(s) will be reminded to complete the diary card for the ful l period or 
until case resolution, if after. Data provided by the parent(s)/LAR(s) in the diary 
card on healthcare utilization should ideally be confirmed by direct contact of the 
investigator/study staff with the healthcare providers involved in managemen t of 
the case (e.g. General Practitioner [GP], hospital staff) and recorded in the eCRF. 
Where possible, the data on healthcare utilization should be made more complete 
as to best capture the healthcare utilization in the eCRF. Any clinical diagnoses 
for the respiratory infection (e.g. pneumonia, bronchiolitis) made by the contacted 
healthcare providers should be collected and recorded in the eCRF as well as the 
symptoms assessed in support of this diagnosis (especially measured RR and 
SaO2).  
• A new diary ca rd and case eCRF will be initiated for each scheduled examination 
visit. Any ongoing eCRF for that case from previous examination visits will be 
closed and further data recorded in the new case eCRF. If a surveillance case 
eCRF is ‘closed’ due to a subsequ ent examination visit for the same case, the diary 
card relating to the ‘closed’ eCRF is stopped prematurely and a new 14 -day diary 
card is started (see also Section 3-examination  visit).  
• Collection of the completed diary card s will be done at resolution by mail or in 
person depending on local best  practice.  
 
ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE CONTACT SCHEDULE to identify any potential LRTI 
case 
 
Active surveillance is aimed at confirming that a case is/was not missed due to lack of 
reporting by parent(s)/LAR(s) and to remind parent(s)/LAR(s) to report cases of RTI 
symptoms as soon as possible themselves.  
 
Active surveillance is allowed to occur through various media (e.g. text messaging, 
email, telephone, and in -person) based on loca l possibilities  
 
• Requirements for non -live media (e.g., text messaging and email) are  that;  
 They meet GSK, local and international requirements with regards to the 
validity of the system used and data privacy and  security.

Active surveillance is to occur at a defined frequency dependent on the known RSV 
seasonality.  
 
• RSV has a typical winter/monsoon seasonality. The peak rates of RSV occur at 
different times on the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. The tropical regions 
are generally known to have little or no  seasonality.  
 
For this reason, an active surveillance schedule will usually be applied based on the 
known or expected RSV seasonality for each study country/site.  
 
• 12 annual contacts - One monthly contact in all the  regions.  
• At least 4 seasonal contacts – An intermediate contact in the four  known/expected 
peak months, depending on the RSV seasons in the country/site. More 
intermediate contacts may be scheduled if dee med necessary by the  investigator.  
 
Outside the scheduled active surveillance contacts, each country/site can employ 
additional activities to enforce active and passive surveillance at their discretion. These 
activities can be tailored to best meet the loc al situation (e.g. reminders, community 
consultation sessions, additional in -person subject support visits, etc.).  
 
TIMING AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTACT  
 
• Active surveillance contacts are scheduled compared to the calendar week (Sat - 
Sun) of enrollment into the study. So regardless of the day of birth, the first 
Sunday after birth is Week 1 in the surveillance  schedule.  
 
• Seasonal contacts can occur anytime during the season they are scheduled to 
occur. A minimum of three attempts, occurring on at least two di fferent working 
days should be  made.  
 
• Monthly contacts should occur in the first two weeks of the calendar month. A 
minimum of six attempts, occurring on at least four different working days  spread 
over two subsequent weeks should be made to make contact f or monthly 
surveillance  contacts.  
 
DISCONTINUATION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE  
 
All reasonable efforts should be made to conduct all active surveillance contacts in line 
with the schedule mentioned above. However, subjects’  parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject 
may not be available for active surveillance for a period of time.   At least one live (e.g., telephone or in -person) contact occurs every  quarter.  
 An adequate response is obtained on non -live contact (e.g. return text message 
or return email). Any non -live contact that is not responded to after a 
maximum of 2 reminders within the course of 2 days should be followed up 
with a live  contact.

 • During active contacts, investigator/study staff should request the parent(s)/LAR(s) 
of the subject if they will unavailable for a scheduled period (e.g. due to holiday). 
If so, the active surveillance contacts can then be actively planned differently or 
cancelled compared to the regular schedule. No more than 2 consecutive active 
surveillance contacts and/or a period of more than 1 month can be  cancelled.  
 
• Active surveillance should be suspended after there has been no contact for more 
than 3 planned contacts and/or no contact for more than 2 months and a final 
attempt has been made by mail or a live visit. If the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject 
contact the investigator/study staff at a later point in time through passive 
surveillance, t he case should be followed up, data should be collected at 
intermittent period and active surveillance could be  reinitiated.

Amendment  number:  1 
Amen dment date:  27 November 2013  
Co-ordinating  author:  PPD , Scientific  writer  
Rationale/background for changes:  
In order to reduce study complexity and manage the global study budget the study 
design has been amended as follows.  
 
• The sample size has been reduced from 3,000 subjects to 2,400 subjects to balance 
recruitment of approximately 400 subjects in each geographic/climatic area. 
Reducing the sample size will affect the precision of the estimates obtained, but 
will be sufficie nt to meet the study objectives with a sample size of 2,400  subjects.  
• The maximum number of active surveillance contacts has been fixed to 16 per year 
per subject. Reducing active surveillance impacts the probability to detect cases of 
LRTI. To balance the  risk of missing cases of LRTI, the study sites will also 
perform passive surveillance. The study procedure manual will outline passive 
surveillance methods that could be implemented in country settings e.g. social 
media applications in developed countries  versus regular (weekly) person -to- 
person community visits in less developed  countries.  
• In addition, some minor editorial changes have been  made.  
Amended text has been included in bold italics and deleted text in strikethrough  in

Proper passive surveillance is import ant in order to identify potential cases as early as 
possible. The active surveillance is mostly aimed at reinforcing the passive surveillance 
as the chance of picking up a (developing) case at the exact time of the active 
surveillance contact is limited.  
In between scheduled active surveillance contacts, the study staff can employ activities 
to solicit passive surveillance according to local practices, e.g. reminder emails or text 
messages up to regular community centre visits.  
Where possible, t The study t eam will confirm and expand relevant healthcare utilization 
with the healthcare provider involved in the management of the case.

 15-DEC -2017  110 The design effect measures the increase in the standard error of the estimate due to the 
sampling design. The following formula will be used to estimate the design effect in the 
simulation [Bennett, 1991]  
 
Each simulation consists of creating ‘ c’ clusters whose size and incidence vary around a 
given value. Then the above formula was applied to estimate the design effect in the 
simulation . Table 11 shows the median result of 1000 simulations (with 5th and 95th 
percentile). The design effect [Bennett, 1991] can be estimated as following once the 
intra -cluster correlation value is known or can be assumed:  
 
DE = 1 + (b – 1) ρ 
 
Where, ρ is the intra -cluster correlation and b is the average number of subjects 
sampled per cluster. According to the results of simulations, we could assume that the 
intra -cluster correlation of 0.02 (See Table 11 below) and considering 12 clusters of 
200160 subjects, we expect that the design effect will take a value of 4.18between 2.57  
and 9.49. A median value of 5.13 was used for the CIs described in Table 9 . 
 
Assuming a drop -out rate of about 20% during the course of follow -up approximately 
6400 subjects by country/region and 3000 2400 subjects overall will need to be r ecruited.  
Section 9.3.3 ATP cohort:  
The ATP cohort will include all subjects meeting all eligibility criteria up to the time of 
their censoring, either at study completion or prematurely as drop -out (e.g. withdrawn 
consent, los st-to-follow -up, lack of comp liance).  
Section 9.8 Analysis of tertiary objectives:  
• To explore the impact of variations in cord -blood sample collection variables on the 
stability of test results.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels will be assessed versus variability in sample 
collection variables. This involves assessment versus various continuous and 
categorical variables and an overall comparison between samples as classified 
‘according to recommended procedure’ and ‘not according to recommended 
procedure’.  
 
The measured mate rnal antibody levels by duration of the processing step and overall 
process duration will be analysed graphically and by log -linear regression.  
 
The measured maternal antibody levels by storage condition or tube type will be 
analysed graphically and by gro up statistics (mean, 95% CI). Group means will be 
compared by t -test to assess the statistical significance of differences.

assessed if we detect potential areas of improvement of the LRTI case definition and 
severity scale, such as clearly under or overestimated incidence rates of LRTI/ severe  
LRTI compared to the rates in the literature or a lack of discriminative power between 
severe and non -severe cases.  
 
Section 9.10.1 Sequence of analyses:  
 
An interim analysis will be performed after data lock at the end of recruitment (expected 
after 18 m onths) or in June 2015 whichever occurs first, on the data collected for the 
subjects recruited in the first year of the study (approximately 2000 1600 ). 
 
APPENDIX C Active surveillance contact schedule:  
 
• Requirements for the non-live media chosen are  that; 
 At least one in three subsequent  live contact s is done by phone occurs every 
quarter.  
 An adequate response is obtained on non -live contact (e.g. return text message 
or return email). Any non -live contact that is not responded to after a maximum 
of 2 remind ers within the course of 2 1 days should be followed up with a  
phone call live contact . 
RSV has a typical winter /monsoon seasonality.  
For th is e above mentioned  reasons, an active surveillance schedule will be applied

according to the following schedule per geographic area (each study site will be allocated  
to a schedule based on geography and known data on seasonality pattern);  
• 12 annual contacts - One monthly contact in all the  regions.  
• 4 seasonal contacts – An intermediate contact in the four known/expected peak 
months, depending on the RSV seasons in the  country/site.  
• Outside the scheduled active surveillance contacts, each country/site can employ 
additional activities to enforce passive surveillance at their discretion. These 
activities can be tailored to best meet the local situation (e.g. reminders, 
community consultation sessions  etc.).

Rationale/background for changes:  
 
Infant respiratory viral infection and childhood asthma are the most common acute and 
chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life respiratory syncytial 
virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) being strongly associated with 
increased asthma risk with no direct link to causality.  
 
World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI case 
definition. The latter includes c linical features considered to be objective, easily 
standardized, generalizable across settings, and generally accepted markers of severe or 
very severe RSV disease.  
 
Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors and/or 
events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma inception 
in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be defined 
best by the concept of cytokine dysregulation; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and some 
form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time -period in the 
development of the immune system or the lung [Lemanske,  2002].

Protocol Amendment 3 Final  
The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and 
define the importance of these three factors on asthma pathogenesis and to test different 
asthma case classificat ions [Lemanske, 2002, Lemanske, 2005, Bisgaard, 2011, 
Jackson, 2008, Jackson, 2012, Bønnelykke, 2015]. These studies have used similar 
albeit slightly different case definitions on asthma diagnosis. These definitions are 
widely used in epidemiological lite rature of asthma etiology in children. The Bisgaard 
definition [Bisgaard, 2011] has multiple criteria that are assessed by the physician from 
records. Therefore the advantage of this definition is that the same objective criteria are 
applied to ascertain e ach case of asthma. However, its application may be challenging 
in some settings if routine medical records do not fully capture the necessary 
information in source. The Jackson definition [Jackson, 2008] includes the criteria of 
HCP diagnosis of asthma an d prescription of 2 agonists. This definition is therefore 
influenced by any differences in local practice of asthma diagnosis and management of 
wheeze. However, its advantage is that it captures the reality of diagnosis and 
treatment. This study anticipa tes that Bisgaard will be more specific and Jackson more 
sensitive. Hence, this study will assess the performance of these two case definitions 
since this will help planning for phase 3 clinical trials of RSV  vaccines.  
 
Numerous longitudinal studies have d emonstrated this first important line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respiratory viral infection 
severity and asthma risk, with increas ing infant infection severity associated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by the population - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the prevalence 
of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and approximately 9 to 
17% in the second year of life.  
 
Among infants with LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in 
the first 3 months of lif e. Thus, the phenotype of asthma after infant RSV LRTI 
accounts for up to 31% of early childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk 
estimated at about 13% in several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].  
 
This cohort study provides us an opportunity to evaluate a potential association and the 
disease burden in the population due to RSV LRTI (exposure) early in life and the 
development of recurrent wheeze and asthma later in life (outcome). Derived 
calculati ons of incidence of recurrent wheeze and asthma among RSV LRTI positive 
and negative subjects and the calculation of population attributable risk percent will be 
able to potentially demonstrate a measurement of potential public health impact if a 
successfu l maternal and/or pediatric vaccine introduced and exposure (RSV) 
eliminated/reduced.

Hence, the protocol is being amended to reflect the following changes:  
 
• All subjects enrolled in the study will now be followed up from 2 years of age  up 
to 6 years of age to capture episodes of wheeze and the diagnosis of  asthma.  
• Additional secondary and tertiary objectives are being included in order to support 
exploratory analysis of the extent the early life experience of RSV LRTI is 
accounting for the total burden of wheeze and asthma from birth up to 6 years of 
age. 
• To perform an exploratory analysis and test of asthma case definitions and  case 
classification performance based on well defined and commonly used case 
definitions from epidemiological  studies.  
• To update LRTI case definitions and severity scale (according to WHO, 2015 
[Modjarrad,  2016]).  
• Information from this study will now be used to infer the potential benefit in terms 
of disease burden reduction and health care utilization of successful 
implementation of vaccination against RSV and measurement of potential public 
health impact and poten tial incidence reduction if a maternal and/or pediatric 
vaccine introduced and exposure (RSV) eliminated.  
• Overall, the new objectives aim to support the fact that successful maternal and 
paediatric  vaccines  that would  be introduced  would  provide  protection  through  the 
first two years of life against RSV LRTI and thus would reduce the burden of 
recurrent wheeze and asthma associated RSV from birth until the sixth  birthday.

 15-DEC -2017  119 Synopsis and section 3  Study design  overview:  
 
In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of 2 years 
for RSV LRTI. In order to determine the population attributable risk and population 
attributable risk percent of wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and to explore the association of RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life with other potential risk factors for wheeze 
and asthma, the study will be extended and subjects will be followed -up from t he age of 
2 years up to 6 years to detect episodes of wheeze and diagnoses of asthma.*  
 
*Note: The procedures related to primary study (surveillance of RSV LRTI) will not be 
extended into the extension period. The extension period will survey for occurrenc e of 
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary 
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were 
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8).  
 
Epidemiological cohort s tudies have some limitations. It is possible that study dropouts 
might occur leading to differential lost to follow up and bias study. Moreover, it is 
possible that a selection bias might occur. Factors pertaining to enrollment of subjects 
into this prospe ctive cohort study would not introduce selection bias. In order to 
introduce bias, selection has to be related to both exposure and outcome. But in this 
study, subjects are enrolled in prospective cohort before they experience the outcome of 
interest.  
 
Another potential limitation of this study is the occurrence of confounding especially 
with potential risk factors. A possible alternative would be to match within a cohort 
study. But this can reduce the efficiency of a cohort study even when there is no 
samp le-size reduction and even when the matching variable is a confounder.  
Furthermore, albeit cohort matching prevents confounding by the matched variable, it 
is not considered an advantage of matched designs since in an unmatched study 
confounding by the cov ariates can be removed by analytical methods. Hence, in order 
to deal with the confounding factors stratification analysis will be used for each 
confounder. Multivariate logistic regression will also be used to adjust to confounders 
after selection from th e univariate logistic regression. All possible confounding factors 
such as gender, geographic ancestry, pets, parental smoking and previous maternal or 
siblings history of asthma will be analyzed first in stratification and then in logistic 
regression (uni variate and multivariate).

surveillance contacts  
 
• Parent(s)/legally acceptable representative(s) (LARs) of the subject will be contacted 
during the pregnancy in order to be informed about the study and to request consent 
for their child’s participation in the primary  study.  
 The parent(s)/LAR(s) will be requested to provide consent during  pregnancy, 
after at least 20 weeks gestation, to enrol their child into the study, at  birth.  
 The child will be checked for eligibility criteria applicable before  birth.  
 The remaining eligibil ity criteria applicable after birth will be assessed as soon 
as possible, and the child’s participation in the study will be confirmed  through 
an updated and resigned informed consent form (ICF) (including any other 
potentially relevant identifiers as appl icable by local requirements) , not later 
than 5 working days after the birth of the  subject.  
At the end of primary study (from birth up to the age of 2 years), parent(s)/LARs) will 
be asked for re -consent for their child’s participation in the extension ( from 
approximately 2 years of age up to 6 years of age), pertaining to the amendment related 
to wheeze and asthma.  
 
• Study population: A cohort of approximately 2400 infants will be included in the 
study at birth and followed -up up to a maximum of  2 years o f age. Maximum 2400 
children will be included in the extension and followed -up up to 6 years of  age. Enrolment visit

 15-DEC -2017  121 • Biological  samples:  
 Serum derived from up to approximately 10 milliliters (mL) of cord  blood 
samples collected from all the subjects participating in the study, at  birth.  
 Nasal swabs collected from subjects with potential LRTI symptoms i. e. RTI 
symptoms with any signs of difficulty in  breathing.  
 Serum derived from a single blood sample of approximately 3.5 mL collected 
from a sub -cohort of subjects. This sub -cohort consists of the first 2000 enrolled 
subjects, from which those born at a ge stational age of less than 36 weeks will be 
excluded from this blood sampling. Sampling time points for this sub -cohort will 
be randomly allocated as specified in Table  1. 
 No biological samples will be collected during the extension (from 
approximately 2 y ears of age up to 6 years of  age).  
• Duration of the study: The entire duration of the primary study will be 
approximately 3  years.  
 Assuming no delays in recruitment, two -thirds of the subjects (approximately 
1600) will be recruited in Year 1 of the study and will be followed -up up to 2 
years of age, resulting in a total primary study duration of 3 years. The 
remaining subjects (approx imately 800) will be recruited in the first half of  Year 
2 of the study and will be followed up till the end of Year 3. The follow -up 
period for subjects recruited in Year 2 will thus be 1.5 to 2 years.* Refer to 
Figure 4 for more  details.  
 In case of any d elays in recruitment for the first two -thirds of the subjects in the 
study, the study duration will be extended until all these subjects have 
completed follow -up up to 2 years of age. Delays in the recruitment of the last 
one-third of the subjects will be absorbed by a shorter follow -up time for these 
subjects.  
 Based on the preliminary results of the interim analyses including any  delays 
incurred in the recruitment at that time, a decision will be taken whether to 
complete the study as currently described i n this protocol, or to extend study 
completion to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of  follow -up.* 
 *Note: Based on the preliminary results of the interim analyses it was decided 
that the incidence rate would be more robust if all subjects completed th e 
study as described  above.  
The duration of the extension period will be approximately 4 years. Subjects will 
be followed -up from approximately 2 years of age up to 6 years of age.  
 Epoch 1: Prospective data collection starting at birth up to a maximum of  2 
years of age on episodes of RSV  LRTI .* 
 Epoch 2: Prospective and retrospective data collection starting at the age of 
approximately 2 years and up to 6 years of age on episodes of wheeze and 
asthma.

Synopsis and  section  3.1 Discussion of the study  design  
 
The association of other respiratory viruses with RSV -associated LRTI and/or severe 
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV  risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. The influence of other respiratory viruses in co - 
infections will be assessed by testing selected samples for the occurrence of other viruses  
after the primary analy ses are completed.  In order to assess and adjust for other potential 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  
 
The subjects enrolled in the primary study will be followed up for episodes of RSV 
LRTI from 0 to 2 years of age. At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as 
soon as possible thereafter), the surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopp ed and the 
subjects will be re -consented for study extension during which they will be followed up 
for the occurrence of wheeze and asthma. Thus, this study also helps to assess how 
much of wheeze and asthma and its healthcare utilization from birth until the sixth 
birthday can be attributable to RSV clinical LRTI and RSV infection in the first two 
years of life. Any information pertaining to a gap period between completion of 
primary study and consent to the extension will be captured retrospectively by 
examination of health records, discussion with health care provider and parental 
interview.  
*Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary study (documented 
at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were recorded during the 
examination visits, see Section 9.8).  
 
This cohort provides us an opportunity and information to evaluate a potential 
association between RSV LRTI (exposure) early in life and the development of 
recurrent wheeze and asthma later in life (outcome). In o ther words, this study will 
assess to what extent this early life experience of RSV LRTI is accounting for the total 
burden of wheeze and asthma from birth until sixth birthday. Moreover, this study will 
also test the performance of asthma case definition.  This study will be able to 
potentially demonstrate a measurement of potential public health impact and potential

Section  6.4 Outline of study  procedures  
 
In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of 2 years 
for RSV LRTI. In o rder to determine the population attributable risk and population 
attributable risk percent of wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and to explore the association of RSV 
clinical LRTI in th e first two years of life with other potential risk factors for wheeze 
and asthma the study will be extended and subjects will be followed -up up to the age of 
6 years.*  
 
*Note: The procedures related to primary study (surveillance of RSV LRTI) will not be 
extended into the extension period. The extension period will survey for occurrence of 
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary 
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were 
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8).  
 
During the extension subjects will be followed up through quarterly contacts. Parents 
will be encouraged to seek a clinical assessment of their child in between quarterly 
contacts and/or during quar terly contacts whenever their child develops wheezing 
and/or breathing difficulties.

 15-DEC -2017  135 • To assess  the performance  of the LRTI  case definition  and severity  scale  for 
RSV -associated  cases.  
Incidences rates will b e calculated as the number of RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI 
as classified by the LRTI case definition and severity scale and also as classified by the 
comparator case definitions (WHO and Nokes, et al [ Wright, 2010  Modjarrad, 2016; 
Nokes, 2004]), over th e number of children -years observations, overall and by  subgroups.  
 
Descriptive statistics of the different types of healthcare utilization will be provided 
(proportions, duration, etc.) among RSV -associated LRTI/severe LRTI as classified by 
the LRTI case definition and severity scale and also as classified by the comparator case 
definitions (WHO and Nokes, et al [Wright, 2010  Modjarrad, 2016; Nokes, 2004]), 
overall and by subgroups.  
 
Section  9.7 Analysis of secondary  objectives  
 
Descriptive statistics of t he different types of healthcare utilization will be provided 
(proportions, duration, etc.) among non -RSV -associated RTI with a suspicion of 
involvement of the lower respiratory tract, overall and by subgroups.  
 
• To evaluate the association between RSV -associated LRTI, RSV -associated 
severe  LRTI  and RSV  neutralizing  antibodies  in the baseline  cord  blood  samples 
collected from subjects, at  birth.  
The impact of the level of RSV neutralizing antibodies in the baseline cord blood samples 
on the risk of having a RSV -associated LRTI and RSV -associated severe LRTI will be 
assessed through a statistical model.  
 
• To determine the prevalence of RSV A and B  infection, at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 
months in a randomly selected sub -cohort of subjects by assessing antibodies in 
serum.  
• To determine the population attributable risk of wheeze and asthma from birth to 
sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the first  two years of  life. 
The population attributable risk together with 95% CI of medically attended wheeze, 
wheeze or asthma requiring admission, prescription of medications for wheeze or 
asthma will be calculated overall and by age strata (0 -2 years, 2 -4 year s and 5 -6 years) 
and by country, respectively.  
 
The population attributable risk is calculated by subtracting the incidence rate in the 
subjects who did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life from the 
incidence rate in all subjects inclu ding both who had and who did not have RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.

 15-DEC -2017  136 For example, the population attributable risk of medically attended wheeze will be 
calculated as  
 
Ip-Iu 
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not 
have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of 
medically attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had and who did not have  
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
• To determine the population attributable risk percent of wheeze and asthma from 
birth until sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of  life. 
The population attributable risk percent  together with 95% CI of medically attended 
wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring admission, and prescription of medications for 
wheeze and asthma will be calculated overall and by age strata (0 -2 years, 2 -4 years 
and 5 -6 years), respectively.  
 
The population  attributable risk percent is calculated by dividing the population 
attributable risk by the incidence rate in all the subjects including both who had and 
who did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
For example, the population attri butable risk percent of medically attended wheeze will 
be calculated as  
 
(Ip-Iu)/Ip*100  
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not 
have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of 
medically attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had and who did not have 
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
The population attributable risk  and population attributable risk percent will be 
stratified by country and other confounding factors as well such as, but not limited to 
family and siblings, history of asthma, atopy or food allergy, living or recurrent contact 
with pets, child history or  diagnosis of allergy, atopy, eczema or atopic dermatitis, etc. 
The detail for calculating the CI for both population attributable risk and population 
attributable risk percent will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.  
 
Section  9.8 Analysis of ter tiary objectives  
 
• To explore the association of RSV and other respiratory viruses with the 
incidence of LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as determined by the LRTI case 
definition and severity scale) using xTAG™ RVP Fast  assay.  
For each of the other  respiratory viruses, incidence rates will be calculated as the number 
of LRTI/severe LRTI cases associate ed with the virus over the number of children -years 
observations.

RTI, LRTI and/or severe LRTI (as determined by the LRTI case definition and 
severity  scale).  
Descriptive analyses (mean, median, min, max) of viral load assessed by the RSV R T- 
qPCR of RSV RTI, RSV LRTI and severe LRTI cases will be tabulated.  
 
• To assess the natural decay of maternal antibody levels using a single follow -up 
blood sample collected from a randomly selected sub -cohort of subjects at 2, 4,  6, 
12, 18 and 24 months.  
The decay of maternal antibody levels over time will be analysed graphically and by a 
log-linear regression. A true, natural decay curve will be explored by stochastically 
reducing the sample to uninfected subjects only. The following steps will be taken to 
identify, confirmed and suspected infected subjects to eliminate these from the sample;  
 
• Subjects with an RSV positive sample  nasal swab during the study before time of 
sampling will be  eliminated.  
• To explore the association of RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life and 
other potential risk factors for wheeze and  asthma.  
The incidence rate of medically attended wheeze, wheeze or asthma requiring 
admission, and prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma will be stratified by 
country.  
 
Besides, multivariate Poisson regression model including RSV clinical LRTI in the 
first two years of life (Yes/No) and other potential risk factors such as, but not limited 
to, family and siblings, history of asthma, atopy or food allergy, living or recurr ent 
contact with pets, child history or diagnosis of allergy, atopy, eczema or atopic 
dermatitis, etc, will be explored, respectively.  
 
The number and percentage of children with diagnosis of asthma (case definition 1 
and 2) will be described for each age (2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years); the number and 
percentage of children with recurrent wheeze from age 2 -3, 3-4, 4-5 and 5 -6 will be 
described overall and by country listed above in frequency tables.  
 
The risk of physician diagnosed asthma at the age of 6 years us ing case definition 1 
and case definition 2 and recurrent wheeze (occurring from 2nd to the 6th birthday) will 
be analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model including RSV clinical LRTI 
in the first two years of life (Yes/No) and other potential risk factors listed above, 
respectively.  
 
• To explore the performance of asthma case definitions.  
 
Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare the two case definitions 
of asthma. A 2x2 contingency table similar as for one of the co -primar y objective will 
be provided and the following measures of agreement (with 95% CI) will be calculated:

Data for endpoints will be pooled across primary and extension period as follows:  
 
• Medically attended wheeze, in the primary phase corresponds to episodes of 
wheeze documented at an examination visit initiated by monthly contacts with 
parents and in the extension phase by a history from parents solicited by contact 
every 3 months, which may be supplemented by review of routine medical  records 
or contact with health care  provider.  
• Wheeze or asthma requiring admis sion in the primary phase corresponds to 
episodes of wheeze documented at an examination visit that were associated with 
admission to hospital and in the extension phase by a history from parents, which 
may be supplemented by review of routine medical reco rds or contact with health 
care provider.  
• Prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma in the primary phase will be 
extracted from all treatments that were recorded during the examination visits and 
in the extension phase by specific request for releva nt medication from parents, 
which may be supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with 
health care  provider.  
• Diagnosis of asthma according to case definition 1 and 2will not be assessed 
during the primary phase and will be assessed for the first time at the first contact 
of the extension period and annually thereafter until study  conclusion.  
• Diagnosis of recurrent wheeze as 4 or more episodes in one calendar year, will be 
assessed in the primary phase based on the episodes of wheeze documented at an 
examination visit initiated by monthly contacts with parents and in the extension 
phase by a history from parents solicited by contact every 3 months, which may be 
supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with health care 
provider.  
Section  9.10.1  Sequence of  analyses  
 
An interim analysis will be performed after data lock at the end of recruitment (expected 
after 18 months) or in June 2015 whichever occurs firs t, on the data collected for the 
subjects recruited in the first year of the study (approximately 1600). This interim 
analysis will be performed to obtain preliminary indications of the results in very young 
infants. These preliminary results will be used for potential adjustment of the LRTI Case 
Definition and Severity Scale before final analysis, to assess the need to extend the 
primary study to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of follow -up and to provide data

antibodies to neutralise the cytopathic effects of RSV ( for example, strains A and B) on 
the host cell line, hence RSV replication. In the first step of the assay, a specific quantity 
of a replication capable RSV virus and a defined dilution of serum are mixed and 
incubated. Each serum dilution is tested in dup licates or triplicates.  
 
RT-qPCR assay  
 
Briefly, RSV A and RSV B ribonucleic acids (RNAs) extracted from the nasal swabs 
are detected in a duplex PCR format using specific amplification primers and 
fluorescent probes designed in the RSV N gene, encoding the RSV nucleocapsid 
protein. The process involves nucleic acids extraction, conversion of RNA to 
complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) by reverse transcription and detection 
by real - time PC R reaction using a calibration curve (absolute quantitation). The RSV 
viral load is reported as copies of RSV RNA per mL of sample.  
 
Based on genetic and antigenic variations in the structural proteins, RSV is classified in  
two subgroups, A and B. In order  to identify and quantify RSV -A and RSV -B nucleic  
acids in various respiratory specimens, such as nasal and throat swab samples, a single - 
step quantitative RT -qPCR assay has been developed. Two sets of primers’ pairs and  
probe have been designed in the N gene encoding the nucleocapsid protein: one targeting  
RSV -A and the other targeting RSV -B. 
 
Viral RNA from 200 µL of the clinical sample is extracted using the MagNA Pure LC 
Instrument and MagNA Pure LC Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. Purified RNA is  
eluted in a final volume of 50 µL. RNA from the clinical sample is amplified and  
detected using the specific primers and probes for RSV -A and RSV -B RNA with the help  
of ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System 96 -Well Bloc k Module (Applied  
Biosystems). Viral load values are quantified and the sample is considered positive when  
the measured viral load is equal to or above the assay cut -off. Several controls are  
included at the extraction step to monitor the efficiency of the  extraction and the potential  
contamination during the extraction run. In addition, RT -qPCR positive controls  
corresponding to a standard curve obtained by dilution of a mix of RSV -A and RSV -B 
synthetic RNA from 106 to 102 copies/RT -qPCR are added to the R T-qPCR step.  Two

Section  1.1 Background  
 
1.1.1 RSV  
This study aims to assess the incidence and associated healthcare utilization of RSV - 
associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of  
age, and also to assess the accu racy of a newly developed LRTI case definition and  
severity scale compared to two existing scales developed by World Health Organization  
(WHO) and Nokes et al. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated 
its RSV -associated LRTI case definition  [Modjarrad, 2016]. The latter includes clinical 
features considered to be objective, easily standardized, generalizable across settings, 
and generally accepted markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
1.1.2 Asthma  
 
The LRTI case definition and severity sc ale has been developed as a consensus model  
derived from existing definitions in the literature, and existing guidelines by

intern ational RSV experts. Suspected cases of LRTI will be classified into RTI, LRTI or  
severe LRTI based on the data collected in the study, according to the newly developed  
LRTI case definition and severity scale. The presence of RSV in potential LRTI cases  
will be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasal swabs. Following the  
confirmation of RSV, the performance of LRTI case definition and severity scale will be  
determined based on the resulting incidence of LRTI and severe LRTI and their  
associati on with healthcare utilization. Full symptom data over the course of the disease  
for all suspected LRTI cases will be collected before positive identification of RSV by  
nasal swab testing. With this symptom data, the LRTI case definition and severity scale  
will be further explored to determine the clinical symptoms which better describe an  
LRTI and severe LRTI case and the LRTI case definition and severity scale will be  
updated if this improves its performance.  
 
Infant respiratory viral infection and childhood asthma are the most common acute 
and chronic diseases of childhood, respectively. Common clinical features and links 
between these diseases have long been recognized, with early -life RSV LRTIs being 
strongly  associated with increased asthma risk.  
 
World Health Organization (WHO) has recently updated its RSV -associated LRTI case  
definition [Modjarrad, 2016]. The latter includes clinical features considered to be  
objective, easily standardized, generalizable ac ross settings, and generally accepted  
markers of severe or very severe RSV disease.  
 
Although asthma is probably a heterogeneous disease or syndrome, three factors 
and/or events consistently emerge for their ability to significantly influence asthma 
incept ion in the first decade of life: immune response aberrations, which appear to be 
defined best by the concept of cytokine dysregulation; LRTIs, in particular RSV; and 
some form of gene –environment interaction that needs to occur at a critical time - 
period i n the development of the immune system or the lung [Lemanske, 2002].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by the population - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the 
prevalence  cumulative inc idence of LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year 
of life and approximately 9 to 17% in the second year of life. Among infants with 
LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of 
life. Thus, the phenotype o f asthma after infant RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of 
early childhood asthma, with a population -attributable risk estimated at about 13% in 
several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this first importan t line of evidence 
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also 
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respiratory viral infection 
severity and asthma risk, with increasing infant infection severity a ssociated with 
greater childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
The Childhood Origins of Asthma (COAST) study was developed to determine and 
define the importance of these three factors on asthma pathogenesis  and to test 
different asthma case classifications [Lemanske, 2002; Lemanske, 2005; Bisgaard,

 15-DEC -2017  145 2011; Jackson, 2008; Jackson, 2012; Bønnelykke, 2015]. These studies have used 
similar albeit slightly different case defi nitions on asthma diagnosis. The International 
Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) takes a slightly different parent - 
based questionnaire approach toward assessing asthma prevalence in young children.  
 
These definitions are widely used in e pidemiological literature of asthma etiology in 
children. The Bisgaard definition [Bisgaard, 2011] has multiple criteria that are 
assessed by the physician from records. Therefore the advantage of this definition is 
that the same objective criteria are app lied to ascertain each case of asthma. However, 
its application may be challenging in some settings if routine medical records do not 
fully capture the necessary information in source. The Jackson definition [Jackson, 
2008] includes the criteria of health care provider (HCP) diagnosis of asthma and 
prescription  of 2 agonists.  This definition  is therefore  influenced  by any differences  in 
local practice of asthma diagnosis and management of wheeze. However, its advantage 
is that it captures the reality of di agnosis and treatment. This study anticipates that  
Bisgaard will be more specific and Jackson more sensitive. Hence, this study will assess  
the performance of these two case definitions since this will help planning for phase 3  
clinical trials of RSV vaccines. ISAAC uses simple, robust, primarily symptom -based 
questions that are administered solely to the parents. ISAAC’s strength is that its 
definitions are not affected by differences in local asthma treatment practices; 
however,  its lack of clinical case confirmation may decrease its precision. The ISAAC 
questionnaire has been used to assess pediatric asthma prevalence in at least 42 
countries across the globe [Pearce,  2007].  
Numerous longitudinal studies have demonstrated this f irst important line of evidence  
that RSV LRTIs precede the development of asthma. Several birth cohort studies also  
demonstrate a dose –response relationship between infant respiratory viral infection  
severity and asthma risk, with increasing infant infecti on severity associated with greater  
childhood asthma risk and asthma severity [Feldman, 2015].  
 
Population -level contribution of RSV LRTIs is best demonstrated by the population - 
attributable risk for asthma after these early -life LRTIs. Among infants, the  prevalence of  
LRTI is approximately 18 to 32% in the first year of life and approximately 9 to 17% in  
the second year of life. Among infants with LRTI, the prevalence of RSV can be as high  
as 80%, especially in the first 3 months of life. Thus, the phenot ype of asthma after infant  
RSV LRTI accounts for up to 31% of early childhood asthma, with a population - 
attributable risk estimated at about 13% in several diverse populations [Feldman, 2015].

associated, suspected LRTI in a general population of infants from birth up to 2 years of

 15-DEC -2017  146 This study will also assess the extent to which RSV LRTI in e arly life (up to 2 years of 
age) accounts for the total burden of wheeze and asthma up to the sixth birthday, and 
test the performance of 3 asthma case definitions – those of Bisgaard, Jackson, and 
ISAAC.  
 
Paragraph 4:  
 
Considering asthma case definitions,  this study anticipates that Bisgaard will be 
more specific and Jackson more sensitive. Although it is likely that the ISAAC 
symptom -based case definitions will be the most sensitive and least specific of all 
three definitions [Yang 2011], its incorporatio n will facilitate wider international 
results comparisons. Hence, this study will assess the performance of the different 
case definitions since this will help planning for phase 3 clinical trials of RSV 
vaccines.  
 
Paragraph 5:  
 
If, in future, a maternal a nd/or pediatric RSV vaccine is introduced, results of this 
study may be used to evaluate post -vaccination incidence reduction (in RSV LRTI 
and/or wheeze and asthma) and the vaccine’s potential public health impact.

3.1 Design Summary  
 
In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of 2 years 
for RSV LRTI, Episodes of wheeze and diagnoses of asthma were also documented . 
Refer to Figure 1. . 
 
In order to determine the population attributable risk and population attributable risk 
percent of wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in 
the first two years of life, and to explore the association of RSV clinical LRTI i n the first 
two years of life with other potential risk factors for wheeze and asthma, the study will be 
extended and subjects will be followed -up from the age of 2 years up to 6 years to detect 
episodes of wheeze and diagnoses of asthma.* Refer to Figure 2..

 15-DEC -2017  147 *Note: The procedures related to primary study surveillance of RSV LRTI will not be 
extended into the extension period. The extension period will survey for occurrence of 
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary  
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were  
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8.3).  
 
Epidemiological cohort studies have some limitations. It is possible  that study dropouts  
might occur leading to differential lost to follow up and bias study. Moreover, it is  
possible that a selection bias might occur. Factors pertaining to enrollment of subjects  
into this prospective cohort study would not introduce selec tion bias. In order to  
introduce bias, selection has to be related to both exposure and outcome. But in this  
study, subjects are enrolled in prospective cohort before they experience the outcome of  
interest.  
 
Another potential limitation of this study is t he occurrence of confounding especially  
with potential risk factors. A possible alternative would be to match within a cohort 
study. But this can reduce the efficiency of a cohort study even when there is no sample - 
size reduction and even when the matchin g variable is a confounder. Furthermore, albeit  
cohort matching prevents confounding by the matched variable, it is not considered an  
advantage of matched designs since in an unmatched study confounding by the covariates  
can be removed by analytical method s. Hence, in order to deal with the confounding  
factors stratification analysis will be used for each confounder. Multivariate logistic  
regression will also be used to adjust to confounders after selection from the univariate  
logistic regression. All possi ble confounding factors such as gender, geographic ancestry,  
pets, parental smoking and previous maternal or siblings history of asthma will be  
analyzed first in stratification and then in logistic regression (univariate and  multivariate).

3.2.1 Primary Study  
The Primary study is being conducted to  will determine the incidence and associated 
utilization of RSV -associated LRTIs in infants from birth up to the age of 2 years, and 
also to  assess the performance of a new LRTI case definition and severity scale.  
Subjects will be identified for participation in the study during the pregnancy after at  least 
20 weeks gestation and before t he start of the delivery. This will be done to ensure that  
the parent(s)/LAR(s) have sufficient time to consider and provide informed consent  
before the subject is born and to obtain a baseline blood cord sample from each subject, 
at birth. Using this samp le, the level of natural protection conferred by the mother to the  
child at birth in the form of maternal antibodies will be assessed and prospectively related  
to subsequent risk of RSV -associated LRTI.  
 
In order to identify all cases of LRTI that occur on  a community level, the cohort of  
infants recruited at birth will be followed -up by active and passive surveillance for  
respiratory symptoms and potential LRTI, up to maximum 2 years of age. For the passive  
surveillance, parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects wi ll be instructed to report new RTI  
symptoms of cough or a runny or blocked nose as soon as possible to the  
investigator/study staff. Proper passive surveillance is important in order to identify  
potential cases as early as possible. The active surveillance  is mostly aimed at reinforcing  
the passive surveillance as the chance of picking up a (developing) case at the exact time  
of the active surveillance contact is limited . Active surveillance, at a frequency dependent  
of the RSV seasonality, involves regular contact of the investigator/study staff with the  
parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects to report any new sign of RTI symptoms (cough, runny  
nose, blocked nose) as soon as possible themselves. In between scheduled active  
surveillance contacts, the study staff can employ activities to solicit passive surveillance  
according to local practices, e.g. reminder emails or text messages up to regular  
community centre visits . 
After identification of a potential case of LRTI based on all reported symptoms, an  
examination visit will be scheduled as early as possible in the disease progression (within  
72 hours after initial identification of a potential LRTI case by the investigat or/study  staff 
during a follow -up contact, based on reported symptoms). During this visit, data  
(including RR and SaO2) will be collected on these cases through an initial assessment  
by the study team during examination visit (off -site/site) and through a diary card. Nasal  
swabs will be taken by the investigator/study staff during the examination visit (off - 
site/site), and will be used to positively identify cases of RSV  infection.  
During the examination visit (off -site/site), an initial assessment of the presence of LRTI  
according to the LRTI case definition for surveillance will be made in order to assess  
the need for a potential subsequent examination visit if the case is found not to be an  
LRTI.  
RSV -associated healthcare resource utilization for RTI wit h a suspicion of difficulty  
breathing will be collected. Parent(s)/LAR(s) will be asked to report any care availed  
(e.g. self -care with over -the-counter [OTC] medication, GP visits, ER visits, hospital  
visits, etc.) via the diary card. Where possible , the study team will confirm and expand

of the case. Healthcare resource utilization is expected to vary between countries, regions  
and/or sites due to the local variations in policy and healthcare.  
 
The association of other respiratory viruses with RSV -associated LRTI and/or severe 
LRTI, and the impact of potential RSV risk factors on the incidence and severity of RSV - 
associated LRTI will also be explored. In order to assess and adjust for other pote ntial 
confounders in the various analyses, data on the subjects’ demography and lifestyle 
factors will be collected at baseline, and followed up quarterly for changes, during the 
regular follow -up contacts.  
 
The study has been designed to target a multi -national population by including multiple  
countries across the globe. Including infants from multiple parts of the world into this  
single study will provide an overall estimate of the incidence of RSV -associated LRTI,  
and will indicate potential variations b etween countries and regions. Data on known and  
suspected risk factors of RSV and/or LRTI will be collected to perform exploratory  
analyses of the association between risk factors and disease.  
 
Recruitment into the study will be controlled as much as possi ble to occur at a stable rate  
using SBIR, so as to achieve a population that is distributed evenly according to their age  
at first exposure to an RSV season. In practice, some subjects will be recruited just at the  
beginning of a season and be exposed imme diately for several months, whereas others  
will be recruited just at the end of a season and thus be at least 6 months old before the  
next season starts. In order to assess the impact of fluctuations in the occurrence of RSV  
between consecutive seasons, th e recruitment period will at least be one -and-a half years  
so that the recruitment after the first year yields a population of subjects with a similar 
age at exposure  to an RSV  season  as the subjects  recruited  in the same  time period,  1 year 
earlier.  
 
The first 2000 subjects enrolled in the study will be randomized at recruitment to a time  
point at which a single blood sample will be collected from these subjects if they are still  
participating in the study at that time. This can be either at 2, 4, 6, 12, 1 8 or 24 months  
old. The serum of these samples will be tested for RSV A/B neutralizing antibodies.  
Adjusted for the baseline level of maternal antibodies, this will provide point prevalence  
estimates over time that will indicate the rate of any RSV infecti on in the study  
population, including the cases that did not develop into an LRTI. In addition, especially  
the samples at earlier time points will indicate the duration of persistence of maternal  
antibodies.  
 
3.2.2 Extension Study  
At 2nd birthday (on completion of primary study or as soon as possible thereafter), the 
surveillance for RSV LRTI will be stopped and the  Consenting, eligible subjects from 
participating study centers will be re-consented for  enrolled in the study extension and 
followed up for the occurrence of wheeze and asthma.* Thus, this study also helps to

Changes to 6.4.1 are as follows : 
 
In the primary study subjects were to be followed -up from birth up to the age of 2 years  
for RSV LRTI. In order to determine the population attributable risk and population  
attributable risk percent of wheeze and asthma from birth to sixth birthday due to RSV  
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and to explore the association of RSV clinical  
LRTI in the first two years of life with other potential risk factors for wh eeze and asthma  
the study will be extended and subjects will be followed -up up to the age of 6 years.*  
 
*Note: The procedures related to primary study (surveillance of RSV LRTI) will not be  
extended into the extension period. The extension period will surv ey for occurrence of  
wheeze and asthma. Data about wheeze and asthma were also collected in the primary  
study (documented at an examination visit or extracted from all treatments that were  
recorded during the examination visits, see Section 9.8.3).  
 
During  the extension subjects will be followed up through quarterly contacts. Parents will  
be encouraged to seek a clinical assessment of their child in between quarterly contacts  
and/or during quarterly contacts whenever their child develops wheezing and/or bre athing  
difficulties.

• Review of information gathered at the first extension study contact with the  subject’s 
parent(s) / LAR(s) about past wheeze, asthma, and troublesome lung symptoms  
issues , and the medications used to treat  them.  
• Review of information about any applicable primary study episodes of wheeze  and

available), as neede d to verify/clarify study information of parents  and 
• Consultation with the subject’s health care provider(s), as needed to verify/clarify 
study information.  
 
Note that all information about all asthma, wheeze, and troublesome lung episodes as 
well as a revi ew of any and all potential asthma medications that were taken by the 
subject will be needed for the accurate completion of the investigator assessment. (Refer 
to Section 4 for definition  case definitions of asthma).  
 
To this end, quarterly contact informa tion about asthma, wheeze, and troublesome 
lung episodes as well as the medications used to treat them should all be brought up -to-

 15-DEC -2017  165 Details will be provided in the SAP. An example follows.  
 
The population attributable risk of medically attended wheeze may be calcu lated as:  
 
Ip-Iu 
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not have 
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of medically 
attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had an d who did not have RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life. The above population attributable risk 
formula may be further adapted to best accommodate the data and their required 
analytic assumptions (e.g., a modified formula may be used for popula tion attributable 
risk calculations involving recurrent outcomes).  
 
Section 9.8.2.2: To determine the population attributable risk percent of wheeze and 
asthma from birth until sixth birthday due to RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of 
life. 
 
The po pulation attributable risk percent together with 95% CI of wheeze , medically 
attended wheeze, recurrent wheeze , wheeze or asthma requiring admission, and 
prescription of medications for wheeze and asthma may be calculated overall and by age 
strata (0 -2 yea rs, 2-4 years and 5 -6 years), respectively.  
 
The population attributable risk percent may be calculated by dividing the population 
attributable risk by the incidence rate in all the subjects including both who had and who 
did not have RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life.  
 
For example, the population attributable risk percent of medica lly attended wheeze may 
be calculated as:  
 
(Ip-Iu)/Ip*100  
 
Where Iu is the incidence rate of medically attended wheeze in subjects who did not have 
RSV clinical LRTI in the first two years of life, and Ip is the incidence rate of medically 
attended wheeze in all subjects including both who had and who did not have RSV 
clinical LRTI in the first two years of life. As with the population attributable risk, the 
above formula may be adapted, as appropriate, to best suit the data .

The number and percentage of children with diagnosis of asthma (case definitions 1, 2 , 
and 3 ) will be described for each applicable age(2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 years) ; the number and 
percentage of children with recurrent wheeze from  at each applicable age 2-3, 3-4, 4-5 
and 5 -6 will be described overall and by country in frequency tables.  
 
The risk of physician diagnosed  asthma at the age of 6 years using case definitions 1and 
case definition , 2 and recurrent wheeze  3 (occurring from 2nd to the 6th birthday) will be 
analyzed using multivariate logistic regression model including RSV clinical LRTI in the 
first two years of life (Yes/No)  and other potential risk factors listed above, respectively.  
 
Statistical analysis of agreement will be performed to compare the two case definitions of  
asthma. A 2x2 contingency table similar as for one of the co -primary objective will be  
provided and the following measures of agreement (with 95% CI) will be  
calculated: asthma case definitions 1, 2, and 3  to each other.  
 
• Sensitivity: TP/  (TP+FN)  
• Specificity: TN/  (TN+FP)  
• Positive predictive value (PPV): TP/  (TP+FP)  
• Negative predictive value (NPV): TN/  (TN+FN)  
• Proportion  of overall  agreement,  which  is the proportion  of cases  similarly  classified: 
(TP + TN)/  (TP+FP+FN+TN).  
Cohen’s kappa (or other appropriate) coefficient may be used for the comparisons . The 
magnitude of the kappa coefficient represents the proportion of agreement greater than 
that expected by chance.

 15-DEC -2017  167 Data for endpoints will be pooled across primary and extension period as follows:  
 
• Medically attended wheeze, in the primary phase corresponds to episodes of wheeze 
documented at an examination visit initiated by monthly contacts with parents and  in 
the exten sion phase by a history from parents solicited by contact every 3 months, 
which may be supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with 
health care  provider.  
• Wheeze or asthma requiring admission in the primary phase corresponds to  episodes 
of wheeze documented at an examination visit that were associated with admission 
to hospital and in the extension phase by a history from parents, which may be 
supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with health care 
provider.  
• Prescription of medications for wheeze or asthma in the primary phase will be 
extracted from all treatments that were recorded during the examination visits and  in 
the extension phase by specific request for relevant medication from parents, which 
may be supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with health 
care provider.  
• Diagnosis of asthma according to case definition 1 and 2 will not be assessed during 
the primary phase and will be assessed for the first time at the first contact of t he 
extension period and annually thereafter until study  conclusion.  
• Diagnosis of recurrent wheeze as 4 or more episodes in one calendar year, will be 
assessed in the primary phase based on the episodes of wheeze documented at an 
examination visit initiated  by monthly contacts with parents and in the extension 
phase by a history from parents solicited by contact every 3 months, which may  be 
supplemented by review of routine medical records or contact with health care 
provider.  
 
Section 9.9: Interpretation of  analyses  
 
Analyses  All analyses will be descriptive with the aim to characterise overall 
occurrences, patterns and potential differences between groups in the endpoints related to 
the objectives. No hypothesis testing will be performed . 
 
Section 9.10: Con duct of analyses  
 
Analytic plans may be modified as appropriate to accommodate final sample sizes and 
data distributions. Any deviation(s) or change(s) from the original statistical plan 
outlined in this protocol will be described and justified in the fina l study report.  
 
Section 9.10.1: Sequence of analyses  
 
…… These preliminary results will be used for potential adjustment of the LRTI Case 
Definition and Severity Scale before final analysis, to assess the need to extend the 
primary study to allow all subjects to complete 2 years of follow -up and to provide data 
for other relevant decision making, as soon as possible.* The results pertaining to this 
analysis will be descriptively reported in the an interim statistical report.

analyses data from birth up to the age of 6 years will be used.  
 
An interim analysis for the study extension will be conducted near the midway point of 
study extension data collection, after all subjects have reached four years of age (and 
completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that contact). The interim 
analysis will be purely descriptive, no adjustment of the type I error is f oreseen.  
 
Final extension study analysis will be conducted after all subjects have reached six 
years of age (and completed their annual contact, or passed the window for that 
contact).

 15-DEC -2017  169 ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE CONTACT SCHEDULE to identify any potential 
LRTI case  
 
Active surveillance is aimed at confirming that a case is/was not missed due to lack of 
reporting by parent(s)/LAR(s) and to remind parent(s)/LAR(s) to report cases of RTI 
symptoms as soon as possible themselves. Although active surveillance is an important  
aspect to ensure that all cases are identified timely, the number of active surveillance  
contacts should not be too high. Too many active surveillance contacts could put an  
unnecessary demand on the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subjects and has been known to  
negatively impact long term compliance. In order to reduce the number of active  
surveillance contacts to an acceptable and valuable level, the following measures should  
be ap plied.  
Active surveillance is allowed to occur through various media (e.g. text messaging, email 
and, telephone, and in -person) based on local possibilities  
 
DISCONTINUATION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE  
 
Active surveillance should be suspended after there has been no contact for more than 3 
planned contacts and/or no contact for more than 2 months and a final attempt has been 
made by mail or a live visit. If the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the subject contact the 
investigator/study staff at a later point in time through passive surveillance, the case 
should be followed up, data should be collected at intermittent period and active 
surveillance could be reinitiated. These subjects will however no longer be included in 
the ATP cohort, therefore, all efforts should be made to avoid this.

 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Disease control of contemporary oropharyngeal cancer 
As for many other primary subsites of the head and neck district, two main options have been 
traditionally employed for the treatment of sq uamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (ORO-
SCC), surgery and radiotherapy (RT). The latter ha s been shown to be less `invasive` and morbid 
than radical surgery 1 and therefore has gained consensus as first line option in ORO-SCC at 
many Institutions across the country.   Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results  (SEER) data from 1975 to 2002 show an 
approximate 5% to 8% improvement in 5-year overall survival for squamous head and neck 
cancer 
2. Most of this improvement occu rred in oropharyngeal carcinoma. Table 1 summarizes 
results from contemporary series using non-su rgical-based approach for ORO-SCC. They 
consistently show that long-term locoregiona l control rates are in  the order of 80-95%.

 Ameliorations in treatment approach th at could have lead  to this include: 
1. Introduction of a more sophisticat ed and precise way to plan and deliver RT or Intensity 
Modulated RT (IMRT). IMRT has been associat ed with more precise target coverage and 
less long-term toxicity on selected organs such as the parotid glands 4;  
2. Introduction of concomitant systemic chem otherapy (CHT) to RT particularly in 
locoregionally advanced disease (AJCC stage III & IV) 5, 6. Chemotherapy exploits a 
local cooperation with RT.  
3. Better support of patients during treatment in terms of pain control and nutritional status 
that allows more aggressive  treatment to be delivered 7; 
4. Wider and wiser use of planned ne ck dissection after primary RT+ CHT and refinement 
of surgical techniques of reconstruction with more salvage options after failure of 
primary chemoradiotherapy. 
 Finally, nowadays a significant percentage of ORO-SCC is associated with the Human 
Papilloma Virus type 16 (HPV-16) or less frequen tly, with other types. It has been postulated 
that the biology of HPV-related ORO-SCC may be more benign than the classic alcohol-
tobacco-related cancers 
8, and preliminary clinical data seem to confirm this hypothesis 9. 
Currently the prevalence of ORO-SCC which te st positive for HPV referred for definitive 
(chemo)radiotherapy at JH is  around 80% (unpublished data). 
 
1.2 Favorable subgroup of patients with ORO-SCC 
Patients with low tumor burden or early stage di sease (I-II, T1-2N0-1, primary tumor equal/less 
4 cm in greatest dimension and/or nodal disease up to 3 cm) have a favorable outcome. In the 
MDACC series on 175 patients with stage I-II disease treated fr om 1970 to 1998 without IMRT 
and systemic treatment, 5-yr local control (LC) , regional control (RC) a nd locoregional control 
rates (LRC) were 85%, 93% and 81%, respectively 10. Recently, RTOG protocol 0022 on IMRT 
alone for early stage (T1-2, N0-1) oropharyngeal  carcinoma has produced a 2-yr LRC of 91% 
(95%CI: 97.9-84.2%)11. T-stage is a strong predictor of  local control by radiotherapy +  
chemotherapy 12. T4 tumors do significantly and consistently worse than T1-3 13. Interestingly, 
up to T3, oropharyngeal primary tumor staging is based on tumor dimensions, but in two 
separate studies this did not correlate with primary tumor volume as measured before treatment on CT 
14, 15. Nathu et al. demonstrated a significant variation of oropharyngeal tumor volume for 
a given T-stage. T2 tumors ranged from 0 to 32.5 cm3, T3 from 0 to 48 cm3, and T4 from 6.5 to 
99.9 cm3. The variation in tumor volume appears to be  greater for tumors of the oropharynx than 
tumors of other head and neck subsites14. Therefore, it is not surprisi ng that the predictive role of 
tumor volume on outcome after (chemo)radiotherapy is a controversial issue with both negative 
14-16 and positive 17-19 studies. While this seems to contradict one of basic principles of RT that is 
the number of clonogens in the tumor is dire ctly correlated with the risk of failure 20, other 
radiobiologic factors may well overcome and ove rride the negative effect of clonogen number. 
One possible explanation is that intrinsic radiosen sitivity of ORO-SCC is greater than that of 
SCC arising from other subsites of the HN district, which is  often reported 15, although this has 
not been documented. Another (more reliable) explan ation is that tumors that show an exophytic 
pattern of growth are more sensitive to radi ation because of better oxygenation and a smaller 
hypoxic component due to better vascular supply 20. It is not an uncommon observation in the 
clinic that bulky, exophytic tumors `melt` dur ing a course of radiotherapy and show good long

8 
 term control. This is indirec tly supported by the ev idence that Hypoxia-I nducible Factor-1- 
(HIF1α) is over-expressed in the vast majority of  patients with squamous cell cancer of the 
oropharynx 21, 22. Interestingly, the degree of expression  has been found to predict the likelihood 
of success of curativ e radiation therapy 22. Moreover, in one study HIF-1a expression was a more 
significant adverse prognostic f actor in the tonsil (hazard ratio [HR], 23.1; 95% confidence 
interval [CI]. 3.04–176.7) than the tongue-base tumor (HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.14–7.19) group (p = 
0.03, test for interaction)21.  
 Based on these considerations, it is reasonable to consider as ha ving a favorable prognosis those 
ORO-SCC`s that present at an early T stage, T1 and T2, and thus radiotherapy alone is a 
reasonable option. For T3`s, combined chemoradiother apy is the treatment of choice as discussed 
below in 1.3.  Regarding N stage, despite excellent locoregional  control rates with RT alone followed by neck 
dissection for residual/persistent nodal disease
12, combined chemoradiotherapy is the treatment 
of choice for patients with singl e nodes greater than 3 cm (N2a, N3) or multiple nodes (N2b-c) in 
attempt to minimize the need for post treatment neck dissection.  
 Finally, preliminary clinical data from two sepa rate controlled studies support the co ncept that 
viral-related as opposed to t obacco/alcohol-related ORO-SCC`s have a better prognosis after 
definitive chemoradiotherapy 
9, 23. While the positive effect of HPV-associated disease on 
outcome may be somewhat mitigated by a previous  history of smoking, evaluation of HPV-status 
appears to identify a grou p of patients with a better prognosis to IMRT.  
 
1.3 On systemic treatment for ORO-SCC 
Systemic treatment is part of the initial mana gement of patients with locally advanced ORO-
SCC`s based on results obtained from randomized co ntrolled trials in all subsites [summarized 
by 24] and specifically for the oropharynx 6. At JH, cisplatin-based chemotherapy concomitant 
with RT is usually recommended fo r stage III-IV disease that includes patients with T3 disease 
and/or advanced nodal disease (N2- 3). Patients with a single node equal/less than 3 cm, even if 
technically assigned to stage III according to AJCC, have a good prognosis with RT alone10. 
However, Cisplatin and other systemic therapies enhance radiation cytotoxicity by a number of 
mechanisms leading to better control of local a nd regional disease that has translated into 
significantly improved survival in the majority of randomized controlled trials and in 4 meta-
analyses. Other potential benefits include a less ening of the need for salvage surgery, better 
functional, cosmetic and quality of life outcomes.  Principles of treatment that correlate with 
outcome and apply to radiotherapy, such as the overall duration of treatment time and the total 
dose of radiotherapy, may not apply when RT is  delivered with concomitant chemotherapy.  
 Other situations in which cisplatin concurrent  with RT is recommended are positive resection 
margins at the primary tumor site and extracapsular nodal extension
25. However, whether 
previous excisional biopsy in the form of wide lo cal excision, radical or simple tonsillectomy, or 
just  `shaving off` the tumor has any role in the management of patients with ORO-SCC is 
unclear with advocates on both sides: `debulking`  certainly reduces the number of clonogens, but 
whether it translates into a better outcome is  not proven; on the other hand, surgery usually

9 
 leaves a scarred, potentially hypoxic  bed that is less likely to re spond to RT or to be reached by 
drugs. While this is an unresolved issue, it has been reported that  patients who undergo an 
excisional biopsy (thus staged as cTx before defi nitive local treatment if no residual macroscopic 
disease is present) have a good outcome after postoperative radiothera py regardless of their 
margin status10. Moreover, we doubt that a positive micr oscopic margin at the primary tumor 
after a simple excisional biopsy carries the same  predictive value as after a radical, oncologic 
procedure (such a `commando` procedure). Ther efore, we advocate the use of concomitant 
CDDP only for those cases were ECE is presen t, and the use of radiotherapy alone for a 
microscopic mucosal margin after excisional biopsy. In the latter case, a `full dose` of RT at the 
surgical site (70 Gy) is  currently delivered. 
 A new class of drugs targeti ng the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) has been 
developed based on  evidence that the receptor is over expressed in most head and neck SCC (although constitutive EGFR activation can occur in the absence of increased expression). Many 
studies have reported antitumor effects when EGFR targeting strategies were used in preclinical head and neck SCC models 
26. Several therapeutic approaches have been developed including 
monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase–specific inhibitors, ligand-linked immunotoxins, and 
antisense approaches. Cetuximab is a monoclona l antibody that targets the extracellular domain 
of the EGFR. A phase III study has shown that cet uximab added to RT reduced the relative risk 
of death with locoregional failure and all- cause mortality by 32% and 26%, respectively 5. Most 
(≈60%) of the patients enrolled in  this trial had oropharyngeal cance r and in subset analyses, this 
patient group showed the most benefit. At presen t, there is no data on how cetuximab plus IMRT 
compares with IMRT and concomitant chemothe rapy. Therefore, for tumors at high risk of 
locoregional failure (T3-4`s, N2, N3 disease a nd/or presence of extracapsular extension after 
surgery) chemoradiotherapy is still the treatment of referen ce. For patients without these 
unfavorable risk features treatm ent with IMRT alone is supported  by the data previously shown 
(1.1, table 1).  
 
1.4 Treatment morbidity 
While contemporary results for ORO-SCC are improved compared to historical controls7, 
treatment morbidity on selected organs/tissues  may have increased as  well, bringing into 
question the real advantage in terms of therapeutic index. 
 Attention has been focused on organs and struct ures involved in swallo wing that are in close 
proximity to ORO-SCC
27. Several papers have reported de terioration of swallowing function 
after RT+CHT (summarized by28). In one study, the incidence of severe aspiration was 11% 
(7/63 pts) before radiothera py and 38% (24/63 pts) afterwar ds, with 6 pts dying from 
complications of aspiration29. In another report on 96 pts af ter radiotherapy, 31 (32%) had 
clinically significant aspiration a nd 36 (37%) developed a stricture30. Altogether the results show 
that a more aggressive approach may yield bett er oncologic outcome but at a greater expense in 
terms of both sub-acute and late toxicity. Curre ntly up to 15% of patie nts are long-term PEG 
tube dependent after combined chemotherapy and IMRT for advanced oropharyngeal cancer31. 
In another study of sequential therapy (induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation), 
Goguen et al periodically assessed the swallowi ng status of 54 head and neck cancer patients30.  
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
10 
 At one year follow up, 80% were able to eat either a regular or a soft diet and 19% still had their 
gastrostomy feeding tube.  In addition to the salivary glands and those stru ctures involved in swallo wing function (including 
the larynx), several other structures can potentially  be affected: mandible-osteonecrosis, brachial 
plexus-palsy, thyroid gland-hypothyr oidism, masticator muscles an d temporomandibular joints –
trismus, oral mucosa-mucositis, ears-deafness, sternocleidomastoid muscles-fibrosis, carotid 
arteries-stroke.  Late toxicity after (chemo)radiotherapy for head and neck SCC is, in general, poorly documented, but unfortunately quite prevalent. A retrospective anal ysis of patients treated with 
concomitant radiotherapy (3D conformal) and ch emotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer 
within 3 RTOG studies (RTOG 91-11, 97-03, and 99-14)  showed that 43% of assessable patients 
had a severe late toxicity defined as chronic grade 3 to 4 pharyngeal/laryngeal toxicity and/or 
requirement for a feeding tube >o r= 2 years after registration and/or potential treatment-related 
death (eg, pneumonia) within 3 years
32.  
 In one other recent prospective study, the actuari al prevalence of grade 3+ CTC AE v3.0 toxicity 
after altered fractionated IMRT for oropharyng eal SCC was 30.9% and 26.1%  at 2 and 3 years, 
respectively 
33. 
 At UTMB, 58 patients with ORO-SCC were treated with IMRT alone (conventional 
fractionation to 70 Gy, 24 pts; hypofractionation to  66 Gy, 9 pts; hyperfrac tionation to 78 Gy, 25 
pts) from 09/02 to 09/06. At a median follo w up of 22 months (range: 3-53.4 months), the 
actuarial prevalence of selected grade 3+ CT CAE 3.0 toxicity is 35.1% (Figure 1)(unpublished 
data). 
 
Time (yrs)proportion of pts

Figure 1. 
 The actuarial prevalence curve shows two `wav es` of toxicity: the first one, corresponding to 
acute toxicity during and after treatment, which s ubsides by 6 months and a late wave due to late 
toxicity.   This increase in toxicity seems  contradictory be cause it is well recognized that IMRT allows for 
sparing of selected structures (i.e. parotid  glands) and thus fewe r complications (i.e. 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
11 
 xerostomia)34. However, the dose to other organs at  risk (OAR- such as the swallowing 
structures and the larynx) remain s high due to their proximity or even `embedding` to the target. 
Another intrinsic limitation of IMRT is that abou t 25-30% of the prescribed dose is distributed 
across all structures surrounding the target. Th e resulting `dose bath` may be high enough to 
have clinical implications 35.  
 Therefore, besides the few organs at risk (cor d, brain, brainstem, parotids, mandible, larynx) 
whose sparing is usually prioritized, this spar ing is usually not possible for the remaining 
structures in the context of standard IMRT pla nning. This is due to both physical (unless the dose 
comes from inside the pt, as in  the case of brachythe rapy, it has to go through the patient) and 
clinical reasons (proximity of the tumor to the organ at risk).   
 The addition of chemotherapy to  IMRT has been shown to in crease acute mucosal damage 
compared to RT alone, and thus increases the risk  of acute toxicity (intensity and duration of 
mucositis, pain, need and duration of PEG tube…). More importantly, acute toxicity can lead to 
subacute and late toxicity (so called `consequential late toxicity`)
36. It has been reported that 
bone exposure and osteo- necrosis may result as  consequence of overlying mucosal denudation 
36; more recently it has been postulated that pharynge al constrictor muscle damage may result 
from a breakdown of the overlying mucosa, l eading to edema, inflammation and ultimately 
fibrosis of the muscles 37.  
 
1.5 Strategies to decrease toxicity 
There are several steps that can potentially redu ce or mitigate the risk of toxicity. Regarding 
IMRT, there are several levels of inte rvention as illustrated in table 2.

Dashed: strategies exploited in the current protocol 
 
We have identified a solution that involves severa l individual strategies, as  extensively discussed 
elsewhere38.  Briefly, in the context of dose painting IMRT (where CTV1 covers the gross tumor 
volume, CTV3 the volume at low (<10%) risk of microscopic dis ease, and PTV1-3 represent an 
expansion of CTV1-3 to account fo r set-up errors and tis sue deformation), we plan a reduction of 
the prescription dose from 70 Gy equivalent dose at 2 Gy per fraction (ED2) for PTV1 and from 
50 Gy ED2 for PTV3 to 60 Gy ED2 and 44 Gy ED 2, respectively. The rationale of the entity in 
dose reduction is reported in table 3. How these `experimental` doses compare to standard ones 
is reported in table 4.  Table 3. Radiobiologic consider ations on dose de-escalation 
 Subclinical disease Gross disease 
General assumptions and definitions 1. 10 fold reduction of cell population means 1 Log or elimination of 
90% of cells;  
2. D
10 is defined as the dose necessary to depopulate by 1 Log; 
3. D10=D0 x 2.3; 
4. Typical value of D 0 is 1.5-2.5 Gy (3 Gy if only hypoxic cells were 
present); here we consider 2.5 Gy; 
5. According to Poisson statistics, 90%  of local control means that the 
average number of cells surviving is about 0.1 or 10-1; 99% means 
0.01 or 10-2; 
6. If a tumor is composed by 1010 cells to begin with, in order to achieve 
a LC of 90%, 10-11 cells need to be killed (f rom 10 to -1 Logs, thus 11) 
Specific assumptions 1. In `high` risk areas at containing 
microscopic disease, tumor population is 10
7 cells; 
2. To achieve 90% of local 
control, 8 Logs of cells need to be killed; 1.Subtotal resecti on, leaving 1% or 
0.01 of cells, depopulates by 2 Logs; 
 
Estimates If each Log is depopulated with 
5.75 Gy (2.5 Gy x 2.3), then:  8 Logs would need 46 Gy 
(5.75 Gy x 8);  9 Logs, 51.75 Gy  12 Logs would require 69 Gy 
 11 Logs, 63.25 Gy 
 10 Logs, 57.5 Gy  
Comments These estimates would be 
consistent with the standard dose of 50 Gy for regions treated electively or at `low ` risk; Consistently, after tonsillectomy 
with 10
8-9 Logs left, the Px dose is 
between 60 Gy and 66 Gy; 
Role of concomitant chemotherapy Concomitant chemotherapy equals to a biological equivalent dose (BED) 
of 10 Gy
39;  
 in presence of chemotherapy, a BED 10 10 Gy lower than needed 
would be expected from RT;  
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
13 
 a BED10 of 8-12 Gy corresponds to 8-10 Gy or 1-2 Logs; 
Estimates In presence of concomitant 
chemotherapy, the dose of RT for microscopic disease would drop to ≈40 Gy for areas at low 
risk and to ≈50 Gy for areas at 
high risk The dose of radiation would drop 
to ≈60 Gy 
Comments on 
disease control 44 Gy at 2 Gy per fraction is 
allowed by NCCN guidelines to treat electively the neck in presence of chemotherapy 
40 
 Clinical data obtained combining 
`reduced dose RT` and concomitant chemotherapy seems to be consistent to these estimates 
41.  
Comments on 
toxicity Structures that are expected to benefi t from less than 70 Gy (due to their 
proximity to the target), include th e mandible, the constrictor mm, the 
larynx, the brachial plexus;  Structures that benefit from an inte rmediate dose level reduction include 
the parotids, the submandibular gl ands, great vessels in the neck, 
masticatory mm, thyroid gland, esophagus

It should be noted that the reduction in the pres cription dose does not apply to the whole volume 
but only selected parts as follow: 
1. to part(s) of PTV1 and PTV3 that are clos e (within 8 mm) or overlapping with selected 
organs at risk, such as the constrictor muscle s, the parotids…. (for a complete list please 
refer to section 5.4); 
2. to part(s) of PTV3 that cover the ipsilateral (t o primary tumor) level IV if ipsilateral level 
III is clinically and radiologically uninvolved 42 (for criteria of nodal involvement please 
refer to section 5.3.2); 
3. to part(s) of PTV3 that cover the contralateral levels III and IV if contralateral level II is 
negative (as defined at 2 above);  
4. to part(s) of PTV3 that cover the contralatera l level IV if contralateral level III is negative 
regardless level II status. 
 Moreover, most (>85%) of each PTV is still adequa tely `covered` by a standard dose, while there 
is a significant dosimetric benefi t on almost each OAR considered 
38 as shown in table 5 in terms 
of absolute difference in mean dos e compared to a reference plan.

Finally, the overall duration of treatment will be kept  to 7 weeks, in order to avoid an increase in 
acute mucosal toxicity and to reduce the risk of increasing subacute/consequential late toxicity. In addition we will enforce a novel set of dos e volume objectives for the mucosa (unpublished 
data). According to the retrospective analysis of  toxicity data obtained in 59 consecutive patients 
treated with IMRT alone for ORO-SCC at UTMB  where a PEG tube was placed only if needed, 
there was a significant correlation between the abso lute amount of oral mucosa that received a 
given dose per week and the need for PEG tube. In particul ar with cut-offs of V9.5<64.5 cc and 
(sensitivity: 95.5, sp ecificity: 59.5) and V 10 < 54 cc (sens: 82, spec: 62), only 1 patient needed a 
PEG tube (figure 2).

Acute toxicity may also translate into subacute and late toxicity as described for the mandible 36 
and hypothesized for the constr ictor muscles and the larynx 44,45.  
 
1.6 Standard Supportive treatment 
Regarding supportive treatment and prophylactic measures to prevent/mitigate toxicity, the 
following ones are generally pursued as standard of care: 
‐ Dental evaluation and fluoride  prescription/administration; 
‐ Speech pathology evaluation including 
‐ Baseline swallowing screening with flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing 
(FEES) followed by a formal modified barium swallowing study (MBSS) if 
needed. The Penetration/Aspiration Scale (Appendix 4) will be used during modified barium swallow studies.  
+ baseline evaluation of jaw opening, premorbid speech disturbance and 
dysphonia.   + baseline cognitive/language functi on screening using the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (Appendix 5).  + implementation of prophylactic sw allowing and trismus prevention 
exercises prior to initiation of treatment
46; 
+ education  regarding th e role of oral hygiene and aspiration pneumonia, 
products to compensate for xerostomia (e.g., frequent sips of water, oral 
lubricants, saliva substitu tes) and dentrifices. 
+ documentation of the presence of a gastrostomy feeding tube, estimated 
percent of oral alimentation/hydrati on via the feeding tube; estimated 
percentage of PO intake at baseline.  
- Nutritional evaluation with pre-treatment  correction of weight  loss (nutritional 
impairment is defined as weight loss > 20% in the preceding 3 months or food

 intake below 50% of normal requirements in the week preceding enrollment) as 
needed. A PEG-tube will be placed routinel y before or shortly after initiation of 
IMRT only in those patients who receive chemotherapy in addition to radiotherapy.

of care assessment for this patient populat ion. This requirement can be waived by the 
investigator if the subject has an identifiabl e procedure which is the immediate and sole 
cause for the weight loss without an underl ying pathological cause. An example of a 
situation like this would be if a participan t is found to need a t onsillectomy during the 
pretreatment evaluations. It’s obvious that  this scenario woul d be a non-pathological 
reason for such a weight loss. The PI will only have this ability to waive this criterion if 
and only if he can substantiate and docume nt that the weight loss does not have a 
pathological etiology and will correct itself w ithin a reasonable and acceptable period of 
time 3.1.10  Patient is judged to be mentally relia ble to follow instructions and to keep

4 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS  
4.1 Each patient must have completed the fo llowing studies prior to irradiation:  
 4.1.1  Complete history and physical exam incl uding weight and performance status.  
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
19 
  4.1.2  Complete dental evaluation. Any required dental extrac tions must be made and 
 fluoride prophylaxis institu ted prior to radiotherapy. 
4.1.3 Speech pathology evaluation including instrumental swallowing assessment or clinical 
assessment of swallowing and administration of pretreatment swallowing and trismus 
exercises (*This assessment is a standard of care assessment for this patient population).  
Completion of pretreatment MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) and Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MCA). Speech therapy evaluation has to take place before 
commencement of treatment.  
 4.1.4 Nutritional evaluation to be conducte d within the first week of starting 
(chemo)radiation therapy.  4.1.5  Completion of the following laboratory studies: CBC with diff. and platelets, 
Metabolic Panel to include- sodium, potassium , glucose, calcium, magnesium, BUN, serum 
creatinine, total protein, albumin, alkaline pho sphatase, total bilirubin, AST, ALT, and a 
creatinine clearance) 
 4.1.6  Completion of the following radiologic studi es: CT of head and neck with < 3 mm 
 contiguous slices in immobilization system (with contrast, unless contraindicated ); whole 
 body PET/CT (integration of both high resolu tion CT with contrast and dedicated PET 
 acquisition through the head and neck are strong ly suggested); MRI of head and neck with 
 gadolinium including T1 and T2 weighted sequ ences in at least 2 different planes strongly 
 suggested for primary tumors of the base of tongue (optional-see 5.1.2) . 
4.1.7  Audiogram to be conducted before or with in the first week of starting therapy (if inner 
ear is to be irradiated at mean dose ≥ 40 Gy).  
     
5 RADIATION THERAPY  
5.1 Treatment Planning, Imaging a nd Localization Requirements  
5.1.1  The immobilization device is a thermoplas tic mask that covers both face and 
shoulders. A mouth piece is also indicated  for all patients but those edentulous.  
5.1.2  Treatment planning CT scans will be perfor med with the patient in the treatment 
position. I.V. contrast at the time of simula tion is also recommended. A planning MRI scan 
is optional.  5.1.3  All tissues to be irradiated must be includ ed in the CT scan. CT scan thickness should 
be 0.3 cm or less through the re gion that contains the primar y target volumes. The regions 
above and below the target volume may be s canned with slice thickness up to 0.5 cm. MRI 
and PET/CT scans may be included to assi st in definition of target volumes.   
5.1.4  The GTV, CTV and PTV and normal tissues will be outlined on all CT slices in which 
the structures exist. 5.1.5 Image Guidance for IGRT: Daily image gui dance of IMRT will be achieved using 
Linear-accelerator mounted MV cone beam CT images. The procedure to register treatment day imaging dataset with the reference dataset will comply with the following recommendations: 
 Region-of-Interest (ROI) or  “clip box” for fusion is set to encompass the 
high dose PTV and adjacent spinal cord; if the supraclavi cular region is a 
part of the target vo lume the ROI should extend to the C6 level; 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
20 
  Automatic (based on bony anatomy) regi stration will be used; the result 
of the fusion will be visually checked for the alignment of the bony anatomy, such as vertebral bodies and applicable soft tissue structures 
(e.g., optic nerves and/or optic chiasm). 
Following the registration, the tr anslational correcti ons will be applied to the treatment 
couch. If all the variances are less than 2.0 mm, the treatment will proceed without 
correction (however, the physic ian/team may elect to perf orm adjustments even for a 
variance < 2.0 mm). If one or more corrections  are 2.0-5 mm, adjustment is necessary 
prior to treatment; however, re-imaging is not mandatory. If one or more of the 
corrections are larger than 5 mm, the imaging mu st be repeated in addition to performing 
table/positioning adjustments. 
 
5.1.6 Management of Radiation Dose to the Patient from IGRT 
The estimates of patient doses per imaging study for various imaging systems vary 
considerably. The doses from helical MV CT scan on a tomotherapy unit were estimated 
to be in range from 1 to 3 cGy for head and neck studies, similar to doses reported for kV 
cone beam CT on Elekta Synergy machine. Thus, the doses for 3D imaging systems are in the range from 1 to 3 cGy for head and neck imaging and can contribute from 0.5 to 
1.5% to the daily dose of 2.0 Gy. These are sm all enough dose contributions that if there 
is only one or two imaging study done per treatment session, the dose does not
 need to be 
incorporated into treatment planning and is not expected to have any clinical relevance to 
the patient.  
 
5.2 Volume and ICRU Reference Point Definitions 
The definition of volumes will be in accordance  with the 1993 ICRU Report #50: Prescribing, 
Recording and Reporting Photon Beam Therapy.  
5.2.1  The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) is defined as all known gross disease determined 
from CT, clinical information, endoscopic findi ngs and MRI in the case of tumors treated 
after biopsy alone.  
 
5.2.2  The Clinical Target Volumes (CTV) is defined as the GTV plus areas considered to 
contain potential microscopic disease, delin eated by the treating physician. The margin 
between the each GTV and its CTV will be t ypically 1-2 cm, with  a minimum of 5 mm 
except in those areas where th e GTV is immediately adjacent to structures known to be 
uninvolved. In postoperative cases, The CT V includes the operative bed and margins 
according to an assessment of the risk of subclinical disease.  
 
The Planning Target Volume (PTV)  will provide a margin around each CTV (i.e. both the 
primary tumor and the lymph nodes containi ng clinical or radiographic evidence of 
metastases) to compensate for the uncertainties of treatment set up and tissue deformation. 
A minimum of 5 mm around the CTV will be requi red in all directions to define each 
respective PTV in the setting of IGRT. 
 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
21 
 5.3 Target Definition  
5.3.1  Targets are defined as follows: CTV1 or hi gh dose volume that encompasses the 
GTV with a margin; in case there is no GTV available (i.e. after tonsillectomy) CTV1 
encompasses the tumor bed or where the tumor was before surgery; CTV2, that typically includes the tissue around the gross tumor vol ume and/or the neck nodal stations that 
have high (>15%) risk of cancer involvement and/or lymph nodes that look suspicious on 
imaging; CTV3 includes contralateral lym ph nodal stations and lower neck lymph nodal 
stations which have relatively lower risk (5 -15%) of cancer involvement and do not look 
suspicious at imaging.  
 
5.3.2 Positive lymph nodes are defined as those that meet any of the following criteria on 
CT: maximum axial diameter > 1cm (>5 mm if retropharyngeal); focal hypoattenuation 
within the node suggesting necrosis; irre gular enhancement pattern; presence of 
extracapsular penetration as judged by 21pecula ted margins. Suspicious are those that 
measure between 7-9 mm in greatest axial dime nsion in neck levels III through IV; have 
a rounded appearance defined as a width to length ratio greate r than 0.5; lack fatty hilum. 
 
5.3.3 Lymph node stations or levels in the neck follow the surgical nomenclature.   A 
station is considered positive if contains positive lymph nodes. However, in this case, only the positive lymph node(s) and not the w hole station is (are) contoured as GTV. 
Moreover, expansion from GTV to  CTV1 does not imply that th e whole level will be part 
of CTV1.  
 
5.3.4 The following (entire) lymph nodal stations are considered at hi gh (>15%) risk of 
containing microscopic diseas e when negative/normal on c linical exam and imaging: 
levels II and III ipsilateral to the site of  a positive lymph node in the neck. The entire 
level is drawn as CTV2 
42.   
 
5.3.5  For lymph node stations different from ip silateral levels II and III (5.3.5) only the 
suspicious finding and not the whole le vel has to be contoured as CTV2; 
 
5.3.6  The following levels are routinely included in CTV3: level IB ipsilateral to neck 
disease; bilateral levels II, III, IV and V. C ontrolateral level IB is routinely excluded from 
any target volume. In the rare case that leve l IB has a positive or  suspicious node, level 
IB becomes part of the appropriate target volume even in absence of positive level II nodes.   
 
5.3.7 The anterior extent of the contour of le vel IB when included in CTV3 will stop at 
the anterior extent of the submandibular gl and and therefore excl ude the triangular fat 
space lateral to the deep extrinsic musc les of the tongue as shown elsewhere 
42.  
 
5.3.8 Retropharyngeal nodes on both sides are routinely included in CTV3 from C1 to the 
bottom of C2

 5.4 Organ At Risk (O AR) Definitions 
Several organs at risk will be contoured on each  patient planning CT as follows. In order to 
facilitate the spelling, a script will be run from  Pinnacle to generate the regions of interest. 
OAR`s are: mandible, brain, brainstem, cord, submandibular glands, thyroid gland, parotid 
glands, upper gastrointestinal mucosa 47, larynx 45, masticatory spaces, upper, middle and inferior 
constrictor muscles, cricopharyngeous muscle, esophagus, brachial plexuses, temporomandibular 
joints (TMJ), inner ears, internal, external and common carotid arteries. Paired organs will be divided into those on the dominan t side of disease (dominant) and those on the opposite side 
(contralateral). An atlas on how to contour each structure is available at the web site of the 
University of Texas Medical Branc h, http://www.utmb.edu/radoncology/oar.htm 
For planning purposes, the cord is expanded by 4 mm.  
5.5 PTV and subPTV generation 
Each CTV is expanded 5 mm isotropically to generate corresponding PTV`s, PTV1, 2 and 3. 
Each PTV is further adjusted to come off the sk in, by excluding the part th at is within 3 mm to 
skin surface (PTV= CTV + 5mm – (skin -3mm)).  In order to achieve dose de-escalation on part s of the PTV (subPTV), each PTV is further 
divided into subPTV`s whose prescrip tion dose is as follows in table 6.

5.6 Dose prescription 
The common practice of this institution for H&N cancer is to prescribe three dose levels, 70 Gy, 
63 Gy and 58.1 Gy to primary tumor and whole n eck (PTV1-3) in 35 fractions. The Px to each 
PTV is reported in table 6. Now we have 4 dose levels, 70, 63, 58.1 and 50.75 Gy. In cases after 
primary tumor surgery where there is no residual macroscopic disease left, the total dose to PTV1 can be reduced from 70 Gy to 68.25 Gy. In this case PTV68.25 is treated as PTV70 
regarding overlap with the various OAR`s.   
 
5.7 Planning 
5.6.1  A co-planar 9 beam whole field IMRT plan w ill be generated. The treatment plan used 
for each patient will be based on an anal ysis of the volumetric dose, including DVH 
analyses of the PTV and critical normal st ructures. An “inverse” planning using 
computerized optimization is used. The treatment  aim will be the delivery of radiation to the 
PTVs and the exclusion of noni nvolved tissue as feasible.  
 
 5.6.2 Dose Specification  
5.6.2.1  The prescription dose is the isodose which en compasses at least 95% of the planning 
target volume (PTV). No more than 10% of a ny planning target volume (PTV) will receive 
>110% of its prescribed dose (V10%<
110%). No more than 1% of any planning target 
volume (PTV) will receive <95% of its prescribed dose (V95%>99%). No more than 1% or 
1 cc of the tissue outside the PTVs and any OAR (`unspecified tissue) will receive >110% 
of the dose prescribed to PTV1.  
 
5.6.2.1  The prescription dose to the PTV`s and subPTV`s is repor ted in table 5. Breaks 
in treatment should be minimized. Break in tr eatment time of more than 5 days will be 
considered a major variation.  
 
5.6.2.2  The reported doses for each PTV shall incl ude the prescription dose as well as 
the maximum point dose, % target vol ume receiving > 110% and >115% of its 
prescribed dose and the % target volume receiving < 95% of the prescribed dose, and 
the mean dose to the PTV.  
  
5.6.2.3  The dose prescription is to be base d on a dose distribution corrected for 
heterogeneities 
 
 5.6.3 Critical Normal Structures  
DVHs must be generated for all critical normal structures and the unspecified tissues. Dose 
constraints to normal tissues (and PT V`s) should be as per table 7.

 The priorities in addressing the protocol aims and constraints will be in the following order:  
  1) Group 1 (table 6),    2) Group 2 (table 6),    3) Group 3 (table 6).   
5.8 External Beam Equipment a nd Beam Delivery Methods  
Megavoltage equipment capable of delivering st atic or dynamic intensity modulation with a 
multileaf collimator is used. Whole field IMRT (without an anterior AP  field) is used.  
 
5.9 Treatment Verification and daily imaging  
 Pre-treatment radiation therapy planning CT scan; 
 Daily imaging with cone beam CT (5.1.5.1) 
 
5.10 Quality Assurance of Target Volumes and Critical Structure Volumes  
The DVH`s of each target and Oar will be expo rted and converted to excel file format. 
 
5.10.1  Each treatment shall be scored with regard to the coverage of each PTV (i.e. 
PTV70, PTV63, PTV58.1, and PTV50.75) and with regard to the level of sparing of 
several OAR`s; the scores to be assi gned are defined in table 8 below.

5.11 Radiation Therapy Toxicity Adjustments  
 5.11.1 Treatment Interruptions  
Interruptions in radiotherapy are strongly di scouraged based on the well known correlation 
between overall treatment time and outcome es pecially in the context of IMRT alone. 
 
5.12 Toxicity Reporting Guidelines  
5.12.1  For both acute and la te effect, the NCI CTCAE Versi on 4.0 will be used (Appendix 
1). All events will be recorded and loaded into software that is routinely used for clinical 
purposes in our Department called Mosaiq  (v1.6 IMPAC, Sunnyva le, California).   
 
5.12.2  The Head and Neck Cancer specific m odule of the MD Anderson Symptom Index 
(MDASI-HN)(Appendix 2) and the Xerostomia que stionnaire (Appendix 3) will be used as 
patient-reported outcome instruments48,49 
 
5.12.3  The swallowing related instruments (see 1.6) are: Penetration/Aspiration scale 
(Appendix 4); Montreal Cognitive Assessmen t (Appendix 5); MD Anderson Dysphagia 
Inventory (MDADI)(Appendix 6).  
5.12.4  All life-threatening ( grade 4) toxicities from protocol tr eatment will be reported to 
the PI within 24 hours of discovery. Institutional guidelines w ill be followed in reporting 
serious adverse events to the IRB.  
 
6 DRUG THERAPY  
 
Chemotherapy will be reserved for patients with T3 lesions (3.1.1) and/or clinically staged nodal 
disease greater than N1 and/or evidence of mi croscopic extracapsular extension after neck 
surgery (T3 and/or N2a >  5cm, N2b, N2c, N3 stage cance r or Nx with ECE). Chemotherapy 
consists of single agent cisplatin or carboplatin.  
6.1 Cisplatin 
 6.1.1 The first dose of cisplatin, 40mg/m
2 IV, will be administered within the first 3 days of 
the start of RT and repe ated weekly for the first 3 weeks and last 3 weeks of RT. Patients will 
not receive chemotherapy during week 4 of trea tment. The last dose of chemotherapy may be 
given up to one week following completion of RT. If  RT is held, cisplatin will also be held.   
  
 6.1.2  Hydration: Patients should be adequately hydrated with 1-2 liters of fluid PO in the 24 
hours prior to and post cisplatin administration. 
  
 6.1.3 Immediately prior to the cisplatin admini stration, patients shoul d receive 1 Liter of 
Normal Saline over 1-2 hours. 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
27 
   
 6.1.4 Cisplatin 40 mg/m2 should be mixed in 1 liter normal saline and infused over 2-3 hours. 
Cisplatin is a commercially available agent. 
  
 6.1.5  Antiemetics : Antiemetics must be given in co njunction with cisplatin. Antiemetic 
selection will be at the disc retion of the treating physician and is recommended with each 
chemotherapy infusion. These include dolaset ron, ondansetron, dexamethasone, lorazepam, 
or procholperazine. Therapy for prevention of delayed emesis may be considered. 
 
6.2 Cisplatin Dose Modification for toxicity 
 6.2.1  Hematologic : Patients must have an ANC ≥ 1000 /mm3 and platelets >100,000/ mm3 
prior to receiving cisplatin.  If th e patient’s counts are below thes e levels, cisplatin will not be 
given and weekly dosing reinstituted the fo llowing week as long as  counts are within 
acceptable treatment parameters. Held doses w ill not be made up. Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 
<500/mm3) or febrile neutropenia requiring hos pitalization for antibiotics or grade 4 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000/ mm3) require a dose reduction of cisplatin of 25%.   
  
 6.2.2 Neurotoxicity : Patients developing gr ade 2 sensory or motor neuropathy or > grade 2 
hearing loss will have cisplatin disconti nued and carboplatin substituted (see 6.3.4).  
 
6.2.3 Nephrotoxicity : Measurement of serum creatinine is  required before each treatment 
with cisplatin and must be w ithin normal limits.  Serum cr eatinine above the upper limit of 
normal necessitates creatinine clearance assess ment using the modified Cockgroft-Gault 
formula. If the patient’s calculated creatinine clea rance is less than 60 ml/min, cisplatin will 
be held and additional hydration will be given.   Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance 
should be repeated weekly and/or as needed after additional hydration is given.  Cisplatin 
may be reinstituted, under the discretion of the treating physician, if the CCl improves to 
greater than or equal to 60 ml/min.  If the creatinine cl earance does not improve despite 
additional hydration, cisplatin will  be substituted with carboplatin (see section 6.3.4).  Held 
doses will not be made up. 
 
6.2.4 Switch to Carboplatin:  In case of any of the followings, cisplatin will be substituted to 
carboplatin: creatinine cl earance < 60 ml/min; ototoxicity ; peripheral sensory or motor 
neuropathy grade 2. Weekly carboplatin dosing would be at AUC=2. Do se modifications of 
cisplatin and carboplatin will be under the discretion of the treating medical oncologist. If the 
patient has peripheral neuropat hy > grade 1, and/or frequency hearing loss that interferes 
with activities of daily living, cisplatin can be do se reduced or substituted with carboplatin.    
 
6.3 Carboplatin 
 6.3.1 Carboplatin may be administered as a subs titution for cisplatin when cisplatin-related 
toxicities occur as described in 6.3 Cisplatin Do se Modification for Toxicity or when patients 
present with >grade 2 sensory or motor neur opathy, >grade 2 hearing loss, or <60 ml/min 
calculated creatinine clearance at baseline.   
 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
28 
  6.3.2 The first dose of carboplatin, AUC=2 IV, will be administered within the first 3 days 
of the start of RT and repeated weekly during the 7 weeks of RT. The last dose of 
chemotherapy may be given up to one week fo llowing completion of RT. If RT is held, 
carboplatin will also be held.   
 
6.4 Carboplatin Dose Modification for Toxicity  
 6.4.1  Hematologic : Patients must have an ANC ≥ 1000 /mm3 and platelets >100,000/ mm3 
prior to receiving carboplatin. If the patient’s count s are below these levels, carboplatin will 
not be given and weekly dosing reinstituted the following week as long as counts are within acceptable treatment parameters. Held doses w ill not be made up. Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC 
<500/mm
3) or febrile neutropenia requiring hos pitalization for antibiotics or grade 4 
thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000/ mm3) require a dose reduction of carboplatin of 25%.   
  
 6.4.2 Nephrotoxicity : Serum creatinine and creatinine clearance should be checked weekly 
before each treatment with carboplatin and/or as  needed to calculate appropriate carboplatin 
dose and assess hydration status.   
 
7 SURGERY  
7.1 Upfront neck surgery (excisional biopsy or neck dissection) is at the discretion of the 
surgeon.  
 
7.2 Surgery at the primary tumor is expected to consist of an incisional biopsy for diagnostic 
purposes only. An excisional surgery (i.e. tonsill ectomy) is allowed if other gross disease is 
present e.g. neck lymph nodes. Patien t will be also staged accordi ng to the clinical stage before 
any surgical procedure.   
 
7.3 Surgery should be performed fo r persistent tumor following RT as documented by PET/CT 
(CT with thin slices and i.v. contrast for the HN part) at 8- 12 weeks after the end of the 
treatment, or at the discretion of the surgeon. Su spected residual disease is  defined as persistent 
FDG uptake at the site of the primary tumor qualitatively assessed by comparing to background 
and corresponding abnormal tissue on CT. Surg ery is recommended for PET/CT positive 
residual disease, as described.  A selective neck dissection is appropriate for patients with 
positive residual disease in levels II-IV and le vels IB and V were initially negative. A 
comprehensive neck dissection is recommended in the other cases. 
 
8 PATHOLOGY  
Tumors will be evaluated for the presence of HP V16 DNA by use of the in situ hybridization – 
catalyzed signal amplification method for biotin ylated probes (GenPoint; Dako, Carpinteria, 
CA)50. The expression status of p16 is strongly corre lated with tumor HPV status and therefore it 
will be evaluated by immunohistochemi stry, as previously described51. For tumors positive at 
P16 but negative for HPV16, a wide spectrum in-s itu hybridization test will be run to exclude 
infection by less frequent subtypes of HPV (30, 31…). In the latter case, specimens will still be 
considered HPV positive and therefore eligible for the study.

3. Initial evaluation must be done within a week of startin g therapy and then as clinically indicated. On treatment 
nutrition evaluations will be performed as clinically indicated.  4. Every 6 months for 5 years 
5. PET/CT is required at 10-12 weeks after the end of tr eatment to evaluate response. Afterwards a PET/CT should 
be obtained at the discretion of treating physician.  Alte rnatively a CT or MRI can be obtained if a PET/CT is not 
approved.

outside, but, again, the pathology specimen must be reviewed at JH. No further HPV testing is necessary on the 
repeat biopsy. 
14. Pre-study audiogram is required if the inner ear is to be irradiated at a dose 
≥  40 GY (the audiogram should be 
done before or within 1 week after starting treatment); subsequent audiograms are under the discretion of the 
treating physician as indicated by symptoms.

9.2 Evaluations  
9.2.1 Every Follow-up Visit 
 All patients will enter a common follow-up program following completion of 
radiotherapy. Routine follow-up care: comple te head and neck examination, including 
mirror and/or endoscopic examination (flexi ble fibroscope if deemed clinically 
necessary by the treating physician), 
 Performance Status, Weight, and Toxicity Notation  
 Follow up speech-language pathology evalua tion will include clinical swallow 
assessment and inter incisors distance meas urement. Prophylactic exercises will be 
reviewed as well as the importance of or al hygiene and strategi es to ameliorate 
xerostomia.  Patients’ ability to follow through with recommended exercises and strategies will be recorded. Documentation of the presence of a gastrostomy feeding 
tube, estimated percent of oral alimentati on/hydration via the feed ing tube; estimated 
percentage of PO intake at baseline. In a ddition, at the first post-treatment follow up 
examination (6-8 wks), a MBSS will be obtained, even in absence of specific symptoms as well as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MCA).    
 
9.2.2 Studies  
 Biopsy: Any suspicious mucosal lesion in the upper aerodigestive tract; pharyngeal 
pain referred to the ear should trigger a se arch for recurrent disease; any firm node 
that persists longer than four weeks; epis taxis; chronic nasal congestion though not to 
be due to radiation mucosal changes. 
 PET/CT as per 9.1 
 Modified barium swallow test will be  obtained 6-8 weeks after completion of 
treatment. Subsequently, a MBSS will be obtained only if clinically indicated. 
 Audiogram: Pre-RT if the inne r ear receives a mean dose ≥40 Gy, or if any hearing 
loss, vertigo or tinnitus occur. Subsequent audiograms will be conducted at the 
discretion of treating physician as in dicated by patient reported symptoms  
 
9.3 Response Criteria  
9.3.1 Tumor Response Measurements (RECIST Criteria) 
The use of the flexible fibroscope may be used for tumor measurement. This will   be 
determined by the treating physician. 
 
All tumor measurements must be recorded  in centimeters and should consist of the 
longest perpendicular diameters. In no case w ill complete response be reported unless all 
clinically demonstrable disease has disappeared.  
 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
31 
 9.3.1.1 Complete Response (CR)  
No measurable tumor is present on cl inical and radiological examination.  
 
9.3.1.2 Partial Response (PR)  A greater than 50% decrease in the product of the longest diameter multiplied by 
its perpendicular diameter when comp ared to the initial ‘on-study product, 
providing there is no increase greater than 25% of any area of known disease or 
the appearance of any new lesions.  
 
9.3.1.3 Minor Response (MR)  The difference between products  is less than 50 percent of the in itial product. No 
new lesions have appeared.  
 
9.3.1.4 Stable Disease (SD)  Tumor size has not changed; no progression, no new lesions.  
 
9.3.1.5 Progression (PD)  The second product shows a greater than  25 percent increase over the initial 
product, or appearance of new lesions.  
 
9.4 Definition of locoregional control 
9.4.1  A patient is defined as locoregionally co ntrolled if he achieves a CR at both the 
primary site and the neck within 10-12 week s from treatment end as previously defined 
(7.2, 9.3.1.1).  
 
9.4.2 Patients who shows a CR at the primary s ite and a <CR (residual disease) in the 
neck at re-evaluation imaging 8-10 weeks, ar e evaluated for neck surgery (7.2). Patients 
who are cleared for residual disease in the neck by surgery are still considered having achieved a CR after treatment provided there is no residual disease left after surgery 
 
9.4.3  Patients who fail to achieve a CR with or  without neck surgery are scored as 
failures at day 1 of radiotherapy. 
 
9.4.4  In order to remain controlled, patients who achieve a CR with or without neck 
surgery must remain cancer free at both T and N during each subsequent follow up 
examination (9.2.1).Treatment failure is de fined as the documented (biopsy-proven) 
reappearance of disease at the primary site and/or the neck.  
 
9.4.5  Distant disease is defined as the clinical or radiological appearance of metastases 
below the clavicles. 
   
9.5 Scoring of toxicity (see also 5.11) 
9.5.1  `Severe` toxicity is considered the one grade 3 or more in the CTCAE 4.0 
(Appendix 1). Therefore, event is considered  the presence of gr ade 3+ toxicity.  
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
32 
  
9.5.2 Similarly, in a 0-10 scale, 7 or more is considered `severe` (Appendix 2 and 3) 48.   
 
9.6 Criteria for Removal from Treatment  
9.6.1  Progression of disease wh ile on treatment.  
 
9.6.2  Sustained severe radiation mucositis resulting in dehydration and poor nutrition 
unresponsive to tube feeding and break from radiation for up to 2 weeks. Every effort 
should be made to sustain the patient so as to avoid such complications. Should the 
patient be removed from study, surgical re moval followed by radiation post-operatively 
may be attempted.  
 
9.6.3  Patients’ wishes to stop participation on the trial.  
 
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Sample Size 
The accrual rate for this study is expected to be approximately 10 patients per year, over a 6-year 
accrual period. This would yield an expected samp le size of 60 patients.  The primary objective 
of this study is to estimate th e prevalence of toxicity and effi cacy two years following treatment 
administration. We expect approximately 15% of patients to die before reaching two years post-
treatment, so our sample size for evaluation of  our primary objective ha s been adjusted to 50 
patients. The goal of this study is to demonstr ate a maximum grade 3+ toxicity rate of 15% 
between six months and two years after treatm ent administration and a minimum locoregional 
tumor control rate (efficacy) of 85%.  The table below shows the precision we have to estimate 
these endpoints with a sample size of 50 patients.  
Endpoint Prevalence Exact 95% Confidence 
Interval Precision (Half th e width of the 
confidence interval) 
Toxicity 2% 
6% 10% 14% 0.05 – 11% 
1 – 17% 3 – 22% 6 – 27% 5.5% 
8% 9.5% 10.5% 
Efficacy 84% 
90% 94% 71 – 93% 
78 – 97% 83 – 99% 11% 
9.5% 8% 
 The locoregional tumor control rate in this patien t population is expected to be at least 85%.  We 
will ensure that this treatment does not reduce toxi city at the expense of efficacy.  At the same 
time, we will monitor for excess toxicity.  If convincing evidence develops that: 
 Locoregional control failure rate exceeds 25%; or 
 Prevalence of new grade 3+ toxicities six months post-tr eatment exceeds 25%, the study 
will stop pending a data safety monitoring committee review.  The complete stopping

 guideline scenarios are shown in the table below, with the propor tion of toxicities and 
failures being considered for the first 10, 20, 30  and 40 patients enrolled. For example, if 
9 of the first 20 patients have a grade 3+ toxi city six months after treatment, the study 
will stop.  If 9 patients have either a grade 3+ toxicity or fail, e.g., 4 have toxicity and 5 
fail, the trial will not stop.  Once the 40th patient reaches six m onths of follow-up, we 
expect to have enrolled 48 out of the tota l 60 patients on the study.  At this point, 
monitoring for excess toxi city or failures will stop, as th e trial’s accrual phase will nearly 
be completed.  The upper bound for the confidence intervals is 100%.

10.2 Monitoring for Efficacy and Toxicity  
(Data Safety Monitoring Committee [DSMC]) 
 
The principal investigators (Drs. Quon and Forastie re), the Lead research nurse (Kelly Szajna), 
and the statistician (Amanda Blackford) will make up the Data Safety and Monitoring 
Committee for this trial. This is a Level 1 tr ial and will be monitored by The Johns Hopkins 
Clinical Research Office. The function and role  of the Data Safety Monitoring Committee will 
review the protocol per their inst itutional standards to help ensure that the trial is running safely. 
 
10.3 Analysis of Endpoints 
10.3.1. To achieve a prevalence of grade 3+ to xicities between six months and two years 
post-treatment <15% while maintaining a lo coregional tumor contro l of at least 85% 
during the same time interval.   
 
The primary endpoints, prevalence of toxic ity and locoregional control rate, will be 
reported for all patients with an  exact 95% confidence interval. 
 
10.3.2. To determine the nature and prevalence of  side effects at different time intervals 
and describe their relationship to pre-trea tment function (toxicity ) and local dose and 
treated volume. 
 
Patients will be grouped by whether they had none or a grad e 0-2 toxicity versus a grade 
3+ toxicity.  We will tabulat e the frequency of patients in each group by a dichotomous 
measure of dose and tests for differences with a Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test.  Patients will also be grouped dichotomously by the number of side effects experienced 
Version:  March 4, 2013 
 
34 
 and frequencies will be compared to dose category and toxicity  category using Chi-
square or Fisher’s exact tests. 
 
10.3.3. To determine the quality of life of surviving patients. 
 
The results of the Head and Neck MD A nderson Symptom Invent ory (MDASI-HN) will 
be calculated for each patient.  The mean scor e will be reported with a 95% confidence 
interval.  The range and quartiles of the dist ribution of scores will also be reported.

Protocol MNEMONIC and Title: FLUVIT  - A double -blind, randomized , placebo 
controlled  study of antibody  induction by vitamin supplementation at the time of 
influenza virus  vaccinations in children  
Principal Investigator: Nehali Patel , MD  
Brief Overview: Respiratory virus infections are responsible for more than 4.5 million 
deaths each year worldwide. Among these, up to 0.5 million deaths are caused by 
influenza viruses. Children are particularly vulnerable to respiratory virus infections, and 
extensive campaigns now target their improved healthcare. Vaccination is the single best 
strategy for the prevention of infecti ous diseases. Despite the clear benefit of respiratory 
virus vaccines, efficacy rates can be disappointing.  
Vitamin A and D deficiencies are each associated with impaired innate and humoral 
immune responses and vulnerability to respiratory tract infectiou s diseases. Rates of 
vitamin A and D deficiencies or insufficiencies have skyrocketed in the United States, 
especially in the mid -south region. Animal studies have demonstrated that in vit amin 
deficient mice, antibody immune responses are poor toward influ enza virus vaccine and 
are improved if a vitamin supplement is administered at the time of vaccination. The 
central hypothesis of this protocol is that vitamin supplements will enhance antibody  
responses toward an influenza  virus vaccine in children. Child ren will be randomized  
using a stratified permuted block method  to receive  an influenza virus vaccine  with 
vitamin A+D supplement  or placebo . Participants will be stratified based on retinol 
binding protein (RBP) levels at screening, using a cut -off  indicative of  vitamin A 
insuffiency (<22,000 ng/ml ). Co enrolled s ibling participants will be first stratified by 
RBP levels , then siblings within a same stratum will be equally assigned  to different arms  
to provide greater assurance of balanced treatment assi gnment. Children will be tested for 
vitamin levels and immune responses before and after influenza virus  vaccinations to 
determine if vitamin supplementation improves the vaccine -induced antibody response.   
Intervention: Children will be randomized to re ceive   influenza virus vaccine plus 
vitamin A and D supplements (intervention) or Influenza virus vaccine  plus matched 
placebo . 
Brief Outline of Treatment Plan: Children between the ages of 2 and 8 years will be 
enrolled. All will receive two doses of  an influenza virus vaccine  administered at least 
28 days apart. Vitamin levels and antibody responses toward the vaccine will be 
measured on days 0 (baseline levels) , 28, and 56. Vitamins A + D will be orally 
administered at the levels of 20,000 IU and 2,000 IU respectively on the days of 
vaccinations  for the children randomized to receive vitamin supplements . Parents will be 
asked to fill out diary cards to indicate food intake for children  (intervention & control)  
over the study period along with an optional food frequency questionnaire given on day

2.0  BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
2.1. Background  
Respiratory virus infections are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in 
children (1). The risk of death by respiratory disease is approximately 2:1 in 
vitamin A deficient children compared to controls (2). Low Vitamin D is similarly 
associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to respiratory disease (3-6). Vaccination is the best way to prevent childhood infections, but many respiratory virus vaccine candidates have failed in clinical trials . Furthermore, the currently 
licensed influe nza vaccines are not fully protective in children. A recent study by 
MedImmune reported that approximately  10% to  50% of children between the 
ages of 2 to 17 years who received  the quadrivalent FluMist vaccine had evidence 
of immune responses towards any one of the influenza virus A and B components, 
respectively ( 7).

 Nutrition and the immune response . Basic studies have shown that vitamins A 
and D each play a key role in the differentiation of T cell subsets, the proper 
migration (“homing”) of cells into  tissues, and the development of protective 
antibody responses (3, 8-10). Antibodies, a first line of defense against influenza 
virus at its point-of- entry ( 11), is impaired when individuals are vitamin deficient 
(12). Epidemiologic studies confirm that deficiencies of vitamin A and vitamin D 
impact the immune response ( 3-6;13-15).  
While vitamins A and D are often studied separately, their activities are cross -
regulated. They differentially bind heterodimeric receptor complexes (RAR- RXR, 
VDR -RXR), which in turn bind DNA sequence motifs in or near promoter 
regions of immune response genes (3; 16-17). The cross- regulatory capacities of 
vitamins A and D are often overlooked, perhaps explaining in part why past clinical supplementation studies with one vitamin or the other have yielded 
conflicting results ( 15;18-24). No clinical study has comprehensively evaluated 
the influences of vitamins A and D, independently or together, on responses 
toward influenza virus vaccines.  
This project will test the central hypothesis that vitamin A+D supplementation in 
children will improve systemic antibody responses toward an influenza virus 
vaccine. Our studies are expected to demonstrate a logistically feasible method to 
improve  influenza virus vaccine efficacy. Ultimately, our data may instruct new 
healthcare initiatives to improve vaccination against numerous respiratory pathogens, and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality in children. 
2.2. Rationale 
Vitamin deficiencies and insufficiencies are widespread among children in the 
United States ( 3;25-27). Based on results from our mouse model (please see 
preliminary data), we hypothesize that children with low vitamin levels will 
exhibit poor antibody responses toward the influenza virus vaccine, but that 
antibodies (including IgG and IgA),  IgA/IgM, and IgA/IgG1 ratio measurements 
will be improved among children who receive vitamin A and D supplements at the time of vaccination. To test our hypothesis, we will randomize children who are receiving the influenza virus vaccine into two groups. One group will receive 
oral vitamin A+D supplements on the days of vaccination while the other group will only receive the influenza virus vaccine. If we find that supplements enhance 
antibody responses, we will (i) provide an explanation for the low efficacy of respiratory virus vaccines in humans, and (ii) provide evidence that vaccine efficacy can be easily improved. By optimizing the i nfluenza virus vaccine and

 other respiratory virus vaccine programs, we may ultimately reduce the morbidity 
and mortality caused by respiratory infections in children. 
Vitamin deficiencies and insufficiencies . Memphis, TN, the site of St. Jude 
Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude), is a mid- south city with many families of 
low socioeconomic status and high vulnerability to infectious disease. A published study of adults in a general internal medicine practice at the University of Tennessee demonstrated very low vitamin levels in Memphis (25).  We also examined  (i) individuals from Memphian families who had at least one influenza 
virus- infected member , and (ii) individuals from the Tennessee Blood Services 
for levels of vitamin A using the surrogate retinol-binding protein [RBP, (28)]. RBP is generally present at a 1:1 molar ratio with retinol. We also measured vitamin D levels. As shown in Figure 1, we found that approximately ½ 
individuals exhibited deficiencies or insufficiencies in vitamin A based on IOM standards (vitamin A deficiencies= ≤0.7μM or ≤15,400 ng/ml RBP; insufficiencies = >0.7 to ≤1.05 μM  or >15,400 to <22,000 ng/ml RBP). Most individuals were deficient in vitamin D [25(OH)D] based on IOM standards (<20 
ng/ml (http://ods.od.nih.gov/ factsheets/VitaminD -HealthPorfessional)).  No one 
in the study exhibited sufficiency for vitamin D, based on reports that certain 
tissues require >30 ng/ml, an opinion reflected by the practice guidelines of the US Endocrine Society ( 30-31).   
 
 
Figure 1, Low vitamin levels in Memphis, TN . Samples from households in 
which at least one individual was influenza virus infect ed (3 2) and from the 
Tennessee Blood Services were tested for human RBP4 (Quantikine ELISA Kit, Panel) and for vitamin D in the Pathology Department at St. Jude using a Roche 
Elecsys Vitamin D assay that measures 25 -hydroxylated metabolites of 
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2). Black and dotted 
lines indicate cut-offs for vitamin insufficiencies  and deficiencies respectively.

 Pre-clinical studies of vitamin A and D deficiencies and the immune response 
toward viral vaccines . 
 
To study the impact of vitamin deficiencies on respiratory virus vaccine 
immunogenicity, we established vitamin deficient mouse models. Briefly, 
C57BL/6 pregnant mice were placed on vitamin deficient or control diets at 4-5 days gestation (Harlan diets). Pups were born and maintained on the diets until they reached adulthood and throughout the course of experiments. Vitamin D 
deficient mice were housed under LED lights.  
  
Analyses were first conducted to monitor CD8+ T cell recruitment to the 
respiratory tract  airway following immunization with low dose (250 EID50) 
Sendai virus (SeV, a parainfluenza virus type I of mice) in vitamin deficient mice. The frequencies of virus -specific CD8+ T cells in the airways were significantly 
reduced compared to controls when there were defi ciencies in vitamins A or D 
[(33) and unpublished data].  
 Experiments were then focused on the study of respiratory virus vaccines and antibody responses in vitamin deficient mice. We found that vaccine- specific IgA 
antibody forming cells a nd IgA responses in the upper respiratory tract were 
significantly reduced in animal s with vitamin A deficiencies (34 ), and were 
further reduced in animals with vitamin A+D deficiencies. This demonstrated a failed first line of immune defense at the pathog en’s point-of- entry ( 11-12).  
 
Figure 2 . Vitamin A+D double deficiency impairs IgA more than a single vitamin 
deficiency. Mice were reared on a diet deficient in vitamin A (VAD) or both 
vitamins A+D (VAD+VDD). As adults, mice wer e vaccinated with a cold -
adapted influenza virus vaccine. After one month, mice were evaluated for IgA -
producing AFCs (panel A) or IgA in nasal washes (NW) diluted 1:10, 1:50 and 
1:250 prior to assay (panel B). Averages are shown.

 To determine if failed  immune responses could be corrected, we vaccinated mice 
with influenza virus vaccine and supplemented mice with vitamins on days 0, 3, 
and 7 relative to vaccination (35). As shown in Figure 3, the IgA responses were 
extremely low in animals that were defi cient for vitamins A+D (clear bars; VAD 
+ VDD) compared to controls (black bars). IgA responses were partially corrected 
in double deficient animals when they received either vitamin A or vitamin D. However, the best correction was when animals received both vitamins A and D (hatched bars; +Vit A and D).  
 
 
Figure 3 . Oral vitamin supplements correct IgA responses in double deficient 
mice. Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate, 600 IU) and vitamin D (c holecalciferol , 40 
IU) were administered to mice deficient in vitamins A and D on days 0, 3, and 7 
relative to vaccination with a cold -adapted influenza virus vaccine. Mucosal IgA 
responses were examined 1 month later. IgA responses were examined in nasal 
washes. Shown are averages for each mouse set, with sample diluti ons of 1:10. 
1:50, and 1:250.  
 
To answer th e question of benefit of vitamin supplementation with intramuscular 
influenza vaccine, we injected mice i.m. with an inactive H1N1 influenza virus vaccine. Each mouse received two i.m. injections with a 4 week interval. Half of 
the mice received 600 IU retinyl palmitate on Days 0, 3, and 7 relative to both the 
priming  and boosting doses of vaccine.  Animal sera were evaluated for function 
with a hemagglutination inhibition assay (HAI) against influenza virus. Samples were tested before vaccination, and after both prime and booster injections. As demonstrated in Figure 4, animals that received vitamin supplements generated 
significantly improved influenza virus-specific antibody responses compared to

 controls. Resul ts were striking in that no mice responded to the priming vaccine 
dose, except for mice that received vitamin supplements. After the booster 
vaccine, vitamin supplemented mice exhibited significantly improved antibody 
titers compared to controls. Altogethe r, data demonstrate that vitamin 
supplements improve antibody responses when animals are vaccinated either with 
a replication -competent or inactive influenza virus vaccine, and ei ther by the i.n. 
or i.m. route.

Human samples were next examined to determine if vitamins  A and D associated 
with antibodies. S amples were available for this study from the Memphian 
families affected by influenza virus infections and from the Tennessee Blood 
Service (Memphis, TN). Strong associations were revealed between RBP and 
isotype patterns. There were significant association s between RBP and IgA, 
IgA/IgM, IgA/IgG1, and IgG4 (Figure 5). There were also associations between 
RBP and neutralizing antibody titers toward influenza virus (data not shown). 
These results are exciting and supportive of our previous findings in vitro and in 
mice.

Figure 5. RBP associates with isotypes represented by antibody heavy chain  
genes located at the 3’ side of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. Blood 
samples were examined for RBP levels by ELISA and f or total immunoglobulin 
isotypes using Luminex technology (HGAMMAG-301K Map human isotyping magnetic bead panel, Milliplex, Millipore, St. Charles, MO).  
 Taken together, our preliminary experiments demonstrate that vitamin A (based on RBP levels) and vita min D deficiencies are common in Memphis and that 
vitamin A levels correlate with IgA levels in mice and humans. In the mouse model, the vitamin A and D deficient animals exhibited extremely low IgA levels, 
which could be corrected when mice received vitam in supplements at the time of 
vaccination.  
 
Results strongly encourage a test of vitamin supplementation in Memphis residing 
children who have low vitamin levels and who will receive  an influenza virus 
vaccine. Improvements in  influenza virus vaccine ef ficacy may ultimately protect

 children and adults from the morbidity and mortality caused by influenza virus 
disease.  Thus, efforts are underway to examine the efficacy of Vitamin A & D 
supplementation in conjunction with children receiving the  influenza virus 
vaccine.   
 
Rationale for Two Doses of i nfluenza virus vaccine 
 Current guidelines  are based on the fact that many children younger than 9 years 
of age have not been infected with influenza viruses previously, and a booster dose is needed for them to produce a protective immune response (36 ). Previous 
research among healthy children has also demonstrated the efficacy of two doses of influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory- confirmed cases of influenza illness 
(37-38). Based on previous evidence and the current guidelines supporting the administration of two doses of influenza vaccine among young children, this study will require two doses of influenza virus vaccine for all participants .   
 
Rationale for Vitamin A and Vitamin D Dose  
 
Consistent with previous literature and our pre -clinical data (as detailed above) , 
high dose vitamin supplementation will be utilized as part of this study  (20,000 IU 
per dose of vitamin A and 2,000 IU per dose of vitamin D). A dose that is 10 
times the recommended daily allowance (RDA) at the tolerable upper intake level (UL) will be used for vitamin A. The chosen vitamin A dose is unlikely to cause adverse effects as it is well below that recommended by the WHO for children in 
developing countries. According to UNICEF’s guidelines “the World Health 
Organization (WHO) has established dosage guidelines; each child between 6 and 11 months is to receive 100,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A. This increases to 200,000 IU every six months from 12 to 59 months of age” (4 0). 
Vitamin D levels will be maintained at the UL  (41), because although high-dose 
vitamin D has been successfully studied in humans, and a combination of vitamin A and D supplements support IgA production in research animals deficient in both vitamins, the correlation between vitamin D and IgA is not convincing in our human study. In addition, high-dose vitamin D can yield paradoxical effects, and 
vitamins A and D can act as antagonists to one another (42 -44) 
 
Additionally, we have conducted vitamin studie s in vitamin A deficient mice 
(VAD) and in mice deficient for both vitamins A and D (VAD+VDD).  Caveats 
to the direct translation of results from these mice to humans are: (i) the vitamin A 
content of a normal mouse diet is approximately 15X the RDA of hum ans based 
FLUVIT

 on weight, (ii) vitamin A was completely withheld from our test mice throughout 
their development prior to vaccination, (iii) the vaccinations in mice were either with influenza virus vaccine, a mouse parainfluenza virus, or a cold-adapted, 
mouse-adapted influenza virus (PR8), (iv) supplements were administered to VAD mice by either the intranasal or oral route, and (v) mice were anesthetized when vaccinated, a condition conducive to vaccine transmission to the lower airway. We found that a dose of 600 IU retinyl palmitate (high dose) in a ~20 gram mouse (approximately 30,000 IU/kg), corrected an influenza virus vaccine-
induced IgA response when administered on Days 0, 3, and 7 relative to 
vaccination. The same dose corrected responses when administered intranasally on Day 0 to mice that received a parainfluenza virus vaccine. In the latter case, significant, but incomplete improvements were also observed with doses of 60 IU 
(3,000 IU/kg, medium dose) and 6 IU (300 IU/kg, low dose), the latter being 
comparatively lower than the vitamin A dose proposed here for the clinical study (45).   
More recently, we conducted additional experiments in which mice deficient in 
both vitamins A and D were given a cold- adapted PR8 -based influenza virus 
vaccine and su pplemented orally. When mice received 600 IU retinyl palmitate 
and 40 IU vitamin D orally on Days 0, 3, and 7 relative to vaccination, the IgA 
response was rescued. Responses were less well improved when 600 IU retinyl 
palmitate or 40 IU vitamin D were use d alone. In another study, mice received 
600 IU retinyl palmitate (~30,000 IU/kg) and 40 IU vitamin D, or 60 IU retinyl palmitate and 40 IU vitamin D, or 6 IU retinyl palmitate and 4 IU vitamin D 
orally on Day 0 relative to vaccination with the cold- adapted PR8 influenza virus 
vaccine. The highest dose was most effective at correcting the vaccine -induced 
IgA response. The medium and lower doses were less  effective. To balance safety 
and efficacy and using the 15X correction factor for human versus mouse diets, 
we chose a vitamin A dose for young children that converts to ~450 IU in a 
mouse based on weight, falling between the medium and high doses described above.       Our long- term goal is to identify a logistically -feasible public health strategy to 
provide all children a vitamin supplement in conjunction with the influenza virus vaccine to enhance their immune protection against influenza virus disease. A dose of 10X the RDA UL given once per month should not pose risk to children who have sufficient levels of vitamins. As stated above, the vitamin A dose by 
weight is well below that recommended by the WHO for children in developing 
countries (each child between 6 and 11 months may receive 100,000 international

 units (IU) of vitamin A; from 12 -59 months of age, children may receive 200,000 
IU every six months). If a child of 1 year of age and 10 kg receives a single dose 
of 200,000 IU vitamin, the dose/kg is 20,000 IU/kg, as opposed to the 1500 IU/kg 
proposed here.  Despite previous indications of vitamin s afety, there are also 
studies that have indicated risk in the context of high vitamin A or D intake. Penniston and Tanumihardjo describe acute toxicities when children ingest >20X the vitamin A RDA over a period of hours or a few days (46). Tolerance to hi gh 
vitamin intake may be variable among children  (47). A dose of 25,000 IU 
increases the incidence of transient bulging of the fontanelle in infants and a dose of greater than 25,000 IU in pregnant females is discouraged at certain periods of gestation due to a risk of teratogenicity (48). These and other studies were likely 
considered by the IOM when defining UL RDA guidelines. Vitamins A and D 
bind nuclear receptors (e.g. RAR- RXR, VDR -RXR, PPAR- RXR, LXR -RXR, and 
TR-RXR) that in turn bind DNA, impacting tr anscription at a plethora of loci and 
influencing a wide variety of cell functions. As stated above, the vitamins and 
receptors can be agonists or antagonists of other receptors and of one another (42 -
44).  The vitamin A dose proposed here (20,000 IU) is below doses previously associated with toxicities.  
 
The proposed pilot study led by the Department of Infectious Diseases will be a double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in healthy volunteers. The primary objective 
will be to assess the vaccine -induced and total antibody (including IgG and IgA) response 
and IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratios in sera. The secondary objective will be to assess the functional antibody response toward Influenza virus vaccine influenza vaccine in the 
sera. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either two doses of an influenza 
virus vaccine plus Vitamin A + D  (intervention group), or two doses of  an influenza 
virus vaccine plus the placebo (control group) . The targeted accrual total is 100 with a 
targeted evaluable 80 participants recruited over 2 influenza seasons (approximately 2 
years) .

3.3. Research Participant Recruitment and Screening  
Children ages 2 to 8 years old will be sought in the Memphis community from a variety of both private and public venues through active recruitment by study staff 
as well as self -referral in response to advertisements . Types of advertisements that 
may be used include flyers, postcards, brochures, and newspaper ads. Advertisements may be distributed in many ways including email, mass mailings, 
and in person by study staff. Verbal permission will be sought at private locations 
where advertisements will be posted by study staff and a signed letter of authorization will be obtained from any performance sites where recruitment activities take place. All recruitment materials will be approved by the IRB before 
use. Advertisements will indicate the nature of the study and provide a phone 
number for further information. 
Study investigators or their designees will explain the study to potential research 
participants, including eligibility and exclusion criteria. Per sons who indicate they 
are interested in participating in the study and potentially eligible will be offered a 
screening visit .  
During the screening visit, study investigators or their designees will assign a participant ID and provide individuals with information about the study and an opportunity to ask questions. Written informed consent for study participation will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. Participants who fail the 
screening process due to the time sensitive criteria (e.g., recent  febrile illness) will 
be allowed to rescreen .  
3.4. Enrollment on Study at St. Jude

 be faxed or emailed to the CPDMO at 595 -6265 to complete the enrollment 
process.  
The CPDMO is staffed 7:30 am -5:00 pm CST, Monday through Friday. A staff 
member is on call Saturday, Sunday, and holidays from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.  
Enrollments may be requested during weekends or holidays by calling the CPDMO “On Call” cell phone (901-413-8591) or referencing the “On Call 
Schedule” on the intranet).  
3.5. Procedures for Identifying and Randomizing Research Participants 
Eligibility of research participants will be confirmed by the PI or study team. A study team member will then approach the participant and his or her legal 
authorized representative regarding the study. If the participant and/or caregiver agree to participate and meet eligi bility criteria , the participant will be 
randomized.  
Once informed consent has been obtained and eligibility confirmed, participants 
will be randomized to receive influenza virus vaccine + Vitamins A & D (n=40) or influenza virus vaccine + placebo  (n=40).  Randomization will be performed in 
the SJCRH pharmacy by an unblinded pharmacist, using the randomization program developed by the Department of Biostatistics. In order to ensure similar enrollment numbers within each group, randomization will be restrict ed with a 
permuted block randomization design. All eligible participants who are enrolled 
and receive at least one administration of influenza virus vaccine will be included 
in the analyses.  
4.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
4.1. Treatment  
This is a single site, pilot, randomized control led trial in health y children . The 
primary and secondary endpoints assessing vaccine-induced and total antibody (IgG and IgA)  response and IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM ratios in the sera as well as 
the functional antibody response toward influenza virus vaccine in the sera will be 
measured at Day 28, and 56. Approximately 100 total and 80 evaluable 
participants will be enrolled equally into two groups over 2 flu seasons, one of which will receive oral vitamins A and D  (intervention), while the other group 
will receive the  influenza virus vaccine and placebo gummy (control).

Protocol document date: 06/08/2018  
 Potential participants will be approached by  study staff. Participants who wish to 
participate in the study will complete the informed consent process prior to 
conducting the screenin g evaluations.  
 Allocation will be stratified by levels of Vitamin A using the surrogate retinol-binding protein (RBP). Vitamin A insufficien cy (inclusive of deficiency) will be 
defined as   ≤1.05 μM  or  <22,000 ng/ml RBP. RBP will be used to stratify 
participants based on previous mouse and human study demonstrating that 
vitamin A (for which RBP is a surrogate) is well correlated with IgA. RBP measurements are variable in humans, distributed somewhat equally above and below sufficiency cut -off. In contras t, our clinical work has indicated that study 
participants in Memphis are largely homogenous for vitamin D measurements in 
that most of the serum values fall below the sufficiency cut off. After the 
screening evaluations are obtained, the participant witho ut co -enrolled siblings 
will be allocated to the intervention or placebo arm , in the pharmacy department, by means of a computerized stratified permuted block method (block size 4: 
allocation ratio 1:1) provided by the department of biostatistics .  Co -enrolled 
siblings will first be stratified by their screening RBP levels , and then siblings 
within the same RBP level stratum will be equally  assigned  to intervention or 
control to avoid the chance of treatment imbalance, with the use of a computerized strat ified permuted block method (block size 2: allocation ratio 
1:1).  
 Participants will be randomized to receive either influenza virus vaccine plus 
vitamins A and D supplements (n=40) or influenza virus vaccine plus matched 
placebo . Gummies for the interven tion and control arm (placebo) will be provided 
in the same container by an unblinded pharmacist to maintain blinding. For the purposes of this study, Study Day 0 is defined for each participant as the day that the first  influenza vaccine dose  is administered. All participants will receive 2 
doses of influenza virus vaccine at least 28 days  apart.   
 Children will have the first influenza virus vaccine dose (dose 1) administered on 
day 0 of the trial, and the second dose (dose 2) administered 28 days later. 
Vaccines will be administered by a technique consistent with the manufacturer’s 
specification.  
Participants will be observed for 30 minutes following vaccination. Participants will be  given a food diary card to record their diet  between th e Day 0 and Da y 56 
study visits.

 Blood serum samples will be collected from participa nts at Screening and  prior to 
receiving the influenza virus vaccine on Day 28 as well as during  their Day 56 
follow-up visit. 
 
Chewable Vitamin or Placebo Administration  
 Chewable Vita min A & D 3 or Placebo Gummy  
The chewable gummy contains either Vitamin A  (20,000 International 
Units)   and Vitamin D 3 (2,000 International Units) or matched placebo, 
which   should be fully chewed under supervision of study staff with  
documention in the par ticipants research record  and eMAR (electronic 
medical administration record) . The chewable gummy should be 
administered prior to receiving influenza virus vaccine vaccination.    If participant s have difficulty  chew ing the gummy , another option is to cut  
the chewable vitamin in half along score line for easier administration .   
4.2. Contraindications to an influenza virus vaccine 
Influenza virus vaccinewill not be administered to anyone with previously known allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of  the vaccine, or after a 
previous dose of any influenza vaccine during the same season prior to study 
participation .  
4.3. Concomitant Therapy 
Information (including name and indication) regarding medication use by participants will be collected at the time of enrollment. All medications taken from enrollment through Day 56 will also be collected. Concomitant medications reported throughout the course of the study will be recorded including: all 
prescription medications, over-the-counter preparations, vita mins, nutritional 
supplements, and herbal preparations. 
 The use of anti-influenza medications for the prevention of influenza is prohibited 
during the trial as use of these agents prophylactically may affect culture results.  
Participants caregivers will b e asked to inform study staff should their child 
require anti -influenza medications while on study.  Use of all other concomitant 
therapies will be allowed.

 9.0 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING R EQUIREMENTS  
9.1. Reporting Adverse Experiences and Deaths to St. Jude IRB 
Only “unanticipated p roblems involving risks to participants or others” referred to 
hereafter as “unanticipated problems” are required to be reported to the St. Jude 
IRB promptly, but in no event later than 10 working days after the investigator 
first learns of the unanticipated problem. Regardless of whether the event is 
internal or external (for example, an IND safety report by the sponsor pursuant to 
21 CFR 312.32), only adverse events that constitute unanticipated problems are reportable to the St. Jude IRB.  As further described in the definition of unanticipated problem, this includes any event that in the PI’s opinion was: 
• Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (1) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents,  
such as  the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent 
document, as well as other relevant information available about the 
research; (2) the observed rate of occurrence (compared to a credible 
baseline for comparison); and (3) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research; and 
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was pr eviously known or recognized. An unanticipated problem involving 
risk to subjects or others may exist even when actual harm does not occur to any participant.  
 
Unrelated, expected deaths do not require reporting to the IRB.  Though death is 
“serious”, the event must meet the other two requirements of “related or possibly 
related” and “unexpected/unanticipated” to be considered reportable.  
Deaths meeting reporting requirements are to be reported immediately to the St. 
Jude IRB, but in no event later than 48 hours after the investigator first learns of 
the death.   
The following definitions apply  with respect to report ing adverse 
experiences : 
 Serious Adverse Event:  
Any adverse event temporally associated with the subject’s participation in 
research that meets any of the following criteria: 
FLUVIT  
Page 25 
 
Revision 1. 3, dated: 06/08/2018  IRB Approval date: 06/14/2018 
Protocol document date: 06/08/2018  
 • results in death; 
• is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred);  
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization;  
• results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• any other adverse event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition (examples of such events include:  any substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions, allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home, blood dyscras ias or 
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse), a congenital anomaly/birth defect, secondary or concurrent cancer, medication 
overdose, or is any medical event which requires treatment to prevent any 
of the medical outcomes previously listed.   
Unexpected Adverse Event:  
• Any adverse event for which the specificity or severity is not consistent 
with the protocol-related documents, including the applicable investigator 
brochure, IRB approved consent form, Investigational New Drug (IND) or 
Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application, or other relevant 
sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts; or if it does appear in such documents, an event in which the specificity, severity or duration is not consistent with the risk information included 
therein; or  
• The observed rate of occurrence is a clinically significant increase in the 
expected rate (based on a credible baseline rate for comparison); or  
• The occurr ence is not consistent with the expected natural progression of 
any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject(s) 
experiencing the adverse event and the subject’s predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
Internal Events:  
Events experienced by a research participant enrolled at a site under the 
jurisdiction of St. Jude IRB for either multicenter or single -center research 
projects.

Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to Subjects or Others:   
An unanticipated problem involving risks to subjects or others is an event which 
was not expected to occur and which increases the degree of risk posed to 
research participants.  Such events, in general, meet all of the following criteria:  
• unexpected;  
• related or possibly related to parti cipation in the research; and  
• suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of 
harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than 
was previously known or recognized.  An unanticipated problem involving 
risk to  subjects or others may exist even when actual harm does not occur 
to any participant.  
Consistent with FDA and OHRP guidance on reporting unanticipated problems 
and adverse events to IRBs, the St. Jude IRB does not require the submission of 
external event s, for example IND safety reports, nor is a summary of such 
events/reports required; however, if an event giving rise to an IND safety or other external event report constitutes an “unanticipated problem involving risks to 
subjects or others” it must be reported in accordance with this policy.  In general, 
to be reportable external events need to have implications for the conduct of the study (for example, requiring a significant and usually safety- related change in the 
protocol and/or informed consent form ). 
 Although some adverse events will qualify as unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, some will not; and there may be other unanticipated problems that go beyond the definitions of serious and/or unexpected adverse 
events.  Examples of unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or othe rs 
include: 
 
• Improperly staging a participant’s tumor resulting in the participant 
being assigned to an incorrect arm of the research study;  
• The theft of a research computer containing confiden tial subject 
information (breach of confidentiality); and  
• The contamination of a study drug.  Unanticipated problems generally 
will warrant consideration of substantive changes in the research 
protocol or informed consent process/document or other correct ive 
actions in order to protect the safety, welfare, or rights of subjects or others.

 9.2. Recording Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Adverse events associated with the influenza virus vaccine will not be recorded 
for this study. Other adverse events will be graded using the Division of 
Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) Pediatric Toxicity Tables 
(Appendix III). All grades of these events will be recorded.  
 Adverse events will be collected from enrollment through the participant’s last 
visit. Any AE that has not had a stop date recorded by the participant’s last visit 
will continue to be followed-up until an outcome or resolution has occurred. 
Study participants will be instructed to notify study personnel at any time during the study if they a re hospitalized or have any unusual, alarming or unexpected 
events.  
 Adverse events will be assessed by the investigator for severity, relationship to the study product , possible etiologies and whether the event meets criteria as a 
serious adverse event.  
 The following guidelines will be used by investigators to assess the relationship of an AE to study product administration:  
• Definite: Unquestionable relationship. The event was directly attributable 
to the study product. 
• Probable: Relationship is likely.  It is likely that the study product caused 
the event.  
• Possible: Relationship may exist. There is at least a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study product, although the likelihood is 
low. 
• Unlikely: Relationship is not likely. Although it is unlikely that the 
study product caused this event, causality cannot be entirely ruled out. 
• Unrelated: No relationship. The study product did not cause the event. 
 
Factors considered in assessing the relationship of an AE to study product include:  
• the temporal relationship of the event to the administration of study 
product ;  
• whether an alternative etiology has been identified; and  
• biological plausibility.

 9.3. Un-blinding Procedures 
The investigator should follow the trial's randomization procedures and should 
ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol. T he treating 
investigator should promptly document and explain to the St. Jude Principal Investigator (PI) any premature un-blinding of the investigational agent (e.g., accidental un -blinding, or un-blinding due to a serious adverse event). The study 
PI determines the attribution and grading of Adverse Events as well as decides, 
in sponsor-investigator trials, if breaking of a study blind is necessary.  In 
deciding, the St. Jude PI may consider:  
• Are there any specific antidotes for the investigational agent or blinded 
chemotherapy agent(s),  
• Are drug -drug interactions expected that may preclude medical 
intervention,  
• Would discontinuation of IND or blinded agent(s) be likely to have an 
immediate effect?  
 - Participant and data management  
It is recommended that, when possible and appropriate, the blind be maintained 
for those persons responsible for analysis and interpretation of results at the 
study's conclusion.  Any toxicities associated or possibly associated with study treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  
 - Accidental Un -blinding 
In the event of accidental un-blinding by study personnel, the following should 
occur:  
• Information on accidental un-blinding (including subject number, 
person(s) involved, information shared, whether the un-blinded person 
has patient contact) is sent to the St. Jude site Principal Investigator (PI). 
• The St. Jude PI provides a summary of the incident to the Biostatisticia n 
and the un-blinded study clinical research monitor. 
• The protocol deviation will be recorded in a blinded manner and 
communicated to the primary blinded monitor. 
• Blinded site staff will be re -trained by the blinded MONITOR, and un-
blinded site staff will be retrained by the un -blinded MONITOR on 
procedures for maintaining the blind. A summary of the issue and the re-

Protocol document date: 06/08/2018  
 training will be documented in both the blinded monitoring visit report 
and the un-blinded monitoring visit report.  
• Monitors will ensure app ropriate actions are taken (e.g., that the affected 
study participant is treated according to protocol specifications concerning un-blinding, that a corrective action to prevent unintentional un-blinding is implemented, that the event is recorded in the deviation log in a blinded manner, and that the SMC  or other appropriate parties 
were notified or consulted as applicable) 
 - Emergency Un -blinding 
In cases of patient safety (medical emergency or serious medical condition), the 
treating physician may reques t un-blinding a participant randomization code, if 
knowledge of the treatment assignment is essential for the clinical management 
or welfare of the participant. Un -blinding of treatment assignment prior to 
documented disease progression is permitted only for a serious, un- expected 
adverse event suspected to be study drug- related (as part of the safety reporting 
process) and if necessary for patient management.  
 Procedure for Requesting Un-blinding of a Unique Participant Identifier or 
Randomization Code: 
 
• The study St. Jude PI is the only one who has authority to approve for un-
blinding a participant randomization code or identification code.  
• In a medical emergency, every effort should be made to consult with the 
St. Jude PI (insert PI emergency contact phone number) to discuss other options prior to requesting un-blinding of a participant randomization 
code.  
• The treating physician at St. Jude shall make a request to the St. Jude PI.  
• The treating physician may hold administration of the investigational 
agen t while waiting for a decision on un-blinding to be made. 
• The St. Jude PI may consult with Investigational Pharmacy for un-
blinding, if applicable. 
• The St. Jude PI will contact the investigational pharmacist to provide the 
randomization code for the individual participant.  
• The un-blinding information for the participant should be limited to as few 
individuals as possible. The blinded study team and the participant 
should remain blinded. 
• Documentation of the incident will be maintained in the pharmacy binde r. 
All documents associated with the incident should be recorded in a 
FLUVIT

 blinded manner in the EMR and/or other documents, such as, emails, if 
the participant remains on study and the data will be included in study data analysis.  
• If the un-blinding was due to an adverse event, confirm the adverse event 
was reported and documented in accordance with applicable reporting procedures and timelines. 
10.0 DATA COLLECTION, STU DY MONITORING, AND 
CONFIDENTIALITY 
10.1. Data Collection  
All study data will be collected by the study  staff using designated source 
documents. Data will be entered and maintained in an institutional relational database with separate backup and monthly off site backup. Standard GCP practices will be followed to ensure accurate, reliable and consistent data collection.  
10.2. Study Monitoring  
The study team will hold monthly meetings and review case histories or quality summaries on participants.  
Source document verification of eligibility and informed consent for 100% of St. 
Jude participants will be performed by the Eligibility Coordinators within 5 
working days of completion of enrollment. 
The Clinical Research Monitor will perform monitoring of applicable essential 
regulatory documentation.  Also, reviewing for the timeliness of serious adverse event reporting (type, grade, attribution, duration, timeliness and appropriateness) 
for selected study participants  semi -annually and track accrual continuously.  The 
monitor will verify those data points relating to the primary study objective for a 
certain number of study enrollees as specified in the Moderate Risk monitoring plan checklist for this study.  Protocol compliance monitoring will include 
participant status, safety assessments, eligibility, the informed consent process, 
participant protocol status, off-study, and off- therapy criteria.  The Monitor will 
generate a formal report which is shared with the Principal Investigator (PI), study team and the Internal Monitoring Committee (IMC).

Revision 1. 3, dated: 06/08/2018  IRB Approval date: 06/14/2018 
Protocol document date: 06/08/2018  
 Monitoring may be conducted more frequently if deemed necessary by the 
CPDM O or the IMC.   
Continuing reviews by the IRB and CT-SRC will occur at least annually.  In addition, SAE reports in TRACKS (Total Research and Knowledge System) are reviewed in a timely manner by the IRB/ OHSP.  
10.3. Confidentiality 
All study procedures will be conducted in private, and every effort will be made to protect participant privacy and confidentiality to the extent possible.  
Data collection, process, and administrative forms, laboratory specimens, and 
other reports will be identified by a coded number only to maintain participant confidentiality.  The study database will identify study participants only by the study identification number and will not contain personal health or other 
identifiers. The list containing the study number and personal identif iers will be 
maintained in a secured file indefinitely. All study -related information will be 
stored securely. All participant information will be stored in locked file cabinets 
in areas with access limited to study staff. All records that contain names or  other 
personal identifiers, such as locator forms and informed consent forms, will be stored separately from study records identified by code number.  Databases will be secured with password- protected access systems. Participants’ study 
information will not be released without their written permission, except as 
necessary for monitoring. Personal identifiers will not be included in any study 
reports.  
All study records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by national and 
local laws.  Authorized representatives of the sponsor(s), and regulatory agencies 
may examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) study records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits and evaluation of the study safety and progress. 
11.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1. Anticipated Completion Dates 
Anticipated Primary Completion Date: 24 months following enrollment of 
the first participant.    
Anticipated Study Completion Date 5 years following approval of the 
FLUVIT

 protocol   
11.2. Sample Size  
The primary goal of the study is  to estimate the effect size of vaccination when 
incorporating vitamin A/D supplements and standard care. The primary 
endpoint of interest will be the proportion of 4X increases  or conversion from 
an undetectable to a detectable response in virus- specific antibody  after two 
immunizations (compared to the starting titer ) in intervention and control 
groups. We plan to enroll 40 participants per group in total. Assuming an 
attrition rate of about 5%, approximately 38 vaccine plus vitamin and 38 
vaccine plus placebo  participants will provide data for the primary objectives. 
Because this is a pilot study and there is very limited information about vitamin supplementation with influenza vaccination among children, t he sample size 
was chosen based on past experien ce with clinical trials of other respiratory 
virus vaccines among a pediatric population at SJCRH and published literature (39).  The sample size proposed will suffice for capturing the response rate 
difference between groups with a power of over 80% at a significance level of 
5%, if the true average response rate overall with the Vitamin A/D supplements 
is over 62% (EAST 6) while the response rate in the vaccine only group is 30% 
on average , the majority of the enrolled participants are either vitamin A or D or 
both deficient as suggested by our experience. If the effect size is smaller, we 
still believe the estimated effect size with the proposed 80 participants will inform future larger studies.  
11.3. Participant Accrual, Follow-up and Retention  
Based on previous studies of influenza vaccination among children, the accrual of 100 total and 80 evaluable participants will take approximately 2 years (or 2 
flu seasons). Participants lost to follow-up and/or discontinued early from the study will not be replaced. The study team will consider a participant “lost to 
follow-up” for this trial if he or she has missed 2 consecutive study visits and is 
unreachable after multiple contact attempts by study staff. However, every effort will be made to complete their regularly scheduled study evaluations. Study staff 
will target a 95% retention  of enrolled participants over the 56 day follow-up 
period.

 11.4. Summary of Primary and Secondary Objectives  
For all analyses, all continuous titer measures will be log transformed unless 
otherwise specified  
 Analysis of Primary Objective s 
 In Section 4.1, we have described a way to equally assign enrolled siblings into 
two arms. By doing this, ignoring the possible nonindependence in siblings when obtaining group difference should still provide a consistent estimate of the group difference. The precision (i.e., the width of the 95% confidence interval) of the estimate may be inflated, while the degree of inflation of the precision depends on the number of co-enrolled siblings, which is not pr edictable at this stage. Given 
the fact that this study is a pilot study, we believe in the value of obtaining an accurate group difference estimate, and allow some leeway in precision. More precise estimates and more power could be achieved  through future larger studies.  
 
 
To assess the vaccine- induced and total antibody (IgG and IgA) 
response and IgA/IgG plus IgA/IgM  ratios in the sera  at days 28 and 56. 
 
The serum antibody response described by the proportion of 4X increases or 
conversion from undetectable to detectable response in virus- specific  
antibody after two immunizations  in intervention and control groups will be estimated and  95% confidence interval will be described  for both groups, 
overall and by stratum. The proportion difference with 95% confidence 
interval will be reported , overall and by stratum. Due to possible variation in 
virus strains and  the i nfluenza virus vaccine formula in different flu 
seasons, analyses by season will also be described.  Continuous titer values 
in both groups, overall or by stratum, will also be described and compared with point estimate along with 95% confidence intervals. 
 
Titer ratios, such as IgA/IgG and IgA/IgM will be summarized with 
descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, median and range, for each intervention group, overall or by season. Two-sample tests (t- test or 
Wilcoxon rank-sum test) will be applied whenever appropriate. 
 
We will also apply generalized estimating equations (GEE) or mixed models to explore titer levels longitudinally .

 As sensitivity analysis, similar analytic procedures will be additionally 
implemented by treating 4X increases or conversion from undetectable to 
detectable response in virus- specific antibody after two immunizations a s an 
endpoint. 
 
Analysis of Secondary Objectives 
 To assess the functional antibody response towared the i nfluenza virus 
vaccine in the sera  
 
Secondary  analyses will examine sero -conversion defined as antibody HAI 
titers of <1:20  converting to ≥1:20, or a four- fold increase in titer for 
participants with a starting titer of ≥1:20. Sero -conversion rate will be 
estimated with proportion and 95% confidence interval for both groups, overall and by stratum . The rate difference will be described with point 
estimate and 95% confidence interval , overall and by stratum. Due to 
possible variation in virus strains and influenza virus vaccine compositions 
in different flu seasons, analyses by season will also be described. 
Continuous titer values in both groups, overall or by stratum, will also be described and compared with point estimate along with 95% confidence intervals.  
 
We will also apply generalized estimating equations (GEE) or mixed models to explore titer levels longitudinally.  
 
Analysis of Exploratory Objectives 
 
To describe the socio -demographic characteristics  and nutritional diet 
among children participating in the trial .  
 
Socio -demographic and dietary intake will be described with tables and 
descriptive statistics (frequency, proportion mean, standard deviation, median, range, etc…). The anticipated socio -demographic  heterogeneity of 
participants may preclude further analysis, but if feasible, relationships between socio -demographic characteristics  and dietary intake with outcomes 
will be exam ined.  
 To assess the feasibility of the food diary among healthy volunteers as measured by completion of the diary.

Revision 1. 3, dated: 06/08/2018  IRB Approval date: 06/14/2018 
Protocol document date: 06/08/2018  
 To assess the feasibility of the food diary among healthy volunteers, the 
proportion and 95% confidence interval of participants who comple te and 
return the food diary will be calculated overall and at each visit time point.  
 To monitor serum Vitamin A and D levels at various time points.  Serum Vitamin A and D levels at screening, days 0, 28 and 56 will be monitored, plotted and described at each time point. Summary statistics, 
such as mean, standard deviation, median and range, will be provided for all 
time points.  If feasible, paired comparisons and longitudinal modeling will be explored.  
12.0 OBTAINING INFORMED CONSENT  
12.1. Informed Consent Prior to Research Interventions  
This protocol, the informed consent document, and any subsequent modifications will be reviewed and approved by the IRB. 
The informed consent will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be 
followed, and the risks and benefits of participation. The consent discussion will take place in a private room and an opportunity to ask questions will be given. A 
copy of the signed consent form will be given to the participant. The consent 
process will be documented in the resea rch record.  
All research participants who meet eligibility criteria regardless of gender or minority status are fully eligible to participate in this study.  
12.2. Consent at Age of Majority 
Age of majority does not apply to this protocol since only children betw een the 
ages of 2 to 8 years old will be eligible for study participation. Participation should only last approximately 56 days so participants will not reach the age of 18 before complet ing th e study.

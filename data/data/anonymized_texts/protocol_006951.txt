Name of Active Ingredients:  
bupivacaine and meloxicam  Phase of Development: 3 
Study Ob jectives:  
Primary Objective:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia following local administration of HTX -011 with 
saline placebo during the first 72  hours following unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy.  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare the efficacy and duration of analgesia for HTX -011 with bupivacaine HCl without 
epinephrine during the first 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To compare the effect of HTX -011 with saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine on 
opioid load during the first 72  hours following surgery in this study population.  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in this study population.  
 To further establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of bupivacaine and meloxicam in 
HTX -011 in this study population.  
Metho dology: This is a Phase  3, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active -controlled, 
multicenter study in subjects undergoing unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy.  
Subjects will be screened within 2 8 days prior to surgery. Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility 
criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to surgery. On the day 
of surgery (Day  1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria will und ergo inguinal 
herniorrhaphy  under general anesthesi a. Spinal, epidural, or regional anesthesi a is not allowed. During 
surgery, the use of intravenous (IV) fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg will be permitted  for intraoperative pain 
control . Just prior to the end of th e surgery , all subjects will receive an additional 50 g IV fentanyl  in 
order to decrease the inherent variability in pain control on postoperative pain perception . As an example, 
the maximum total amount of fentanyl used during surgery for a 70 kg subject  should not exceed 330 µg 
(4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 5 0 μg at the end of the case = 330 μg total). 
Intraoperative administration of other opioids  or any other analgesics  (including ketamine) , local 
anesthetics, or anti -inflammatory agents (except as specified by the protocol) is prohibited, unless needed 
to treat an adver se event  (AE) that occurs after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF ), for 
pretreatment prior to a needle placement , or to decrease venous irritation (eg, caused by propofol , in 
which case no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20 mg IV may be administered) . 
Near the completion of surgery  and after irrigation and suction have been completed , a single dose of 
study drug (HTX -011, saline placebo, or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine) will be given 
intraoperatively via local adminis tration into the surgical site.  
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the

postanesthesia care unit (PACU). Su bjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for a minimum of 
72 hours after the start of study drug administration to undergo postoperative assessments. After the 
72-hour assessments have been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subjects will r eturn to the study 
site on Days  10 and 28 to complete follow -up assessments.  
Treatment Groups  
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment group s in a 2:2:1  ratio:  
 HTX -011, 300 mg/9 mg ( bupivacaine/ meloxicam doses), 10.3 mL, via instillation into the surgical 
site ( 160 subjects)  
 Bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine 0.25%, 75  mg (30 mL), via injection into the surgical site 
(160 subjects)  
 Saline placebo, 10.3  mL, via instillation into the surgical site ( 80 subjects)  
Blinding  
The study will use a double -blind design . The site’s pharmacy staff and surgical staff will not be blinded 
to the treatment assignments because HTX -011 is a colored and viscous liquid whereas saline placebo and 
bupivacaine HCl are not, and the volume of s tudy drug to be administered varies by treatment group. 
However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug they are receiving, and once surgery is complete 
and the subject is transferred to the PACU, the assessor and all staff involved in efficacy and s afety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock.  
Postoper ative Rescue Medications  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed, during the 
72-hour postoperative observation per iod. Rescue medicatio n should not be given for pain prophylaxis, 
but only for treating postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue medication, 
if the subject has not already had at least 1 postoperative pain  score assessed, then a Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS -R) followed by an NRS  score with activity (NRS -A) must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consist of oral (PO) immediate -release oxycodone ( no more than  
10 mg within a 4-hour period  as needed) , IV morphine ( no more than 10 mg within a 2 -hour period  as 
needed ), and/or  oral acetaminophen  or oral paracetamol  (no more than 1 gram [1000 mg] in a 6 -hour 
window). For subjects administered any acetaminophen /paracetamol -containing p roduct, the total 
combined daily dose mu st not exceed 4 grams (4000 mg) as severe liver damage may occur . No other 
analgesic agents, including nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ), are permitted during the 
72-hour po stoperative observation period.  
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue medication 
as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge.  
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours , oral acetaminophen /paracetamol  (no 
more than 1000  mg every 6  hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain.  If a subject 
received 10 mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject should be provided

(from Screening through the Day 28 Visit) will be up to 60 days.  The overall duration of the study is 
anticipated to be approximately 9 months.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Efficacy , safety , and PK  assessments will be performed. The start of study drug administration will be 
considered as Time  0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK timepoints.  
Efficacy Assessment s: 
 Pain intensity scores using NRS -R and NRS -A at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72  hours, and on 
Day 10 and Day 28.  
 NRS -R: Subjects should be recumbent or lying supine. Measurements should be obtained after 
the subject is in the resting position for at least 5 minutes.  
 NRS -A: Subjects should be recumbent or lying supine  and instructed to sit up. Measurements 
should be obtained as soon as  the subject has sat  up from the resting  position.  
 Date, time of administrati on, and amount of all opioid rescue medication taken through 72  hours.  
 Subject daily diary to record if any opioids were taken from 72 hours through Day 28.  
 Discharge readiness assessment per the Modified Postanaesthetic Discharge Scoring System 
(MPADSS) criteria at 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hours. (Note: This study instrument assesses 
a subject’s potential readiness to be discharged and should be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It 
is not meant to be used to decide on whether or not to disc harge a subject from the study, as subjects 
are required to remain in the hospital/research facility for at least 72 hours.)  
 Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of pain control at 24, 48, and 72 hours and on Day 28.  
Safety Assessments:  
 AEs from the time the su bject signs the ICF through Day 28.  
 Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity (LAST) assessment s at 30 minut es (±5 min), 1 hour (±5 min), 
2 hours (±15 min), 4 hours (±15 min), 18 hours (±30 min) , 24 hours (±1 h) , and 72 hours (±4 h) . If 
symptoms are present at 30  minutes, 1 hour, or 2 hours, an unscheduled blood sample will be 
collected for PK and a 12 -lead ECG will be performed.  If symptoms are present at 72 hours, an 
unscheduled blood sample will be collected for PK.  
 Clinical safety laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry) at the Screening  Visit, at 24  hours 
(hematology only), at 72  hours, and on Day 10.  
 Physical examination at Screening Visit and 72  hours; the Screening Visit will also include height, 
weight, and BMI calculation.

carried forward ( wWOCF ), comparing the estimated treatment difference between HTX -011 and saline 
placebo using analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with missing data imputed via last observation carried 
forward ( LOCF ) for interval censored pain intensi ty scores and worst observation carried forward 
(WOCF) for right -censored pain intensity scores in the Intent -to-Treat Population.  
The primary analysis of AUC 0-72 of the NRS -A pain intensity scores will be carried out using an ANOVA 
model with treatment as  the main effect, comparing HTX -011 with saline placebo at a significance level  
of 5% . Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and SDs, least -squares mean differences and SEs with 
associated 95% CIs, and p -values. To account for the duration effect of opioi d rescue medication, the 
wWOCF method will be implemented as the primary analysis meth od for endpoints involving NRS pain 
intensity scores . In this method, pain intensity scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of 
effect) of any opioid rescue  medication will be replaced with the worst (hi ghest) postdose nonmissing 
NRS  pain intensity score observed prior to the rescue medication window, with the f ollowing exception: 
if the NRS  pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the w orst pre -window score, 
then it will not be replaced. Sensitivity analys es for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores  will 
analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opioid rescue medications.

endpoints, a strict testing hierarchy will be applied to control s tudy-wise alpha level at 0.05. If the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant (p≤0.05), then the first key secondary endpoint will be tested. If the 
first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the second key secondary endpoint will be 
tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner down the key  secondary endpoint list until an 
endpoint fails to meet st atistical significance, after which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be 
considered exploratory. If the primary endpoint is not statistically significant, then all key secondary 
endpoints will be considered exploratory.  
Continuous  endpoints will be analyzed using an ANOVA model with treatment as the main effect. 
Results will be expressed as means and SDs, least -squares mean differences and SEs with associated 95% 
CIs, and p -values.  
Categorical endpoints will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. Results will be expressed as the number 
and percentage of subjects meeting the relevant endpoint, differences in proportions with 95%  CIs, and 
p-values.  Median time in hours to first opioid rescue administration will be analyzed with Kaplan -Meier 
methods.  
Handling of Missing Data  
Due to the required 72 -hour inpatient postoperative  observation period, the amount of missing data is 
expected to be very low. For any missing data observed  through 72 hours in subjects who complete the 
72-hour postoperative observ ation period , NRS pain intensity scores will be imputed via LOCF, in which 
the most recent postdose value is used for a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a 
postdose value prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose v alues at the relevant 
timepoint from subjects with observed data in the same randomized treatment group will be used. Predose 
values will not be carried f orward to postdose timepoints. In subjects who withdraw from the study prior 
to 72 hours, missing  NRS pain intensity scores  through 72  hours that were to be collected following 
withdrawal will be imputed via WOCF, in which the worst (highest) NRS pain intensity score observed 
prior to withdraw al will be used for po st-withdrawal values through 72  hours . Analyses that adjust for the 
effect of opioid rescue medication will perform wWOCF following LOCF /WOCF  (ie, perform 
LOCF /WOCF  first, then apply wWOCF).  The number and percentage of missing NRS pain intensity 
scores will be summarized.  
Safety Analyses  
All safe ty data will be listed and summarized by treatment group; no statistical hypothesis testing will be 
performed. All TEAEs will be coded and tabulated by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence 
of TEAEs, SAEs, and ORAEs will be summarized and presen ted in descending order of frequency 
according to the HTX -011 group. Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic profile, renal 
function, and hematology  values will be grouped and presented together in summary tables. Individual 
subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. Changes in 
vital sign parameters and ECG results will be summarized . Wound healin g assessment results will be 
summarized.

Name of Active Ingredients:  
bupivacaine and meloxicam  Phase of Development: 3 
Determination of Sample Size  
Based on a previous Phase 2 study of HTX -011 in subjects undergoing unilateral open inguinal 
herniorrhaphy, estimates of the relevant parameters for each of the primary and key secondar y endpoints 
are as follows:  
 
Parameter  Saline Placebo  Bupivacaine HCl  HTX -011 300 mg/9 mg  
Pain intensity AUC 0-72: Mean (SD)  400 (150)  350 (150)  275 (200)  
Opioid consumption (mg): Mean (SD)  30 (25)  23 (25)  12 (25) 
Proportion of opioid -free subjects  10% 20% 40% 
 
Assuming these estimates and using Satterthwaite’s t -test with α = 0.05, 2 -sided for the continuous 
endpoints and Fisher’s exact test with α = 0.05, 2 -sided for the categorical endpoints, 160 subjects in the 
HTX -011 group, 160 subjects in the bupivacaine HCl active control group, and 80 subjects in the saline 
placebo control group provide at least 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference between 
the HTX -011 group and each of the control groups for each of the p rimary and key secondary endpoints.

* The start of study drug administration will be considered as Time 0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK assessments. For assessments at ti mepoints when the subject 
is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the subject. If there is no response, the assessments at th ese timepoints may be recorded as “Not Done.” 
Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) should be completed. When PK and NRS pa in intensity assessments 
coincide, the NRS pain intensity assessments should be condu cted before the blood draw. See Section 6 for more information on study procedures and 
assessments. a Subjects who withdraw from the study before the ir Day 28 Visit will be asked to complete Early Termination procedures.  
b The urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test should be performed first. Results should be confirmed negative prior to performing any additional assessments 
and prior to initiation of surgery. A subject who fails the drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects with a positi ve drug screen 
who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test (eg, amphetamine an d dextroamphetamine for attention -
deficit/hyperactivity disorder , benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder ) may be eligible for participation in the study. Subjects taking medical marijuana are not 
allowed to participate in the study.  
c Includes height, weight,  and body mass index calculation.  d Only if subject withdraws prior to 72  hours. e If early neurologic and cardiac signs and symptoms of  LAST are observed, unscheduled vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG, and blood sample collection for 
PK must be performed. f Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior  to study drug administration.  
Subject does not need to be present for randomization to occur.  g Hematology only. h The length of the surgical incision should be recorded.  i NRS-R should be assessed while the subject is recumbent or lying supine. Measurements should be obtained after the subject is in the resting position for at 
least 5 minutes. j If a subject requires rescue medication before the 1 -hour pain intensity assessments, then an unscheduled NRS -R pain score followed by an NRS -A pain score 
must be obtained before administering the first dose of rescue medication. These do not replace the 1-hour NRS-R and NRS-A assessments. k For NRS-A assessments, subjects should be recumbent or lying supine and instructed to sit up. M easurements should be obtained as soon as the subject has sat 
up from the resting position. l Subjects will complete a dail y diary from 72 hours through Day 28 to record if they take any opioid medication.  Subject diary results will be reviewed at each 
site visit. m This study instrument assesses a subject’s potential readiness to be discharged and should be repeated at all sc heduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to 
decide on whether or not to disc harge a subject from the study.  
n At the Screening Visit, ensure subject is not taking any prohibited medications. Record all medications taken from the time t he subject signs the Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) through Day 28.  o Adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signs the ICF through Day 28.

Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 22 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background Information  and Study Rationale 
Up to 70% of patients have moderate to severe pain after surgery, and the most severe pain 
occurs within the first 72 hours (Lynch, 1997;  Svensson, 2000;  Apfelbaum, 2003;  Gan, 2014;  
Misiolek, 2014;  Singla, 2014;  Meissner, 2015). Administering a local an esthetic (eg, 
bupivacaine, ropivacaine , or levobupivacaine) is a relatively simple and safe means of providing 
postoperative pain relief. A major limitation of current local anesthetics is their short duration of 
effect (6 to 12 hours following surgery) (Kehlet, 2011). Consequently, many patients are given 
opioids for pain management . The requirement for opioids postopera tively is a serious 
manifestation of ineffective pain relief. E xposure to opioids can lead to opioid-related adverse 
events (ORAEs) resulting in worse patient outcomes and increased hospital costs  (Coley, 2002;  
Wheeler, 2002;  Stephens, 2003;  Cashman, 2004;  Shirakami, 2005;  Jarzyna, 2011;  
Ramachandran, 2011 ;  Chan, 2013;  Kessler, 2013;  Oderda, 2013;  Lee, 2015;  Lee, 2016). 
Furthermore, transition from acute opioid use to chronic use can occur quickly. A recent review 
of a random sample of records from patients who had at least 1 opioid prescription between 2006 
and 2015 showed that the probability of chronic opioid use begins to increase after the third day 
supplied and rises rapidly thereafter (Shah, 2017). Reduced exposure to opioids and better pain 
management is associated with improved patient outcomes and reduce d risk for the development 
of persistent pain and consequent opioid abuse (Barnett, 2017). Therefore, there is a medical 
need for clinical alternatives to prescription opioids to manage ambulatory nonmali gnant pain. 
The development of an extended -release local anesthetic applicable for a broad range of 
surgeries that could significantly reduce both pain and opioid use after surgery and can be easily 
administered with a favorable safety profile would addres s an important public health need.  
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Heron) is developing HTX -011 for local administration  into the 
surgical site to reduce postoperative pain and the need for opioid analgesics  through 72 hours. 
HTX-011 is an extended-release, fixed-ratio combination product that contains 2 active 
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), bupivacaine as the main or disease -active ingredient and 
low-dose meloxicam to enhance the effectiveness of bupivacaine, incorporated in a proprietary 
bioerodible polymer  (termed Biochronomer®). When HTX-011 is administered, the polymer 
undergoes controlled hydrolysis in the tissue resulting in the extended release of bupivacaine and 
meloxicam over 3 days. Bupivacaine HCl is an amide -type, long-acting, immediate-release, local 
anesthetic and meloxicam  is a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug (NSAID). Both have been 
approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in many countries 
outside the US and have a long history of clinical use. Bupivacaine is available as a solution for 
injection and is approved for surgical anesthesia and for acute pain management (nerve block) in 
adults and children (MARCAINE, SENSORCAINE®, and VIVACAINETM). Meloxicam is 
available as a tablet for oral use and approved for short -term symptomatic treatment of 
exacerbations of osteoarthrosis and long -term symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis or  
ankylosing spondylitis in adults. The extended release is achieved using a proprietary vehicle 
formulation consisting of the novel tri[ethylene glycol] -based poly[orthoester] polymer (AP135) 
in combination with different excipients approved for human use (dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol 
triacetate [triacetin], and maleic acid).  
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 23 This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active-controlled, multicenter 
study in subjects undergoing unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy to evaluate the anal gesic 
efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of HTX -011 administered via local administration 
into the surgical site. 
1.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups  
Herniorrhaphy is an accepted model of postoperative pain. Herniorrhaphy produces generally 
reliable and persistent pain symptoms for a period typically lasting over 72 hours from the 
surgery, which allows for analysis of acute analgesia o ver an extended period of time.  
The study will compare HTX -011 via local administration in to the surgical site with 2 controls: a 
saline placebo control and an active control, bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine . 
The study will employ a randomized and double -blind design to minimize potential bias in 
subject selection as well as efficacy and safety assessments. The site’s pharmacy staff and 
surgical staff will not be blinded to the treatment assignments because HTX -011 is a colored and 
viscous liquid whereas b upivacaine HCl and saline placebo are not, and the volume of study drug 
to be administered varies by treatment group. However, subjects will not be aware of the study 
drug they are receiving, and once surgery is complete and the subject is transferred to t he 
postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the Investigator and all staff involved in efficacy and safety 
assessments will be blinded to treatment assignments until after database lock.  
One dose level of HTX-011 will be evaluated in this study , 300 mg/9 mg 
(bupivacaine/meloxicam doses) administered via instillation . The dose and administration 
technique were selected based on a previous Phase 2 dose -finding study in herniorrhaphy 
(Study 202). In Study 202, HTX-011 doses ranging from 200 mg/6 mg to 400 mg/12 mg via 
different local administration techniques (injection , instillation, or a combination of the 
2 techniques) were evaluated. All doses  were determined to be effective at producing 
postoperative analgesia through 72 hours . The 300 mg/9 mg dose given by local administration 
via instillation was noted to have similar efficacy to the highest dose tested, 400  mg/12 mg, 
while demonstrating a good safety profile and improved PK profile  (ie, lower systemic 
exposure). Based on these findings, 300  mg/9 mg administered via instillation was selected for 
this Phase 3 study. 
The primary endpoint for this study, mean area under the curve (AUC) of the Numeric Rating 
Scale of pain intensity scores with activity (NRS -A) through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) for HTX-011 
compared with saline placebo , was selected based on FDA and Committee for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use  (CHMP) guidances as well as regulatory precedent. D raft FDA 
Guidance for Industry on Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products  
(February 2014) states that “pain intensity is the fundamental measure that defines the e fficacy of 
an analgesic drug.” In addition, the FDA agreed to a primary endpoint of AUC of the NRS pain 
intensity scores over the first 24-hour period in a bony model (bunionectomy) for EXPAREL® 
(EXPAREL USPI, 2016 ). The timepoint of 72  hours selected for this study is considered 
clinically relevant for patients a s literature shows that the most severe postoperative pain occurs 
within the first 72 hours after surgery (Lynch 1997;  Svensson 2000;  Apfelbaum 2003;  Gan 
2014;  Misiolek 2014;  Singla 2014;  Meissner 2015). NRS-A was selected for the primary 
endpoint because activity is known to be a more sensitive measure of pain control  (Breivik, 
2008), and the prescribed activity reflects a simple daily activity for patients ( sitting up from a 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 24 resting position). The primary comparator is saline placebo, as recommended in the Fe bruary 
2014 FDA draft Guidance for Industry on Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and 
Biological Products  and the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP’s) Note for 
Guidance on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products For Treatment of Nociceptive Pain  
(Doc. Ref. CPMP/EWP/612/00 ). 
Bupivacaine HCl is included as an active comparator. Bupivacaine HCl is t he widely accepted 
standard for local analgesia. Bupivacaine is the disease -active ingredient in the HTX -011 
fixed-ratio combination product with low -dose meloxicam included to enhance the effectiveness 
of bupivacaine. Discussions with experts confirmed th at bupivacaine doses commonly used for 
herniorrhaphy range from approximately 20 to 30 mL of 0.25% solution delivered into the 
wound. The dose of bupivacaine solution selected for this Phase 3 study, 75 mg (30 mL of 0.25% 
solution), reflects the maximum do se and maximum concentration that is commonly used and 
allows for appropriate comparisons within the study. This dose is within the range of dosing 
provided in bupivacain e labeling (MARCAINE USPI, 2011 ;  MARCAIN SmPC, 2016 ) and is 
further supported by published literature with active comparators (Crompton, 2016;  Sinha, 
2016). All subjects with inadequately controlled pain will have access to prespecified rescue 
medication, including both non -opioid (acetaminophen /paracetamol) and opioid (morphine 
and/or oxycodone) options.  
The study includes 4 prespecified key secondary endpoint s with a strict statistical hypothesis 
testing hierarchy to preserve the study -wise alpha level at 5% . Given the importance of 
comparison to the bupivacaine active control arm  in order to satisfy the Combination Rule,  
21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 300.50 Fixed-Combination Prescription Drugs for 
Humans, the first key secondary endpoint will evaluate  the mean AUC0-72 of the NRS-A pain 
intensity scores compared with an active control , bupivacaine HCl.  The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th key 
secondary endpoints will evaluate  opioid consumption through 72 hours  compared with saline 
placebo, proportion of subjects who are opioid -free through 72 hours compared with bupivacaine 
HCl, and opioid consumption through 72 hours  compared with bupivacaine HCl, respectively . 
Given the concern for misuse and abuse of opioids, a reduction in opioid load and an increase in 
the number of subjects  who are opioid free are  considered clinically meaningful endpoint s and 
are in alignment with t he February 2014 FDA draft Guidance for Industry on Analgesic 
Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products . Opioid sparing endpoints were also 
included in recently approved labels for EXPAREL, OFIRMEV®, and CALDOLOR®, and 
NAROPIN®. 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
As of 23 March 2017, 665 subjects have been exposed to 1 of the 3 different formulations of 
HTX-011 in 6 clinical studies. This includes 2 Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers 
(subcutaneous study drug administration [Studies  02 and 102]) and 4  Phase 2 local 
administration studies (bunionectomy [Studies 201 and 208], herniorrhaphy [Study 202], and 
abdominoplasty [Study 203]) . A total of 400 subjects received a single dose of the HTX-011 
formulation for Phase 3. Study drug was given via subcutaneous injection or via local 
administration into the surgical site (injection, instillation, a combination of injection and 
instillation, or injection using a Mayo block)  at doses ranging from 30 mg/0.9 mg to 
600 mg/18 mg (bupivacaine/meloxicam  doses). 
Protocol No: HTX -011-302 Version 3   Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential  25 Preliminary results from Phase 2 demonstrated that HTX -011 is generally well tolerated. In the 
Phase 2 studies, the majority of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or 
moderate in severity and resolved without sequelae. The 2 most common TEAEs were nausea 
and constipation.  
 
 
 
 
  
2 SARs were reported in subjects who received the Phase 3 HTX -011 f ormulation. One  SAR of 
non-healing postoperative wound was reported in a subject who received  200 mg/6  mg in the 
bunionectomy study (Study 208), and 1 SAR of wound dehiscence was reported in a subject who 
received 300 mg/9 mg in the abdominoplasty study (Study 203) . 
An identified risk for HTX -011 is incision site erythema, which was observed primarily in 
bunionectomy. Most events were self -limiting, mild or moderate in severity, and resolved 
without intervention or sequelae.  
Potential risks for bupivacain e include dose -related cardiovascular (CV) and central nervous 
system toxicity (MARCAINE USPI, 20 11;  MARCAIN SmPC, 2016 ). Close attention should be 
given to conditions that may represent reported toxicities associated with bupivacaine including, 
but not limited to, perioral tingling, metal lic taste, visual and auditory disturbances, muscle 
twitching, seizure, acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia (heart rate <50 beats per minute 
with symptoms), hypotension (systolic blood pressure <90  mmHg or symptomatic decrease from 
baseline), low ox ygen saturation (≤90% for ≥1  minute), and cardiac arrest . 
Potential risks for meloxicam include CV adverse reactions , gastrointestinal bleeding , and liver 
tests elevations  (MOBIC SmPC, 2015 ;  MOBIC USPI, 2016 ). NSAIDs may cause an increased 
risk of serious CV thrombotic events , myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal, and 
this risk may increase with duration of use. Patients with CV disease or risk factors for CV 
disease may be at greater risk. NSAIDs may also cause an increased risk of serious 
gastrointestinal AE s including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, 
which can be fatal. Elderly patients are at greater risk for serious gastrointestinal events. 
Borderline elevations of 1  or more liver tests may occur in patients taking NSAIDs , including 
meloxicam, which may worsen. It is unclear how applicable these potential risks are for 
meloxicam when given as single dose via local administration (a novel administration method 
for meloxicam) for postoperative pain as part of a fixed -ratio c ombination (eg, HTX -011).  Any 
subject in this study with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an 
abnormal liver function test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development 
of a more severe hepatic reaction.  
Use of HTX -011 in subjects with hypersensitivity to bupivacaine, meloxicam, or any of the 
components of HTX -011 is contraindicated.  
The analgesic efficacy of HTX -011 has been evaluated in Phase 2. In a Phase 2 study in subjects 
undergoing unilateral open inguinal herniorrhaphy , single -dose administration of the Phase 3 
HTX -011 formulation at dos es of 200 mg/ 6 mg to 400  mg/12  mg resulted in a significant 
reduction in mean AUC of pain intensity scores through 72 hours compared with saline placebo.  
Similar efficacy results were observed in a second  Phase  2 study in subjects undergoing 

Protocol No: HTX -011-302 Version 3   Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential  26 unilateral bunionectomy, where single -dose administration of the current HTX -011 formulation 
ranging from 60 mg /1.8 mg  to 200 mg/6  mg also significantly decreased the mean AUC of  pain 
intensity scores through 72 hours.  HTX -011 was also associated with decreased total opioid 
consumption, and resulted i n more subjects who were opioid -free and a longer time to first 
opioid use compared with saline placebo .

3.1. Description of the Study Design 
3.1.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, saline placebo - and active-controlled, multicenter 
study to evaluate the analgesic efficacy, safety, and PK  of HTX-011 administered via local 
administration into the surgical site in subjects undergoing unilateral open inguinal 
herniorrhaphy. 
All subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to surgery . Subjects who meet the Screening 
eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be done up to 1 business day prior to 
the day of surgery. On the day of surgery (Day  1), subjects who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria will undergo inguinal herniorrhaphy  under general anesthesi a. Spinal, epidural, or 
regional anesthesia is not allowed. During surgery, the use of intravenous (IV) fentanyl up to 
4 μg/kg will be permitted for intraoperative pain control . Just prior to the end of the surgery , all 
subjects will receive an additional 50 g IV fentanyl in order to decrease the inherent variability 
in pain control on postoperative pain perception . As an example, the maximum total amount of 
fentanyl used during surgery for a 70 kg subject should not exceed 330  µg (4 μg/kg × 70 kg = 
280 μg for intraoperative pain control + 50 μg at the end of the case = 330  μg total). 
Intraoperative administration of other opioids  or other analgesics, local anesthetics, or 
anti-inflammatory agents (except as specified by the protocol) is prohibited, unless needed to 
treat an adverse event (AE) that occurs after signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF) , for 
pretreatment prior to a needle placement , or to decrease venous irritation (eg, caused by 
propofol, in which case no more than a single ad ministration of lidocaine 1 % 20 mg IV may be 
administered). 
Near the completion of surgery  and after irrigation and suction have been completed , a single 
dose of study drug (HTX -011, saline placebo, or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine) will be 
given intraoperatively via local administration into the surgical site, as described in Section 5.5. 
Following surgery and immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the 
PACU. Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for a minimum of 72  hours after the 
start of study drug administration to undergo postoperative assessments. After the 72 -hour 
assessments have been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subjects will return to the study 
site on Days 10 and 28 to complete follow -up assessments. 
3.1.2. Treatment Groups 
Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 3 treatment groups in a 
2:2:1 ratio: 
 HTX-011, 300 mg/9 mg ( bupivacaine/meloxicam doses), 10.3 mL, via instillation 
into the surgical site ( 160 subjects) 
 Bupivacaine HCl without epineph rine 0.25%, 75 mg (30 mL), via injection into the 
surgical site (160 subjects)

Confidential 29  Saline placebo, 10.3 mL, via instillation into the surgical site ( 80 subjects) 
3.1.3. Postoperative Rescue Medications  
Subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for pain control, as needed , during 
the 72-hour postoperative observation period. Rescue medication should not be given for pain 
prophylaxis, but only for treating postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose 
of rescue medication, if the s ubject has not already had at least 1 postoperative pain score 
assessed, then a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score at rest (NRS-R) followed by a Numeric 
Rating Scale score with activity ( NRS-A) pain score must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication wil l consist of oral (PO) immediate -release oxycodone (no more 
than 10 mg within a 4-hour period as needed), IV morphine (no more than 10 mg within a 2-hour 
period as needed), and/or oral acetaminophen or oral paracetamol (no more than 1 gram 
[1000 mg] in a 6-hour window). For subjects administered any acetaminophen /paracetamol-
containing product, the total combined daily dose must not exceed 4 grams (4000 mg) as severe 
liver damage may occur . No other analgesic agents, including NSAIDs , are permitted during the 
72-hour postoperative observation period. 
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue 
medication as above to treat postoperative pain until discharge.  
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours, oral acetaminophen/paracetamol 
(no more than 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain.  
If a subject received 10  mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject 
should be provided with a prescription for oxycodone (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed). See 
Appendix G for instructions on postoperative pain management for subjects medically ready for  
discharge. 
Subjects will complete a daily diary to record if they tak e an opioid medication between 72 hours 
and Day 28. 
3.1.4. Postoperative Assessments  
Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity scores using NRS-R and NRS-A, use of opioid 
medication, discharge readiness  as assessed by the Modified Postanaesthetic Discharge Scoring 
System (MPADSS), and Patient Global Assessment  (PGA) of pain control. 
Safety assessments will include AE recording, local anesthetic systemic t oxicity (LAST) 
assessments, physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs), hematology and 
serum chemistry, and wound healing assessment s. 
PK assessments will include the collection of blood samples for bupivacaine and meloxicam PK 
analysis. See Section 7.2.2 for instructions regarding unscheduled PK blood sample collection 
for signs and symptoms associated with potential  LAST. 
See Section 6 for more information on the study procedures and assessments. For the timing of 
procedures and assessments, see  Section 7 and the Schedule of Events table.

for diagnostic procedures (eg, colonoscopy).  
21. Has a body mass index (BMI) >39 kg/m2. 
4.2. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may be 
done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery. Subjects will be random ized using a 
centralized computer -generated blocked randomization algorithm created by an interactive 
response technology (IRT) provider . All randomization information will be kept in a secure 
location accessible only by the randomization personnel, the as signed Pharmacist(s) and his/her 
verifier, and the unblinded clinical monitor. No subject may receive study drug prior to 
randomization.  
4.2.1.  Procedures for Handling Randomized Subjects  Who Do Not Meet the Study 
Eligibility Criteria  
Subjects who fail to meet th e eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, receive 
study drug . 
Subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria and are randomized but who do not meet the 
eligibility criteria on Day  1 will be withdrawn from the study without receiving  study drug. In 
the event a subject does not meet the eligibility criteria , but is randomized and receives study 
drug, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor immediately . The Sponsor ’s Medical Monitor 
and the Investigator will discuss whether to allow the subject to continue on study . 
4.3. Blinding  
The study will use a  double -blind design  to minimize potential bias in subject selection as well as 
efficacy and safety assessments . The site’s pharmacy and surgical staff will not be blinded to the 
treatmen t assignments b ecause HTX -011 is a colored and viscous liquid whereas  bupivacaine 
HCl and saline placebo  are not , and the volume of study drug to be administered varies by

Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 35 treatment group. However, subjects will not be aware of the study drug they are receiving, and 
once surgery is completed and the subject is transferred to the PACU, the Investigator and all site 
staff involved in safety and efficacy assessments will be blinded to the treatment assi gnment 
until after database lock . The Sponsor’s study team will also be blinded to the treatment 
assignments with the exception of the clinical trial material (CTM) and clinical observer staff. 
4.3.1. Breaking the Blind  
The study blind should not be broken except  in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the subject requires knowledge of the study drug he/she received . An attempt 
should be made to contact the Sponsor before breaking the blind. If the Sponsor cannot be 
reached and the blind is broke n by the Investigator, the reason for unblinding must be 
documented and the Sponsor must be contacted  within 24 hours. 
The Sponsor retains the right to break the treatment code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities . 
All circumstances leading to the premature unblinding must be clearly documented.  
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
4.4.1. Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment . 
A subject may also be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor at any time if 
either determines that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue partici pation. 
Possible reasons for early withdrawal include the following:  
 Adverse event 
 Consent withdrawal 
 Death 
 Lost to follow up 
 Investigator’s decision  
 Sponsor’s decision  
 Ineligible at Day 1 
The date and the primary reason for early withdrawal will be recorded on the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). At the time of withdrawal from the study, every attempt should be made to 
complete the Early Termination  Visit assessments (see Section 7.4). 
4.4.2. Subject Replacement 
Randomized subjects who withdraw fr om study will not be replaced. To account for withdrawal 
of subjects who ineligible at Day 1 or are otherwise randomized but not dosed , enrollment will 
continue until at least 400 subjects have been randomized and dosed.

Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential  36 5. STUDY TREATMENT  
All subjects will receive a single dose of study drug intraoperatively while undergoing a 
herniorrhaphy . Study drug is defined as HTX -011 (investigational product ), saline placebo  
(control) , or bupivacaine HCl without epinephrine (active control) . 
HTX -011, saline placebo, and bupivacaine HCl  will be supplied by the Sponsor . 
5.1. Description of Investigational Product  
HTX -011 is a slightly yellow , viscous , semi -solid gel liquid . HTX -011 is supplied in 10 mL or 
20 mL clear glass vials . The vials serve only as a closed container for the drug product . For 
administration of study drug, the formulation in the vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile 
syringes . 
5.2. Manufacturing, Packaging , and Labeling  
HTX -011 will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices . 
Study drug will be packaged and labeled  by the Sponsor or designee  and will be packed and 
dispatched to comply with shipping and storage conditions . Study drug  labeling will comply with 
all applicable national  and local laws and regulations . 
5.3. Storage  
At the study site, HTX -011 should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 20 to 25°C 
(with excursions permitted from 15 to 30°C).  The room  should be locked with restricted access. 
A temperature log must  be maintained to monitor the room’s  temperature.  
Saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl will be stored as per the prescribing information.  
5.4. Preparation  
Study drug will be prepared at the study site . HTX -011 and saline placebo will be prepared in a 
group of syringes without a needle. Bupivacaine HCl will be prepared in a group of syringes 
with a needle.  Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on study drug preparation.  
5.5. Study Drug Administration  
Study drug will be given  via local administration into the surgical wound prior to wound closure , 
after irrigation and suction of each layer  are complete . “Infiltration” is a regulatory term for 
product labels to describe local administration via instillation or injection.  
5.5.1.  Instillation : HTX -011 and Saline Placebo  
HTX -011 and saline placebo will be administered via instillation  using a Luer-lock applicator 
supplied by the Sponsor . Following irrigation and suction of each fascial l ayer, study drug will 
be administere d evenly so that all tissues receive adequate coverage at both the level below and 
the level above the fascia . Note that the shallow subdermal layer is to be avoided, and that all 
study drug should be utilized (ie, there  should be no residual study drug left). Thereafter, skin

Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential  37 closure will commence to complete the surgical procedure  (ie, there should be no betadine wash 
until after skin closure at the end of the case) . 
5.5.2.  Injection : Bupivacaine HCl  
Bupivacaine HCl will be administered via injection into the surgical site. Approximately 
one-third of study drug will be placed into the upper third of subcutaneous tissue just above the 
level of the fascia, approximately one -third will be placed immediate ly underneath the 
aponeurosis of the external oblique above the inguinal canal (taking care to avoid the nerves), 
and the remaining one -third will be placed into the canal itself . Thereafter, skin closure will 
commence to complete the surgical procedure  (ie, there should be no betadine wash until after 
skin closure at the end of the case) . 
5.6. Study Drug Compliance  
All study drug must be administered in accordance with the treatment assignment . Because study 
drug is being administered as a component of the surg ical procedure, a lack of treatment 
compliance is not expected . 
5.7. Study Drug Accountability  
The study drug s provided for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol . In 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , Investigators are requir ed to maintain accurate 
and up -to-date records of all study drug to permit reconciliation . The Investigator or designee 
must maintain adequate records of distribution, including  the date received, number and units 
received, lot numbers , dispensing, and return or destruction of all study drug (ie, accountability 
or dispen sing logs).  
All study drug records must be readily available for inspection by the site ’s unblinded clinical 
monitor and/or auditor . No study drug can be returned to the S ponsor or designee or disposed of 
at the study site until the unblinded clinical monitor has verified the accuracy of the study drug 
records at the study site . All returns, disposal , or destruction must be approved by the Sponsor in 
writing.

Confidential 38 6. STUDY PROCEDUR ES AND ASSESSMENTS  
The following sections describe the study procedures and assessments that will be performed 
during the study. See Section 7 and the Schedule of Events table. 
6.1. Medical History and Demographics 
6.1.1. Medical History 
A complete medical history will be obtained before randomization to ensure subjects qualify for 
the study. Medical history will be obtained through subject interview. A review of the subject’s 
medical records from their primary care physician is recommended. Data collected will include 
medical and surgical history.  
6.1.2. Demographics 
Demographic information collected will include age, sex, race, and ethnici ty, where acceptable 
by local authorities . 
6.2. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications taken by subjects between signing the ICF and Day 28 will be recorded in the 
subject’s eCRF. The dosing regimen of “prn” should not be recorded on the eCRF . 
During the 72-hour postoperative period, t he name, dose, and route, as well as the start date and 
time, of concomitant medications must be recorded. Medications include prescription or 
over-the-counter medications (including herbal products and vitamins).  For subjects entering on 
a stable dose of permitted medication, any change in dose should also be recorded . Note: All 
medications received during this period must have a start time recorded except for IV fluids and 
oxygen used during surgery, which do not need  to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE.  
After the 72-hour period until the Day 28 Visit, at least the start date of each concomitant  
medication should be recorded.  
6.2.1. Allowed Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the Investigator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the Investigator’s in keeping with the standard of medical care.  
Antiemetic medications may be given to treat nausea and/or vomiting, but should not be 
administered prophylactically  (ie, as a routine preventative in the absence of signs or symptoms 
of nausea or vomiting).  
During surgery, the use of IV fentanyl up to 4 μg/kg is permitted  for intraoperative pain control . 
As in the predicate cohorts from the Phase 2 herniorrhaphy study , to decrease the inherent 
variability in pain control  on postoperative pain perception , all subjects will receive 50 g IV 
fentanyl just prior to the end of the surgery.  As the prescribing information for fentanyl citrate  
(Fentanyl Citrate USPI, 2012 ) specifies that for intraoperative use a “moderate dose”  of 2 to 
20 μg/kg IV is necessary in order to allow the anesthesiologist to respond to any signal that the 
surgical stress is increasing or anesthesia lightening, this dose was chosen to be in the lowermost

Confidential 39 portion of that range and therefore not interfere  with assessment of postoperative opioid load . As 
clinically appropriate, the minimum possible fentanyl dose should be used.  
See Section 3.1.3 for information on rescue medications permitted.  
See Appendix G for information on postoperative pain management for subjects who are 
medically ready for discharge. 
6.2.2. Prohibited Medications  
6.2.2.1. Medications Prohibited Prior to Surgery  
Refer to exclusion criteria  5 through 11 and 17 for medications that are prohibited prior to the 
scheduled surgery (Section 4.1.2). 
6.2.2.2. Medications Prohibited During Surgery  
Spinal, epidural, or regional anesthesi a is not permitted. 
Intraoperative administration of opioids  or any other analgesics  (including ketamine) , local 
anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents except as specified by the protocol (ie, HTX -011, 
bupivacaine HCl, and fentanyl) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE that occurs after 
signing the ICF, for pretreatment prior to a needle placement , or to decrease venous irritation (eg, 
caused by propofol, in which case no more than a single a dministration of lidocaine 1% 20 mg 
IV may be administered) . 
6.2.2.3. Medications Prohibited From Time 0 Through 72 Hours  
With the exception of rescue medications specified in Section 3.1.3, no other analgesic agents, 
including NSAIDs, are permitted during the 72-hour postoperative observation period.  
6.3. Efficacy Assessments  
6.3.1. Pain Intensity Assessment 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints after surgery . 
Subjects will receive training by the site on how to provide pain intensity assessments.  
Pain intensity scores will be assessed using a n 11-point NRS (0–10) where 0 represents “no 
pain” and 10 represents “worst pain imaginable” (Breivik 2008). NRS scores will be recorded 
first at rest (NRS-R) and then with activity (NRS-A). 
For NRS-R assessments, subjects should be recumbent or lying supine. Measurements should be 
obtained after the subject is in the resting position for at least 5 minutes.  
For NRS-A assessments, subjects should be recumbent or lying supine and instructed to sit up. 
Measurements should be obtained as soon as the subject has sat up from the resting position. 
If a subject withdraws from the study before 72 hours, NRS-R and NRS-A pain intensity scores 
will be recorded at the time of withdrawal. See Appendix C.

6.3.2.1. Opioid Rescue Medication Through 72 Hours  
The name, dose, and route as well as the date and time of administration of any opioid rescue 
medication must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF  from Time 0 through 72 hours . For more 
information on opioid rescue medications permitted, see  Section 3.1.3. 
6.3.2.2. Subject Daily Diary of Opioid Use From 72 Hours Through Day 28  
Subjects will be provided a daily diary to record if they t ake any opioid medication from 
72 hours through Day 28 (yes or no). 
6.3.3. Discharge Readiness  
Discharge readiness will be assessed using the MPADSS criteria  (Chung, 1995). See 
Appendix E. 
Note: This study instrument assesses a subject’s potenti al readiness to be discharged  and should 
be repeated at all scheduled timepoints . It is not meant to be used to decide on whether or n ot to 
discharge a subject from the study. Subjects are required to remain in the hospital /research 
facility for 72 hours. 
6.3.4. Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Pain Control 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate the ir pain control over the preceding 24 hours using a 4-point 
PGA scale where 0  represents “poor” and 3 represents “excellent” (Rothman, 2009). See 
Appendix D for the PGA scale. 
6.4. Safety Assessments  
6.4.1. Adverse Events 
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day 28. See Section 8 for details. 
6.4.2. Local Anesthetic Systemic Toxicity Assessment  
A LAST assessment questionnaire is provided  (see Appendix H) to monitor for early neurologic 
and cardiac signs and symptoms of  LAST (Vasques, 2015). 
Subjects should be assessed with this questionnaire on a regular basis to identify early stages of 
toxicity to determine whether treatment should be initiat ed. If a subject has signs or symptoms 
that may be attributed to LAST, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECG, and blood sample 
collection for PK must be performed.  If symptoms are present at a timepoint when 1 of these 
assessments is not scheduled, an unscheduled assessment must be performed.  
6.4.3. Physical Examinations 
Scheduled physical examinations will include a n evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, and 
musculoskeletal systems .

conducted. 
Unscheduled physical examinations may also be performed (the extent of which is  to be 
determined by the Investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by a change in the 
subject’s medical history or condition.  
6.4.4. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure , resting heart rate, respiration rate, 
and body temperature. Subjects should be in a supine position (includes sitting in a recliner 
chair) for at least 5  minutes before taking vital signs . Clinically significant post -treatment vital 
sign results should be recorded as AEs.  
6.4.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
Screening and post-treatment ECGs will be obtained for all subjects. Standard digital 12 -lead 
ECGs will be performed in triplicate. Subjects should be in the supine position (includes sitting 
in a recliner chair) for at least 5  minutes before each initial ECG recording. The mean of the 
3 ECGs will be used as the baseline result.  
The ECG tracings will be reviewed by a central reader.  Refer to the Cardiac Safety Study 
Manual for instructions on colle cting and transmitting results.  
6.4.6. Wound Healing Assessment  
Surgical wound healing will be evaluated by the Investigator or other medically qualified clinical 
site personnel; every attempt should be made by the site to use the same assessor for individual 
subject assessments . The findings will be graded according to the South ampton Wound Scoring 
System (Bailey, 1992); see Appendix F. 
6.4.7. Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for diagnostic  screening tests and for safety laboratory 
tests (hematology and serum chemistry) . See Table 1 for a list of clinical laboratory tests and 
parameters. Urine samples will be tested by local laboratories. Blood samples will be tested by a 
central laboratory. 
Laboratory results will be reviewed by the Investigator . Any laboratory values outside of the 
normal reference range will be evaluated for clinical si gnificance. Clinically significant findings 
after study drug administration will be recorded as AEs.  
Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed instructions on sample collection , processing, and

This section lists the study procedures and assessments that will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints during the study. See Section 6 for information on study pr ocedures and assessments.  
Unless there is a safety concern, every effort should be made to avoid protocol deviations . For 
pain assessments at timepoints when the subject is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the 
subject. If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not 
Done.” Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) 
should be completed . Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if clinically indicated in 
the opinion of the Investigator . 
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint,  it is recommended that 
they be performed in this  order: 
 NRS-R pain intensity assessment (subjects should be recumbent or lying supine ; 
measurements should be o btained after the subject is in the resting position for at least 
5 minutes) 
 PGA of pain control  assessment 
 Vital signs 
 12-lead ECG 
 NRS-A pain intensity assessment  (subjects should be recumbent or lying sup ine and 
instructed to sit up. M easurements should be obtained as soon as the subject has sat 
up from the resting position ) 
 LAST assessment 
 Blood sample collection  
 Physical examination  
 Wound healing assessment  
7.1. Screening Period 
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study . Screening procedures must be 
performed within 28 days prior to surgery. The Investigator must evaluate the subject’s medical 
history and the results of all Screening assessments to determine study eligibility before the 
subject is randomized. 
Screening procedures and assessments will include the follo wing: 
 Urine drug screen 
 Urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child -bearing potential only)  
 Medical history 
 Demographic recording  
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 44  Physical examination (including weight, height, and BMI calculation ) 
 Vital signs measurements 
 12-lead ECG (in triplicate) 
 Blood sample collection for the hematology and serum chemistry  
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments 
 AE recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF ) 
 Prior and concomitant medication recording (from the time the subject signs the ICF)  
The urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test should be performed first, and the r esults should 
be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments. A subject who fails the 
drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects with a positive drug 
screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive 
drug test (eg, amphetamine and dextroamphetamine for attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder , 
benzodiazepine for anxiety disorder ) may be eligible for participation in the study.  Any other 
screening laboratory test result  that does not meet the eligibility criteria may not be repeated 
without the Sponsor's approval.  
All subjects who meet the Screening eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomization may 
be done up to 1 business day prior to the day of surgery . Subjects do not need to be present for

7.2. Treatment and Postoperative Observation Period 
7.2.1. Day of Surgery (Day  1) 
7.2.1.1. Prior to Surgery 
On Day 1, subjects will be reassessed for study eligibility . This includes a urine drug screen test 
(all subjects) and a urine pregnancy test (female subjects of child -bearing potential only ). Results 
should be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional assessments.  
Subjects who continue to meet the eligibility criteria can continue on study and will be admitted 
to the surgical unit. The following additional study procedures and assessments wi ll be 
performed before surgery:  
 Vital signs measurements 
 Subject training for pain intensity assessments (refresher training)  
 AE recording  
 Prior and concomitant medication assessment 
7.2.1.2. Surgery and Study Drug Administration  
Subjects will undergo an inguinal herniorrhaphy under general anesthesia. Epidural or spinal 
anesthesia is not permitted. Sites should follow intraoperative safety monitoring in accordance 
with ASA Standards for Basic Anesthe tic Monitoring (American Society of Anesthesiologists, 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 45 2015), which is consistent with the European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA) recommendations 
for minimal monitoring during Anaesthesia and Recovery  (for review in 2018) (EBA UEMS, 
2016). The start and stop time of surgery and additional surgical details (including the length of 
the surgical incision ) should be recorded in the eCRF.  
Subjects will be administered study drug un less they experience a clinically significant event 
during surgery (eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject 
medically unstable or complicate their postoperative course. Study drug will be administered via 
local administration into the surgical site at the end of the surgical procedure , but prior to wound 
closure. See Section 5.5 for complete details on  the study drug administration  technique. 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of 
administration will be recorded on a wo rksheet, which will be used in the dictation of the 
surgical notes and will become part of the source document.  Note: The start of study drug 
administration will be considered as Time 0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK assessments . 
Placement of the last suture will be considered the end of surgery.  
Concomitant medications used  during surgery will be recorded  (note that IV fluids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE) . AEs will also be recorded. 
After immediate postope rative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the PACU. 
7.2.2. Postoperative Assessment Period (Up to 72 Hours) 
Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for 72 hours after study drug administration . 
Study procedures and assessments that will be performed are listed below. 
All timepoints are referenced to the start of study drug administration . Actual times will be 
recorded for all events, and any deviation outside the specified ranges must be clearly 
documented in the subject’s study records.  
 NRS-R and NRS-A pain intensity assessments: at 1 hour (±5 min), 2 and 4 hours 
(±15 min), 8 and 12 hours (±30 min), 24 hours (±1 h); 36 and 48 hours (±2 h), 60 and 
72 hours (±4 h) 
 Note: If a subject requires rescue medication before the 1 -hour pain intensity 
assessments, then an unscheduled NRS -R pain score followed by an NRS -A pain 
score must be obtained before administering the first dose of rescue medication. 
These do not replace the 1 -hour NRS-R and NRS-A assessments. 
 PGA of pain control assessment: 24 hours (±1 h), 48 hours (±2 h), and 72 hours 
(±4 h) 
 Vital signs measurements: 30 minutes (±5 min), 1 hour (±5 min), 1.5 hours 
(±10 min), 2 hours (±15 min), 4 hours (±15 min), 8 hours (±30 min), 12 hours 
(±30 min), 18 hours (±30 min), 24 hours (±1 h), 36 hours (±2 h), 48 hours (±2 h),

 AE recording: (Note: the start date and time of all AEs during this timeframe must 
be recorded) 
 Concomitant medication recording : (Note: the start date and time of all 
concomitant medications during this timeframe must be recorded)  
 Use of rescue medication recording: Any time between study drug administration 
and 72 hours (Note: the start date and time of all rescue medications during this 
timeframe must be recorded) 
7.2.3. End of the Postoperative Assessment Period  
After the 72-hour assessments have been completed , the subject may be discharged if medically 
ready. The time of discharge will be recorded.  If a subject is not ready to be discharged due to an 
AE, it should be recorded on the AE eCRF as per  Section 8.3.1. If a subject is ready for 
discharge but is not discharged for any reason other than AE, the reason should be recorded on 
the eCRF. 
Subjects who are not medically ready for discharge at 72 hours may receive the same rescue 
medication as outlined in Section 3.1.3 to treat postoperative pain until discharge.  
For subjects who are medically ready for discharge  at 72 hours, oral acetaminophen/paracetamol 
(no more than 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed) should be recommended for postoperative pain.  
If a subject received 10  mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the subject 
should be provided with a prescription for oxycodone (up to 10 mg PO q4h as needed, #15, no 
substitutions). See Appendix G for instructions on postoperative pain management for subjects 
medically ready for discharg e. 
Subjects will be given a diary to complete daily and record if they take any opioid  medication 
from 72 hours through Day 28.

Confidential  49 8. SAFETY  MONITORING AND REPO RTING  
Investigator s are responsible for the det ection and documentation of events that meet  the 
definition of an AE, SAE, suspected adverse reaction, serious suspected adverse reaction , 
unanticipated adverse device effect , or unanticipated problem , as provided in this protocol . 
Investigators must review the HTX -011 IB so as to be aware of the safety -related events, which 
may be anticipated with its use . Investigators will also be versed in the latest standard of care 
guidelines . 
8.1. Definition  of Safety Parameters  
8.1.1.  Definition of an Ad verse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or di sease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug . Any abnormal laboratory value , 
vital sign result, or ECG finding  deemed clinically significant by the Investigator, rega rdless of 
causal relationship, must be reported as an AE . A clinical diagnosis, rather than the changes in 
laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be recorded (eg, anemia rather than low 
hemoglobin value) . 
Examples of AEs include the following:  
 Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study . 
 Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the conditio n (eg , abnormal physical examination 
finding) . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction . 
 Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, 
unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur) . 
 The following abnormal laboratory results:  
 Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a 
worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to h ave investigational 
product interrupted or discontinued.  
 Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment 
for the lab abnormality . 
Protocol No: HTX -011-302 Version 3   Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential  50  Any laboratory abnormality that required additional monitoring  and follow -up 
visits . 
 Any laboratory abnormality requiring further diagnostic investigation . 
The following examples are not considered AEs:  
 Medical or surgical procedure (eg , endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE . 
 Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen . 
 The disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease  or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a 
greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition . 
 Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to 
occur as a long -acting local anes thetic wears off) . 
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
 Death . 
 A life -threatening AE (ie, prese nted an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.)  
 Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
 A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions . 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be  considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . 
Examples of such medical events include  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of  drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
The following events do not meet the  definition of an SAE: hospitalization for elective treatment 
of a pre -existing condition that does not worsen from baseline , hospitalizations for a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine monitoring of the studied indication not 
assoc iated with any deterioration in condition,  social or convenience admission to a hospital , 
prolongation of a hospitalization for social or convenience reasons not associated with the 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 51 occurrence of an AE , or hospitalization or an emergency room visit that la sts less than 24 hours 
that does not meet the criteria of an important medical or a life -threatening event. 
According to 21 CFR 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse 
effect on health or sa fety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, 
a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to 
the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
8.1.3. Definition of a Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any AE for which there is a reasonable pos sibility that 
the AE was caused by the study drug .  
8.1.4. Definition of a Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
A serious suspected adverse reaction is any suspected adverse reaction that is determined to be 
serious, based on the outcomes of a SAE described in Section 8.1.2. 
8.1.5. Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequ ency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the research 
protocol and informed consent document approved by the Ethic s Committee (EC; 
includes Institutional Review Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics C ommittees [IECs], 
and Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being studied.  
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by the procedures involved in the research).  
 Suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previous ly known or 
recognized. 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2. 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Event s 
8.2.1. Severity of Adverse Events 
The Investigator will assess the s everity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categorie s: 
 Mild: Event is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities . 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 52  Moderate: Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some  interference with 
functioning. 
 Severe: Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment . Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating. 
8.2.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug based on his/her clinical 
judgment. The Investigator’s ass essment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. 
If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should be repo rted. 
All AEs must have their relationship to study agent assessed . In a clinical trial, the study drug 
must always be suspect . The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the 
Investigator’s assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will be asses sed according to the following guidelines : 
 Possibly related: The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study drug and event . Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
 Unlikely related: There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
study drug caused the event, there is no temporal relations hip between the study drug 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established . 
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessment of causa lity for every event before 
entering the information into the eCRF or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available. The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory reporting  requirements. The Investigator may change his or 
her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly in the eCRF or the SAE reporting form, as applicable.  
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up 
8.3.1. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring 
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through Day 28. Note: the AE start time, as well as the date, must be recorded during the 
72-hour postoperative period.  
If an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs in a subject more than 28 days after 
study drug administration  and the Investigator considers the event to be possibly related to the 
study drug, the Investigator needs to report the SAE to the Sponsor as described in Section 8.4.1. 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 53 8.3.2. Follow-Up of Events 
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the I nvestigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contacts . 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or unti l the event is otherwise explained or judged by the Investigator to be 
no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent) . 
The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories:  
 Resolved: The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae . An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions . Examples include stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device im planted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an upper respiratory tract infection.  
 Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, fu nctional limitation, or both . Such sequelae are 
usually limited to SAEs . Examples include hip replacement resulting in foot drop 
(foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in 
paralysis, or emboli formation after a ba cterial infection resulting in a renal infarct 
and loss of renal function.  
 Not resolved: At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the outcome is unknown . 
Examples include headache, low-grade fever, or nausea.  
 Unknown: The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow-up, and the status of the event is unknown.  
 Death 
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves  (ie, when the event no longer meets any of the 
seriousness criteria) , the condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged 
by the Investigator to be no longer clinically significant (unles s the subject is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent) . The Investigator will ensure that follow -up information provided to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both . New or updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section 8.4.1. 
8.4. Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1. Reporting Serious Adverse Event s to the Sponsor 
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE  due to any 
cause that occurs during the course of this study, regardless of relationship to study drug , he/she 
Protocol No: HTX-011-302 Version 3  Heron Therapeutics, Inc . 
Phase 3 herniorrhaphy study for postoperative analgesia (EPOCH  2) 
Confidential 54 must notify the Sponso r by entering the SAE information into the eCRF within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . 
If EDC is not available, the Investigator must complete an SAE reporting form and email it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . The Investigator 
must also enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address: Heron_PV@ubc.com  
In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to th e Sponsor the following eCRF pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible:  
 AE record 
 Medical history 
 Prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following  documents are to be forwarded:  any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
EDC is the primary method for notification of SAE information. In rare circum stances and in the 
absence of email capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy of the SAE 
reporting form sent by overnight mail . Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need 
for the Investigator to complete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined. 
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event . The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received . Follow-up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial rep ort. 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor by reporting any unanticipated adverse device effect 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the effect . 
8.4.2. Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an even t meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem, he/she must notify the Sponsor by completing an Unanticipated Problem Form  and 
emailing it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator  becoming aware of the 
problem. 
Email Address: Heron_PV@ubc.com  
The following information  will be included with unanticipated problem reporting: 
 Protocol identifying information: protocol title , protocol number, and Investigator’s 
name. 
 A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome . 
 An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem.

Confidential 55 It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report unanticipated problems to the Sponsor and their 
EC, as required by local regulations.  
8.4.3. Regulatory Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effects  to the 
Sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.4.1. The Sponsor has a legal 
responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety  of a product under clinical investigation . Prompt notification of SAEs 
by the Investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that serious 
suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing o ccurrence be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects 
are met. 
Investigator letters are prepared according to Sponsor policy and are forwarded to the 
Investigators as necessary . An Investigator lett er is prepared for any suspected adverse reaction 
that is attributable to study drug, serious, and unexpected . The purpose of the Investigator letter 
is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the EC. 
The Sponsor is responsible for informing ECs, Investigators, and regulatory authorities of 
finding that could adverse ly affect the safety of subjects or affect the conduct of the study . 
Events will be reported to regulatory authorities in accordance with expedited and period 
reporting requirements . 
8.4.4. Pregnancy Reporting  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be withdrawn from the study 
immediately. Female subjects who become pregnant within 28  days after receiving study drug 
should also notify the Investigator . The Investigator must attempt to follow the pregnancy to 
term or termination in order to report  on outcome and health status of mother and child.  
The Investigator must notify t he Sponsor of any pregnancy by completing a Pregnancy Form  and 
emailing it to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of  the 
pregnancy. 
Email Address: Heron_PV@ubc.com  
8.5. Safety Oversight  
The internal, blinded Product Safety and  Risk Management Committee will monitor safety data 
on a periodic basis throughout the study  (ie, monthly unless more frequent monitoring is 
necessary due to high enrollment or safety concern) , including regular review of ECG findings, 
AEs, LAST assessments,  and SAEs. 
The stopping criteria, enrollment suspension or study termination for safety issues, are provided

160 subjects in the HTX -011 group, 160 subjects in the bupivacaine H Cl active control group, 
and 80 subjects in the saline placebo control group provide at least 90% power to detect a 
statistically significant difference between the HTX -011 group and each of the control groups for 
each of the primary and key secondary endp oints.  
10.3. Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : All subjects who are randomized and receive study drug will be 
included in the ITT Population . This population will be used as the primary analysis population 
for all efficacy endpoints.  The ran domized treatment assignment will be used for analysis in this 
population.  
Per Protocol Population : All subjects in the ITT Population who do not receive a prohibited 
rescue medication prior to 72 hours  and who have no important  protocol violations prior t o 72 
hours  will be included in the Per Protocol  Population . This population will be used for sensitivity 
analyses on the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
Safety Population : All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population . 
This population will be used for all summaries of safety data . The actual treatment received will 
be used for analysis in this population.

10.4.1.  Disposition  and Demographics  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis popu lation will be summarized. Subject  
disposition, including the number of subjects  screened, rando mized, dosed, completing the 
72-hour postoperative observation period , completing Day 28, and not completing Day 28 by 
reason for withdrawal will be summarized for the ITT Population . Subject  demographics and 
baseline characteristics will also be summarized for the ITT Population and will include age, age 
category, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI.  
10.4.2.  Efficacy Analysis  
10.4.2.1.  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary estimand to address the efficacy objectives is the mean AUC of NRS -A pain 
intensity scores through 72 hours (AUC 0-72) adjusted for use of opioid rescue medication via 
windowed worst observation carried forward ( wWOCF ), comparing the estimated treat ment 
difference between HTX -011 and saline placebo using analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with 
missing data imputed via last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) for interval censored pain 
intensity  scores and worst observation carried forward (WOCF) for right -censored pain intensity 
scores in the ITT Population.  
The primary analysis of AUC 0-72 of the NRS -A pain intensity scores will be carried out using an 
ANOVA model with treatment as  the main effect, comparing HTX -011 with saline placebo at a n 
overall  signifi cance level of 5%. Results will be expressed as mean AUCs and SDs, least -squares 
mean differences (LSMD) and SEs with associated 95% CIs, and p -values.  To account for the 
duration effect of opioid rescue medication, the wWOCF method will be implemented as the 
primary analysis method  for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores.  In this method, pain 
intensity scores observed during the analgesic window (duration of effect) of any opioid rescue 
medication will be replaced with the worst (highest) postdos e nonmissing NRS pain intensity 
score observed prior to the rescue medication window, with the following exception: if the NRS 
pain intensity score for a windowed observation is higher than the worst pre -window score, then 
it will not be replaced . Sensitiv ity analyses for endpoints involving NRS pain intensity scores 
will analyze the data without adjustment for the effect of opioid rescue medications.  
10.4.2.2.  Key Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
Key secondary endpoint s involving AUC of NRS -A will be analyzed similarly t o the methods 
descri bed for the primary endpoint.  
Total opioid consumption through 72 hours will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The 
Shapiro -Wilk test will be used to examin e the assumption of normality. If this test is statistically 
significan t (ie, p ≤0.05) then the assumption of normality is violated and the total postoperative 
opioid consumption during period of interest will be analyzed using Wilcoxon rank sum test. 
Results will be expressed as median (range) and p -values. However, if assumption of n ormality 
holds (ie, Shapiro -Wilk p -value >0.05), then the total postoperative opioid consumption during 
period of interest will be analyzed using an ANOVA model with randomized  treatment as the 
Protocol No: HTX -011-302 Version 3   Heron Therapeutics, Inc .

Confidential  59 main effect. Results will be expressed as means, SDs, and LSMD  and SE with associated 95% 
CI, and p -values.  
The proportion of subjects who are opioid -free through 72 hours will be analyzed using Fisher’s 
exact test. Results will be expressed as the number and percentage of subjects meeting the 
relevant endpoint, diff erences in proportions with 95% CIs, and p -values.  
10.4.2.3.  Study -Wise Type I Error Control  
To account for multiple hypothesis testing on  the primary endpoint and on each of the 4 key 
secondary endpoints, a strict testing hierarchy  will be applied to control study -wise alpha level at 
0.05. If the primary endpoint is statistically significant  (p ≤0.05) , then the first key secondary 
endpoint will be tested. If the first key secondary endpoint is statistically significant, then the 
second key secondary endpoint will be  tested. Sequential testing will continue in this manner 
down the key secondary endpoint list until an endpoint fails to meet statistical significance, after 
which all subsequent key secondary endpoints will be considered exploratory. If the primary 
endpoi nt is not statistically significant, then all key secondary endpoints will be considered 
exploratory.  
  
 
 
 
10.4.2.5.  Handling of Missing Data  
Due to the required 72 -hour inpatient postoperative  observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed  through 72 hours in subjects who 
complete the 72 -hour postoperative observation period , NRS pain intensity scores will be 
imputed via LOCF, in which th e mos t recent postdose value is used for a subsequent missing 
value. For subjects who do not have a postdose value prior to their first missing value, the 
median of the postdose values at the relevant timepoint from subjects with observed data in the 
same randomized treatment group will be used. Predose values will not be carried forward to 
postdose timepoints. In subjects who withdraw from the study prior to 72  hours, missing  NRS 
pain intensity scores  through 72 hours that were to be collected following wi thdrawal will be 
imputed via WOCF, in which the worst (highest) NRS pain intensity score observed prior to 
withdrawal will be used for post -withdrawal values through 72 hours. Analyses that adjust for 
the effect of opioid rescue medication will perform wWO CF following LOCF /WOCF  (ie, 
perform LOCF /WOCF  first, then apply wWOCF ). The number and percentage of missing NRS 
pain intensity scores will be summarized . 
10.4.3.  Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be carried out on the Safety Population.  All safety data will be listed and 
summarized by treatment group .  
AEs that occur between the time the subject signs the ICF and the start of study drug 
administration will be considered pretreatment AEs. AEs that start during or after study drug 
administ ration, or AEs with an onset prior to study drug administration that worsen after study

System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of TEAEs and SAEs will be summar ized and 
presented in descending order of frequency accor ding to the HTX -011 group . AEs leading to 
study withdrawal, if a ny, will be listed separately.  
Associated laboratory parameters such as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology values 
will be grouped and presented together  in summary tables . For each laboratory test, individual 
subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. 
Shift tables will be produced showing the frequency of shifts from Base line to the lowest and to 
the highest on -study value in and out of the normal range as well as by visit. Laboratory 
parameters will also be summarized by visit.  
The change from Baseline to each visit for each of the vital sign variables will be summarized.  
Abnormal vital sign values will be flagged and listed.  Changes from baseline in ECG results will 
be summarized.  
Wound healing assessment results will be summarized at each timepoint.  
10.4.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma bupivacaine and meloxicam concentrations will be determined using validated liquid 
chromatography tandem -mass spectrometry assays . Concentrations will be calculated by 
interpolation from a calibration curve . An estimated C max and T max will be calculated using 
population PK modeling , which will be developed in non-linear mixed effects modeling

Confidential  77 APPENDIX  G. INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSTOPERATIVE PAIN 
MANAGEMENT FOR SUBJECTS MEDICALLY READY 
FOR DISCHARGE  
The following text should be read by the Investigator or designee to the subject at the time of 
discharge:  
You have completed the initial part of the study which required you to stay at the facility. You 
are now being discharged to go home. You will come back here again for check -up visits on 
Day 10 (approximately 1 week from now) and Day 28 (approximately 3½  week s from now) . 
While you are at home, if you experience any pain from your operation, please take up to 2  over-
the-counter extra -strength (500 mg) acetaminophen /paracetamol  tablets (eg, Tylenol, Panadol ) 
every 6  hours as needed. Do not take more than 8  table ts (4000 mg)  in a 24 -hour period. If this 
does not control your pain, please call <<insert name and contact information>> so that we can 
talk about providing you with a prescription for  something stronger, if needed.  
Do not take other acetaminophen /paracet amol -containing products that are available over the 
counter without first checking with your doctor. As an example , cold medicine over the counter 
may contain acetaminophen /paracetamol  and may result in exceeding the daily dose limit of 
acetaminophen /para cetamol  and can cause liver damage . 
NOTE: If a subject required 10 mg or more of oxycodone in the 12 hours prior to discharge, the 
subject should be provided with a prescription for oxycodone up to 10 mg PO q4h, #15, as 
needed. Pharmacists should be instru cted that substitutions for any other opioid -containing 
product are not permitted.

Confidential  78 APPENDIX  H. LOCAL ANESTHETIC SYS TEMIC TOXICITY 
ASSESSMENT  
This Local Anesthetic Systemic T oxicity  (LAST) questionnaire is provided to monitor for early 
neurologic and cardiac signs and symptoms of LAST . Subjects should be assessed with this questionnaire 
at the following timepoints : 30 minutes (±5 min), 1 hour (±5 min), 2 hours (±15 min), 4  hours (±15 min), 
18 hours (±30  min), 24  hours (±1  h), and 72 hours (±4  h) following the star t of study drug administration, 
and at the Early Termination Visit if the subject withdraws before 72 hours.  
If a subject has signs or symptoms that may be attributed to LAST, vital sign measurements, 12 -lead 
ECG, and blood sample collection for PK must be performed . In many cases, those assessments are 
already scheduled within that timepoint and do not need to be repeated (see the shaded  areas in the table 
below). If symptoms a re pre sent at a timepoint when one  of these assessments is not scheduled, an 
unscheduled assessment must be performed.  These unscheduled assessments  are shown by timepoint as 
the checked areas in the following table.

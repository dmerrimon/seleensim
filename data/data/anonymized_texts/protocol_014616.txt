STUDY DESIGN  Study Procedures  
Screening  
Before any study procedures are performed on any subject , informed consent must be 
obtained at an initial Screening Visit (SV1). Subjects  recruited to participate in the study, 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 8 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 and who have pro vided full consent to participate, will be asked to attend a second 
Screening Visit (SV2), having taken their last dose of L -Dopa and any other adjunctive 
PD medication no later than midnight the evening prior to the visit. Their normal morning 
dose of L -Dopa ( without adjunctive PD medication)  will be administered in the clinic 
following confirmation of an “OFF” episode by the Investigator, to ensure that they experience an “ON” response. Eligibility criteria will be assessed  by the Investigator and 
approve d by the EAC prior to  enrollment.  
Subjects  will be asked to return to the clinic the morning of Titration Visit 1 (TV1) for 
the Dose Titration Phase of the study.  
Dose Titration Phase  
Depending on the Investigator's decision, subjects  will be asked to arri ve at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically 
defined "OFF" state with no anti -parkinsonian medication a fter midnight the 
night prior).  
During the Dose Titration Phase of the study, subjects will start with a dose of 10 mg 
APL -130277 and increase in 5 mg increments up to 40 mg and then in 1 0 mg increments 
for the 5 0 mg and 60 mg dose levels  until the subject  reaches a full “ON” state. Once a 
full “ON” state is achieved, dosing will continue for 2 additional visits to a maximum 
dose of 60 mg (i.e., if a subject  experiences the first full “ON” at 1 0 mg, dosing will 
continue up until a dose of 20 mg). 
For those subjects who do not achieve a full "ON" response, titration should continue 
until the maximum tolerated dose of APL -130277 is determined.  
Note:  For subjects who have previously participated in the CTH -300 or CTH -301 study, 
the subject will begin titration at the effective dose used in the respective previous study. 
Similarly dose titration of these subjects will increase in 5 mg increments up to 40 mg 
and then in 10  mg increments for the 50  mg and 60  mg dose levels until the subject 
reaches a full “ON” stat e. Once a full “ON” state is achieved, dosing will continue for 
2 additional visits to a maximum dose of 60 mg (i.e., if a subject  experiences the first full 
“ON” at 35 mg, dosing will continue up until a dose of 50 mg). 
At Titration Visit 1 (TV1), once th e subject's “OFF” state  has been confirm ed by both the 
Investigator and subject,  the subject will be treated with 1 0 mg APL -130277. Subjects  
who tolerate the 1 0 mg APL -130277 will restart their normal PD medications and will be 
asked to return to the clinic the next business day for Titration Visit 2 (TV2), to assess the 
next highest dose (i.e., 1 5 mg) in a manner identical to that of Titration Visit 1 (TV1) . 
Doses of APL -130277 will increase in 5 mg increments up to 4 0 mg and then in 10 mg 
increments for the 50 mg and 60 mg dose levels  until a full “ON” state is achieved , then 
dosing will continue for 2 additional visits  to a maximum dose of 60 mg. This will 
sequentially be 2 0 mg [TV3], 2 5 mg [TV4], 3 0 mg [TV5], 3 5 mg [TV6] , 40 mg [TV7] , 
50 mg [TV8] and 6 0 mg [TV9] . 
For Titration Visit 3 (TV3), Titration Visit 4 (TV4), Titration Visit 5 (TV5), and Titration 
Visit 6 (TV6) subjects should be dosed with the next highest dose of study medication 
within 4 hours of the initial dose, as long as the subject achieves  another “OFF” state that 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 9 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 day. TV3 should be paired with TV4 (2 0 mg and 2 5 mg can be dosed on the same day),  
TV4 should be paired with TV5 (25 mg and 3 0 mg can be dosed on the same day), TV5 
should be paired with TV6 (3 0 mg and 3 5 mg can be dosed on the sa me day) and TV6 
should be paired with TV7 (3 5 mg and 4 0 mg can be dosed on the same day).  
Should the subject be unable to tolerate either  of the two additional dose levels after 
reaching a full “ON” state, in the Investigator’s opinion, due to adverse events commonly 
associated with apomorphine (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, etc.), 
subjects will be randomized to the previous dose . 
Dosing days in the Dose Titration Phase should be scheduled on consecutive business 
days and a maximum of 2 days between visits may be permitted with Medical Monitor approval. All visits in the Dose Titration Phase must be completed within 14 days .  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed at each visit  according to the protocol.  
Three -Way Balanced Rando mized Crossover Assessment Phase  (Period 1, Period 2, 
Period 3)  
Subjects  who successfully complete the Dose Titration Phase of the study , and are 
approved by the Sponsor to proceed to randomization, will  be asked to return to the clinic 
for Period 1 Dosing Visit  1 (P1V1) . This visit will occur between 2 and 7  days after the 
final visit in the Dose Titration Phase of the study. Depending on the Investigator's 
decision, subjects  will be asked to arrive at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medic ations; but before taking their next 
dose of medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically 
defined "OFF" state with no anti -parkinsonian medication after midnight the 
night prior).  
Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to six possible sequences of each of the 
three treatments being studied:  
1. Treatment A: APL -130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration 
Phase, 
2. Treatment B: Matched placebo  APL -130277, 
3. Treatment C: A single 40 0 mg dose of mox ifloxacin.  
Following confirmation by both the Investigator and subject that the subject is in the 
“OFF” state, the subject will be dosed according to the subject's random treatment 
assignment. APL -130277 and placebo APL -130277 will be administered in a dou ble-
blind fashion and moxifloxacin will be administered open -label in a three- way balanced 
crossover. All subjects will be exposed to all three treatments. The six possible treatment sequences are: 1) ABC; 2) ACB; 3) BCA; 4) BAC; 5) CAB; and 6) CBA.  
Subjec ts will return to clinic 3 days after Period 1 and will be dosed for Period 2 with one 
of the other two treatments.  
Subjects will return to clinic 3 days after Period 2 and will be dosed for Period 3 with the 
third and last treatment.

STUDY ENDPOINTS  Primary Endpoint  
1. Time -matched change from baseline in QTc, placebo -adjusted and corrected for 
HR based on the Fridericia correction method (QTcF) method (∆∆QTcF) . Assay 
sensitivity will be demonstrated by inclusion of a positive control, moxifloxacin.  
Secondary Endpoints  
1. Pharmacokinetics of apomorphine and apomorphine metabolites . 
2. Evaluation of safety and tolerability of APL -130277 as measured by adverse 
events , physical examination including assessment of oropharyngeal  adverse 
events , 12-lead ECGs, vital signs including o rthostatic hypotension (OH), 
clinical laboratory tests, and C -SSRS  assessments . 
3. ECG  assessments including QTc with Bazett correction (QTcB), heart rate, PR 
interval, QRS interval, uncorrected QT interval, ECG morphology and presence 
of cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia or Torsade de 
Pointes  (TdP) . 
4. MDS -UPDRS Part III change from pre -dose to 30, 60, 90 minutes af ter dosing 
during the titration phase  at the highest tolerated APL -130277 dose level and the 
lowest APL -130277 dose resulting in a full “ON” . 
5. Time to “ON” during Titration Phase  at the highest tolerated APL -130277 dose 
level and the lowest APL -130277 dose resulting in a full “ON”. 
6. Duration of “ON” during Titration Phase at the highest tolerated APL --130277 
dose level and the lowest APL -130277 dose resulting in a full “ON”.  
 
STATISTICAL METHODS SUMMARY  All subject s who receive at least one dose of study med icine `will be included in the 
safety analysis set. The PK analysis set includes all subject s with at least one PK 
evaluation. The efficacy analysis set includes subject s who have efficacy assessments at 
the lowest dose level resulting in a full “ON”. The super-efficacy analysis set includes 
subject s who have efficacy assessments at both the lowest dose that provides a full “ON” , 
the highest tolerated dose level during the Titration Phase.  
The evaluation of the ECG data is focused on the corrected QT interv al (QTc). Both the 
formula by Bazett and by Fridericia will be used for the correction , though the Fridericia 
correction will be considered primary, and the Bazett correction data is presented for historical purposes . Both central tendency (mean changes fr om pre -dose) and outliers will 
be evaluated.  
Assay sensitivity will be demonstrated by evaluating the placebo corrected change from baseline for QTcF for the positive control, moxifloxacin, at predesignated timepoints.  
The pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized with descriptive statistics for each dose level. 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 12 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 The safety data other than ECG ( vital signs including orthostatic blood pressure, physical 
examinations including oral assessments, premature discontinuations, adverse events, 
C-SSRS, and safety  laboratory variables) will be summarized with descriptive statistics 
for APL -130277 overall and separately for each dose level.  
The main efficacy endpoint of this study is the change in MDS -UPDRS Part III at 
30 minutes. The MDS -UPDRS Part III will be anal yzed using a Mixed Model for 
Repeated Measures with data from the lowest dose level resulting in a full "ON" and at the highest tolerated dose level during the Titration Phase as response variables. The 
baseline (SV2) value will be included as a covariate and the day (1 = assessment at the lowest dose level resulting in a full “ON”, 2 = assessment at the highest tolerated dose 
level) and dose level (1 0 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, …, 60 mg) as fixed factors in the model. 
Separate models will be used for each time poin t (30, 60 and 90 minutes).  
 
SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  Forty -two (42) subjects will provide approximately 8 0% power to detect a mean 
difference of 7 ms in the change in QTc between APL -130277 and placebo, assuming 
that the true difference between APL -130277 and placebo can be up to 3  ms, (adding up 
to the predefined threshold of 10 ms) and a standard deviation of 14 ms  12 for ΔΔQTcF 
with one -sided significance level of 0.05.

1 Dosing days in the Dose Titration Phase should be scheduled the following business day of the previous visit and all visits must be completed within 14 days. 
A maximum of 2 days between visits may be permitted with Medical Monitor approval.  
2 All screening procedures to be conducted wi thin 14 days prior to Titration Visit 1 (TV1). If required by the Investigator, and following receipt of subject 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 15 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 consent, the Investigator may review the subjects ’ medical history, BMI, height, weight, vital signs, 12 -Lead ECG (in triplicate) and perform a complete 
physical examination at SV1 to determine if the subject may be eligible for study participation. Procedures performed on SV1 will not be repeated at SV2.  
3 Subjects  may be monitored in the clinic overnight before Dose Titration Visits if such facilities exist and the subject  consents.  
4 Physical examination to include the following: head -eyes-ears-nose and throat; respiratory system; cardiovascular system; gastrointestinal system, including 
mouth – oral cavity; musculoskeletal system; central and peripheral nervous system; and skin. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual 
inspection of the inside of each cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongu e. 
5 Abbreviated physical exam to  include head -eyes-ears-nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; and skin; to be done at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and 120 minutes 
after dosing at TV1 to TV 9, Period  1, Period 2, and Period 3. The oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each 
cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue.  
6 Both height and weight captured at the Screening Visit (SV2) to calculate BMI; only weight captured at all other indicated visits. 
7 Vital signs will be assessed at the Screening Visit (SV2)  and End of Study ( EOS ); TV1 to TV 9 and during Period 1, 2 and 3 at t  = 0 minutes (just prior to 
dosing) , 15, 45 and 60 minutes. Blood pressure to be measured supine and standing (measured wit hin 3 minutes of standing) at all timepoints.  
8 Suggested Sequence of Assessments at Pre- Dose: ECG – PK – Vitals  – Efficacy . Sequence of Assessments after dosing (where applicable) : MDS -UPDRS Part 
III - Subject “OFF”/”ON” status  – ECG  – PK – Vitals.  
9 12-lead ECG (Triplicate; Holter) : Period 1 : Obtain three ( 3) sets of triplicate ECGs  over approximately 1 -hour (prior to dosing) as the baseline assessment ; and 
obtain triplicate ECG at t = 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours after dosing. Period 2 and Period 3 : Obtain triplicate ECG at t = 0 (just prior to 
dosing), 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours after dosing .  
10 12-lead ECG ( Single; Resting): Obtain at the Screening Visit in triplicate  (SV2). TV1 to TV 9: ECG at t = 0 (just prior to  dosing) and 45 minutes after  dosing. 
Period 1, Period 2 and Period 3 at 60 m inutes after  dosing . EOS:  A triplicate ECG will be obtained . ECGs will be assessed by the Investigator at each visit.  
11 Blood and urine collection for clinical laboratory tests will occur at Screening Visit (SV2) and at the End of Study Visit (EOS) . In addition, serum pregnancy 
test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential.  
12 PK will be assessed for APL -130277 and placebo dosing days  at t = 0 (just pri or to dosing) , 30, 45, 60 minutes  and 2, 4 hours  after dosing . PK will be assessed 
on the moxifloxacin dosing day at t = 0 (just prior to dosing),  30, 60 minu tes and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours after  dosing.  
13 MDS -UPDRS Part III (Motor Function) to be assessed at  t = 0 (just prior to dosing), 30, 60 and 90 minutes after L -Dopa administration  at the second 
Screening Visit (SV2) ; the modified Hoehn and Yahr will be used during the Screening Visit (SV2) . Assessments during the Titration  Phase at t = 0 (just prior 
to dosing), 30, 60 and 90 minutes after dosing ; these assessments will e xclude the “Dyskinesia Impact on Part III Ratings” and the Hoehn and Yahr staging. 
14 “Screening” scale to be used at the Screening Visit (SV2); “Since Last Visit” to be used at all other  visits . 
15 Optional Dosing Regimen:  For TV3, TV4, TV5 and TV6 only subjects can be dosed with the next highest dose of study medication within 4 hours of the 
previous  dose, as long as the subject achieves another “OFF” state that day.  
16 Following completion of the Dose Titration Phase of the study , Sponsor approval is required prior to r andomization in the Three -Way  Balanced Crossover 
Phase . Additional details are available in the Enrollment a nd Randomization Adjudication Process , which is contained in a  separate document.

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 7 INTRODUCTION 
7.1 Background 
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s 
disease. PD has a prevalence of approximately 0.5% to 1% among persons 65 to 69 years of age, 
rising to 1% to 3% among persons 80 years of age and older.1 The disease is characterized by 
progressive degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and depletion of dopamine, which results in the core motor symptoms of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability.
2 During the early stages of the disease, motor symptoms are well controlled with 
L-Dopa plus a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitors, dopamine agonists or MAO -B inh ibitors. 
However, as the disease progresses, PD subjects  develop motor complications which consist of 
dyskinesia and motor fluctuations. Motor fluctuations represent periods of “OFF” time and include wearing- “OFF”, delayed “ON” (if with first morning dose termed morning akinesia), 
unexpected “OFF” or “ON”/ “OFF” fluctuations. These motor fluctuations can be either 
predictable or unpredictable. The mechanisms by which response fluctuations occur are only 
partially understood but are thought to include presynaptic neuronal degeneration leading to a lack of buffering of released L -Dopa, postsynaptic changes in dopamine receptor sensitivity and 
number, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic influences of exogenously administered dopaminergic agents.
3,4 Fluctuations in plasma levels of L -Dopa occur due to the short half -life 
of L-Dopa and the unpredictable variability of gastric emptying. In general, approximately 40% 
of subjects  with PD experience mo tor fluctuations and/or dyskinesias after 4 to 6 years of 
L-Dopa therapy, with close to 90% of subjects  experiencing these symptoms after 9 or more 
years of treatment .5  
Predictable motor fluctuations (i.e. wearing -“OFF”) can be treated by increasing the dose or 
frequency of L -Dopa or by adding adjunctive PD medications ( Catechol O -methyltransferase 
[COMT] inhibitors, MAO -B inhibitors, dopamine agonists). However, over time this becomes 
less effective. Treatment of unpredictable motor fluctuations (i.e. del ayed “ON”, sudden “OFF”, 
“ON”/”OFF” fluctuations ) is limited. Some subjects  take oral L -Dopa immediate release as 
needed but this is of limited value as higher doses of L -Dopa can result in dyskinesia and 
perpetuates the development o f further motor compli cations. The only approved treatment for 
acute management of “OFF” episodes in North America, Europe and Asia is apomorphine 
delivered  subcutaneous ly (s.c.). Although efficacious, s.c. apomorphine has limited use due to its 
parenteral administration and since it may be difficult for a PD patient to deliver. There remains a huge unmet medical need for easy to administer, rapid, safe, effective and reliable rescue medications for the treatment of these “OFF” episodes in PD subjects . APL -130277, sublingually 
administered apomorphine, provides a more patient -friendly, easy to administer medication for 
the management of both predictable and unpredictable “OFF” episodes.

CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 Apomorphine is a non- ergot dopamine agonist that binds to D1- like and D2- like receptors. Firs t 
used as a treatment for PD as early as 1951, its clinical use was first reported in 1970 although its 
emetic properties and short half -life made oral use impractical. A later study found that 
combining the drug with 10 mg  domperidone improved results sig nificantly .6-10 
APOKYN® and APO -go® (apomorphine hydrochloride injection, see APPENDIX I: APOKYN® 
Prescribing  Information and APO -go® Summary of Product Characteristics ) are prescription 
medicine s that reverses “OFF” episodes (end-of- dose wearing -“OFF” and unpredictable “ON”-
“OFF” episodes) associated with advancing PD. APOKYN®, which are indicated for the acute, 
intermittent treatment of hypomobility, “OFF” episodes associated with advanced PD, has been 
studied as an adjunct to other PD medications. Therapeutic use in PD is effective because of the 
drug's strong dopaminergic action. When administered subcutaneously, apomorphine is the most effective dopamine agonist. Within 3 -20 minutes of injection, apomorphine demonstrates a 
magn itude of effect (ability to convert the patient with PD to the “ON” state) that is comparable 
to L-Dopa. The effects of a single s.c. injection last for 60 minutes. Apomorphine can be used in 
combination with L -Dopa. L -Dopa dosing may need to be readjusted (decreased) to reduce dopa -
induced dyskinesias periods .
6-10 
Subcutaneous injection of apomorphine was developed to avoid first -pass metabolism as 
apomorphine is almost completely metabolized when delivered orally (between 1- 2% of the total 
dose enters the  bloodstream following oral administration ). The total daily dose can range up to 
20-25 mg /daily. Domperidone, a peripheral dopamine antagonist , may be administered to avoid 
emesis, bradycardia and hypotension caused by apomorphine 's peripheral dopaminergi c action. 
Subjects  on chronic apomorphine treatment may be able to discontinue domperidone 
co-administration after about 2  months without recurrence of the dopaminergic adverse effects of 
apomorphine. Domperidone is not available in the US, where trimethobenzamide is used.  
There is a small dose related prolongation of QTc interval with single doses of APOKYN®/APO-
go® greater than 6  mg ( see APPENDIX I: APOKYN® Prescribing  Information and APO -go® 
Summary of Product Characteristics ). This study will evaluate the QT interval prolongation 
potential of APL -130277. 
7.2 Drug Substance  
The active ingredient is apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate (C 17H17NO 2•HCl  •½H 2O(salt)). 
Apomorphine is synthesized from morphine, but it is not a narcotic, nor is it a controlled substance. Apomorphine hydrochloride appears as white or greyish- white glistening crystals or 
white powder. The R- enantiomer is used clinically.  
The drug substance, apomorphine hydrochloride hemihydrate , is manufactured by Sanofi -
Avent is. Apomorphine hydrochloride is manufactured from morphine monohydrate in the 
presence of orthophosphoric acid, ethyl acetate and hydrochloric acid. Purification is performed

7.3 Drug  Product  (APL -130277 Sublingual Film)  
The product under development, APL -130277, is a soluble thin film for sublingual 
administration. APL -130277 is designed to deliver apomorphine systemically through absorption 
from the oral cavity  mucosa , thus bypassing the extensive first pass metabolism associated with 
gastrointestinal absorption of the compound. The product is intended to be an alternative to the injectable form of apomorphine hydrochloride, which is marketed in North America as 
APOKYN
® and in most of Europe and Asia as APO- go®. 
APL -130277 is manufactured for clinical studies as a bilayer thin film with one layer containing 
the active ingredient, apomorphine hydrochloride, and the other layer containing a buffer , 
pyridoxine . Dosage units of 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 mg  are achieved from a single formulation by 
cutting different sized rectangular thin films from sheets of bulk film  as shown in the table 
below. Identifying marks are printed in white ink on the buffer (pyridoxine) side of the

as an  antioxidant/preservative. The formulation also includes pyridoxine HCL as a buffer 
component. The excipients used in formulating APL -130277 sublingual thin films, are 
compendial (USP, NF or FCC) items and/or are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and/or 
have precedent for use in pharmaceutical products approved in the US. 
7.4 Clinical Experience 
This is the twelfth planned  in-man study for APL -130277. Previous studies CTH -101, CTH -102, 
CTH -103, CTH -104, CTH -106, CTH -107 and CTH -200 were performed in healthy volunteers in 
Malaysia, all at Info  Kinetics. The first study completed in a PD patient population, CTH -105, 
was conducted at 4 sites in North America.  CTH -203, CTH -300 and CTH -301, evaluating 
APL -130277 in a PD patient population, are being conducted and CTH -302 is  planned for later 
this year.  
The healthy volunteer studies are summarized in considerable detail in the Investigator ’s 
Brochure  (IB). Adverse events were those expected to be seen with apomorphine, with the most 
common AEs being somnolence , dizziness and nausea. No dose limiting side effects were 
encountered  and no subjects discontinued APL -130277 treatment due to an AE.  
The healthy volunteer studies confirmed the method of administration, allowed further 
refinement of the formulation and confirmed PK comparability of APL -130277 to s.c. 
apomorphine. The CTH -103 and CTH -104 PK study results demonstrated dose proportionality 
of the doses of APL -130277 tested (10  mg, 15 mg, 25 mg) and that the 25 mg dose is sustained 
over an extended period of time (162 minutes) above the minimal efficacious plasma concentration of apomorphine (approximat ely 3  ng/m L), believed to be a level demonstrating 
symptomatic relief of “OFF” symptoms. The T
max for the 25 mg dose of APL -130277 was 
approximately 40 minutes, which was similar for the 10  mg and 15 mg doses of 
APL -130277. The rapid uptake of apomorphine in the APL -130277 sublingual thin film is 
comparable to that described in the s.c. apomorphine label s (i.e. , between 10 and 60 minutes).  
The PD subjects dosed in CTH -105 (19 subjects) displayed similar side effects to that seen in 
healthy volunteers;  the most common AEs (seen in 2 or more subjects ) were dizziness, 
somnolence, nausea, yawning, headache and hyperhidrosis. Most of these AEs were mild to 
moderate in severity. There was no dose -response relationship seen with the most common AEs 
and no subjects  discontinued due to an AE . Local irritation of the oral mucosa was monitored in 
the study and none was noted. 
The CTH -105 study demonstrated that APL -130277 provided rapid, clinically meaningful 
improvement in MDS -UPDRS Part III scores for PD subjects  in the “OFF” state and converted 
most subjects from the “OFF” state to the “ON” state . Much of the benefit was sustained through 
90 minutes. A range of doses were utilized but over half of the subjects responded to the two 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 30 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 lowest doses (10 and 15 mg). 
The CT H-106 study results demonstrated that the orientation of the thin film does not have a 
meaningful impact on the bioavailability of apomorphine. 
In CTH -107 and CTH -200, similar AEs were seen as in the previous healthy volunteer studies, 
and study analysis is ongoing.  
7.5 Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
APL -130277 
Given that APL -130277 uses the same active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API) as APOKYN® and 
APO- go®, and the pharmacokinetic profile is comparable between the sublingual thin film and 
the s.c. injection, the risks associated with the drug will be the same as those seen in the 
APOKYN® and APO -go® Product Inserts (see  APPENDIX I: APOKYN® Prescribing  
Information and APO -go® Summary of Product Characteristics ), except for the significant 
injection site reactions. It is assumed that the bioavailability of APL -130277 will be consistent in 
CTH -201 with that found in previous experience with APL -130277 compared with APOKYN® 
and APO- go®. 
The buffer contained in the inactive layer of  APL -130277 is designed to mitigate potential 
irritation of the oral mucosa seen in other buccal formulations of apomorphine as well as assist in maintaining a stable pH and optimal absorption kinetics. A preclinical hamster study demonstrated no evidence of microscopic or macroscopic irritation. No local irritation was noted 
in the CTH -105 study . In other ongoing clinical studies of APL -130277, non- serious AE reports 
of irritation of the oral mucosa have been received. Local irritation will be closely monitored 
throughout study participation. The goal of this development program, however, is to formulate a medication that provides the PD patient with an easier delivery system. We hypothesize that an 
orally available formulation will be easier to use, allow quicker control over predicted “OFF” 
periods, be more readily accessible to the patient when unpredicted “OFF” episodes occur during activities of daily living, and potentially be used by the milder PD patient when “OFF” episodes begin during the advanceme nt of the disease.  
Moxifloxacin  
Moxifloxacin is an antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolones family and will be used as a reference product in this study. 
Changes in cardiac electrophysiology have been observed following exposure to moxifloxacin, 
in the form of QT prolongation and is therefore contraindicated in patients with: 
• Congenital or documented acquired QT prolongation; 
• Electrolyte disturbances, particularly in uncorrected hypokalaemia; 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 31 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 • Clinically relevant bradycardia; 
• Clinically relevant heart failure with reduced left -ventricular ejection fraction ; 
• Previous history of symptomatic arrhythmias . 
The risk of cardiac abnormalities may increase with increased dose. There is a rare chance that 
patients may experience a severe, sudden allergic reaction  (an anaphylactic reaction/shock) with 
the following symptoms: tightness in the chest, feeling dizzy, feeling sick or faint, or experience dizziness on standing. Moxifloxacin may cause inflammation of the liver, diarrhea (during or after taking this type o f antibiotic), and may occasionally cause pain and inflammation of 
tendons. Quinolone antibiotics may make the patient's  skin become more sen sitive to sunlight or 
UV light.  
7.6 Rationale 
This multi- center, Phase 2 study is designed to evaluate the QT interval  prolongation potential of 
10 mg  to 60 mg  doses of APL -130277 compared to placebo and the positive control, 400 mg  
moxifloxacin in subjects  with PD who experience motor fluctuations (“OFF” episodes).

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 10 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multi- center, phase 2, randomized, double -blind, placebo controlled, 3-period 
crossover, positive control, QT -evaluation study of APL -130277 in subjects  with PD 
complicated by motor f luctuations (“OFF” episodes). 
10.1 General Overview  
This study will commence with initial Screening Visits, followed by an open- label Dose 
Titration Phase in which individual responses to single doses of APL -130277 are evaluated in 
order to determine the dose for the Randomized Assessment P hase. APL -130277 and placebo 
will be  double-blinded and randomized in a balanced three -way crossover Williams design with 
open- label moxifloxacin treatment (Period  1, Period 2 and Period 3).11 
10.1.1  Screening Visits  
Before any study procedures are performed on any subject , informed consent must be obtained at 
an initial Sc reening Visit (SV1). Subjects  recruited to participate in the study, and who have 
provided full consent to participate, will be asked to attend a second Screening Visit (SV2), 
having taken their last dose of L -Dopa and any other adjunctive PD medication no later than 
midnight the evening prior to the visit. Their normal morning dose of L -Dopa ( without 
adjunctive PD medication)  will be administered in the clinic following confirmation of an “OFF” 
episode by the Investigator  and subject, to ensure that they e xperience an “ON” response. 
Eligibility criteria will be assessed  by the Investigator and approved by the Enrollment 
Authorization Committee (EAC)  prior to  enrollment.  
Subjects  will be asked to return to the clinic the morning of Titration Visit 1 (TV1) to start the 
Dose Titration Phase of the study. 
If needed, the site will arrange subject transfers. Alternatively, subjects may be monitored in the 
clinic overnight to facilitate “OFF” evaluation the following morning if such facilities exist and the subject  consents. These occurrences will not be considered a SAE. 
10.1.2  Dose Titration Phase  
Depending on the Investigator's decision, subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of  
medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically defined 
"OFF" state with no anti-parkinsonian medication after midnight the night prior). 
During the Dose Titration Phase of the study, subjects will start with a  dose of 10 mg  
APL -130277 and increase in 5 mg  increments up to 40 mg  and then in 10 mg  increments for the 
50 mg  and 60 mg  dose levels  until the subject reaches a full “ON” state. Once a full “ON” state 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 35 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 is achieved, dosing will continue for 2 additional vi sits to a maximum dose of 6 0 mg  (i.e., if a 
subject  experiences the first full “ON” at 1 0 mg , dosing will continue up until a dose of 20 mg ). 
For those subjects who do not achieve a full "ON" response, titration should continue until the 
maximum tolerated dose of APL-130277 is determined. 
Note:  For subjects who have previously participated in the CTH -300 or CTH -301 study, the 
subject will begin titration at the effective dose used in the respective previous study. Similarly dose titration of these subjects will increase in 5 mg  increments up to 40 mg and then in 10 mg 
increments for the 50  mg and 60 mg dose levels until the subject reaches a full “ON” state. Once 
a full “ON” state is achieved, dosing will continue for 2 additional visits to a maximum dose of  
60 mg (i.e., if a subject  experiences the first full “ON” at 35 mg , dosing will continue up until a 
dose of 50 mg ). 
At Titration Visit 1 (TV1), once the subject's “OFF” state has been confirm ed by both the 
Investigator and subject, the subject will be treated with 10 mg APL -130277. Subjects who 
tolerate the 10  mg APL -130277 will restart their normal PD medications and will be asked to 
return to the clinic the next business day for Titration Visit 2 (TV2), to assess the next highest 
dose (i.e., 15 mg) in a manner identical to that of Titration Visit 1 (TV1).   
Doses of APL -130277 will increase in 5 mg  increments up to 40 mg  and then in 10 mg  
increments for the 5 0 mg  and 60 mg  dose levels until a full “ON” state is achieved , then dosing 
will continue for 2 additional visits  to a maximum dose of 60 mg . This will sequentially be 
20 mg  (TV3), 25 mg  (TV4), 30 mg  (TV5), 35 mg  (TV6), 40 mg  (TV7), 50 mg  (TV8) and 6 0 mg  
(TV9).  
For Titration Visit 3 (TV3), Titration Visit 4 (TV4), Titration Visit 5 (TV5)  and Titration Visit 6 
(TV6) subjects should be dosed with the next highest dose of study medication within 4 hours of 
the dose, as long as the subject  achieves another “OFF” that day . TV3 should be paired with TV4 
(20 mg  and 25 mg  can be dosed on the same day); TV4 should  be paired with TV5 (25 mg  and 
30 mg  can be dosed on the same day) , TV5 should be paired with TV6 (30 mg  and 35 mg  can be 
dosed on the same day)  and TV6 should be paired with TV7 (35 mg  and 4 0 mg  can be dosed on 
the same day).  
Should the subject be unabl e to tolerate either  of the two additional dose levels after reaching a 
full “ON” state, in the Investigator’s opinion, due to adverse events commonly associated with 
apomorphine (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, etc.), subjects will be randomized

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 10.1.3  Three-W ay Balanced Randomized Crossover  Assessment Phase : Period 1, 
Period  2, Period 3 
Subjects who successfully complete the Dose Titration Phase of the study, and are approved by 
the Sponsor to proceed to randomization, will be asked to return to the clinic for Period 1 Dosing Visit 1 (P1V1). This visit will occur between 2 and 7 days after the final visit in the Dose Titration Phase of the st udy. Depending on the Investigator's decision, subjects  will be asked to 
arrive at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of 
medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically defined 
"OFF" state with no anti-parkinsonian medication after midnight the night prior). 
Subjects will be randomized in equal numbers to six possible sequences of each of the three 
treatments being studied:  
1. Treatment A: APL -130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration Phase, 
2. Treatment B: Matched placebo  APL -130277, 
3. Treatment C: A single 40 0 mg  dose of moxifloxacin. 
Following confirmation by both the Investigator and subject that the subject is in the “OFF” state, the sub ject will be dosed according to the subject's random treatment assignment. 
APL -130277 and placebo APL -130277 will be administered in a double -blind fashion and 
moxifloxacin will be administered open -label in a three -way balanced crossover. All subjects 
will be exposed to all three treatments. The six possible treatment sequences are: 1) ABC; 2) 
ACB; 3) BCA; 4) BAC; 5) CAB; and 6) CBA. 
Subjects will return to clinic 3 days after Period 1 and will be dosed for Period 2 with one of the 
other two treatments.  
Subjects will return to clinic 3 days after Period 2 and will be dosed for Period 3 with the third 
and last treatment.  
At the Period 1 Dosing Visit 1 (P1V1), three (3) sets of triplicate 12-L ead ECGs will be obtained 
using a continuous 12- lead Holter monito r over approximately 1- hour (prior to dosing) as the 
baseline assessment for analyses defined in Section 15.4.3. 
10.1.4  Enrollment Adjudication Committee (EAC) 
The Investigator must obtain approval from the EAC and Sponsor prior to e nrolling any subject 
into the study . The EAC will determine the subject ’s appropriateness for inclusion in the study, 
independent of the entry criteria . The EAC will consult with the Medical Monitor, and the 
Investigator as appropriate, to address and resolve any o utstanding questions or issues. 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 The EAC review should be completed within 48 hours of submitting a request, and the 
Investigator will b e informed of the decision. Following EAC /Sponsor approval, the final 
determination of eligibility for enrollment in the study will be made by the Investigator, who will then submit a request via the IWRS for enrollment into the Dose Titration Phase of the study . In 
case of refusal, the decision will be accompanied by a rationale. For additional details, please 
refer to the Enrollment and Randomization Adjudication Process, which is contained in a 
separate document.  
A dedicated charter will be developed in order to address the mode of operations of the EAC to ensure the integrity of the study will be protected. The communication from the EAC, 
documenting review and approval of the subject , will serve as EAC documentation for inclusion 
into the study and must be stored in the site study file.

• Record demographics and detailed medical history, including review of medications 
taken within 6 months prior to the initial Screening Visit (SV1), current treatment 
regimens, drug, alcohol and smoking history. 
• Perform a complete physical examination, including an oropharyngeal examination. The 
oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each 
cheek, the inside of the  upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the 
tongue. 
• Measure height and weight; calculate BMI.

their normal adjunctive PD medicatio n. 
• Record any AEs/SAEs that  have occurred after  the informed consent was obtained. 
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant 
medications being used by the subject since the last visit.  
• Subject inclusion into the study to be approved by the EAC.  
The Investigator will review all information obtained from the screening procedures. If the 
subject is not eligible, the subject will be a screening failure and will not attend any other visits. 
Subjects  who fulfill all entry criteria will be found eligible to participate in the trial and an 
appointment for Titration Visit 1 (TV1)  will be made.  
Eligible subjects  will be asked to return to the clinic the morning of Titration Visit 1 (TV1) to 
start the Dose Titration Phase of the study. 
12.2 Dose Titration Phase (TV1 to TV9) 
Depending on the Investigator's decision, subjects will be asked to arrive at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of 
medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically defined 
"OFF" state with no anti-parkinsonian medication after midnight the night prior). 
Once the subject's “OFF” state has been confirm ed by both the Investigator and subject, the 
subject will be treated with 1 0 mg  APL -130277 (TV1).  Subjects who tolerate  the 1 0 mg  
APL -130277 will restart their normal PD medication and will be asked to return to the clinic the 
next business day for Titration Visit 2 (TV2) to assess the next highest dose in a manner identica l 
to that of TV1. 
During the Dose Titration Phase of the study, subject s will start with 1 0 mg  and increase in 5 mg  
increments up to 40 mg  and in 10 mg  increments for the 5 0 mg  and 60 mg  dose levels  until the 
subject  reaches a full “ON” state. Once a full  “ON” state is achieved, dosing will continue for 
2 additional visits to a maximum dose of 60 mg  (e.g., if a subject  experiences the first full “ON” 
at 10 mg , dosing will continue up until a dose of 20 mg ). Dosing days in the Dose Titration 
Phase should be  scheduled the next business  day after the previous visit and must be completed 
within 14 days . 
• Titration Visit 1 (TV1) – 10 mg  APL -130277; 
• Titration Visit 2 (TV2) – 15 mg  APL -130277; 
• Titration Visit 3 (TV3) – 20 mg  APL -130277; 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 46 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 • Titration Visit 4 (TV4) – 25 mg  APL -130277; 
• Titration Visit 5 (TV5) – 30 mg  APL -130277; 
• Titration Visit 6 (TV6) – 35 mg  APL -130277 (20 mg  sublingual thin film under the 
tongue for 3 minutes before placing the second 15 mg  sublingual thin film, sequentially  
for another 3 minutes [total dosing time should be 6 minutes] ); 
• Titration Visit 7 (TV7) - 40 mg  APL -130277 (20 mg  sublingual thin film under the 
tongue for 3 minutes before placing the second 2 0 mg  sublingual thin film, sequentially  
for another 3 minutes [total dosing time should be 6 minutes] ); 
• Titration Visit 8 (TV8) - 50 mg  APL -130277 (25 mg  sublingual thin film under the 
tongue for 3 minutes before placing the second 2 5 mg  sublingual thin film, sequentially  
for another 3 minutes [ total dosing time should be 6 minutes] ); 
• Titration  Visit 9 (TV9) - 60 mg  APL -130277 (30 mg  sublingual thin film under the 
tongue for 3 minutes before placing the second 3 0 mg  sublingual thin film, sequentially  
for another 3 minutes [total dosing time should be 6 minutes] ). 
For Titration Visit 3 (TV3), Titration Visit 4 (TV4), Titration Visit 5 (TV5) and Titration Visit 6 
(TV6) only, subjects can be dosed with the next highest dose of study medication within 4 hours 
of the initial dose, as long as the subject achieve s another “OFF” state that day.  
• TV3 should  be paired with TV4 (20 mg  and 25 mg  can be dosed on the same day);  
• TV4 should be paired with TV5 (25 mg  and 30 mg  can be dosed on the same day)  
• TV5 should be paired with TV6 (30 mg  and 35 mg  can be dosed on the same day). 
• TV6 should be paired with TV7 (3 5 mg  and 40 mg  can be dosed on the same day). 
After reaching a full “ON” state, the subject will continue with the next two T itration Visits . 
Should the subject be unable to tolerate one of the two additional dose levels after reaching a full 
“ON” state , in the Investigator’s opinion, due to adverse events commonly associated with 
apomorphine ( e.g., orthostatic hypotension, nausea, vomiting, etc.), subjects will be randomized 
to the previous dose.  
Study staff will perform the  following  procedures  at each  Titration Visit: 
• Reconfirm consent. 
• Review restriction criteria.  
• Perform an abbreviated physical examination, including oropharyngeal examination at 
t = 0 (just prior to dosing ) and 120 minutes after dosing at TV1 to TV 9. The 
oropharyngeal cavity examination should include a visual inspection of the inside of each 
cheek, the inside of the upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 47 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 tongue. 
• Single 12- lead ECG will be obtained using a resting ECG device at t = 0 (just prior to 
dosing) and 45 minutes after dosing  as a safety evaluation ; assessment by the 
Investigator/ECG qualified person to be completed at the visit. 
• Record vital signs (BP, HR, RR and Temp) at t  = 0 minutes (just prior to dosing), 15, 45 
and 60 minutes after dosing. Blood pressure to be measured both supine and standing 
(measured within 3 minutes of standing). 
• Assess subject motor function using MDS -UPDRS Part III at t =  0 (just prior to dosing) , 
30, 60 and 90 minutes after dosing (see APPENDIX IV: Movement Disorder Society - 
Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS -UPDRS) ). These assessments will 
exclude the “Dyskinesia Impact on Part III Ratings” and the Hoehn and Yahr staging. 
• Investigator confirmation of “OFF” or “ON”. The subject must be in an “OFF” state prior 
to dosing in order to proceed with dosing . Investigator will assess “OFF”/”ON” state as 
part of the MDS- UPDRS Part III assessments.  
• Subject confirmation of “OFF” or “ON” . The subject must be in an “OFF” state prior to 
dosing in order to proceed with dosing. 
• When subject is in the “OFF” state, dose with APL-130277. 
• Subject  will report the time when they turned to a full “ON” (if applicable) and report the 
time when they turned “OFF” following dosing (if it occurs within 90 minutes of dosing). 
• Record any AEs/SAEs that have occurred since the last visit.  
• Record any new concomitant medications and/or changes to current concomitant 
medications being used by the subject since the last visit.  
• Assess suicidal ideation using C -SSRS (see APPENDIX V: Columbia Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS) ). The “Since Last Visit” scale should be used at this visit.  
• Subject inclusion into the Crossover Phase to be approved by Sponsor prior to 
Randomization. 
If in the opinion of the Investigator the subject  can no longer tolerate the “OFF” state at any 
point during the visit, the subject  may receive rescue L -Dopa ( ± other adjunctive PD medication) 
at a dosage considered appropriate by the Investigator to achieve a full “ON” state. Where 
possible, administration of rescue L -Dopa should be delayed until after the 60 minute efficacy 
assessments are complete.  
If the subject  receives rescue L -Dopa ( ± other adjunctive PD medication) as described above, 
subjects  can return to the clinic on another day to resume the titration with the next highest dose.

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 12.3 Three-Way Balanced Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase :  Period 1, Period 2, 
Period 3  
Subjects  who successfully completed the Dose Titration Phase will be asked to return to the 
clinic for Period 1 Dosing Visit  1 (P1V1). This visit will occur between 2 and 7 days after the 
final visit in the Dose Titration Phase of the study . Depending on the Investigator's decision, 
subjects  will be asked to arrive at the clinic : 
• after their usual morning dose of PD medications; but before taking their next dose of 
medication ; OR  
• after withholding their normal morning dose of L -dopa (ie, in the practically defined 
"OFF" state with no anti-parkinsonian medication after midnight the night prior).  
Following confirmation by both the Investigator and subject that the subject is in the “OFF” 
state, the subject will be randomized using the Williams design . Subjects will be randomized in 
equal numbers to six possible sequences of each of t he three treatments being studied:  
1. Treatment A: APL -130277 at the dose determined in the Dose Titration Phase,

12.6.1  Order of Asses sments  
The following summarizes the suggested sequence of asses sments prior to dosing during SV2, 
Dose Titration Phase and Periods 1, 2, and 3 of the study: 
ECG – PK – Vitals  – Efficacy   
The following summarizes the suggested sequence of assessments after dosing during Dose 
Titration Phase and Periods 1, 2, and 3 of the study: 
MDS -UPDRS Part III - Subject “OFF”/”ON” status – ECG  – PK – Vitals   
In the event the completion of the MDS- UPDRS Part III at a previous timepoint conflicts with 
other assessments that  are scheduled, priority should be given to completing the MDS- UPDRS 
Part III first before conduc ting the remaining assessments.  
12.6.2  Clinical Safety Assessments  
12.6.2.1 Physical Examinations 
Complete physical examination s at all scheduled timepoints must include the  following: head -
eyes-ears-nose and throat; respiratory system; cardiovascular system; gastrointestinal system, 
including the oral cavity  (and oropharyngeal cavity examination ); musculoskeletal system; 
central and peripheral nervous system; and skin; t o be done at the second  Screening Visit (SV2)  
and End of Study (EOS) Visit. 
Abbreviated physical exam inations at all scheduled timepoints must include head -eyes-ears-nose 
and throat; heart, lungs; abdomen; oropharyngeal cavity examination; and skin; t o be done at 
t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and 120 minutes after dosing at visits TV1 to TV 9, Period 1, Period 2, 
and Period 3. 
All physical examinations performed in this study, whether complete or abbreviated, will include 
an oropharyngeal cavity examination by the  Investigator (or designate trained to perform this 
examination) and will include a visual inspection of the inside of  each cheek, the inside of the 
upper and lower lip, the surface of the tongue, and under the tongue. Each location within the 
oropharyngeal examination will be scored and graded as follows: 
• Finding 
o None 
o Focal reddening  
o Multiple foci of reddening 
o Edema  
o Ulceration  
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 53 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 • Grade  
o Mild  
o Moderate  
o Severe  
All abnormal findings at baseline will be recorded on the Medical History/Concomitant 
Diagnoses page (or  equivalent) of the CRF. New abnormal findings or a worsening of baseline 
conditions detected at follow-up physical examinations will be recorded as AEs on the CRF. 
The Investigator (or designate) should evaluate each finding against AE criteria and comple te the 
AE CRF, as appropriate. Photographs for reference may be taken by the Investigator (or 
designate) provided the subject provides consent to do so. 
12.6.2.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs ( HR, RR, BP and body temperature ) will be measured at various timepoints after the 
subject has been in a supine position for 5 minutes. Vital signs will be measured at t = 0 (just 
prior to dosing), 15, 45, 60 minutes after dosing at all scheduled study visits.  Vital signs (BP 
only) will also be measured within three minutes of standi ng at all timepoints . The same arm 
should be used during each assessment of BP and HR. If the subject is unable to stand due to 
orthostatic symptoms such as light- headedness, dizziness, or changes in sensorium upon 
standing, every attempt should be made to obtain BP and HR in the sitting position. Study personnel will carefully monitor subjects  for signs of OH; defined as:  
• a systolic  BP decrease of ≥  20 mmHg within three minutes of standing up from a supine 
position; and/or 
• a diastolic BP decrease of ≥  10 mmHg within three minutes of standing up from a supine 
position. 
12.6.2.3 12-Lead ECG  
12-lead ECG s will be performed as outlined in the prot ocol using two modalities, a continuous 
Holter monitor and a resting ECG device. Detailed i nstructions will be provided to study staff 
and subjects. 
12-lead Holter M onitor:   At the Period 1 Dosing Visit 1 (P1V1) , three ( 3) sets of triplicate 
12-lead ECG s will be obtained over approximately 1-hour (prior to dosing) as the baseline 
assessment for analyses  defined in Section 15.4.3 . Triplicate 12 -lead ECG s will also be obtained 
at t = 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes after dosing and at 2, 3, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours after dosing . In Period  2 
and Period 3, triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at t  = 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes and at 2, 3, 
4, 8, 12, 24 hours after dosing . At each ECG extraction time points the subject must have 
rested in the supine position for 10 minutes prior to the nominal timepoint and 10  minutes 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 54 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 after. 
ECGs obtained using the continuous Holter monitor will be sent directly to the central core ECG 
laboratory contracted by the Sponsor and/or its designate. The Holter monitor results will not be 
provided to the site. 
Resting ECG Device:   At Screening Visit 2 (SV2)  a triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be obtained . 
Triplicate ECG should be completed with 5 minutes. The screening ECG will be centrally 
reviewed by the ECG Laboratory and the result provided for eligibility. 
At each Titration Visit, a single  12-lead ECG will be performed  at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) and 
45 minutes after dosing . In Period 1, Period  2 and Period 3, a single ECG  will be performed at 
t = 60 minutes after dosing . At the End of Study Visit (EOS), a triplicate 12 -lead ECG will be 
obtained. 
ECGs obtained using a resting ECG device will be used as a safety evaluation and assessed  by 
the Investigator/ECG qualified person at each visit.  
The following parameters will b e reported in the CRF based on the safety ECGs:  
• Heart rate  
• PR interval  
• QRS interval  
• RR interval  
• QT interval  
• QTc Interval (Fridericia’s correction)  
• QTc Interval (Bazett’s correction)  
All safety ECGs should be assessed by the Investigator and deemed “Normal”, “Abnormal, not 
clinically significant” or “Abnormal, clinically significant”. Abnormal readings that, in the 
opinion of the Investigator are deemed clinically significant should be reported as AEs on the 
appropriate CRF page.  
12.6.2.4 Modified Hoehn and Yahr  
The Modified Hoehn and Yahr scale will be administered at the second Screening Visit (SV2) to 
verify subjects meet the eligibility criteria for this study. This will be conducted in the “ON” 
state.  
12.6.2.5 Mini -Mental State Examination 
Mini- Mental State Examination (M MSE) is used to evaluate a person’s cognitive and mental 
function and will be administered at the second Screening Visit (SV2) to verify subjects meet the 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 55 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 eligibility criteria for this study.  
12.6.2.6 Clinical Laboratory Tests

Screening Visit only):  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface antigen, 
Hepatitis C antibodies . 
12.6.2.7 Specimen  Handling  Requirements  
The transmission of infectious agents may occur through contact with contaminated needles and blood or blood products. Consequently, appropriate blood and body fluid precautions should be employed by all personnel involved in the drawing of blood and the handling of specimens in 
both the clinic and laboratory settings. 
In addition to appropriate handling of subject samples, specific regulations exist regarding the 
shipment of biologic/etiologic samp les. Procedures and regulations for the packaging and 
shipping of infectious samples may be  outlined in the study Laboratory Manual. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure all study samples that are to be transported to another 
location are appropriately packed and shipped according to the applicable regulations. 
Blood and urine samples for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, and serology  will be sent 
to a central  laboratory for analyses.  Please see the Laboratory Manual for details.  
12.6.2.8 C-SSRS 
Formal assessments of subject  suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed at the second 
Screening Visit (SV2)  and all following visits through to the End of Study (EOS). A final 
assessment will be performed at the time of termination, regardless if it is scheduled (i.e., at 
EOS) or an early termination/withdrawal.  
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 56 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 At SV2 the C -SSRS ‘Screening’ assessment tool will be used. Subjects who answer ‘Yes’ to 
Questions 4 and 5 at this Visit should be excluded from participation in the study. All subsequent  
evaluations will utilize the C -SSRS ‘Since Last Visit’ assessment . 
12.6.2.9 Medical History  
At the Screening Visit (SV2), the Investigator (or designate) will review the subject ’s medical 
history in order to ascertain the subject ’s eligibility. The medical history  should assess the 
subject ’s current PD medications, including medication name, dose, number of tablets per dose 
(if applicable), dosage units and frequency per day. 
The medical history assessment will include a detailed assessment of the subjects  PD histo ry, 
including, but not limited to: 
• Year of Diagnosis;  
• Presence of a rest tremor at the time of diagnosis;  
• Year when motor fluctuations began; 
• Type of “OFF” episodes experienced (e.g., morning akinesia, wearing -“OFF ”, 
delayed “ON”, dose failure, sudden “OFF ”); 
• Number of “OFF” episodes per day; 
• Typical length of “OFF” episodes . 
• PD medications previously or currently taken, including: 
o Dopamine agonists; 
o MAO-B inhibitors; 
o COMT inhibitors; 
o Amantadine;  
o Anti-cholinergics.  
12.6.3  Efficacy Assessments  
12.6.3.1 Confirmation of “OFF” or “ON” Episodes 
“OFF” and “ON” Training of Subjects at SV2  
At S creening Visit  2 (SV2), subjects  will present to the clinic having taken their last dose of 
L-Dopa and any other adjunctive PD medication no later than midnight the evening prior to the 
visit. Their normal morning dose of L -Dopa ( without adjunctive PD medication) will be 
administered in the clinic. Prior to administration of their L -Dopa dose, subject s will be 
examined by the Investigator in order to verify that they are in the “OFF” state . If they are in the 
“OFF” state, the Investigator will educate the subject  that this is an “OFF” period or “OFF” 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 57 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 episode. The Investigator should clearly explain to the subject that this “OFF” time is when their 
medication has worn off, and does not provide benefits in terms of mobility, slowness and 
stiffness.   
Subject s will then take their next scheduled dose of L -Dopa. Once the Investigator determines 
that the subjec t is experiencing an “ON” state, they should educate the subjec t that this is an 
“ON” state.  The Investigator should clearly explain to the subjec t that an “ON” episode is the 
period of time where their medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, slowness and stiffness, and they feel they can perform normal daily activities.  Once the  subjec t has 
demonstrated understanding of the “OFF” and “ON” state, the training is complete. Successful 
completion and understanding of this training should be noted in the appropriate CRF.  
Any subject  who cannot differentiate between an “ON” and “OFF” state will be deemed a screen 
failure.  
Definitions of Full “ON” and “OFF” 
The following definitions will be used in this study: 
“OFF” – defined as:  
• A period of time when medication has worn off and is no longer providing benefit with 
regard to mobility, slowness, and stiffness; 
• Confirmed by the Investigator using their clinical judgement as “OFF”.  
• Confirmed by the subjec t as “OFF”.  
Full “ON” as assessed by the subject  – defined as:  
• A period of time where medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness and slowness and where a subjec t feels he/she can perform normal daily activities.  
• A response comparable to or better than their normal response to PD medications prior to 
enrolling in the study. 
Full “ON” as assessed by the Investigator – defined as: 
• Based on clinical judgment , it is the period of time  where the Investigator feels the 
medication is providing benefit with regard to mobility, stiffness and slowness and the 
subject  has adequate motor function to allow them to perform their norm al daily 
activities.  
Clinical confirmation of the “OFF” state must occur prior to dosing a subject  with study 
medication (or their standard L -Dopa dose at the second Screening Visit (SV2)). The same 
assessor should be utilized for each subject  throughout the study. 
Subject s must confirm they are in an “OFF” state prior to dosing with study medication (or their 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 standard L -Dopa dose at the second Screening Visit (SV2)).  
The Investigator will assess “OFF”/” ON” state as part of the MDS -UPDRS Part III assessme nts.  
At each Dose Titration, the subject  will report the time when they turned to full “ON”  (if 
applicable) and will  report  the time when they turned “OFF” following dosing (if it occurs within 
90 minutes of dosing). The timing of this should begin when t he subject is dosed with the study 
medication , APL -130277, and recorded with a suitable timing device. These times are to  be 
documented on the appropriate form of the CRF. 
12.6.3.2 MDS -UPDRS Part III  
The Motor Function section (Part III) of the MDS -UPDRS will be ad ministered at all visits 
where it is indicated.  
Administration will be performed at t = 0 (just prior to dosing) , 30, 60 and 90 minutes after 
dosing at the second Screening Visit (SV2)  and during the Dose Titration Phase.  
These assessments will exclude the “Dyskinesia Impact on Part III Ratings” and the Hoehn and 
Yahr staging. The modified Hoehn and Yahr will be used during the Screening Visit ( SV2). 
The MDS -UPDRS can only be performed by the Principal Investigator or Sub- Investigator who 
has been trained  to perform this evaluation. In specific cases , another appropriately experienced 
and certified study staff member can perform the assessment if approved by the Sponsor. 
12.6.3.3 Pharmacokinetic  (PK) Evaluation  
Blood draws for PK analyses  on APL -130277 and placebo treatment  days will occur at t = 0 (just 
prior to dosing) , 30, 45, 60 minutes after dosing and at 2, 4 hours after dosing. On the 
moxifloxacin treatment day , blood draws will occur at t  = 0 (just prior to dosing), 30, 60 minutes 
after dosing and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 hours after dosing. Sampling should occur as close as possible to 
the target time.  
Instructions specific to PK draws will be outlined in the PK lab manual .

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 13 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
Adverse events  will be recorded  from  the time of signing  of the ICF by the subject through to 
30 days after  study completion or earlier , if warranted  by a subject discontinuation. 
13.1.1  Definition  of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  (or patient)  or clinical investigation 
subject (or patient) administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing  diseases  or conditions  will not be considered  AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition. 
13.1.2  Definition  of Serious  Adverse Events  
An SAE  is any untoward  medical  occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results  in death;  
• Is life threatening; 
• Requires  in-subject hospitalization  (being admitted)  or prolongation of existing  
hospitalization;  
• Results  in permanent  (persi stent)  disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital  anomaly;  
• Is an important medical  event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events  that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject  
(or patient)  or may require intervention to prevent another of the outcomes listed in the definition 
above. 
Examples of such events are intensive treat ment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An elective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the investigational 
drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not  qualify the condition 
or event as an SAE.  
A spontaneous abortion or congenital anomaly  in an infant  born to a mother  who was exposed  to 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 the investigatio nal drug during  pregnancy is an SAE.  Because the effect of APL -130277 or 
apomorphine on human male reproduction has not been determined, a ll pregnancies ( in the 
subject or the subject's partner) will be documented on the Pregnancy Reporting Form with 
expressed consent. 
Due to the nature of subjects  being enrolled in this study, and the given study objectives, 
subjects  who are hospitalized  for their titration and Period  1, 2 and 3  visit “OFF”  episodes  
will not  be considered a SAE.  
13.1.3  Definition  of Severity  
The clinical  “severity” of an AE will be classified  as: 
Mild:  Causes no limitation of usual activities . 
Moderate:  Causes some limitation of usual activities . 
Severe:  Prevents or severely limits usual activities . 
 
13.1.4  Definition  of Start  Date,  Stop  Date,  and Duration  
Start  Date: The date at which  the AE is first noted. 
Stop Date: The date at  which  the AE is known to be resolved. If it is not known to 
have stopped, then indicate  “ongoing” . 
Duration : A time in days,  hours or minutes  (this is optional). 
 13.1.5  Action(s ) Taken  
Actions taken may consist of: 
None: No actions  taken.  
Discontinued Investigational
 
Drug:  Investigational drug was permanently  discontinued  because 
of the AE. 
Change Investigational Drug:  Investigational  drug was given  at a lower dose, at a longer  
interval between  doses, or was temporarily  withheld  
because of the AE. 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 61 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 Treatment:  Specified medication  (to be listed  on the concomitant  
medication  chart)  was used as a countermeasure.  
Others:  Other  actions,  such as an operative procedure, were  
required  because of the AE.  
 
13.1.6  Definition  of Expectedness  
An expected AE is an AE for which the nature or severity  is consistent with the known AE 
profile of the product. For an investigational  drug, the known information  is contained  in the IB. 
For a marketed  product,  the known information  is contained  in the current  package insert  for the 
product. 
An unexpected  AE is an AE for which the specificity  or severity  is not consistent with the 
current IB.  For example, hepatic necrosis  would be unexpected  (greater  severity ) if the IB only 
listed  elevated  hepatic enzymes  or hepatitis. Likewise,  cerebral  thromboembolism and cerebral  
vasculitis  would be unexpected  (greater  specificity) if the IB only listed  cerebral  vascular  
accidents.  
Furthermore, reports that  add significant  information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already documented adverse reaction  constitute  unexpected events. Examples would be (a) acute 
renal failure as an expected  adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial 
nephritis and ( b) hepatitis with a first  occurrence of fulminate hepatitis.  
13.1.7  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) for APL -130277 pertaining to irritation of the oral 
mucosa require immediate reporting (see Section  13.1.14) no matter if the event is serious or 
non-serious. These AESIs include, but are not limited to: 
• Stomatitis  
• Oral Ulcers  
Note: Per their discretion, Investigators may use other terminology and/or descriptors pertaining 
to irritation of the  oral mucosa.  
Other AESIs for APL -130277 should be immediately reported only if they meet the serious 
criteria or lead to the discontinuation of the subject from the study. These AESIs include: 
• Changes in QT. 
• Orthostatic Hypotension.

CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 13.1.8  Definition  of Relation ship to Investigational Drug(s)  
The categories  for classifying  the Investigator’s  opinion regarding  the relationship of an AE to 
investigational drug(s) are listed below: 
Certain:  An AE occurring  in a plausible time  relationship  to 
investigational drug  administration  and which  cannot be 
explained  by a concurrent disease or other drugs  or events.  
The response to  withdrawal  of the drug  (dechallenge) is 
clinically  reasonable.  
Probable (likely): An AE with a reasonable time  sequence to  administration  of 
the investigational drug  and which  is unlikely to be attributed  
to concurrent disease or other drugs  or events.  The response to  
withdrawal  of the drug  (dechallenge) is clinically  reasonable.  
Possible: An AE with a reasonable time  sequence to  administration  of 
the investigational drug,  but which could also be explained  by 
concurrent disease or other drugs  or events.  Information  on 
drug withdrawal  may  be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely: An AE, including laboratory  test abnormality, with a temporal  
relationship  to in vestigational  drug administration  that makes a 
causal  relationship improbable and  in which  other drugs, 
events, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
Not related:  An AE with  sufficient  evidence to accept  that there is no 
causal  relationship to  investigational drug  administration  (e.g.,  
no temporal  relationship  to drug administration,  because the  
drug was administered  after onset of event;  investigation  
shows that  the drug  was not administered; another cause was  
proven; etc.).  
13.1.9  Definit ion of Outcome  at the Time  of Last  Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified  as: 
• Resolved; 
• Resolved  with sequelae;  
• Ongoing;  
• Death;  
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 63 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 • Unknown. 
Death should only be selected as an outcome when the AE resulted in death. If more than 1 AE is 
possibly related to the subject ’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for the AE 
attributed as the cause of death in the death certificate or summary . 
13.1.10  Documentation  of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non -leading questions at 
each visit or evaluation. The occurrence of all AEs will be documented in the CRF with the following information, where appropriate: 
• AE name or term;  
• When  the AE  first occurred  (start  date);  
• When  the AE stopped (stop  date),  or an indication  of “ongoing”; 
• How long the AE persisted  (optional); 
• Severity  of the AE; 
• Seriousness; 
• Actions  taken;  
• Outcome;  
• Investigator opinion regarding  the relationship  of AE to the investigational  drug(s).  
13.1.11  Follow -up of Subjects  With  an Advers e Event  
Any AE will be followed to a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by another known cause(s) (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warrante d. All findings relevant to the final 
outcome of an AE must be reported in the subject ’s medical record . 
13.1.12  Special  Procedures  for Managing  AEs/ SAEs  and Need  for
 Unblinding 
If AEs occur  in a subject which are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of 
investigational drug is not reasonable  in view of the potential benefit to subject, the Investigator  
must decide whether to stop investigational treatment and/or treat the subject . Subject 
withdrawal should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt 
should be made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. 
13.1.13  Notification  of Serious  Adverse  Events  
The Investigator must  report all SAEs  and pregnancies promptly to Sunovion or its designee, by 
completing the SAE form and submit by email (or fax) within  24 hours of first

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 14 TREATMENTS  
14.1 Treatments  Administered  
APL-130277 is a near square bilayer film containing apomorphine hydrochloride. APL -130277 
is intended for fast sublingual absorption for use in rescue therapy for acute intermittent “OFF” 
episodes experienced by PD subjects. APL -130277 bilayer is composed of 2 layers laminated 
together: a first layer is composed of cellulose -ether based film, containing drug substance, 
stabilizers and plasticizers; a second layer contains a pH -modifier (pyridoxine hydrochloride) 
contained within a similar cellulosic film bas e, flavor agents and a permeation enhancer . Buffer 
layer will be on the side of the sublingual film that has an alphanumeric printing. 
APL -130277 sublingual thin films will be provided in 5 strengths: 1 0 mg , 15 mg , 20 mg , 25 mg  
and 30 mg . Two sublingual thin films will be administered sequentially to form the 3 5 mg  dose , 
40 mg  dose , 50 mg  dose and 60 mg  dose (as described below ). In this study, placebo sublingual 
thin films will be prepared, which will be identical in appearance, size and colour, but contain no 
active ingredient (i.e., apomorphine).  Moxifloxacin  400 mg  tablets will be provided to the site for oral administration.  
14.2 Administration of Study Medication 
During all phases of this study; subjects  will be dosed by study staff.  
Dose Administration for APL -130277 and Placebo: 
Before dosing, the study staff will read out to subject s:  
“The product is a film . It will be placed against the bottom of the tongue . After the dose is placed 
in the mouth, close your mouth naturally. Let your tongue take a natural position. Do not move 
the tongue around to try to taste the drug or change its position. Just let it slowly dissolve in place. It will disso lve in 3 to 4 minutes. During that time try not to swallow saliva or the film. 
When the film is dissolved, raise  your hand to let the clinical staff know. We will ask that you 
open your mouth to show us.” 
Subjects will be instructed to consume a glass of water immediately prior to dosing, and staff 
will ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water.  
Using glo ved hands, or a single -use plastic disposable tweezers, staff will place the product 
beneath the tongue, with the drug side facing up and placed against  the bottom of the tongue 
(i.e., the side of the film that does not have  an alphanumeric printing), and ask subjects to close 
their mouth naturally. Subjects  should not swallow the medication and should also try not to 
swallow their saliva for at least 3 minutes. If, upon inspection at the 3 minute mark, the film is 
not completely dissolved, subjects  should be instructed to close their mouth and hold the study 
medication under their tongue for another minute (i.e., maximum of 4 minutes in total).  
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 67 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 If the subject feels the film has fully dissolved prior to the 3 minute mark, they should indicate 
this to staff by raising their hand, who will then verify. If upon inspection, the film is not 
completely dissolved, subjects  should be instructed to close their mouth again and hold the study 
medication under their tongue. Staff may verify at regular intervals, as appropriate, for a duration 
maximum of 4  minutes in total.  
To administer the 3 5 mg  dose, study staff will administer the 20 mg  sublingual thin film under 
the tongue  first, and then after 3 minutes has elapsed, immediately administer the 1 5 mg  
sublingual thin film for another 3 minutes (total dosing time should be 6 minutes) . 
To administer  the 4 0 mg  dose, study staff will administer the  20 mg  sublingual thin film under 
the tongue  first, and then after 3 minutes has elapsed, subjects will be instructed to consume 
approximately 1  teaspoon of water immediately prior to dosing the second 20 mg dose, and staff 
will ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water . The second 20 mg  sublingual thin film 
will be administered under the tongue for another 3  minutes (total dosing time should be 
6 minutes) . 
To adm inister the 5 0 mg  dose, st udy staff will administer the 2 5 mg  sublingual thin film under 
the tongue  first, and then after 3 minutes has elapsed, subjects will be instructed to consume 
approximately 1 teaspoon of water immediately prior to dosing the second 2 5 mg dose, and staff 
will ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water . The second 25 mg sublingual thin film 
will be administered under the tongue for another 3  minutes (total dosing time should be 
6 minutes) . 
To administer the 6 0 mg  dose, s tudy staff will administer the 3 0 mg  sublingual thin film under 
the tongue  first, and then after 3 minutes has elapsed, subjects will be instructed to consume 
approximately 1  teaspoon of water immediately prior to d osing the second 30 mg dose, and staff 
will ensure the sublingual space is free of excess water . The second 30 mg sublingual thin film 
will be administered under the tongue for another 3  minutes (total dosing time should be 
6 minutes) . 
Dose Administration for Moxifloxacin: 
A single dose of 400 mg  of moxifloxacin tablet will be administered orally to the subjects by 
study staff . The tablet should be swallowed whole with plenty of water; do not crush or chew the 
tablet.  
14.3 Storage 
The Investigator is responsible  for ensuring the proper storage of study medication according to 
procedures agreed in advance. Each Investigator is  required to keep investigational drug product 
in a locked cabinet or other secure storage contained with limited access to personnel. Temperature logs must be maintained for the storage room.

14.5 Drug  Accountability  
Drug  supplies, which will be provided by Sunovion or a CRO appointed by Sunovion, must be 
kept in a secure, limited access storage area.  
The Investigator, pharmacist, and/or investigational drug storage manager must maintain records of the product’s delivery to the trial site, the inventory at the site, the use by each subject , and the 
return to Sunovion of unused product(s). These records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial 
numbers, expiry dates, and the unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product(s) and trial subjects . The Investigator, pharmacist, and/or investigational drug storage manager will 
maintain records that doc ument adequately that the subjects  were provided the doses specified by 
the clinical trial protocol and reconcile all investigational product(s) received from Sunovion. At 
the time of return to Sunovion, the Investigator or site designate must verify that all unused or 
partially used drug supplies have been returned by the clinical trial subject and that no remaining 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 69 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 supplies are in the Investigator’s possession. 
Note: If any of the investigational drug is not dispensed; is lost, stolen, spilled, unusable; or 
arrives at the clinical site in a damaged container, this information must be documented and 
reported to Sunovion and appropriate regulatory agencies as required. The investigational drug 
will only be administered to subjects  participating in this study . Only authorized clinical site 
personnel may supply or administer the investigational drug. 
14.6 Method  of Assigning  Subjects  to Treatment  Groups  
In the Dose Titration Phase, all s ubjects  will be assigned open -label APL -130277 treatment using 
an IWRS system . 
In the Three- Way Balanced Randomized Crossover Assessment Phase (Period 1, Period 2, 
Period  3) s ubjects will be randomized  using the Williams Design such that subjects are 
randomized in equal numbers to six possible sequences of each of the three treatments  being 
studied: 
1) APL -130277 at the dose determined  in the Dose Titration Phase,  
2) Matched placebo  APL -130277, 
3) A single 400 mg  dose of moxifloxacin. 
APL -130277 and placebo will be administered in a double -blind fashion and moxifloxacin will 
be admi nistered open- label in a three -way balanced crossover. The strength  of APL -130277 or 
placebo  (i.e., 10 mg , 15 mg, 20 mg , 25 mg , 30 mg , 35 mg , 40 mg , 50 mg , 60 mg) to be given will 
be determined based on safety/tolerability during the Dos e Titration Phase o f the study.  
14.7 ECG  Methodology: Central Laboratory 
ECGs obtained digitally using a continuous 12- lead Holter device will undergo central review . 
ECGs to be used in the analysis will be selected /extracted  at predetermined time points and will 
be read central ly using a high -resolution manual on- screen caliper semiautomatic method with 
annotations. Triplicate (3) 12 -lead ECGs at each timepoint specified will be downloaded from 
the continuous recording approximately one minute apart. The digital ECGs will underg o a 
treatment -blinded high- resolution measurement of the cardiac intervals and morphological 
assessment by a central cardiologist also blinded to the study treatment.  
Digital ECGs will be processed via the central core laboratory’s  validated data managemen t 
system, EXPERT. Interval duration measurements will be collected using computer assisted 
caliper placements on three consecutive beats . Trained analysts will review all ECGs for correct 
lead and beat placement and adjudicate the pre- placed algorithm calipers as necessary using a 
proprietary validated electronic caliper system applied on a computer screen (manual adjudication methodology). A cardiologist will then verify the interval durations and perform the 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 70 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 morphology analysis . The ECG interval duration measurements will be performed in Lead II and 
when Lead II is not analyzable in Lead V5, when Lead V5 is not analyzable in Lead V2, 
followed by the most appropriate lead, if necessary. 
On-screen measurements of the RR, PR, QRS, and QT interval durations will be performed and 
heart rate, QTcF and QTcB will be derived by the following process: Interval measurements will be obtained by the following method:  
• Three (3) R -R    mean R -R Interval is reported  
• Three (3) PR    mean PR Interval is reported  
• Three (3) Q RS   mean QRS Width is reported  
• Three (3) QT    mean QT Interval is reported  
The following calculations will be made from the interval measurements: 
Three (3) QTcF measurements —QTc correction by the Fridericia’s formula  
• QTcF1 = QT1/3√RR1 
• QTcF2 = QT2/3√RR2 
• QTcF3 = QT3/3√RR3 
• Mean QTcF = (QTcF1 + QTcF2 + QTcF3)/3  
Three (3) QTcB measurements - QTc correction by the Bazett’s formula  
• QTcB1 = QT1/ √RR1 
• QTcB2 = QT2/ √RR2 
• QTcB3 = QT3/ √RR3 
• Mean QTcB = (QTcB1 + QTcB2 + QTcB3)/3  
Three (3) Heart Rate measurements  
• HR1 = 60 / RR1  
• HR2 = 60 / RR2  
• HR3 = 60 / RR3  
• Mean HR = (HR1 + HR2 + HR3)/3  
Each fiducial point (onset of P wave, onset of Q wave, offset of S wave, and offset of T wave) 
will be marked . The original ECG waveform and such annotations will be saved separately in 
XML format for independent review.

CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 14.8 Randomization  
At Screening, the IWRS will assign a unique subject  identification number to the subject  known 
as the Screening Number. This number will be associated with the subject  throughout the study. 
Every subject  that signs an ICF must be entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order 
to obtain a Screening Number. This 7- digit number will consist of a 4 -digit site ID followed by a 
3-digit number assigned sequentially wi thin each site starting at 001.  
Follow ing Sponsor approval  (additional details are available in the Enrollment a nd 
Randomization Adjudication Process, which is contained in a separate document) , subjects  will 
be randomized centrally at a study level after the Dose Titration Phase has been completed ( prior 
to Period 1 Dosing Visit 1) to one of the six  randomization sequences using the Williams design : 
1. APL -130277 – P lacebo – Moxifloxacin  
2. APL -130277 – Moxifloxacin – P lacebo  
3. Placebo – Moxifloxacin – APL -130277 
4. Placebo – APL -130277 – Moxifloxacin  
5. Moxifloxacin – Placebo – APL -130277 
6. Mox ifloxacin – APL -130277 – Placebo  
No stratification factors will be used. The randomization scheme will be designed by the study 
statistician. Once designed, an independent randomization expert will execute the randomiz ation 
in the IWRS. The 5- digit randomization number is used to identify the treatment sequence 
(APL -130277, placebo , moxifloxacin ) of the kits that will be assigned to the subject  during the 
Period  1, Period  2 and Period 3 of the Crossover Phase.  
A randomization number can only be assigned to one subject and cannot be reused once assigned.  
14.9 Blinding  
This study will be open -label during the Dose Titration Phase and for m oxifloxacin dosing 
during the Crossover Assessment Phase.  
APL -130277 and Placebo  Dosing V isits will be double -blinded. 
An IWRS will allocate treatment for Period 1 , Period 2 and Period 3 Dosing Visits based on a 
pre-specified randomization list, generated by the IWRS provider.  
For blinded Dosing Visits active and placebo study medication will be provided to each site 
participating in the study. For each dose, study medication and placebo packaging will be identical in size, shape, color and appearance. Investigators will not have access to the 
randomization (treatment) code except in case of a SAE. In this case, the code may be broken 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 72 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the study medication is essential for 
treating the subject. Subjects and study staff members will be blinded to treatment assignments 
until the completion of the study.  
A list of treatment kit numbers for each treatment sequence is generated centrally by the vendor 
selected by the Sponsor to perform this function, and the treatment kits are prepared in 
accordance with this list. Numbers will not be reused regardless of the status of the use of the corresponding study drug.

28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 15 STATISTICAL  ANALYSES  
15.1 Statistical  Analysis Plan 
Full statistical considerations  and complete analysis of data collected in this study will be 
specified in a formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) . This section of the protocol prospectively 
outlines the analysis methods. The final SAP will be finalized prior to locking the database  and 
prior to unblinding any study data. The SAP will serve as a compl ement to the study protocol 
and supersedes it in case of differences. In case of major differences between the study protocol 
and SAP (e.g. changes in the analysis related to the primary endpoint), a protocol amendment 
will be considered.  
15.2 Analysis Populations 
15.2.1  Safety Analysis Set  
All subjects  who receive  at least one dose of study medication will be included in the safety 
analysis set. The safety analysis set will be used for the analysis of the safety endpoints and the 
subjects  will be grouped according to the treatment that they received.  
15.2.2  PK Analysis S et 
The PK analysis set includes all subjects  with at least one PK evaluation and will be used for the 
analysis of the PK data.  
15.2.3  Efficacy Analysis Set  
The efficacy analysis set includes subjects who have efficacy assessments at the lowest or 
highest dose lev el resulting in a full “ON” . The efficacy analysis set will be used for the analysis 
of the efficacy data collected during the Dose Titration Phase.  
15.2.4  ECG and PK -PD Analysis  Sets 
The analysis populations for the ECG and pharmacokinetic -pharmacodynamic (PK -PD) analyses 
(Evaluable Population) will be comprised of all subjects who are randomized, receive at least one dose of study medication, and have at least one evaluable pre- dose ECG and one evaluable 
on-treatment post- dose ECG within the same Treatment Perio d. Additionally, for the PK -PD 
analysis (placebo corrected change in QTc vs . plasma concentration), a time -matched plasma 
concentration would also be necessary. 
15.3 Sample Size Calculation  
The study is powered to detect a mean difference in the change in QTcF between APL -130277 
and placebo  (∆∆QTcF ) of 7  ms, assuming that the true difference between APL -130277 and 
placebo can be up to 3 ms, adding up to the predefined threshold of 10 ms. The standard 
deviation of  ∆∆QTcF  is assumed to be 14 ms.

Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 74 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 42 subjects are required for the 3x3 cross -over phase to achieve approximately 80% power. 
15.4 ECG and Concentration- QTc Effect Analysis  
15.4.1  Primary E ndpoint  
The primary endpoint for this trial will be the time -matched change from  baseline in QTc, 
placebo -adjusted and corrected for HR based on the Fridericia correction method (QTcF) method 
(∆∆QTcF).  
15.4.2  Secondary E ndpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include: 
• QTc with Bazett correction (QTcB) ; 
• Heart rate; 
• PR interval ; 
• QRS interval ; 
• Uncorr ected QT interval ; 
• ECG morphology. 
15.4.3  Central Tendency Analyses  
The primary analysis for the QT/QTc data in this study is based on the time -matched analysis for 
each treatment group. This time -matched analysis will be based upon the endpoint “change from 
baseline in the QTc F interval, placebo-adjusted – ΔΔ QTc.” Baseline is defined as the mean of 
the 9  ECGs (3 sets of triplicate ECGs) recorded at baseline (P1V1). Note that the measurements 
from the three ECGs collected at a time point are averaged to produce a single value for each 
ECG interval for that time point . These baseline and Day  1 post -dose ECG data, for each 
Treatment Period, will then be subjected to a mixed effects model (using the SAS Procedure PROC MIXED) with the following covariates: time (categorical), treatment, time by treatment interacti on, region, gender, and the baseline value of the parameter . Since this is a crossover 
design, period and sequence terms will necessarily also be included in the model . Subject will be 
included as a random effect . Gender  and region effects will be investig ated as specified below . 
Should a significant treatment by gender /region  interaction be observed, it will also be included 
in the model . The estimate s of the ΔΔQTc at each time point and its confidence intervals (CI) 
will be performed using a LSMEAN statement within PROC MIXED and a diff option. For this 
analysis a 90% two -sided confidence interval will be calculated. Hypotheses will be based upon 
the Intersection -Union test. Since the Intersection -Union test can be applied here, no multiple 
endpoint adjust ment is needed . Based on the ICH E14 guidance, the hypothesis will be evaluated 
by observing if any of the time points have a two -sided 90% upper confidence bound (i.e. one -
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 75 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 sided 95%) which is equal to, or exceeds, 10 ms.  
The upper limit of the two -sided 90% CI on treatment will be compared to the 10 ms bound only 
for APL -130277 versus placebo. If the upper limit of the two- sided 90% CI for APL -130277 
versus placebo falls below 10 ms, it will be concluded that  APL -130277 does not prolong the 
QTc interval to  a clinically significant degree.  
The 7 time points to be evaluated for the primary analysis include 15, 30, 45 60 minutes and 2, 3, 
and 4 hours post -dose. If only 1 or 2 of the 7 timepoints for APL -130277 just exceeded 10  ms, a 
determination of whether this is a false positive response relied on all of the study findings with 
special emphasis on the PK -PD model described below. 
The analysis also will be presented in a graphical manner: for each comparison of interest all CI’s (corresponding to the number of post -baseline time points) will be presented superimposed 
in one graph showing moxifloxacin and APL-130277, all of which have been placebo -adjusted . 
A similar analysis will be conducted for QTcB . 
15.4.4  Establishment  of Assay Sensitivity 
To establish assay sens itivity, there should be at least one time point where the lower confidence 
bound of the mean difference of moxifloxacin and placebo is greater than 5 ms . The same model 
as described for the time- matched analyses will be used for this analysis.  
The hypothe sis of assay sensitivity will be rejected if the lower limit of the one -sided 
(Bonferroni corrected) 95% confidence interval is never above 5 ms . However, detecting the 
positive control’s effect will establish the ability of the study to detect such an eff ect of the study 
drug. 
For purposes of determining assay sensitivity, 4 time points (i.e., hours 1, 2, 3, and 4) will be 
utilized for calculating the one -sided 95% (i.e. two- sided 90%) confidence limits . In this case, 
since the alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the time points is greater than or equal to 5 ms, a multiplicity adjustment is necessary . Therefore, the confidence intervals will be 
calculated using Bonferroni adjustment, specifically an adjusted alpha error level of 0.05/4 = 0.0125. Note that although only these time points will be used to assess assay 
sensitivity, the calculated upper and lower confidence bounds (Bonferroni -corrected) for the 
entire moxifloxacin profile will be displayed.  
15.4.5  Outlier Analyses  
An outlier or categorical an alysis supplements the central tendency analysis by determining if 
there were subjects who had an exaggerated effect on any ECG interval that would not be revealed in a mean change from baseline central tendency analysis. Each subject would be considered having an outlier value based on the most extreme value across all of the time points.  
The following criteria (“study endpoints”) are defined for this analysis:

QTcB interval at a pre- determined post -dose time point  is > 480 ms when the subject’s 
baseline mean QTcB interval is ≤ 480 ms and when a pre -determined post -dose time 
point is >  450 ms when the subject’s baseline mean QTcB interval is ≤ 450 ms . In 
addition, the proportion of subjects with changes from baseline in >  30-60 ms and 
> 60 ms will be reported.

As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the study, the Investigator agrees to 
maintain accurate CRFs and source documentation as part of the case histories for all subjects 
who sign an ICF. 
The vendor selected to perform CRF design will be responsible for drafting CRFs for the study, 
which Sunovion will review and approve before implementation. An electronic CRF may be 
used instead of paper CRFs, and the term CRF is synonymous for both types of CRFs. 
Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 82 
CTH -201 
28 Aug 2017  CONFIDENTIAL  Version: 5.00 CRFs are considered confidential documents and should be handled and stored accordingly. 
Sunovion or its designee will provide the necessary training on the use of the specific CRF 
system used during the study to ensure that the information is captured accurately and appropriately. 
In order to ensure data accuracy, CRF data for individual subject visits should be completed as 
soon as possible following the visit in accordance with the site Clinical Trial Agreement in place . 
CRFs will be reviewed by the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) during monitoring visits. The 
CRA will ver ify data recorded with source documents. 
A copy of all the CRFs will be sent securely to Sunovion at the end of the study. 
If the study is managed using an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, the Investigator agrees to maintain accurate CRFs/EDC modules and source documentation as part of the case histories 
for all subjects  who sign an ICF.  
CRFs/EDC modules are considered confidential documents and should be handled and stored accordingly. Sunovion or its designee will provide the necessary training on th e use of the 
specific EDC system used during the study to ensure that the information is captured accurately and appropriately. 
In order to ensure data accuracy, EDC module data for individual subject  visits should be 
completed as soon as possible following the visit and in accordance with the site Clinical Trial 
Agreement in place. EDC data will be reviewed by the CRA during monitoring visits. The CRA 
will verify data recorded with source documents.  
All corrections or changes requested to the study data must be made as soon as possible by the study site, and verified by the Investigator. When all incorrect and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for, EDC data will be considered complete. 
The site is expected to notify the Study Medical Monitor before breaking the study blind, unless 
it is in the subject ’s best interest if the blind is broken immediately. All corrections or changes 
made to any study data must be appropriately tracked in an audit trail. When all incorrect and/or inconsistent data has been accounted for, CRFs will be considered complete. 
16.3.3  Source Documents  
All information recorded in the CRF must be supported by corresponding source documentation. 
Examples of acceptable source documentation include but are not limited to hospital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, and recorded data from automated instruments,

clinical site will be monitored by Sunovion and/or it’s designate to ensure compliance with the 
protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines. As representatives of Sunovion, CRAs 
are responsible for following the study protocol closely and notifying project management of any noted deviations. The assigned CRA (s) will visit the Investigator and clinical site at periodic 
intervals and maintain periodic communication. The CRA(s) will maintain current knowledge of the study through observation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion of th e conduct of the study with the Investigator and staff. While on site, the CRA(s) will review 
regulatory documents, compare entries in the source documents, and review investigational drug accountability records. The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correction of any noted inconsistencies.  
By signing the protocol, the Investigator agrees to meet with the CRA during clinical site visits, to ensure that study staff is available to the CRA(s) as needed, to provide the CRA(s) access to all study documentation and medical records , to the clinical supplies dispensing and storage area, 
and agrees to assist the monitors in their activities, if requested. The Investigator also agrees to allow inspectors from regulatory agencies to review records and to assist the inspectors in their duties, if requested. 
16.4.2  Routine  Data  Collection  
CRFs will be reviewed by the CRA during monitoring visits. The CRA will verify data with 
source documents. If the CRA’s comparison of the original CRF data with source documents reveals data discrepancies or omissions that require study staff to make corrections, corrections will be made. After the CRF data have been monitored and all corrections have been made, the Investigator must appropriately document within the data system his/her agreement with the data contained therein. If corrections are required subsequent to the Investigator’s signature, the Investigator must document his/her agreement with the CRF data to confirm the accuracy of the changed data. A copy of all CRF data will be retained at the clinical site. If corrections are required after all data have been electronically transferred, corrections that have been made must be verified in writing by the Investigator, and new data provided to Sunovion.

                   MDS-UPDRS 
 
  
The Movement Disorder Society (MDS)-sponsored new version of the UPDRS is founded on the critique 
that was formulated by the Task Force for Rating Scales in Parkinson’s disease ( Mov Disord 2003;18:738-750).   
Thereafter, the MDS recruited a Chairperson to orga nize a program to provide the Movement Disorder 
community with a new version of the UPDRS that would maintain the overall format of the original UPDRS, but 
address issues identified in the critique as weakness es and ambiguities. The Chairperson identified 
subcommittees with chairs and members. Each part was written by the appropriate sub committee members 
and then reviewed and ratified 
by the entire gr oup. These members are listed below.  
 
 
The MDS- UPDRS has four parts:  Part I (non-mo tor experience s of daily living), Part II (motor 
experiences of daily living, Part III (motor examination) and Pa
rt IV (mot or complications).  Part I has two 
components: IA concerns a number of behaviors that ar e assessed by the investigator  with all pertinent 
information from patients and caregive
rs, and IB is co mpleted by the patient with or without the aid of the 
caregiver, but independen
tly of the investigator.  These sections can, however, be reviewed by the rater to 
ensure that all questions are answered clearly and the rater can help ex plain any perceived ambiguities. Part II
is designed to be a self-administered questionnaire like Part IB, but can be reviewed by the 
investigator to ensure completeness and clarity. Of note, the official versio ns of Part IA, Part IB and Pa rt II of
the MDS-UPDRS do not have separate on or off ratings.  However, for individual  programs or protocols the same
questions can be used separately for on and off. Part III has instructions for the rater to give or  demonstrate
to the patient; it is completed by the rater.  Part IV has instructions for th e rater and also instructions to be read
to the patient. This part integrates patient-derived information with the rater’s clinical observations and judgments 
and is completed by the rater.

Page 2  Part I:  Non-Motor Aspects of Ex periences of Daily Living (nM-EDL)   
Overview:  This portion of the scale assesses the non- motor impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on patients’ 
experiences of daily living. There are 13 questions.  Part 1A  is administered by the rater (six questions) and focuses 
on complex behaviors.  Part 1B is a component of the self-administered Patient Questionnaire that covers seven 
questions on non-motor experiences of daily living.  
  
Part 1A:  In administering Part IA, the examiner should use the following guidelines: 
 
1.   Mark at the top of the form t he primary data source as patient, caregi ver, or patient and caregiver in equal 
proportion.     
2.   The response to each item should refer to a period encompassing the prior week including the day on which the 
information is collected.  
3.    All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing scores).  In the event that an item does not 
apply or cannot be rated (e.g., amputee who cannot walk), the item is marked UR for Unable to Rate. 
4.  The answers should reflect the usual level of function and words such as “usually”, “generally”, “most of the time” 
can be used with patients. 
5.  Each question has a text for you to read (Instruction s to patients/caregiver).  After that statement, you can 
elaborate and probe based on the target symptoms outlined in the Instructions to examiner.  You should NOT 
READ the RATING OPTIONS to the patient/caregiver, because these are written in medical terminology.  From 
the interview and probing, you will use your medica l judgment to arrive at the best response.  
6.  Patients may have co-morbidities and other medical condi tions that can affect their function.  You and the patient 
must rate the problem as it exists and do not attempt to  separate elements due to Parkinson’s disease from other 
conditions.   
EXAMPLE OF NAVIGATING THROUGH TH E RESPONSE OPTIONS FOR PART 1A  
 Suggested strategies for obtaini ng the most accurate answer: 
After reading the instructions to the patient, you will need to  probe the entire domain under discussion to determine 
Normal vs. problematic:  If your questions do not identify any problem in this domain, record 0 and move on to the 
next question.   
If your questions identify a problem in this domain, you sh ould work next with a reference anchor at the mid-range 
(option 2 or Mild) to find out if the patient functions at this  level, better or worse.  You will not be reading the choices of  
responses to the patient  as the responses use clinical terminology.  You will be asking enough probing questions to 
determine the response that should be coded.  
Work up and down the options with the patient to identify  the most accurate response, giving a final check by 
excluding the options above and below the selected response. 
Is this item normal for you? 
Consider mild (2) as a reference point 
and then compare with slight (1). 
Consider moderate (3) to see if this 
answer fits better. 
Consider severe (4) to see if this 
answer fits better. 
‘Yes, severe is closest.’ ‘No, I have problems.’ 
If mild is closer than slight. Mark (0) Normal. 
Confirm and mark (1) Slight. 
Confirm and mark (2) Mild. 
Confirm and mark (3) Moderate. 
Confirm and mark (4) Severe. If moderate is closer than mild. ‘Yes’. 
‘Yes, slight is closest’. 
‘No, moderate is too severe’. 
‘No, severe is too severe’.

To be read to the patient: I am going to ask you six questi ons about behaviors that you may or may not experience.  
Some questions concern common problems and some concern uncommon ones.  If you have a problem in one of the areas, please choose the best response that describes  how you have felt MOST OF THE TIME during the PAST 
WEEK. If you are not bothered by a problem, you can simply respond NO.  I am trying to be thorough, so I may ask 
questions that have nothing to do with you.

Instructions:   
 
This questionnaire will ask you about y our experiences of daily living.  
 There are 20 questions.  We are trying to be thorough, and some of these questions may 
therefore not apply to you now or ever.  If you do not have the prob lem, simply mark 0 for NO.  
 Please read each one carefully and read all answers before selecting the one that best applies to you.   We are interested in your average or usual f unction over the past week including today.  
Some patients can do things better at one time of the day than at other s.  However, only one 
answer is allowed for each question, so please ma rk the answer that best  describes what you 
can do most of the time
. 
 You may have other medical condi tions besides Parkinson’s disease.  Do not worry about 
separating Parkinson’s disease from other conditions.  Just  answer the question with your 
best response.     Use only 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for answers, not hing else.  Do not leave any blanks.  
 Your doctor or nurse can review  the questions with you, but th is questionnaire is for patients 
to complete, either alone or with their caregivers.

This completes the questionnaire.  We may have asked about problems you do not even have, 
and may have mentioned problems that you may never dev elop at all.  Not all patients develop all 
these problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every 
patient.  Thank you for your time and attent ion in completing this questionnaire.

  July 1, 2008  Part III:   Motor Examination    
 
Overview:  This portion of the scale assesses the motor signs of PD.  In administering Part III of the MDS-UPDRS  
the examiner sh
ould comply with the following guidelines: 
 At the top of the form, mark whether the patient is 
on m edication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease 
and, if on levodopa, the time since the last dose.   
 
Also, if the patient is receiving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease, mark the patient’s 
clinical state using the following definitions:  
ON is the typical functional state when patients ar e receiving medication and have a good response.   
OFF is the typical functional state when patients hav e a poor response in spite of taking medications. 
 The investigator should “rate what you see”.  Admittedly,  concurrent medical problems such as stroke, paralysis, 
arthritis, contracture, and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with 
individual items in the motor examination.  In situations where it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations, 
plegia, limb in a cast), use the notation “ UR” for Unable to Rate.  Otherwise, rate the performance of each task as the 
patient performs in the context of co-morbidities. 
 
All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings). 
 
Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item.  These should be followed in all instances. The 
investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter.  For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17 ), these items have been pla
 ced 
purposefully at the 
end of the scale because clinical inform ation pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the 
entire examination.  At the end of the rating, indicate if dy skinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time of the examination, and if 
so, whether these movements interfer ed with the motor examination.  
 
 
3a   Is the patient on medication for treating the sy mptoms of Parkinson’s Disease?        

 No    
 Yes 
   
 
3b    If the patient is receiving medication for tr eating the symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease,

3.3  RIGIDITY    
 
Instructions to examiner :  Rigidity is judged on slow passive movement of major joints with the patient in 
a relaxed position and the examiner manipulating the limbs and neck.  First, test without an activation 
maneuver.  Test and rate neck and each limb separately.  For arms, test the wrist and elbow joints 
simultaneously. For legs, test the hip and knee joints  simultaneously. If no rigidity is detected, use an 
activation maneuver such as tapping fingers, fist opening/closing, or heel tapping in a limb not being 
tested. Explain to the patient to go as limp as possible as you test for rigidity.   
 
0:  Normal:   No rigidity. 
 
1:  Slight:  Rigidity only detected with activation maneuver.   
 
2:  Mild:  Rigidity detected without the acti vation maneuver, but full range of motion is easily 
achieved.  
 
3:  Moderate: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver; full range of motion is achieved 
with effort.   
 
4:  Severe: Rigidity detected without the activation maneuver and full range of motion not 
achieved.

towards the examiner so that both right and left sides of the body can be easily observed 
simultaneously.  The patient should walk at least 10 meters (30 feet), then turn around and return to the 
examiner. This item measures multiple behaviors: stride amplitude, stride speed, height of foot lift, heel 
strike during walking, turning, and arm swing, but not freezing. Assess also for “freezing of gait” (next 
item 3.11) while patient is walking.    Observe posture for item 3.13

 3.12 POSTURAL STABILITY    
   
Instructions to examiner
:  The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a 
quick, forceful  pull on the shoulders while the patient is  standing erect with eyes open and feet 
comfortably apart and parallel to each other.  Test  retropulsion.  Stand behind the patient and instruct 
the patient on what is about to happen. Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid 
falling. There should be a solid wall behind the examiner, at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the observation of the number of retropulsive steps. The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated.  The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards 
the examiner with enough force to displace the cent er of gravity so that patient MUST take a step 
backwards.  The examiner needs to be ready to catch t he patient, but must stand sufficiently back so as 
to allow enough room for the patient to take severa l steps to recover independently.  Do not allow the 
patient to flex the body abnormally forward in antici pation of the pull.  Observe for the number of steps 
backwards or falling.  Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal 
ratings begin with three steps.  If the patient fails to understand the test, the examiner can repeat the 
test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects  the patient’s limitations 
rather than misunderstanding or lack of prepar edness.  Observe standing posture for item 3.13 
 
0:  Normal:  No problems:  Recovers with one or two steps.   
 
1:  Slight:  3-5 steps, but subject recovers unaided.   
 
2:  Mild: More than 5 steps, but subject recovers unaided. 
 
3:  Moderate: Stands safely, but with absence of  postural response; falls if not caught by 
examiner. 
 
4:  Severe:  Very unstable, tends to lose bal ance spontaneously or with just a gentle pull on 
the shoulders.  
  
Page 24   July 1, 2008   
3.13  POSTURE  
   
Instructions to examiner : Posture is assessed with the patient st anding erect after arising from a chair, 
during walking , and while being tested for postural refl exes.  If you notice poor posture, tell the patient 
to stand up straight and see if the posture improves (see option 2 below).  Rate the worst posture seen in these three observation points.  Observe for flexion and side-to-side leaning.  
 
0:  Normal:  No problems. 
 
1:  Slight:   Not quite erect, but posture could be normal for older person. 
 
2:  Mild:   Definite flexion, scoliosis or leaning to one side, but patient can correct posture to 
normal posture when asked to do so.  
 3:   Moderate: Stooped posture, scoliosis or leaning to one side that cannot be corrected 
volitionally to a normal posture by the patient.  
 
4: Severe: Flexion, scoliosis or leanin g with extreme abnormality of posture.

3.14  GLOBAL SPONTANEITY OF MOVEMENT (BODY BRADYKINESIA) 
 Instructions to examiner
:  This global rating combines all observations on slowness, hesitancy, and

3.16  KINETIC TREMOR OF THE HANDS   
 
Instructions to examiner :  This is tested by the finger-to-nose maneuver. With the arm starting from the 
outstretched position, have the pati ent perform at least three finger-to-nose maneuvers with each hand 
reaching as far as possible to touch the exam iner’s finger. The finger-to-nose maneuver should be 
performed slowly enough not to hide any tremor that c ould occur with very fast arm movements. Repeat 
with the other hand, rating each hand separately.  The tremor can be present throughout the movement 
or as the tremor reaches either target (nose or finger).  Rate the highest amplitude seen.  
0:  Normal:   No tremor.   
1:  Slight:   Tremor is present but less than 1 cm in amplitude.

Overview and Instructions:  In this section, the rater us es historical and objective information to assess two motor 
complications, dyskinesias and motor fluctuations that incl ude OFF-state dystonia.  Use all information from patient, 
caregiver, and the examination to ans wer the six questions that summarize function over the past week including 
today.  As in the other sections, rate using only integers ( no half points allowed) and leave no missing ratings.  If the 
item cannot be rated, place UR for Unable to Rate. You will need to choose some answers based on percentages, 
and therefore you will need to establis h how many hours generally are awake hours and use this figure as the 
denominator for “OFF” time and Dyskinesias.  For “OFF dy stonia”, the total “Off” time will be the denominator.    
Operational definitions for examiner’s use.    
Dyskinesias: Involuntary random movements 
Words that patients often recognize for dyskinesias include “irre gular jerking”, “wiggling”, “twi tching”.  It is essential to 
stress to the patient the difference between dyskinesia s and tremor, a common error when patients are assessing 
dyskinesias .   
 
Dystonia: contorted posture, oft en with a twisting component:   
Words that patients often recognize for dystoni a include “spasms”, “cramps”, “posture”.   
 Motor fluctuation:  Variable response to medication:  
Words that patients often recognize for motor fluctuation in clude “wearing out”, “wearing off”, “roller-coaster effect”, 
“on-off”,  “uneven medication effects”.   
 
OFF:  Typical functional state when pati ents have a poor response in spite of ta king mediation or the typical functional 
response when patients are on NO treatment for parkinsonism.  Words that patients often recognize include “low 
time”, “bad time”, “shaking time”, “slow ti me”, “time when my medications don’t work.” 
 
ON:  Typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response:  
Words that patients often recognize include “good time”,  “walking time”, “time when my medications work.” 
 
A .  DYSKINESIAS [exclusive of OFF-state dystonia]   
 
4.1 TIME SPENT WITH DYSKINESIAS  
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the hours in the usual  waking day and then the hours of 
dyskinesias.  Calculate the percenta ge.  If the patient has dyskinesias in the office, you can point them 
out as a reference to ensure that patients and caregivers understand what they are rating. You may also 
use your own acting skills to enact the dyskinetic mo vements you have seen in the patient before or 
show them dyskinetic movements typical of other pat ients.  Exclude from this question early morning 
and nighttime painful dystonia.  Instructions to patient [and caregiver].
   Over the past week,  how many hours do you usually sleep on a 
daily basis, including nighttime sleep and daytime napping? Alright, if you sleep ___ hrs, you are awake ____ hrs.  Out of those awake hours, how many hours in total do you have wiggling, twitching or jerking 
movements?  Do not count the times when you have tremor, which is a regular back and forth shaking 
or times when you have painful foot  cramps or spasms in 
 the early mo rning or at nighttime.  I will ask 
about those later.   Concentrate only on these types of wigg ling, jerking and irregular m ovements.  Add

4.2 FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF DYSKINESIAS  
 
Instructions to examiner:   Determine the degree to which dyskinesias impact on the patient’s daily 
function in terms of activities and social interactions.  Use the patient’s and caregiver’s response to your 
question and your own observations during the o ffice visit to arrive at the best answer.  
  Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
 Over the past week, did you usually have trouble doing things or 
being with people when these jerking movements occurred?  Did they stop you from doing things or from being with people? 
 
0:  Normal: No dyskinesias or no impact by dyskinesias on activities or social interactions.  
1:  Slight: Dyskinesias impact on a few acti vities, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods.   
 2:  Mild: Dyskinesias impact on many activi ties, but the patient usually performs all 
activities and participates in all social interactions during dyskinetic periods.    
 3:  Moderate: Dyskinesias impact on activities to the point that the patient usually does not 
perform some activities or does not usually participate in some social activities 
during dyskinetic episodes.    
 
4:  Severe: Dyskinesias impact on function to the point that the patient usually does not 
perform most activities or participate in most social interactions during dyskinetic episodes.

4.3  TIME SPENT IN THE OFF STATE   
Instructions to examiner:
  Use the number of waking hours deri ved from 4.1 and determine the hours 
spent in the “OFF” state.  Calcul ate the percentage.  If the patient has an OFF period in the office, you 
can point to this state as a reference. You may al so use your knowledge of the patient to describe a 
typical OFF period.  Additionally you may use y our own acting skills to enact an OFF period you have 
seen in the patient before or show them OFF function  typical of other patients.  Mark down the typical 
number of OFF hours, because you will need this number for completing 4.6   Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:     Some patients with Parkinson's disease have a good effect 
from their medications throughout their awake hours and we call that “ON” time.   Other patients take their medications but still have some hours of low ti me, bad time, slow time or shaking time.  Doctors 
call these low periods “OFF” time. Ov er the past week, you told me before that you are generally awake  
____ hrs each day. Out of these awake hours,  how many  hours in total do you usually have this type of 
low level or OFF function  ____ (Use this number for your calculations).

4.4  FUNCTIONAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS   
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the degree to which motor fluctuations impact on the patient’s daily 
function in terms of activities and social interact ions.  This question concentrates on the difference 
between the ON state and the OFF state.  If the pat ient has no OFF time, the rating must be 0, but if 
patients have very mild fluctuations, it is still possible to be rated 0 on th is item if no impact on activities 
occurs. Use the patient’s and caregiver’s response to your question and your own observations during 
the office visit to arrive at the best answer.    Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
 Think about when those low or “OFF” periods have occurred over 
the past week.  Do you usually have more problems doing things or being with people than compared to the rest of the day when you feel your medicati ons working? Are there some things you usually do 
during a good period that you have trouble with or stop doing during a low period?  
0:  Normal: No fluctuations or No impact by  fluctuations on performance of activities or 
social interactions.  
 
1:  Slight: Fluctuations impact on a few acti vities, but during OFF, the patient usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typically 
occur during the ON state.   
 2:  Mild: Fluctuations impact many activiti es, but during OFF, the patient still usually 
performs all activities and participates in all social interactions that typically 
occur during the ON state.   
 
3:  Moderate: Fluctuations i
mpact on the performan ce of activities during OFF to the point that 
the patient usually does not perform some activities or participate in some social interactions that are performed during ON periods.    
   
4:  Severe: Fluctuations impact on function to the point that, during OFF, the patient usually 
does not perform most activities or partic ipate in most social interactions that 
are performed during ON periods.

 4.5  COMPLEXITY OF MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS  
 
Instructions to examiner:
  Determine the usual predictability of OFF function whether due to dose, time 
of day, food intake or other factors.  Use the information provid ed by the patients and caregiver and 
supplement with your own observations. You will ask if the patient can count on them always coming at 
a special time, mostly coming at a special time (in wh ich case you will probe furt her to separate slight 
from mild), only sometimes coming at a special time  or are they totally unpredictable?   Narrowing down 
the percentage will allow you to find the correct answer.   Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:
  For some patients, the low or “OFF” periods happen at  certain 
times during day or when they do activities like eati ng or exercising. Over the past week, do you usually 
know when your low periods will occur?  In other words, do your low periods always  come at a certain 
time?  Do they mostly  come at a certain time? Do they only sometimes  come at a certain time?  Are 
your low periods totally unpredictable?”  
0:  Normal: No motor fluctuations.  
 
1:  Slight:   OFF times are predictable all or almost all of the time (> 75%). 
 
2:  Mild:   OFF times are predictable most of the time (51-75%). 
 
3:  Moderate: OFF times are predictable some of the time (26-50%).  
4: Severe: OFF episodes are rarely predictable. (<
 25%).

4.6  PAINFUL OFF-STATE DYSTONIA   
 
Instructions to examiner :  For patients who have motor fluctuat ions, determine what proportion of the 
OFF episodes usually includes painful dystonia? Y ou have already determined the number of hours of 
“OFF” time (4.3). Of these hours, determine how ma ny are associated with dy stonia and calculate the 
percentage.  If there is no OFF time, mark 0. 
 
Instructions to patient [and caregiver]:    In one of the questions I asked earlier, you said you generally 
have ___ hours of low or “OFF” time when your Parkinso n's disease is under poor control.  During these 
low or “OFF” periods, do you usually have painful cramps or spasms?  Out of the total ____ hrs of this 
low time, if you add up all the time in a day when these painful cramps come, how many hours would 
this make?  
 
0:  Normal:  No dystonia OR NO OFF TIME.    
1:  Slight: < 25% of time in OFF state.  
2:  Mild:  26-50% of time in OFF state. 
 3:  Moderate: 51-75% of time in OFF state.  
 
4:  Severe: > 75% of time in OFF state. 
  
Summary statement to patient :  READ TO PATIENT 
 This completes my rating of your Parkinson’s disease.  I know the questions and tasks have taken several minutes, 
but I wanted to be complete and cover all possibilities. In  doing so, I may have asked about problems you do not even 
have, and I may have mentioned problems that you may never develop at all.  Not all patients develop all these 
problems, but because they can occur, it is important to ask all the questions to every patient.  Thank you for your time 
and attention in completing this scale with me.

SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR  
(Check all that apply, so long as these are separate events; must  ask about all types)  Past X Year s 
or 
Lifetime  
Actual Attempt:   
A potentially self -injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act.  Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent 
does not have to be 100%.  If there is any intent/desire to di e associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not 
have to be any injury or harm , just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results , 
this is considered an attempt.   
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circums tances. For example, a highly lethal 
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide  can be inferred (e.g. , gunshot to head, jumping from window of a high floor/story). Also, if 
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.  
Have you made a suicide attempt?  
Have you done anythin g to harm yourself?  
Have you done anything dangerous where you could have died?  
What did you do?  
Did you______ as a way to end your life?  
Did you want to die (even a little) when you_____?  
Were you trying to end your life when you _____?  
Or did you think  it was possible you could have died from _____ ? 
Or did you do it purely for other reasons / without ANY int ention of killing yourself (like to relieve stress, feel better, get sympathy, 
or get something else to happen)?   (Self-Injurious Behavior without su icidal intent)

Interrupted Attempt:    
When the person is interrupted (by an outside circumstance)  from starting the potentially self -injurious act  (if not for that, actual attempt would have 
occurred).  
Overdose: Person has pills in hand but is stopped from ingesting.  Once they ingest any pills, this becomes an attempt rather  than an interrupted attem pt. 
Shooting: Person has gun pointed toward self, gun is taken away by someone else, or is somehow prevented from pulling trigger . Once they pull the trigger, 
even if the gun fails to fire, it is an attempt. Jumping: Person is poised to jump, is grabbed an d taken down from ledge. Hanging: Person has noose around neck 
but has not yet started to hang - is stopped from doing so.

Answer for Actual Attempts Only  Most Lethal  
Attempt  
Date:  
Actual Lethality/Medical Damage:   
0.  No physical damage or very minor physical damage (e.g. , surface scratches).  
1.  Minor physical damage (e.g. , lethargic speech; first -degree burns; mild bleeding; sprains).  
2.  Moderate physical damage; medical attention needed (e.g. , conscious but sleepy, somewhat responsive; second -degree burns; bleeding of major vessel).  
3.  Moderately severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization and likely intensive care required (e.g. , comatose with reflexes intact; third -degree bu rns 
less than 20% of body; extensive blood loss but can recover; major fractures).  
4.  Severe physical damage; medical  hospitalization with intensive care required (e.g. , comatose without reflexes; third -degree burns over 20% of body; 
extensive blood loss with unstable vital signs; major damage to a vital area).  
5.  Death

______  
Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality=0  
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medica l damage, had potential for very serious 
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with on coming train but pulled away 
before run over).  
 
0 = Behavior not likely to result in injur y 
1 = Behavior likely to result in injury but not likely to cause death  
2 = Behavior likely to result in death despite available medical care

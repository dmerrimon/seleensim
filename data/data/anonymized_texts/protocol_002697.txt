Tracheal extubation in patients undergoing head and neck surgery may be followed by severa
l 
respiratory complications, such as coughing, desaturation, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and airway 
obstruction
s
.
1, 2
 
The trachea can be extubated when the patient is still deeply anaesthetized or after 
he/she fully regains consciousness. Currently, the de
fault method of extubation at Massachusetts Eye 
and Ear Infirmary (MEEI) is deep extubation. In contrast, the default method of extubation in most 
centers in the United States is awake extubation.
 
 
Respiratory complications may occur following both deep an
d awake extubation, and the superiority 
of one method over another has not been established. When the trachea is extubated in light stages of 
anesthesia or after the patient has regained consciousness, there can be significant increases in heart 
rate and a
rterial pressure that may continue into the recovery period. This increase in blood pressure 
and heart rate may be partially due to straining during extubation. In patients in whom these 
stimulatory effects can be detrimental, tracheal extubation under dee
p anesthesia may reduce the 
incidence and degree of these complications; however, tracheal extubation under deep anesthesia may 
cause respiratory complications, including laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and negative pressure 
pulmonary edema.
3
 
 
There is a pauci
ty of research related to deep or awake extubation in adults. Specifically, such studies 
are lacking in patients who undergo head and neck surgery. In a prospective survey of respiratory 
complications of tracheal intubation and extubation of 1005 patients 
16 years or older who underwent 
elective general anesthesia, Asai et al found that the incidence of respiratory complications was higher 
in the deep versus the awake extubation group, regardless of the type of operation.
3
 
 
However, studies in the pediatric
 
population have shown a different picture. In children undergoing 
adenotonsillectomy, von Ungern
-
Sternberg et al have shown that patients who were extubated while 
awake had a higher incidence of severe coughing and desaturation at emergence, as well as a 
higher 
rate of hoarse voice on the first postoperative day.
4
 
Although there was no difference in the instances 
of oxygen desaturation between the two methods of extubation, these episodes tended to be more 
common and of longer duration in the awake group. In contrast, the children who were extubated 
while deeply an
aesthetized showed an overall higher incidence of partial airway obstruction.
 
 
Given the serious nature of untoward respiratory events in the perioperative period associated with 
tracheal extubation, 
w
e propose a prospective observational cohort study 
to f
urther assess
 
the 
perioperative respiratory complications of deep extubation
, 
the defa
ult method of extubation at MEE
 
in adults undergoi
ng head and neck surgery
.

STUDY DESIGN
 
Provide a detailed description of the study design (e.g. cross
-
sectional, stratified, longitudinal, 
prospective cohort, case
-
control, randomized, placebo
-
controlled, masked/double masked, feasibility, 
pilot, proof
-
of
-
concept, etc.).  
 
Explain why this stud
y design is appropriate for this study. 
 
 
Response
:
 
 
Our study is a prospective observational cohort study.
 
We will 
record 
the 
respiratory complications
, 
such as bronchospasm, laryngospasm, respiratory depression, desaturation, persistent cough, and 
apnea 
after deep extubation in patients undergoi
ng head and neck surgery at MEE
. 
 
 
We will also collect following data:
 
 
1) Length of time from the end of surgery to leaving the OR;
 
2) Length of stay from admission to the PACU to discharge home; 
 
3) Any unplanne
d hospital admission due to perioperative respiratory adverse events.

SUBJECT INFORMATION
 
a)
 
Target Enrollment
-
 
Specify the number of subjects you plan to enroll and justify why this 
number is sufficient to achieve adequate power for statistical analysis taking into account 
anticipated screen failures and drop
-
outs. Include sample size by cohort i
f the study has 
multiple cohorts.  
 
 
Response:
 
Our proposed sample size of 300 patients will enable us to report the complication rates 
with adequate precision in terms of a sufficiently narrow two
-
sided 95% confidence interval. For 
example, if the observe
d respiratory complication rate is 30%, as was reported by Asai T et al (1), our 
confidence interval will have a half
-
width of 5%. If a complication rate that we observe is 35%, the 
half
-
width of our confidence interval will be 6% (nQuery Advisor version 7
). We have used nQuery 
Advisor version 7 for the calculation of our sample size. For a CI of 95%, 
α
 = 0.05, P= 80%, and a 
complication rate of deep extubation of 30%, as reported by Asai T et al (Asai T, Koga K, Vaughan 
RS, et al. Respiratory complications
 
associated with tracheal intubation and extubation. Br. J. Anesth. 
1998, 80, 767
–
775.), we will require a sample size of 300.

please specify the total number of subjects required by all sites to achieve sufficient power.
 
 
Response
:
 
N/A
 
 
c)
 
Provide justification that 
the researchers have access to sufficient numbers of eligible subjects 
to meet target enrollment goals (e.g., researcher’s own patients, clinic patients with a specific 
diagnosis, subjects from previous studies who agree to participate in future studies).
 
 
Response:
 
Potentially eligible subjects for this study are all adult patients who undergo head and neck 
surgery as well as deep extubation at the end of the surgery per the discretion of the anesthesiologist 
assigned t
o the case. Deep extubation is the
 
de
fault extubation method practiced at MEE. Therefore, 
there will be a sufficient number of potentially eligible subjects to
 
meet the target enrollment goals

Hypotheses ar
e more specific than specific aims and are tested using 
predetermined 
statistical 
methods 
and 
form the basis for statistical power calculations.  The primary hypothesis is a statement 
of the effect of the research intervention/interaction on the primary 
outcome measure.  Hypotheses are 
generally stated as the null and alternative hypotheses (H0, Ha) as they have their basis in inferential 
statistics.  Rejecting the null hypothesis with a specific level of probability indicates that there is a 
relationship
 
between the variables being studied.  State the alternative hypothesis which you expect 
your data to support.
 
 
Examples of null and alternative hypotheses 
 
 
•
 
H0: Chronic sinusitis prevalence rates are not different among children from low and high 
socioeconomic groups 
 
•
 
Ha: Chronic sinusitis prevalence rates are different among children from low and high 
socioeconomic groups.
 
 
 
a)
 
Describe the primary hypothesis:
 
 
Response:
 
 
H0: The rate of perioperative respiratory complications of deep extubation in adults 
undergoing head 
and neck surgery 
at MEE is not different among other institutions.
 
Ha: The rate of perioperative respiratory complications of deep extubation in
 
adults undergoing head 
and neck surgery at MEE is differ
e
nt than other institutions. 
 
b)
 
Describe any secondary hypotheses. 
 
 
Response
:
 
 
1
) Length of time from end of surgery to leaving the operating room;
 
2
) Length of stay from admission to and discharge 
from the PACU
 
Stage 1 and 2
;
 
3
) Incidence of unexpected hospital stay related to perioperative respiratory complications.
 
4
)
 
Incidence of sore throat.
 
 
Is there a significant association between the lengths of time from end of surgery to leaving the 
operating room with the perioperative respiratory complications?
 
 
Is there a significant relationship between the lengths of stay from admission to and discharge 
from the PACU?
 
 
What is the incidence of unexpected hospital stay associated with perioperativ
e respiratory 
complications?
 
 
What is the incidence of sore throat?

Describe the planned statistical methods including specific tests (e.g., parametric and non
-
parametric 
tests, estimation of incidence and prevalence rates, odds 
ratios, survival/failure analyses, intent to treat 
analyses).  Provide the power calculations used to estimate the proposed sample size.  If needed, 
please consult a biostatistician.  (Note: Biostatistical consults are available through Harvard Catalyst.)
 
 
Response
:
 
Our proposed sample size of 300 patients will enable us to report the complication rates with adequate 
precision in terms of a sufficiently narrow two
-
sided 95% confidence interval. For example, if the 
observed respiratory complication rate is 30%, as was 
reported by Asai T et al (1), our confidence 
interval will have a half
-
width of 5%. If a complication rate that we observe is 35%, the half
-
width of 
our confidence interval will be 6% (nQuery Advisor version 7).
 
We have used nQuery Advisor 
version 7 for th
e calculation of our sample size. For a CI of 95%, 
α
 = 0.05, P= 80%, and a 
complication rate of deep extubation of 30%, as reported by Asai T et al (Asai T, Koga K, Vaughan 
RS, et al. Respiratory complications associated with tracheal intubation and extuba
tion. Br. J. Anesth. 
1998, 80, 767
–
775.), we will require a sample size of 300.

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS 
AND MINIMIZATION OF RISKS
 
 
Risk 
is the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated as a result of participation in 
the research.
 
Minimal risk
 
means the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research 
are not 
greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
 
 
a)
 
Describe any risks of harm to subjects and/or anticipated discomfort(s) that are reasonably 
foreseeable, even if unlikely.  Identify the safeguards you will put in place to minimize the 
occurrence of these risks and discomforts.  Risks of harm and discomfort may include: 
physical harm/discomfort, psychological harm/discomfort, legal harm/discomfo
rt, social 
harm/discomfort and economic harm. 
 
 
Response:
 
There are two methods of extubation in patients undergoing anesthesia: deep or awake. 
Currently, deep extubation is the d
efault extubation method at 
MEE
. However, in almost every other 
institution in the country, awake extubation is the default method. Risks of airway complications are 
associated with both methods and can include the following: 1) desaturation and hypoxia; 2) partial or 
complete laryngosp
asm; 3) bronchospasm; and 4) negative pressure pulmonary edema. Since this 
study is observational, there will be no risk for patients accruing from participating in the study. 
Recording of additional data by the anesthesiologist assigned to the case after 
extubation will not 
impact clinical care of the patient as the anesthesiologist will be monitoring the same vital signs 
whether the patient is part of the study or not. The computerized anesthesia manager program captures 
all the vital signs until the pati
ent is disconnected and transported to the PACU. In the PACU, the data

recorder will be recording the additional data. The only document with the patient’s identifiers will be 
the data sheet, which will be filled out by the anesthesiologist during the case
 
and by the data recorder 
in the PACU. Subsequently, all data will be recorded
 
as a research record on an 
MEE
 
password 
protected computer. Patient’s data sheets will be locked in the drawers located in the anesthesia off
ice 
on the 7th floor of the 
MEE
 
main
 
building. Only the study coordinator and the principal investigator 
have access to these drawers. Consequently, the patients’ data will remain confidential all the time.
 
 
 
b)
 
If applicable, describe any group harms (i.e. research that focuses on a specific
 
group or 
population that if the results are disclosed, could harm the group as a whole).

e)
 
Explain why you feel this category is appropriate based on the definition above (if more than 
minimal risk, describe the likelihood and seriousness of such risks).
 
 
Response
:
 
 
This study is an observational study; thus, there will be 
no intervention. The deep 
extubation is a method of extubation used for patients for any type of surgery. After transport to the 
PACU, the anesthesiologist routinely stays with the patient until it is safe to hand the patient off to a 
PACU nurse.

INCIDENTAL FINDINGS
 
 
If there is the possibility 
that study procedures may identify incidental findings of medical importance 
to a subject and/or the subject’s family (e.g., genetic studies, imaging studies, studies that conduct 
routine blood tests, etc.), describe the plan for reporting any incidental f
indings (e.g., study physician 
will discuss with subject/subject’s PCP, genetic counseling).  In addition, researchers may uncover 
evidence of child, domestic, or elder abuse, which require reporting to authorities.  Please describe the 
plan for reporting 
such findings.

PRIVACY/CONFIDENTIALITY
 
 
NOTE: MEE researchers must adhere to MEE
 
Information Security Policies and Procedures when 
designing their research protocols.  The HSC evaluates the collection, use and storage of data and may 
require additional safeguards.  For example, the HSC may require a Certificate of Confidentiality for 
research projects that collect personally identifiable, sensitive information
.   
 
 
a)
 
Describe the plan for protecting the privacy and confidentiality of subjects throughout the 
research (e.g., limited access to medical records and identifiable study data, da
ta security 
procedures consistent with MEE Information Security Policy).
 
 
Response:
 
Research data will be coded using a subject identification number that does not include the 
subject’s initials and is not derived from the subject’s identifiable 
information. The key linking the 
subject identification number to the subject’s identifiable information (only MRN) is available only to 
Mass. Eye and Ear PI and other MEE study team members.
 
 
b)
 
Where will you store research data, signed informed consent f
orms, and assent forms to 
maximally protect privacy and confidentiality?
 
 
Response:
 
Response: Paper files will be locked in cabinets when not in use and protected from 
inappropriate access. Electronic data will be stored in a password protected file and ne
tworked MEE 
computer for which access is limited to authorized members of the study team only. 
 
 
c)
 
Please provide the plan for destroying identifiers (at the earliest opportunity as consistent with 
the research plan) or provide a health or research justifi
cation for retaining identifiers. For 
protocols subject to future and secondary data analysis, provide justification for not destroying

If the research is no more than minimal risk, describe 
any provisions in place to ensure the 
safety of participants.  In minimal risk studies, there is always the risk of loss of confidentiality 
and privacy.  However, minimal risk studies involving blood draws, imaging, and eye exams 
may have risks associated 
with the study procedure.
 
 
Response:
 
Risks of airway complications are associated with both awake and deep extubation 
methods and can include the following: 1) desaturation and hypoxia; 2) partial or complete 
laryngospasm; 3) bronchospasm; and 4) negative 
pressure pulmonary edema. Since this study is 
observational, there will be no risk for patients accruing from participating in the study. Recording of 
additional data by the anesthesiologist assigned to the case after extubation will not impact clinical 
ca
re of the patient as the anesthesiologist will be monitoring the same vital signs whether the patient is

Original Protocol   25 September 2020 , version 1 (electronic 2.0) 
Amended protocol 01 (27 September 2022 ) 
This amended protocol (amendment 01) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to redefine the Cold Urticaria Activity  Score  
(ColdUAS)  efficacy  endpoints. It is anticipated that the newly defined ColdUAS endpoints are 
more sensitive to detect a treatment effect and will better address the objectives of the EFC16720 
study.

Estimands for main 
endpoints  The following ColdUAS secondary endpoints have been 
removed : 
- Proportion of participants with cold exposure triggered 
urticaria signs and symptoms at Week  12 and Week 24 as 
measured by ColdUAS compared with placebo  
- Proportion of days with cold exposure triggered urticaria 
signs and symptoms at Week 12 and Week 24 as measured 
by ColdUAS compared with p lacebo  
- Proportion of participants with severe cold exposure 
triggered urticaria signs and symptoms at Week 12 and 
Week 24 as measured by ColdUAS compared with placebo  
- Proportion of days with severe cold exposure triggered 
urticaria signs and symptoms a t Week 12 and Week 24 as 
measured by ColdUAS compared with placebo  
 
 
 Newly proposed secondary endpoints 
are considered sensitive to detect a 
shift in cold urticaria signs and 
symptoms severity, either via reduction 
in signs/symptoms severity score or 
change in proportion of symptom free 
days . Symptom free days  are 
considered clinically meaningful for 
assessment of  treatment benefit .  
 
 
 
 
 Of note, 
there will be no change in data 
collection for ColdUAS. The proposed 
modifications affect the ColdUAS data 
analysis.

And replaced  by the following secondary endpoints : 
• Change from baseline in cold urticaria signs and 
symptoms severity at Week  24 on cold exposure 
days as  measured by ColdUAS, compared wi th 
placebo  
• Change from baseline in the proportion of cold 
urticaria sign and symptom free days at Week 24 
on cold exposure days as  measured by ColdUAS, 
compared with placebo

Synopsis  Objectives 
and endpoints/  
Section 3 
Objectives and 
endpoints / 
Section  9.4.1 
efficacy analyses  The following endpoints were no longer considered as 
secondary endpoints but were moved to exploratory 
endpoints:  
• Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of 
primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU at 
Week  12 and Week  24 compared with placebo  
• Change from baseline in Patient Global Impression 
of Severity (PGIS) of primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU at Week 12 and Week 24 
compared with placebo  PGIS and PGIC scales are used in the 
study as a benchmark/anchor 
instrument for the analysis of the other 
patient -reported outcomes ( PROs ). 
Therefore,  they were considered 
exploratory endpoints rather than 
secondary  ones .

Appendix 13 -
Estimands for main 
endpoints  The following secondary endpoint was removed : 
• Time to first rescue therapy for primary acquired 
chronic induced ColdU during the planned 
treatment period compared with placebo  Cold urticaria signs and symptoms as 
well as need for rescue therapy occur 
episodically. Analysis of “Time to onset 
of rescue therapy” will likely be 
confounded by this factor. This 
endpoint was removed since the 
Spon sor consider ed the secondary 
endpoint of “proportion of participants 
receiving rescue therapy” already 
defined in the protocol as sufficient to 
evaluate the effect of the study 
intervention on rescue therapy need .  
Section 3 
Objectives and 
endpoints / 
Section 9.4.1 
efficacy analyses  The following tertiary/ exploratory endpoints were removed:  
• Change from baseline in  at Week  12 
and at Week 24 compared with  placebo  
• Change from baseline in  over time up to 
Week 24 compared to placebo  
• Change from  baseline in HRQoL as measured by 
Cold Urticaria Quality of Life (ColdU -QoL) 
questionnaire at Week 24 compared placebo   scoring is not validated by 
the scale developer  and therefore the 
endpoints evaluating change in 
 score were  removed.  
 
 
This endpoint was removed from 
tertiary endpoints as it was already 
mentioned as a secondary endpoint 
(was duplicated by error).

Appendix  13 -
Estimands for main 
endpoints  • Change in the imputation rule from “worst possible 
value” to “ worst observation carried forward 
(WOCF ) approach ” for participants taking high ly 
influential prohibited medications and/or highly 
influential rescue medications . 
• The following changes related to missing data 
handling were made: For participants who 
discontinue study intervention due to lack of 
efficacy, all data collected after discontinuation will 
be used in the analysis, and a WOCF approach will 
be used to impute  missing Week 24 value if 
needed . For participants who discontinue study 
intervention not due to lack of efficacy, a multiple 
imputation approach will be used to impute missing 
Week 24 value, and this multiple imputation will 
use all participants excluding  participants who have 
taken the highly influential prohibited medications 
and/or highly influential rescue medications on or 
before Week 24 and excluding patients who 
discontinue due to lack of efficacy on or before 
Week 24.  Handling of missing data after  taking 
highly influential prohibited medications 
and/or highly influential rescue 
medications or after withdrawal of 
study intervention are modified to 
include each participant's own worst 
data in order to better reflect the clinical 
scenario of treatment  failure.  
 
Section 6.3 
Measures to 
minimize bias: 
Randomization and 
blinding  • Code breaking: Investigator could decide at his/her 
discretion to contact the Sponsor to discuss the 
situation prior to  unblinding participant’s 
intervention assignment.  To clari fy that the responsibility to 
unblind treatment assignment in 
emergency situations resides solely 
with the investigator as per the EMA 
GCP Inspectors Working Group (GCP 
IWG) and the Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG). Consequently, the 
Sponsor cannot  require or insist on 
being involved in the decision to 
unblind, stall or delay in any way the 
unblinding of trial participant treatment 
in emergency situations.  
Section 8.1.5 Cold 
Urticaria Activity 
Score  • The following text was removed: “  
 
. The  will be assessed over 
prior to baseline, Week  12, and Week 24 ”.  scoring is not validated by 
the scale developer and therefore the 
endpoints evaluating change in 
 score were removed.  
• Text was corrected as follows:  After each week of 
completion, participants will be asked 2 additional 
questions about the overall disease activity of their 
ColdU in the past week using a 4 -point Likert scale 
from “No disease activity” to “High disease activity” 
and 1 question about thei r current disease activity 
in the past week compared with before treatment 
using a 4 -point Likert scale.  
And the following  text was deleted : “After each 
2 weeks of completion, participants will be asked 
about the overall disease activity of their ColdU i n 
the past 2 weeks using a 4 -point Likert scale from 
“No disease activity” to “High disease activity”, and 
they should rate disease activity in the second Correction  of error

1.1 SYNOPSIS   
Protocol title:  A randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center, parallel -group 
study of dupilumab in patients with chronic inducible cold urticaria who remain 
symptomatic despite the use of H1 -antihistamine treatment  
Short title:  Dupilumab for the treatment of chronic inducible cold urticaria in patients who 
remain symptomatic despite the use of H1 -antihistamine  
Rationale : 
Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU ) is a subtype of chronic urticaria characterized by recurrent 
itchy wheals, angioedema, or both with a minimum disease  duration of 6 weeks, that only occurs 
after exposure to defined  external triggers and is classified according to the stimulus t hat provokes 
the development of signs and symptoms (1, 2). Unlike chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU ), 
symptoms in CIndU patients ( itchy wheals and angioedema) develop only and repro ducibly in 
response to the trigger stimulus that is specific for their condition (eg, cold exposure in cold 
urticaria [ColdU ]). The triggers that lead to the urticarial signs and symptoms in CIndU patients 
are mainly physical or chemical stimuli , which results in 2 main sub -groups of CIndU : physical 
and non -physical, respectively . Physical triggers include pressure (in delayed pressure urticaria 
[DPU ]), radiation (in solar urticaria), friction (in symptomatic dermographism), temperature (in 
cold and heat urticaria), and vibration (in vibratory angioedema). Chemical triggers of CIndU 
reactions include  water (in aquagenic urticaria), sweat (in cholinerg ic urticaria [CholU ]), and 
other urticariogenic chemical compounds (in contact urticaria) ( 3). 
Chronic inducible urticaria has an estimated prevalence of about 0.5% in the general population  
(4), and has substantial impact on quality of life (QoL ) in many patients, mainly due to the need 
for trigger avoidance. Within the group of CIndU, most CIndU subtypes are rare and therefore 
very difficult to study ( 1). The most common are symptomatic dermographism , CholU  and ColdU 
(also called chronic inducible cold urticaria),  chronic inducible ColdU  being the second most 
common form of physical urticaria ( 1). Cold urticaria  is a relatively rare disorder with a reported 
prevalence of 0.05% as per one study in Europe  (4), with a higher prevalence in northern climates. 
It is also self -limited, lasting 4 to 5 years on average  (5). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  manifests as wheals , angioedema, or both  secondary to the release of 
mast cell mediators after exposure to cold or cooling and rewarming of the skin. The clinical 
symptoms occur within minutes after skin contact with cold air, cold liquids, cold solid objects, or 
evaporation -based cooling and pe rsist in general for a few hours ( 4). In severe cases, patients can 
develop systemic involvement including anaphylaxis. Local angioedema affe cting the lips, 
tongue, or pharyngeal tract has been associated with the ingestion of cold beverages or food, and 
shock like reactions are reported after swimming in cold water. Cold urticaria s can be classified as 
those with typical responses to cold prov ocation tests, those with atypical responses to cold 
provocation, and those with familial forms. Primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU  is the most 
common form of chronic inducible ColdU  and is considered idiopathic in nature. Historically the

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 13 majority ( 96%) of patients with acquired cold -induced urticaria have been shown to have primary 
cold-induced urticaria, with only rare occurrences of se condary cold -induced urticaria ( 6). 
Secondary acquired chronic inducible ColdU  is very rare and associated with an underlying 
disease most commonly cryoglobulinemia, but infectious causes, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and 
some drug -induced cases have been  reported. Both primary and secondary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU  have typical positive responses to cold provocation. Several other rare forms of 
atypical acquired chronic inducible ColdU  exist, w hich have negative immediate tests to cold 
provocation  and include systemic atypical acquired chronic inducible ColdU , cold -dependent 
dermographism, cold -induced CholU, delayed chronic inducible ColdU , and localized cold -reflex 
urticaria. Lastly, hereditary forms of chronic inducible ColdU  have been described: 1) Familial 
cold autoinflammatory syndrome caused by mutations in NLRP3 (cryopyrin) and is inherited in 
an autosomal dominant manner, which includes cryopyrin -associated periodic syndromes, 
Muckle -Wells syndrome and neonatal -onset mul tisystem inflammatory disease; 2) Familial 
atypical cold urticaria inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with having phospholipase 
C-g2-associated deficiency an d immune dysregulation (PLAID) ( 4). 
Chronic inducible urticarias are diagnosed based on the patient history and the results of 
provocation testing  (1, 2). The treatment of inducible urticaria is trigger avoidance and 
prophylaxis by H1 -antihistamines that preve nt the effects of the mast cell ‐mediator histamine 
(4, 7) or, if antihistamines are not effective, agents that prevent the activation of mast cells (eg, 
anti-immunoglobulin  E [IgE] omalizumab)  (7, 8, 9). The consensus recommendations for CIndU 
manag ement (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) are mainly based on treatments approved for 
CSU, and some clinical data available in patients suffering from various types of CIndUs 
(cholinergic, symptomatic dermographism, ColdU).  The recommended th erapies are, in general, 
not approved for CIndU by regulatory agencies, with only limited specific countries where 
antihistamines are approved under broader “urticaria” indications. All patients are advised to 
avoid prolonged skin contact with cold objects  or exposure to cold air temperatures. T he first -line 
symptomatic  therapy for CIndU is a non -sedating second -generation H1 antihistamine at 
approved doses for CSU. In patients who do not obtain complete control, increasing the dose up to 
4 times approved d oses for CSU is recommended. Steps 3 and 4of treatment options include 
omalizumab and ciclosporin A, respectively . All these treatments are used off label and lack good 
evidence of effectiveness in patients with CIndU.  
Chronic inducible urticarias  last several years and often pose a great treatment challenge because 
of their resistance to first -line therapy with H1 -antihistamine ( 1). They are debilitating , often 
causes systemic reactions including anaphylaxis in severe cases  and severely affect patient QoL 
(7, 8). Avoidance of offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefor e is 
typically not feasible . Thus, the need for approved treatment o ptions for CIndU, especially for 
chronic inducible ColdU  that have proven to be safe and efficacious in chronic inducible ColdU  
patients, is high.  
Chronic inducible ColdU  presents as  pruritic wheals with or without angioedema secondary to the 
release of mediators from mast cell s after exposure of the skin to cold air, liquid, or cold objects. 
Degranulation of mast cells in CIndU is held to be mediated by Fc epsilon receptor ( FcεRI ) 
activation, through cell surface -bound IgE cross -linked by as of yet unidentified autoallergens. 
The subsequent release of histamine and other pr o-inflammatory mediators leads  to local tissue 
edema and p ruritus. Many symptoms of urticaria are mediated primarily by the actions of

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 14 histamine (a mast cell mediator) on the H1 -receptors, and treatment with H1 -antihist amine is a 
mainstay of therapy ( 1). Approximately 50% of patients achieve symptomatic control with 
convent ional H1 -antihistamine therapy ( 2). Increasing the dose of anti -histamines in some cases 
has been demonstrated to be effective but not in all cases ( 10). Omali zumab anti-IgE which is 
approved for CSU  may be efficacious in ColdU,  however it is not approved for use in this specific 
condition. The mechanism by which omalizumab exerts its therapeutic effects is likely 
constrained to reduction in serum IgE and consequent down regulation  of high affinity IgE 
receptors. Novel therapies that target signaling pathways important for mast cell survival and 
function may provide additional treatment options for patients with this disease who are not 
responsive to treatment with H1 -antihistamine therapy. Interleukin -4 (IL -4)/IL-13 signaling is 
required for antibody isotype switching to IgE production in B cells and contribute to mast cell 
survival and function ( 4, 7). Therefore, blockade of IL -4/IL-13 by dupilumab represents a novel 
therapeutic approach for chronic inducible Cold U patients.  
Dupilumab is a human monoclonal antibody (mAb ) directed against the interleukin -4 receptor 
alpha subunit (IL -4Rα), which  is a component of IL -4 receptors Type I and Type II, the latter 
being also a receptor for IL -13. The binding of dupilumab to IL -4Rα results in blockade of both 
IL-4 and IL -13 signaling. As a targeted immunomodulatory agent, dupilumab selectively inhibits 
the type 2 immune response, which is responsible for several pathophysiological mechanisms 
including mast cell and basophil degranulation. Dupilumab has shown efficacy in multiple 
diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation such as atopic dermatitis (AD ), asthma, chronic 
rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP ), and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE ). In these 
clinical studies, treatment with dupilumab resulted in continuous decreases in blood total IgE. 
Moreover, in CRSwNP studies, a decrease in urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4 ) and  prostaglandin D2 
metabolite (PGDM ) suggests that dupilumab has impact on mast cell function. In a proof of 
concept study in EoE  dupilumab modulated type 2 inflammatory genes including genes asso ciated 
with mast cell activation ( 11). 
In a small case series of patients who had concurrent AD and CSU (12) and were resistant to 
omalizumab, treatment with dupilumab improved their urticaria. The same has been observed in 
1 patient with ch ronic inducible ColdU  (13). These data further sup port the rationale to target 
IL-4/IL-13 signaling with dupilumab in patients with chronic urticaria. As this is a novel therapy 
that acts further upstream than IgE -targeted therapies, the clinical study  proposed here will test the 
efficacy of dupilumab in patients who have failed antihistamines alone.  
Based on available literature  data for ColdU  and dupilumab mechanism of action, the present 
study will be evaluating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients  with primary acquired 
chronic inducible ColdU.

Overall design:  
The EFC16720 study is a 24-week , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center study to evaluate the use of dupilumab in adults and adolescents (≥12 to <18 years  
old) with primary a cquired chronic inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despite the use of 
H1-antihistamine. Participants using H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily or as needed are eligible 
since both treatment regimens are common in patients with ColdU ( 5). The study is designed to 
test the hypothesis that dupilumab will increase the proportion of participants  with negative ice 
cube provocation test compared with  placebo. Negative ice cube provocation test  is defined as 
absence of a confl uent hive/wheal at the entire skin site of exposure after ice cube provocation 
test. 
Chronic inducible ColdU signs and symptoms will be evaluated after a provocation test by the 
Investigator  (hives/wheals intensity) and participant  (itch severity, skin pain, skin burning 
sensation) . In addition,  chronic inducible ColdU disease activity  will be assessed daily by the 
participant  using the Cold Urt icaria Activity Score (ColdUAS ) questionnaire in  an e-diary  where  
the pa rticipant  will report  his/her  skin reactions (wheals and swelling), skin sensations (itching, 
burning, pain or feeling hot), if they have been in contact with cold temperatures that usually 
cause skin react ions, if they have avoided  trigger exposure, and overall symptoms severity . The 
study will also assess the effect of dupilumab on urticaria control, participants´ health -related 
quality of life (HRQoL ) and overall health status , proportion of patients with cold urticaria 
requiring emergency medical care visit or treatment with epinephrine and on reduction of rescue 
therapy.

3. The statistical test is a Z test that is ba sed on the difference of the 2  proportions with 
unpooled variance estimate and 2 -sided 1% significance level.  
4. Participants  are equa lly randomized to the dupilumab group and the placebo group.  
With these assumptions, 3 9 participants  per group ( 78 participants  in total) will provide 
90% power  to detect the difference of  response rate in the dupilumab group and 
 response rate in t he placebo group . The sample size calculations were performed 
using nQuery+nTerim 4.0.  
• Randomization  
Participants  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio to dupilumab or placebo. The randomization 
will be first stratified by age (adults versus adolescents) with at least 4  adolescents . Then 
in adult ’s randomization will be stratified further by country  and background 
H1-antihistamine regular/daily use (Yes/No). Randomization will not be stratified further  
in adolescents . 
Number of participants using H1 -antihistami ne as needed prior to study entry should be at 
least .  
• Analysis population  
The primary analysis population for the efficacy endpoint s will be the randomized 
intent -to-treat population which includes all participants  who have been allocated to 
a randomiz ed treatment regardless of whether the tre atment kit was used or not. The 
efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the treatment to which they were 
randomized.  
The analysis population for safety endpoints is defined as all randomized participants  
exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. The 
safety analyses will be conducted according to the treatment participants  actually received.  
• Primary analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of participant s with negative  ice cube 
provocation test at Week  24. The statistical hypothesis for comparing dupilumab against 
placebo on the primary endpoint is:  
- Null hypothesis H0: No treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo.  
- Alternative hypothesis H1: There  is a treatment difference between dupilumab and 
placebo.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 21 medication usage . For other participants, all available data including those collected 
during the off -treatment period will be used  to determine the positive/negative ice cube 
provocation test outcomes.  Participants  with missing ice cube provocation test  data at 
Week 24 will be considered as having positive ice cube provocation tests.  
• Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The continuous secondary endpoints at Week 24 will be analyzed usi ng Analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA ) with multiple imputation. For p articipants  taking highly influential  
prohibited medications and/or highly influ ential rescue medications (details of selection 
will be specified in the SAP), their data after the medication usage will be set to missing, 
and the WOCF  approach (worst postbaseline observation for the participant will be carried 
forward) will be used to impute missing Week 24 value  (for participants whose 
postbaseline values are all missing, the participant’s baseline value will be used to impute 
the missing endpoint value) . Participant s who discontinue the treatment prematurely are 
encouraged to follow the planned clinical visits. For p articipants  who did not take the 
highly influential  prohibited medications and/or highly influential rescue medications, all 
data collected after treatme nt discontinuation will be used in the analysis. For these 
participants , missing data may still happen despite all efforts have been tried to collect the 
data after treatment discontinuation. For participants who discontinue study intervention 
due to lack of efficacy , all data collected after discontinuation will be used in the analysis, 
and a WOCF approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value if needed. For 
participants who discontinue study intervention not due to lack of efficacy, a multiple 
imputation approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value, and this multiple 
imputation will use all participants excluding participants who have taken the highly 
influential prohibited medications and/or highly influential rescue medications on or 
before Week 24 and excluding patients who discontinue due to lack of efficacy on or 
before Week 24.  Each of the imputed complete data will be analyzed by fitting an analysis 
of covariance model with the baseline valu e of the endpoint, treatment group, region 
(combined countries) , and background H1 -antihistamine  regular/daily  use (Yes/No)  as 
covariates. Statistical inference obtained from all imputed data will be combined using 
Rubin’s rule. Descriptive statistics incl uding number of  participants , mean, standard error, 
and least squares (LS) mean changes (and standard error) score will be provided. In 
addition, difference of the dupilumab group against placebo in LS means a nd the 
corresponding 95% CI will be provided along with the p -values.  
The continuous endpoints at Week 12 will be analyzed in a similar way as the secondary 
endpoint s at Week 24.  
The binary endpoints will be analyzed in the similar way to the primary effic acy endpoint.  
The safety variables, including adverse events (AEs ), laboratory parameters, vital signs, 
electrocardiogram (ECG ), and physical examinations wi ll be summariz ed using 
descriptive statistics.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential  Page 22 • Missing data handling  
For continuous endpoints, missing data due to lack of efficacy will be imputed using 
WOCF approach and missing data not due to lack of efficacy will be imputed using a 
multiple imputation method, which will use all participants except those who have taken 
the high ly influential  prohibited medications and/or highly influential rescue medications  
and excluding patients who discontinue due to lack of  efficacy . For binary endpoints, 
missing data will be considered as non -responder.  
In addition to the missing data handling approaches specified above, the reason and pattern 
of missing data will be carefully examined , and tipping point analyses and additi onal 
sensitivity analyses will be performed.  
• Multiplicity considerations  
A multiplicity hierarchical testing will be  proposed to control the overall Type -I error rate 
for testing the primary endpoint , selected patient -reported outcome  (s) (PRO ) and the  other  
key secondary endpoints. The study is considered positive when the primary endpoint 
achieves statistical significance. Detailed multiplicity adjustment procedure for the 
efficacy endpoints will b e described in the study SAP.  
• Planned database lock date  
A primary database lock will be performed when all randomized participants have 
completed their treatment phase. Final analyses in the clinical study report (CSR ) will be 
based on all data collected up to this database lock.  
The database  will be updated at the end of the study for all participants t o include the 
post-treatment follow -up information and updates for the events previously ongoing at t he 
time of the primary lock. Additional data between this database lock and last participant 
completing last visit will be summarized in a CSR addendum.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 28 2 INTRODUCTION   
Chronic urticaria comprises CSU  and CIndU , and both are characterized by the appearance of 
itchy wheals (hives) , angioedema, or both that reoccur  for more than 6 weeks. The symptoms 
occur either without a specific  trigger  in the case of CSU, or are induced (provoked) by a specifi c 
and d efinite  trigger in the case of CIndU ( 1, 2). There are 9 subtypes of CIndUs depending on the 
type of trigger tha t provokes urticaria  signs and symptoms : symptomatic dermographism, ColdU , 
DPU , solar urticaria, heat urticaria, vibratory angioedema, CholU , contact urticaria , and aquagenic 
urticaria. Most CIndU subtypes are rare and the most common are symptomatic dermo graphism, 
ColdU  (also called chronic inducible cold urticaria ) and CholU  (1). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  is the second most commo n form of physical urticaria  (1, 14). Cold 
urticaria is a relatively rare disorder with a reported prevalence of 0.05% as per one study in 
Europe ( 4), with a higher prevalence in  northern climates. It is also self -limited, lasting 4 to 
5 years on average ( 5). Chronic inducible ColdU  often develops in young adults and is diagnosed 
based on the patient history and the results of provocation testing. Systemic symptoms of mast 
cell activation may occur, and up to 35% to 70% of patients with chronic inducible ColdU  have 
experience d system ic reactions includi ng anaphylaxis in severe cases ( 4). 
Therapy is focused on  the avoidance of the trigger factor and symptomatic treatment. The 
consensus recommendations for CIndU mana gement (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) are 
mainly based on treatments approved for CSU, and some clin ical data available in patients 
suffering from various types of CIndUs (cholinergic, symptomatic dermographism, ColdU).  The 
recommended therapies are, in general, not approved for CIndU by regulatory agencies, with only 
limited specific countries where ant ihistamines are approved under broader “ urticarial”  
indications.  All patients are advised to avoid prolonged skin contact with cold objects or exposure 
to cold air temperature for CIndU, a similar stepwise approach as in patients with CSU is 
recommended: second -generation H1-antihistamines are the first -line (standard doses) and second 
line (high doses) therapies, although there is a lack of good evidence in patients with CIndU for 
the latter recommendation. Approximately 50% of patients achieve symptomatic control with 
conventional H1 -antihistamine thera py, defined as reduction of hives and itch ( 15). Step 3 and 
4 of treatment options includ e omalizumab  and ciclosporin A , respectively . Omalizum ab, a 
monoclonal anti - IgE antibody, is the most used off label  treatment  in antihistamine -resistant 
patients with CIndU including  ColdU . However, approx imately a third of the patients treated with 
omalizumab are not well -controlled ( 16). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  is debilitating and severely affects patients QoL. Avoidance of 
offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefore  is typically not feasible. 
Thus, the need for treatment options is high , especially as no approved treatments are available.  
The underlying pathologic mechanism, while not well understood, is thought to be driven by mast 
cell activation and degranulation.  Activation of skin mast cells with the release of histamine and 
other pro -inflammatory mediators leads to the signs and symptoms of CIndUs. Increased numbers 
of mast cells are found in both lesional and non -lesional skin in CSU and induci ble urticaria. 
Interleukin -4 and IL -13, causative cytokines of type 2 inflammation , are secreted by mast cells in

SAR231893 - EFC16720  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 29 addition to T helper 2 (Th2 ) lymphocytes. Mast cells express the IL -4 receptor, IL -4Rα, which is 
also stimulated by IL-13. Stimulation of mast cell IL -4Rα has been shown to also promote 
degranulation, adhesion, and chemotaxis, and to enhance FcεRI expression (4, 17). 
Dupilumab is a human mAb  directed against the IL-4Rα, which is a component of IL -4 receptors 
Type I and Type II, the latter being also a receptor for IL -13. The binding of dupilumab to IL -4Rα 
results in blockade of both IL -4 and IL-13 signaling. As a targeted immunomodulatory agent, 
dupilumab selec tively inhibits the type  2 immune response, including Th2 cells, which can 
potentially achieve the desired therapeutic effect without the side effects typically associated with 
the use of broad immunosuppressants. The type 2/Th2 pathway is responsible for several 
pathophysiological mechanisms including mast cell and basophil degranulation. Dupilumab has 
shown efficacy in multiple diseases with underlying type 2 inflammation such as AD, asthma, 
CRSwNP, and EoE. In these clinical studies, treatment with dupil umab resulted in continuous 
decreases in blood total IgE. Moreover, in CRSwNP studies, a decrease in urinary LTE4  and 
PGDM  was reported,  suggesting that dupilumab has impact on mast cell function s. 
Based on the above described dupilumab mechanism of action  as well as available data with 
dupilumab, this study will evaluate dupilumab efficacy in patient s with primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU. 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
Primary  acquired  chronic inducible ColdU  patients with and without angioedema experience 
hives and pruritus secondary to mast cell dysregulation. Degranulation of mast cells in CIndu is 
held to be mediated by FcεRI  activation, through cell surface -bound IgE cross -linked b y as of yet 
unidentified autoallergens. The subsequent release of histamine and other pr o-inflammatory 
mediators leads  to local tissue edema and pruritus. While antihistamines are the mainstay of 
therapy, not all patients are controlled with antihistamines  alone, and not all antihistamine -
refractory patients are adequately responsive to omalizumab (anti -IgE antibody) therapy. 
Therefore, there remains an unmet need. One possible way to meet this need is through novel 
therapies that target signaling pathways important for mast cell and basophil survival and 
function. Interleukin -4/IL-13 signaling is required for antibody isotype switching to IgE 
production in B cells and contributes to mast cell survival and function  (4, 7). Therefore, blockade 
of IL -4/IL-13 by dupilumab represents a novel therapeutic approach for chronic urticaria patients. 
In a small case series of patients who had concurrent AD and CSU and were resistant to 
omalizumab, treatment with dupi lumab improved th eir urticaria ( 12). The same has been observed 
in 1 patient with chronic inducible  ColdU  (13). These data further support the rational e to target 
IL-4/IL-13 signaling with dupilumab in patients with chronic urticaria. As this is a novel therapy 
that acts further upstream than IgE  -targeted therapies, the clinical study  proposed here will test 
the efficacy of dupilumab in  patients who have failed antihistamines alone.  
Based on the known pharmacokinetics (PK ), safety and efficacy of dup ilumab, the selected dosing 
regimen is dupilumab 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg for adults; and 300 mg q2w 
with a loading dose of 600 mg for adolescents >60 kg at baseline OR 200 mg q2w with a loading 
dose of 400 mg for adolescents ≥30 kg and  <60 kg at baseline. To achieve effective drug

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 30 response, a loading dose is selected for this study as done in the dupilum ab AD program. These 
are the approved dose regimens for AD, another skin disease and they are expected to achieve 
concentrations in serum that saturate the IL -4/IL-13 receptor in most patients , and hence they are 
expected to provide the maximum benefit and  therefore to achieve the optimal benefit/risk ratio in 
this patient population. The same dosing regimens are currently under investigation in a 
dupilumab Phase 3 study in patients with CSU who remain sy mptomatic despite the use of 
H1-antihistamine treatme nt. 
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that dupilumab is effective in inhibiting hives /wheals  
after provocation test ( ice cube provocation test), in patients suffering from primary  acquired 
chronic inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despite t he use of H1 -antihistamine treatment.  
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Chronic inducible ColdU  is a debilitating condition that severely affects  QoL. It is normally  not 
feasible to avoid the offending  trigger without significant changes to everyday life. The majority 
of patients with chronic inducible ColdU  may experience systemic reactions, including  
anaphylaxis in severe cases. There is no approved treatment available to date for chronic inducible 
ColdU , and EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guidel ines treatment recommendations ( 2) are mainly  
based on the approved treatments for CSU . Many patients h owever are refractory to these 
treatments; therefore, a high unmet medical need exist.  
In the EFC16720 study the target population consists of patients with primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H1-antihista mine as these 
patients have a significant unmet medical need. The updated international guideline on the 
definition, classification, diagnosis , and management of urticaria (1, 2) provides recommendations 
and a treatment algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 of this algorithm  is the use of non -sedating H1-
antihistamine s at approved, or increased doses (up to 4-fold), respectively. Step 3  and 4 of 
treatment options include omalizumab and ciclosporin A, respectively . This protocol allows the 
use of H1-antihistamine at up to 4 -fold the approved doses as background medication at stable 
doses.

The t arget population of EFC16720  are patients with chronic inducible ColdU who remain 
symptomatic despite the use of H1 -antihistamine treatment. These patients have failed 
antihistamine therapy and have active disease  as indicated in Section  5. There are currently no 
therapies that are approved specifically for the trea tment of cold -induced urticaria . Therefore, 
these patients have a high unmet medical need for novel effective treatment.  Participation in 
EFC16720 will provide an opportunity for these patients to be treated with dupilumab that has 
proven efficacy in disease states (eg , AD, asthma, CRSwN P) where type 2 inflammation is the 
underlying driver of the disease process , and which targets signaling pathways important for mast 
cell survival and function that may provide a new treatment option for chronic inducible ColdU . 
Interleukin -4 is essential  for the function/survival of several cell types important in the 
pathogenesis of urticaria, including B cells, Th2 cells, mast cells, and basophils ( 12, 18, 19, 20, 
21, 22). It is hypothesized that dupilumab will be effective in reducing itc h and hives and improve 
angioedema urticaria control as well as QoL, in adults and adolescents with CSU and chronic 
inducible ColdU. Supporting the mechanistic rationale for dupilumab’s potential effectiveness in 
CSU, dupilumab improved the hives and itch severity/frequency in a case series of 6 patients with 
CSU ( 12). Ferrucci et al reported ( 13) that a patient with chronic inducible ColdU who failed to 
respond to omalizumab (anti - IgE antibody) and oral cyclosporine, healed shortly after starting 
dupilumab. Itch (Numerical Rate Scal e) and QoL (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI ]) 
significantly improved in this patient after only 1 month of therapy with dupilumab and the ice 
cube provocation test was negative. The patien t underwent cold -water exposure by rafting in a 
mountain river (water temperature 3°C), without showing any relapse of urticaria.  
The participants who will participate in this study may have the potential benefit of receiving a 
novel treatment for the unde rlying disease process. Based on the dupilumab mechanism of action 
in reducing IgE production and effects on mast cells mediators, it is anticipated that use of 
dupilumab will lead to reduced signs and symptoms associated with primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU and improved function and QoL for these participants.  
Treatments approved in CSU are antihistamines or omalizumab. In general, treatments for chronic 
inducible ColdU including omalizumab are given off label. Thirty -five percent to 70% of patien ts 
with chronic inducible ColdU have experienced systemic reactions including anaphylaxis in 
severe cases. Thus, the need for approved treatment options for chronic inducible ColdU is high 
(4). 
One possible way to meet this need is through novel therapies that target signaling pathways 
important for mast cell and basophil survival an d function. Interleukin -4/IL-13 signaling is 
required for anti body isotype switching to IgE production in B cells and contribute to mast cell 
and basophil survival and function. Therefore, blockade of IL -4/IL-13 by dupilumab represents a 
novel therapeutic approach for chronic inducible ColdU patients.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 32 This 24 -week study allows for assessment of the effect of dupilumab on urticaria symptoms after 
the cold provocation test (hives/wheals, itch, pain, and burning sensation), and on pa rticipant ’s 
HRQoL , and health status.  
2.3.2  Risk assessment   
No tissue targets or specific hazards to humans were identified in nonclinical general and 
reproductive toxicology studies.  
Dupilumab has an extensive safety database. As of 28 March 2020 (Data Lock Point) , 
10 191 subjects were enrolled into the development program for dupilumab and are included in 
the safety population: 382 as healthy volunteers, 4405  from AD studies, 3614  from asthma 
studies, 782 from CRSwNP studies, 232 from EoE studies, 248  from the grass all ergy and peanut 
allergy studies, 511 from the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD ) studies , 5 from 
prurigo nodularis (PN ) studies, and 12 from the CSU studies . The number of subjects exposed to 
dupilumab in clinical studies was 8720 (356  in healthy volunteer studies, 4052  in AD studies, 
3263  in asthma studies, 470 in CRSwNP studies, 166 in EoE studies, 148 in the grass allergy  and 
peanut allergy studies, 256 from the COPD studies , 3 from  PN studies, and 6 from  the CSU  
studies ). 
Based on clinical studies  in AD, the safety profile  in adolescent patients (ie, 12 –17 years of age) 
appears similar to that of adults with AD . As of 28 September 2019, 336 adolescents  had been 
exposed to dupilumab in AD clinical studies , with a total of 457.7 person -years of exposure.  
Based on the sales figures and using the World Health Organization’s defined daily dose for 
dupilumab of 21.4 mg /day, the cumulative post -marketing exposure to dupilumab is estimated to 
be 161 582 patient -years (01 January 2017 to 31 March 2020).  
Dupilumab has been generally well -tolerated in all populations tested in clinical development 
programs consistent with a positive benefit/risk profile. The adverse drug reactions (ADRs ) 
identified to date for dupilumab include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis (including allergic 
and bacterial), oral herpes, herpes simplex, blepharitis,  keratitis,  dry eye, eye pruritus, 
eosinophilia, serum sickness , anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, and arthralgia . These ADRs 
were generally mild or moderate, transient, and manageable. These ADRs were not consistently 
observed in all  indications (see IB for greater  details). More significant serious allergic reactions 
were very rare. The ADRs reported in the post -marketing setting include events of anaphylactic 
reaction, angioedema, arthralgia, keratitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Importantly, no increased 
overall infection risk was observed in patients treated with dupilumab.  
Systemic hypersensitivity has been established as an important identified risk with dupilum ab. As 
protein therapeutics, all mAbs  are potentially immunogenic. Rar e serious and systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the dupilumab program including serum 
sickness/serum sickness -like reaction in the adult AD program and anaphylaxis related to 
dupilumab in the adult asthma clinical studies . 
The impor tant potential risk for dupilumab is “eosinophilia associated with clinical symptoms in 
asthma patients.” The observed increase in eosinophil count is transient, which is consistent with

SAR231893 - EFC16720  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 33 the current understanding of the mechanism of action of dupilumab. In  dupilumab asthma studies, 
a small number of patients with asthma experienced serious systemic eosinophilia presenting with 
clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis consistent with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis, conditions which are often treated with systemic corticosteroids 
(SCS) therapy. These events have been seen in other drug development programs for severe 
asthma and usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid 
therapy suggesting possible unmasking of these conditions with tapering o f corticosteroids during 
dupilumab therapy. The association of dupilumab treatment and these events has not been 
established. Health care providers should be alert to eosinophilia associated with vasculiti s rash, 
worsening of pulmonary symptoms, pulmonary infiltrate, cardiac complications, and/or 
neuropathy presenting in their patients, especially upon reduction of SCS.  
Patients with known helminth infections were  excluded from participation in clinical studies, 
therefore it is not known if dupilumab will i nfluence the immune response against helminth 
infections. Consequently, patients with pre -existing helminth infections should be treated for their 
helminth infection before initiating therapy with dupilumab.  
The common ADR across all indications is injecti on site reaction. Other potential risks based on 
the safety profile in particular indications are discussed in the IB.  
To date, the safety profile has been similar among adult and adolescent patients in asthma and AD 
populations and adult patients with CRS wNP. While long -term data are still accumulating, data 
from randomized, placebo -controlled trials and open -label extension studies to date, have not 
identified any new safety concern in these populations. It is anticipated that dupilumab in patients with 
primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU will have a favorable safety profile as observed across 
other type 2 -driven immunological disorders.  
2.3.3  COVID -19 Benefit -risk assessment   
Dupi lumab has shown clinical benefit in several type -2 driven immunological disorders, such as 
AD, asthma, and CRSwNP . In asthma and AD, clinical benefit has also been established in certain 
pediatric patients (asthma in adoles cents and AD in 6 to18 years old ) and a similar benefit -risk 
profile to adults has been observed.  
To date, more than 8000 patients have been treated with dupilumab during the clinical 
development program in several indications, of which AD, asthma, and CRSwNP  are licensed in 
some countri es. 
Currently, as sufficient data in patients with COVID -19 who are being treated with dupilumab is 
not available. Thus, the safety and efficacy of dupilumab in COVID -19 patients are unknown. 
During the course of the clinical trial program, respiratory inf ections including viral infections 
were monitored and these events are not listed as ADRs  with dupilumab.  
The target population of EFC16720 are participants with primary ac quired chronic inducible 
ColdU have uncontrolled disease and in general, treatments for chronic inducible ColdU including 
omalizumab are given off label. Therefore, these patients have a high unmet medical need for 
novel effective treatment. Participation in EFC16720 will provide an opportunity for these

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 37 3.1 APPROPRIATENESS OF M EASUREMENTS   
Primary acquired cold urticaria (ACU ) is a type of physical chronic inducible urticaria that is 
characterized mainly by the appearance of wheals after contact with cold or cooling and 
rewarming of the skin (4). The assessments used in this study focus on evaluation of local 
symptoms that occur after skin contact to cold using ice cube provocation test. In addition, overall 
urticaria control, daily documentation of skin reactions to cold , participant’s QoL , reduction in 
need of rescue therapy and health status are evaluated.  
The proposed primary endpoint is proportion of participants  with negative ice cube provocation 
test (absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site of expo sure) at Week  24.  Cold 
provocation tests are standard in diagnosis of cold urticaria (4). In addition, they are used for 
assessment of efficacy in clinical trials (23, 24) in patients with ColdU . Cold urticaria symptoms 
appear only after skin contact with a cold trigger (cold air, liquids, or solid ob jects), usually within 
minutes , and persist for up to a few hours. The use of cold provocation tests allow s for the 
standardiz ation of the cold trigger and for perform ing assessment in predefined time points . The 
ice cube provocation test will be standardized for the purpose of th is study and an operational 
manual with instructions for ice  cube preparation and cold provocation test administration will be 
provided to the study centers  along with th e study  protocol . This will ensure that all study ce nters  
will apply the ice cube  provocation tests consistently across this international, multi -center  
clinical study . 
Presence of a confluent hive/wheal as well as wheal intensity will be assessed by the clinicians 
10 minutes after removal of the ice cube, as recommended in the CIndU 
(EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) guidelines ( 1). Assessment will be performe d at each provocation 
test, ie,  at Week 0, Wee k 12, and Week 24. In addition, symptoms of itch  severity , skin burning 
sensation , and skin pain will be assessed by the participant  10 minutes after the cold provocation 
test. 
The c linical picture of a participant  at the time of study visits may not be  totally representative of 
the actual current disease status due to symptom fluctuation that is dependent upon the contact 
with the triggering temperature . Therefore, the participants  will rate the  disease activity using the 
ColdUAS questionnaire in an e-diary. On a daily basis, participants will report their skin reactions 
(wheals and swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), avoidance behavior 
and trigger exposure, and overall symptoms severity. Cold Urticaria Activity Score  will provide 
important supportive information on clinical improvement of the participants  on a daily basis.  
Since skin reactions, skin sensations and behavioral avoidance to trigger vary from one day to 
another , ColdUAS will be assessed on a daily basis . 
Participants  with primary inducible ColdU  are at risk of developing systemic hypersensitivity 
reactions including anaphylaxis after exposure to cold trigger s. Such systemic reactions are  
mainly described  as provoked by aquatic activities ( eg, swimming in cold w ater) when the whole 
body , or a large proportion  of it,  was in contact with cold. Systemic hypersensitivity events will 
be documented via adverse event of special interest (AESI )/serious a dverse event (SAE ) 
reporting , and information about corrective treatment will be collected.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 38 To get a complete picture of the disease , it is important to assess disease control over the course of 
treatm ent in addition to  urticaria symptom assessment. Patients are best positioned to accurately 
assess this control, as they experience and feel it. They will self -assess their ColdU control using 
the urticaria control test (UCT ), a well -developed and validated instrument  in chronic urticaria 
patients (25). 
Lastly, patients with primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU  experience substantial HRQoL 
impairment. Therefore, the DLQI,  a dermatology -specific  instrument design ed to assess  HRQoL 
in adult s ≥16 years old (26) with dermatologic conditions,  and the corresponding Children’s 
Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI ) for adolescents aged ≥12 years to <16  years old will be 
used, in addition to the newly developed disease -specific Cold Urticaria Quality of Life (ColdU -
QoL) questionnaire. . 
The proposed primary and secondary endpoints will answer important clinical questions about the 
efficacy of dupilumab on disease symptoms, disease control and HRQoL in patients with primary 
acquired chronic inducible ColdU .

4.1 OVERALL DESIGN   
The EFC16720 stu dy is a 24-week , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center study to evaluate the use of dupilumab in adults and adolescents (≥12 to <18 years  
old) with primary acquired  chronic inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despite  the use of 
H1-antihistamine. Participants using H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily or as needed are eligible 
since both treatment regimens are common in patients with ColdU ( 5). The study is designed to 
test the hypothesis that dupilumab will increase the proportion of participants  with negative ice 
cube provocation test  at Week 24 compared with  placebo. Negati ve ice cube provocation test  is 
defined as the absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site of exposure  after an ice 
cube provocation test.  
The study consists of 3 periods:  
• Screening period (2 to 4 weeks).  
• Randomized IMP treatment period (24 weeks).  
• Post IMP treatment period (12 weeks).  
Chronic inducible ColdU  signs and symptoms will be evaluated after an ice cube provocation test , 
by the Investigator  (hives/wheals intensity) and participant  (itch severity, skin pain, skin 
sensation) . In addit ion, chronic inducible ColdU disease activity  will be assessed daily by the  
participant  using ColdUAS questionnaire in an e-diary  where the participant  will report his/her  
skin reactions (wheals and swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), if they 
have been in contact with cold temperatures that usually cause skin reactions, if they have avoided  
trigger exposure, and overall symptoms severity.  The study will also assess the effect  of 
dupilumab  on urticaria control, participants´ HRQoL and overall health status , proportion of 
patients with cold urticaria requiring emergency medical care visit or treatment with epinephrine 
and on reduction of rescue t herapy.  
The total anticipated number of participants randomized in the study is 78. This corresponds to 
approximately 39 participants who will be randomly assigned to each intervention arm:  
• Dupilumab: 300 mg every q2w for adults; 200 mg q2w for adolescents  ≥30 kg and  <60 kg 
at baseline or 300 mg q2w for adolescents ≥60 kg at baseline.  
• Matched placebo.  
At least 4  participants randomized  in the study will be adolescents (≥12 to <18 years  old) who 
will be recruited in a few selected sites in  selected countries . Randomization will be stratified by 
age (adolescent versus adult) and within adult group by country  and background H1 -antihistamine  
regular/daily  use (Yes /No) (see Section  6.1.2  for additional background  therapy details) . 
Number of participants using H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should be at 
least .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 40 During the study, participants should continue their established standard of care background 
therapy with a long-acting non -sedating H1 -antihistamine, at up to 4 -fold the approved dose for 
CSU.  
• Participants who used H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily prior to study entry should 
continue to take it daily.  Note: regular/daily use of H1 -antihistamine prior to study entry is 
defined as H1 -antihistamine intake for at least 4 days per week for at least 1  month prior to 
screening visit (Visit 1)  
• Participants who took H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study ent ry should limit the use 
to short -term. 
The H1 -antihistamine dose used during the study should be the same dose the participants took to 
prevent ColdU symptoms prior to study entry (“presc reening dose”). However, if participants  
experience a flare rescue th erapy may be initiated. Please refer to Section  6.5.1  for rescue therapy.  
If participants are on a dose higher than 4-fold the approved CSU dose at the screening visit 
(Visit  1), the Investigator can adjust the participant’s dose within the stipu lated range at the 
screening visit (Visit  1).  
All participants will be allowed to take study -defined H1-antihistamine as rescue therapy as long 
as they do not exceed 4 -fold the approved CSU dose during screening, treatment, and follow -up 
periods. If sympt oms are still uncontrolled after increase of H1 -antihistamine to the maximum 
allowed dose, or if the participant  is already on the 4-fold approved dose of H1-antihistamine, 
participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 4 -fold (2-fold in Japan)  the approved  dose 
for CSU  or a short course of oral corticosteroids (OCS ) is allowed during the treatment and 
follow -up periods.  For rescue therapy in  participants in Japan, please  see Appendix  8 
(Section  10.8). However, for the purpose of the  primary analysis, data collected after OCS use 
will be set to missing an d the worst postbaseline  value before OCS will be used.  
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  FOR STUDY DESIGN   
In the EFC16720 study the target population consists of patients with primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H1 -antihistamine alone as these 
patients have a significant unmet medical need. Therapy for the patients is focused on the 
avoidance of the trigger factor and symptomatic treatm ent. The updated international guideline on 
the definition, classification, diagnosis and management of urticaria ( 1, 2) provides 
recommendations and a treatment algorithm. The consensus recommendations for CIndU 
management are mainly based on treatments approved for CSU, and some c linical data available 
in patients suffering from various types of CIndUs (cholinergic, symptomatic dermographism, 
ColdU).  The recommended therapies are, in general, not approved for CIndU by regulatory 
agencies, with only limited specific countries where antihistamines are approved under broader 
“urticaria” indications.  A similar stepwise approach as in patients with CSU is recommended for 
CIndU, including ColdU. Steps 1 and 2 of this algorit hm is the use of non -sedating 
H1-antihistamines at approv ed, or i ncreased doses (up to 4 -fold), respectively. Step 3 and 4 of 
treatment options include omalizumab and ciclosporin A, respectively. More than 50% of 
acquired primary chronic inducible cold urticaria patients do not  respond to H1 -antihistamine 
VV-CLIN-0635063 1.0

SAR231893 - EFC16720  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 41 treatment ( 8). Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti - IgE antibody, is the most used off label treatment 
in antihistamine -resistant patients with CIndU including ColdU. However, approximately a third 
of the patients treated with omalizumab are not well -controlled ( 12). 
Study EFC16720 targets patients not adequately controlled with H1 -antihistamine treatment and 
allows the use of H1 -antihistamine at up to 4 -fold the approved doses as background medicat ion at 
stable doses . 
As mentioned in  Section  2.1 dupilumab at SC doses of 300 mg  and 200 mg have been observed to 
suppress both total and antigen specific IgE levels across the  indications studied: AD, asthma, and 
CRSwNP.  In addition, d upilu mab offers a new mechanism of action by inhibiting IL -4 signaling 
via the Type I receptor and both IL -4 and IL -13 signaling through the Type II receptor.  Blocking 
IL-4Rα with dupilumab inhibits IL -4 and IL -13, key cytokines that drive optimal mast cell 
degranulatio n and IgE production and other t ype 2 inflammatory responses, including the release 
of pro -inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, and IgE  (21). 
There are  a limited number of studies conducted in patients with cold urticaria. As mentioned 
above , the guideline recommendations for CSU are adopted for patients with CIndU ; however , 
there are several differences between CSU and CIndU. In CIndU, the symptoms only occur after 
skin exposure to physical or chemical triggers. The duration of individual wheals is often 
relatively brief for CIndU, lasting minutes to hours. This is the reaso n why different assessment 
tools and endpoints are used in CIndU clinical  studies  compared with CSU. C old provocation 
tests are used in clinical studies in patients with chronic urticaria to evaluate efficacy of 
treatments, mainly antihistami ne treatments,  but also doxepin , cyproheptadine  (4), either by 
evaluating proportion of patients who after treatment did not develop signs/symptoms with the  
cold provocation test or evaluating the response to an experimental cold -simulation time test 
(CSTT ) ie, minimum time threshold of cold stimulation required to induce a coalescent wheal and 
other  cold urticaria signs and symptoms.  This study will assess efficacy using the primary 
endpoint of the proportion of participants with negative ice cube provocation test  at Week  24. The 
patients/I nvestigators will also score local signs and symptoms before and after provocation test 
assessing effect of the IMP on hives, itch, burning sensation , and pain. Ice cube provocation test is 
a traditional test used in common practice. For the study, the method will be standardized and 
compliant with according to the International EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/UNEV guidelines ( 1). In 
addition to provocation test,  cold urticaria signs and symptoms will be evaluated usin g ColdUAS. 
It is scored by patients daily to assess overall disease activity.  
A large portion of patients with ColdU (35% to 70%) have experience d systemic reactions 
including anaphylaxis, after extensive cold exposur e and exercise, respectively ( 4). Avoidance of 
offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefore is typically not feasible. 
This has significant impact on pati ents´ QoL. The study will assess the proportion of patients with 
cold exposure triggered urticaria requiring emergency medical care visit or treatment with 
epinephrine  urticaria . 
A double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled design is chosen to minimize bias in data  
collection and interpretation. The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the objectives of  
this study since it will provide the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 42 (per protocol  Section  1.3 and Section  8.2), the Investigators will oversee efficacy via monitoring 
of ColdU  symptoms collected daily in an e -diary and can continuously assess benefit and risk for 
each individual  participant  and decide about the need to administer rescue therapy (Section  6.5.1 ) 
or to discontinue the IMP. The study  participants may withdraw from treatment if he or she 
decides to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason.  
The 24 -week treatment duration should be suffici ent for efficacy evaluation of dupilumab. 
Dupilumab treatment has shown clinical efficacy prior to Week 24 in all Phase 3  clinical studies  
examined across all indications. In addition, biomarkers of disease response, including total serum 
IgE levels platea u after Week 16 but before Week 24 in prior AD clinical studies , including the 
52-week AD study (R668 -AD-1224; CHRONOS). Given that the clinical efficacy and biomarker 
changes occur prior to Week 24 in prior studies in multiple indications, the Sponsor con siders that 
a 24-week study is an appropriate duration to observe dupilumab’s effect in ColdU . The duration 
of the 12 -week follow -up period is based on the time expected for drug levels to reach zero 
(below the lower limit of quantification) in most partic ipants  after the last dose of dupilumab.  
In addition to adults, the study will evaluate efficacy and safety in adolescents. It is reported that 
cold urticaria of ten develops in young adults ( 1) and therefore , it is considered important to  make 
dupilumab available to adolescent without delay. It is planned to enroll at least 4 adolescent 
participants  (9). Inclusion of both populations in one study is supported by the fact that ColdU  is 
similar in adult and adolescent patients in terms of pathophysiology, clinical presentation and 
diagnostic procedures, and treatment guidelines (EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/WAO) are similar for 
both adult and adolescent population.  
Assessment of dupilumab will pr ovide efficacy data that can be used for positioning of  dupilumab 
in current treatment algorithm of ColdU  recommen ded in International Guideline ( 2). 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE   
Based on the known PK, safety and efficacy of dupilumab, the selected dosing regimen is 
dupilumab 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg for adults; and 300 mg  q2w with a loading 
dose of 600 mg for adolescents ≥60 kg OR 200 mg q2w with a loading dose of 400  mg for 
adolescent s ≥30 kg and  <60 kg. These are the approved dose regimens for AD, another skin 
disease and they are expected to achieve concentrations in serum that saturate the IL -4/IL-13 
receptor in most patients and hence they are expected to provide the maximum benefi t and 
therefore to achieve the optimal benefit/risk ratio in this patient population. Organ perfusion is 
anticipated to be similar between AD and primary acquired chronic inducible cold urticaria  and 
lower than the rate of lung perfusion.  
Furthermore, for AD a loading dose was administered to more rapidly achieve effective drug 
concentrations, thereby allowing a rapid PD response as demonstrated by improvement in 
pruritus, a hallmark of AD. Similarly, as pruritus is a core symptom of primary acquired chroni c 
inducible cold urticaria , and to achieve effective drug concentrations more rapidly, a loading dose 
is selected for this study.

personnel and/or health care professionals (eg,  visiting nurse service) to administer IMP at 
participant’s home.  
For doses not given at the study center , paper diaries will be provided to record information 
related to the injectio ns. The paper diary will be kept as source data in the participants  study file.  
At Visit 2 , the Investigator or delegate will prepare and inject the first dose of IMP in front of the 
participant (or parent/legally authorized representative, or caregiver) . If home administration is 
planned, t he participant (or parent/legally authorized representative  or caregiver) will prepare and 
inject the second dose of IMP under the supervision of the Investigator or delegate. Th e training 
must be documented in the parti cipant’s study file.  In case of emergency  (eg, natural disaster, 
pandemic etc.) different training ways (eg, virtual training via video  call etc.) can be performed 
(and will be documented in the participant’s study file).  
Subcutaneous injection sites shoul d alternate between the upper thighs, 4 quadrants of the 
abdomen or the upper arms, so that the same site is not injected twice during consecutive 
administrations. Injection in the upper arms can only be done by a trained person (parent/legally 
authorized representative/caregiver trained by the Investigator or d elegate) or health care 
professional but not the participants themselves.  
Participants should be monitored for at least 30 minutes. The monitoring period may be extended 
as per country specific or lo cal study center -specific requirements . 
The participant/parent/legally authorized representative/caregiver should be trained by the study 
center staff to recognize potential signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction in order to 
self-monitor/monitor at home for at least 30 mi nutes (or longer per country specific or local study 
center -specific requirements) following injection. In case of hypersensitivity symptom/s the 
participant should contact his/her healthcare provider/emergency contact.

• Participants who used H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily prior to study entry should 
continue to take it daily. Note: regular/daily use of H1 -antihistamine  prior to study entry is 
defined as H1 -antihistamine intake for at least 4 days per week for at least 1 month prior to 
screening visit (Visit 1)  
• Participants who took H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should limit the use 
to short -term. 
The H 1-antihistamine dose used during the study should be the same dose the participants took to 
prevent ColdU symptoms prior to study entry (“prescreening dose”). Howe ver, if participants  
experience a flare rescue therapy may be initiated. Please refer to Section  6.5.1  for rescue therapy.  
If participants are on a dose higher than 4-fold the approved CSU dose at the screening visit 
(Visit  1), the Investigator can adjust the participant’s dose within the stipulated range at the 
screening visit (Visit  1). 
The followi ng list of H1 -antihistamine  is allowed  as background and rescue  therapy  during the 
study  (see Section 6.5.1 ) and noted with their recommended dose:

In each participant, all ice cube provocation tests from screening visit (Visit 1) to EOS (Visit 5) 
should be done under the same background therapy conditions . For at least 5 consecutive days 
prior to the test, participants sho uld either  be on stable H 1-antihistamine prescreening dose  (if 
they take H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily)  or be without H1 -antihistamine intake  (if they  use

the conditions unchanged during the study.  
Background therapy reimbursement will be provided when deemed necessary and as per country 
regulation.  
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING /STORAGE/ACCOUNTABIL ITY  
Storage and Handling  
1. The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all IMP received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved 
before use of the study intervention.  
2. Only participants randomized  in the study may receive IMP and only authorized  study center  
staff may supply or administer IMP. At study center, a ll IMP must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in acco rdance with the 
labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized  study center  
staff.  
3. The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconcilia tion, and record maintenance ( ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
Responsibilities  
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP  (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration dat e, etc) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor. 
Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure (see  Section  8.3.8 ). 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and elimin ate potential hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for 
direct -to-patient [DTP ]shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by the 
Sponsor), allow the IMP  to be used other than as directed by this clinical study  protocol, or 
dispose of IMP  in any other manner.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 55 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE  BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING   
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized IMP using an interactive response 
technology ( IRT). The Investigator will be questioned during  the interactive voice response 
system (IV RS) phone call/interactive web response system (IWRS ) web module if he/ she wishes 
to enroll the participant  in the study . Befo re the study is initiated, the telephone number and call -
in directions for the IVRS and/or the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
At the screening visit (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will contact the IRT  system to receive 
the participant number. If a  participant  who had previously failed screening is approached for 
rescreening, a new ICF must be signed. In such case, a new  participant  number will be assigned 
by IRT.  
Methods of assigni ng participants  to treatment group  
The randomized intervention kit number list is generated centrally by Sanofi and IMPs 
(dupilumab 300 mg, dupilumab 200 mg, or their matching placebo) are packaged in accordance 
with this list. The randomization and intervention allocation ar e performed centrally by an IRT. 
The IRT generates the participant randomization list and allocates the intervention number and the 
corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it.  
Participants  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio treatmen t arm as described in the  Table  3. 
Randomization will be stratified by age (adolescent versus adult) and within adult group by 
country  and background H1 -antihistamine  regular/daily  use (Yes /No) (see Section  6.1.2  for 
additional background therapy details) . 
Number of participants using H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should be at least 
. At screening (Visit 1), the Investigator or des ignee will contact the IRT system to receive 
the participant number. If a  participant  who had previously failed  screening is approached for 
re-screening, a new ICF must be signed. In such case, a  new participant  number will be assigned 
by IRT.  
A randomized  participant is defined as a participant who has been allocated to a randomized 
intervention regardless of whether the treatment was administered or not (ie. participant registered 
by the IRT). A participant cannot be randomized more than once in the study . 
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in schedule of activities (SoA ) 
(Section  1.3). Returned study intervention should not be re -dispensed to the participants.  
Methods of blinding  
Dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg and placebo matching dupilumab 300 mg/200 mg will be provided in 
identically matched 2 mL/1.14 mL pre -filled syringes that are visually indistinguishable for each 
dose. Syringes and box es will be labeled with a treatment kit number. Whilst this study is 
double -blinded in terms of treatment with either dupilumab or placebo, it is not blinded to weight -
based dose levels, due to the different volume size (2 mL versus 1.14 mL) of the dose level of

different weight categories for adolescents.  
Code breaking  
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s intervention 
assignment is warranted (eg, in case of availabl e antidote). Participant safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, he/she may, at his/her discretion, contact the Sponsor to discuss the situation prior to 
unblin ding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of 
the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be 
notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason  that the blind was broken 
must be recorded in the source documentation and the electronic case report form (eCRF ), as 
applicable.  
If the code is broken, the participant must withdraw from IMP a dministration.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION C OMPLIANCE   
• The Investigator or his/her delegate must ensure that IMP is administered to each 
participant according to the labeling instructions.  
• Investigational medicinal product  accountability:  
- Investigational medicinal product  units are returned by the participant at each visit. In 
case of DTP process, the intervention units can be returned by the carrier (if defined in 
the contract).  
- The Invest igator or his/her delegate counts the number of remaining kits/pre -filled 
syringes and fills in the Intervention Log Form.  
- The Investigator or his/her delegate records the dosing information on the appropriate 
pages of the  eCRF . 
- The monitor in charge of th e study then checks the eCRF data by comparing them with 
the IMP which he/she has retrieved and intervention log forms /source documents.  
- A paper diary will be dispensed to the participants for indicating  IMP administration at 
home.  
When participants are do sed at the study center , they will receive study intervention directly from 
the Investigator or design ee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF . The 
dose of study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of 
dosing by a member of the study  center  staff other than the person adminis tering the study 
intervention.  
When participants self -administer study interven tion(s) at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed at each visit.  Compliance will be assessed by  checking diary and

A record of the number of  kits/pre -filled syringes  dispensed to and taken by each participant must 
be maintained and reconciled with study interv ention and compliance records. Intervention start 
and stop dates, including dates for intervention delays and/or dose reductions will also be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY   
Any medication or vaccine  (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives 
during the study must be recorded along with:  
• Reason for use.  
• Dates of administration inclu ding start and end dates.  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency.  
Non-sedating H1 -antihistamines, at up to 4 -fold the approved dose for CSU, are allowed as 
background medication an d on demand as recue medication . See Section  6.1.2  and Section  6.5.1  
for details.  
The concomitant use of the following therapies is prohibited during the entire study. Study 
treatment will need to be discontinued in participants receiving these treatments:  
• Systemic immunosuppressants (immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs) 
eg, systemic corticosteroids (oral or parenteral [intravenous, intramuscular, SC]), 
cyclosporine, mycophenolate -mofetil, interferon gamma, Janus kinase inhibitors, 
azathioprine, methotrexat e, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, sulfasalazine, colchicine, etc.  
Note: a short course of OCS is allowed as rescue therapy (see  Section  6.5.1  ) 
• Any cell -depleting agents including but not limited to rituximab  
• Monoclonal antibodies (which are biological response modifiers)  including a nti-IgE 
therapy (omalizumab)  
• Treatment with a live (attenuated) vaccine  
• IVIG  
• Plasmapheresis  
• Other investigational drugs.  
The concomitant use of following therapies is prohibited during the entire study but study 
treatment will not need to be discontinued in participants receiving these treatments in violation of

therapy)  
• Routine doses of doxepin (daily or every other day during 5 or more consecutive days)  
• LTRAs and H2 receptor antagonists, unless stable a nd taken for diseases other than 
chronic inducible ColdU  
• Antifibrinolytic tranexamic acid and epsilon -aminocaproic acid  
• Phototherapy, including tanning beds . 
6.5.1  Rescue medicine   
All participant s will be allowed to take study -defined  H1-antihistamine  (see Section  6.1.2 ) as 
rescue therapy as long as they do not exceed 4 -fold the approved dose for CSU  during the 
screening, treatment, and follow -up periods. If symptoms are still uncontrolled after increase of 
H1-antihistamine to the maximum allowed dose, or if the participant  is already on the 4-fold  
approved H1-antihistamine , participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 4 -fold the 
approved  dose for CSU or a short course of OCS is allowed during the treatment and follow -up 
periods. In order to ensure consistency, when possible, it is recommended to use OCS for 5 to 
7 days with a starting dose of oral prednisone 40  mg (or clinically comparable OCS) followed by 
taper per the Investigator’s judgment.  
Due to an episodic nature of ColdU , it is recommended to prescribe rescue therapy for a short 
period of time (not more than 7 days).  
The ice cube provocation test should be delayed  if rescue therapy (H1 -antihistamine or OCS) is 
taken within 5 days prior to th e test . The ice cube provocation t est can be done when the 
participant  is back to prescreening H1 -antihistamine  dose or is off H1-antihistamine  (or OCS)  
intake  for at least 5 consecutive days  to allow to have ice cube provocation test performed under 
the same background condition for each participant from screening visit (Visit 1) to EOS (Visit  5). 
In case of systemic hypersensitivity reactions due to cold , the participants may require 
epinephrine treatment. EpiPen (or a local equivalent) will be provided t o the participants at the 
beginning of the study, and the participants should be appropriately trained  how and when to use 
it. EpiPen use should be in accordance  with the locally approved p roduct labeling.  
For rescue medication in participants in Japan, pl ease see  Appendix  8 (Section  10.8). 
The initial background therapy should remain unchanged throughout the study . Participants 
should continue their prescreening dose of initial H1 -antihistamine once rescue treatment is no 
longer required  or stop H1 -antihistamine intake . The use of permitted rescue medications should 
be delayed  in all participants , if possible, for at least 8 weeks following the initiation of the 
investigational treatment. The date and time of rescue medication administration as well as the 
name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication must be recorded.

PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION /WITHDRAWAL   
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION   
7.1.1  Definitive  discontinuation   
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant  to permanently discontinue  study 
intervention . If study intervention is permanently  discontinued, the participant should complete 
the early treatment discontinuation visit with all assessments pla nned for the end of treatment 
(EOT ) Visit . See the S oA (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of 
study intervention . 
The participants may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he or she decides to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should 
be made to document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation , and this should be documented 
in the eCRF.  
Participants must be permanently withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized und er 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective participant to the patient’s 
participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research).  
• If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
participant’s well -being. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor.  
• Any code broken requested by the Investigator will lead to permanent discontinuation of 
study intervention.  
• Pregnanc y. 
• Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (see  Section  10.9). 
• Diagnosis of a  malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.  
• Any opportunistic infection or other infections whose nature or course may suggest an 
immunocompromised status (see Section  10.11 ). 
• Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT ) >3 × Upper Limit of Normal (ULN ) and total 
bilirubin >2  × ULN (see  Section  10.6). 
• Serum ALT >5  × ULN if baseline ALT ≤2  × ULN or ALT >8  × ULN if baseline 
ALT  >2 × ULN (see Section  10.6).

(see Section  6.5). 
• If the participant misses more than 2 consecutive doses of the IMP (see  Section  7.1.2 ). 
• Systemic hypersensitivity reaction including anaphylaxis related or suspected to be related 
to ice cube provocation test. In the participants who experienced such reaction no further 
ice cub e provocation test should be done during the study.          
See the SoA  (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of intervention  discontinuation and 
follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter w ill be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation  within a reasonable timeframe as assessed by the Investigator before making 
a decision of definitive discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned participant . 
If a clinically significant ECG finding is identifi ed (including, but not limited to changes from 
baseline in QT interval corrected using [Bazett’s formula {QTcB}  or Fridericia’s formula 
{QTcF }]) at screening , the Investigator  or qualified designee will determine if the participant is 
eligible for  the study. This review of the ECG printed at the time of collection must be 
documented. Any new clinically relevant finding should be reported as an AE.  
Handling of participants after definitive intervention  discontinuation  
Participants will be followed -up according to the study procedures specified in this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed -up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.  
Participants  who discontinue th e study intervention prematurely (prior to completing the 24 -week 
treatment period) will perform, as soon as possible, the early treatment discontinuation Visit with 
all assessments normally planned for the EOT visit (Visit 4), to assure a complete clinica l 
assessment in close temporal proximity to the premature termination of study treatment is 
available.  
In addition, and to allow assessment of participant outcomes over the stipulated study period, 
participants  will be asked and encouraged to complete all remaining study treatment visits and 
participate in safety follow -up according to the visit schedule with a ±3 day window. Under 
exceptional circumstances when a participant cannot come to the  study center  for a scheduled 
visit, a  phone contact can be made . During the phone contact, at least information about AEs, 
concomitant medication and status of  urticaria should be collected.  
All cases of permanent intervention discontinuation must be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of eCRF when c onsidered as confirmed.  
7.1.2  Temporary discontinuation   
Temporary intervention discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of 
suspected AEs  or disruption of the clini cal trial due to regional or national emergency declared by

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 62 a governmental agency (Appendix 9 [ Section  10.9]). For all temporary intervention 
discontinuations, duration should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the 
eCRF.  
In addition, i f patients become infected while receivi ng treatment with dupilumab and do not 
respond to antihelminth ic treatment, treatment with dupilumab should be temporarily 
discontinued until infection resolves.  
If the participant  misses more than 2 consecutive doses, the participant  will be permanently 
discontinued from the study  treatment . 
For all temporary intervention discontinuations, duration should be recorded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the eCRF.  
7.1.2.1  Rechallenge   
Reinitiation of intervention  with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator  will have considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned adverse event 
was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to  Section  5.1 and 
Section  5.2). 
For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, contingency measures 
are included in Appendix 9  (Section  10.9). 
7.2 PARTICIPANT DISCONTI NUATION/ WITHDRAWAL FROM THE STUDY   
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at h is/her own request  or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator  for safety, behavioral, compliance, or 
administrative reasons.  This is expected to be uncommon . 
• At the time of discontinuing from the study, if possible, an early disc ontinua tion visit 
should be conducted. Refer to SoA (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of 
study discontinuation and follow -up and for any further evaluations that need to be 
completed.  
• The participant  will be permanently discontinued both from the study intervention  and 
from the study at that time . 
• If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor  may 
retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withd rawal of consent.  
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples 
taken and not tested, and the Investigator  must document this in the study  center  records.  
If participants no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study.

collected during their continued involvement will be emphasized as important to the public health 
value of the study.  
Participants who withdraw from the study intervention  should be explicitly asked about the 
contribution of possible AEs to their decision, and any AE information elicited must be 
documented.  
All study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator  in the appropriate screens of the 
eCRF and in the participant’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented.  
In addition, a participant may withdraw his/her consent to stop participating in the  study. 
Withdrawal of consent for intervention  should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for 
Follow -up Visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -participant contact follow -up, 
(eg, medical record checks ). The  study center  should document any case of withdrawal of 
consent.  
Participants who have withdrawn from the study cannot be  re-randomized  (treated) in the study. 
Their inclusion and intervention  numbers must not be reused.  
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW UP  
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a partic ipant fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The study center  must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit sch edule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the Investigator  or designee must make 
every effort to r egain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s 
medical record.  
• Should the participant continue to be unr eachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of Appendix  1 
(Section  10.1).

• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  (Section  1.3). Protocol 
waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that p otential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as pa rt of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the  time f rame defined in the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
• It is recommended that a ssessments/procedures at a study center visit are performed in the 
following order if applicable (see Section  1.3) and possible:  
- Patient -Reported Outcome questionnaires  (ColdUAS [if not performed at home bef ore 
the study visit] , DLQI /CDLQI , UCT, ColdU -QoL,  5-level EuroQol 5 -dimensional 
questionnaire [EQ -5D-5L]) should be completed by the participants before the 
consultation and/or clinical tests, in a quiet place. The questionnaires should be 
completed by t he participants themselves, independently from their physician, the 
study nurse, or any other medical personnel and without any help from friends or 
relatives.  
- ECG (at screening), physical examination including vital signs, safety and laboratory 
assessment . 
- Ice cube provocation test . 
- Investigator /participant  evaluation of urticaria symptoms at the provocation test site 
will be performed 10 minu tes after ice cube removal . The Investigator will do his/her 
assessment first (the presence/absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site 
of exposure [primary endpoint] and wheal  intensity Likert scale ). Then the participant 
will rate p eak pruritus Numerical Rating Scale  (NRS ), peak burning sensation N RS, 
peak pain se nsation NRS and will answer the Patient Global Impression of Severity 
(PGIS ) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC ). It is important that the 
Investigator does not give any details of the evaluation to the participant, so his/her

Investigator/study center staff in the eCRF.  
8.1.1   Ice cube provocation test  
Cold urticaria is defined by the appearance of its signs and symptoms (hives /wheals , itch, pain, 
and burning sensation) after contact cooling and rewarming of the skin. Chronic inducible 
urticarias, including primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU , are diagnosed based on the 
patient history and the results of provocation testing. Moreo ver, cold provocation tests are used in 
clinical studies in patients with chronic urticaria to evaluate efficacy of treatments, mainly 
antihistami ne treatments, but also doxepin , cyproheptadine  (7, 24), either by evaluating the 
proportion of patients who after treatment did not develop signs/symptoms with the cold 
provocation test or evaluating the response to  an experimental CSTT,  ie, minimum time threshold 
of cold stimulation required to induce a coalescent wheal and other ColdU  signs and symptoms.  
The ice cube provocation test is the most frequently used provocation method for ColdU  in 
routine clinical practice and is therefore propo sed for the  present clinical study.  
The consensus recommendations for  CIndU (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) defines the 
following for provocation methods for ColdU :  
• Provocation tests should be performed by applying a cold stimulus to forearm skin . 
• Cold provocation testing should be performed for 5 minutes on volar for earm. 
• Ice cube should be melting within a thin plastic bag to avoid cold damage of the skin and 
to prevent direct water contact to avoid the confusion with aquagenic urticaria if the test is 
positive.  
• Reading time 10 minutes of rewarming after ice cube is remov ed. 
Emergency treatment should be available at the study center to be administered by trained study 
center staff if severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs during the ice cube provocation test.  
The ice cube provocation test procedure will be described in a  separate document.  
See Section  6.1.2  and Section  6.5.1  for details regarding background therapy requirements related 
to the ice cube provocation test and instructions how to proceed  when a participant is using rescue 
therapy  within 5 days prior to the test . 
For each participant, it is recommended that the ice cube test results are read by the same study 
personnel during the entire study , if possible.  
The p rimary endpoint will be the proportion of participants  with negative ice cube provocation 
test at Week 24 compared to placebo. The negative test is defined as the absence of a confluent 
hive/wheal at the enti re skin site of exposure after i ce cube provocation test . The assessment  will 
be done by the Investigator 10 minutes after ice cube remov al. The result will be  recorded in 
eCRF.  For each ice cube provocation test room temperature and outdoor temperature should be 
reported in eCRF.

The Wheal  intensity Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 5) is a clinician -reported outcome measure  
comprised of a single item assessing the intensity of patients’ cutaneo us reaction rated as follows: 
0=no wheals; 1= numerous  small, noncoalescent wheals; 2= a large, regular, slightly  edematous, 
coalescent wheal; 3= a large and moderately edematou s wheal; 4= a large, regular, and 
significantly edematous wheal witho ut pseudopodia; and 5 =a large, very edematous wheal with 
pseudopodia  (28, 29). 
Investigators  will complete the scale at the study visit, 10 minutes after removal of the ice cube 
from the participant’s arm . Investigators will complete t he wheal  intensity Likert scale in eCRF as 
described  in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.1.3  Peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS), peak pain NRS, and peak burning 
sensation NRS   
Participants will undergo a temperature provocation test using ice cube at study visits at study 
center. Ten minutes after the removal of the ice cube from their arm, p articipants  will be asked to 
rate the severity of local itch, pain, and burning sensation at the prov ocation site skin  using a 
NRS.  
The peak pruritus NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item rated on a scale from 0 (“No itch”) to 
10 (“Worst itch imaginable”). Participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their worst local 
site pruritus (itch) 10 minu tes after removal of the ice cube . The 24 -hour version  of the scale  has 
been developed, tested and validated with patients with AD; a threshold value of 4 has been 
determined as a meaningful within -person change in score in adults and adolescent patients w ith 
AD (30). 
The peak pain NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item ra ted on a scale from 0  (“No pain ”) to 10 
(“Worst imaginable pain”). Participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their worst local site 
pain 10 minutes  after removal of the ice cube.  
The peak burning sensation NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item rated on a scale from 
0 (“No burning sensation”) to 10 (“Worst imag inable burning sensation”). Participants will be 
asked to rate the intensity of the worst local site burning sensation of their skin 10 minutes after 
the removal of the ice cube . 
Participants  will complete the NRS as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.4  Urticaria control test (UCT) 4 -item version   
The UCT  is a PRO questionnaire for assessing urticaria control. The questionnaire has been 
developed and validated with patients with CSU and CIndU  (25). It is comprise d of 4 items : 
severity of physical symptoms of urticaria (itch, hives and/or swelling); QoL impairment; 
frequency of treatment being not sufficient to control urticaria; overall urticarial control. Recall 
period is “last four weeks”. Each item is rated on a 5 -point Li kert scale (scored with 0  to 4 points). 
Low scores indicate high disease activity and low disease control. The UCT total score is

scores are 0 and 16, with a score of 16 for  complete disease control ( 25). 
The minimal important difference (MID ) of the UCT is determined to be 3 ( 31). 
Participants will complete the UCT as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.5  Cold Urticaria Activity Score   
The ColdUAS is a disease -specific PRO questionnaire  designed to determine cold urticaria 
disease activity. ColdUAS is intended for patients with cold urticaria aged 12 years old and above; 
it has been developed and comprehensively tested with adults and adolescent patients with co ld 
urticaria.  Disease activity assessment is based on the daily documentation of cold-induced skin 
reactions (wheals and  swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), avoidance 
behavior and trigger exposure, and overall symptoms sever ity. Skin reaction, skin sensations, 
exposition to cold temperatures that usually cause ColdU  symptoms and overall symptom severity 
are rated on a 4 -point scale from 0 (“No”) to 4 (“Yes, severe”); avoidance of cold temperatures 
that usually lead to ColdU  symptoms are answered using responses “No”, “Yes partially 
avoided”, “Yes completely avoided”.  
After each week of completion, p articipants  will be asked 2 additional questions about the overall 
disease activity of their ColdU  in the past week using a 4 -point Likert scale from “No disease 
activity” to “High disease activity”  and 1 question about their current disease activity in the past 
week compared with before treatment using a 4 -point Likert scale . 
Participants  will complete the ColdUAS as described in th e SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.1.6  Dermatology Life Quality Index and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index   
The DLQI is a PRO developed to measure dermatology -specif ic HRQoL in adult participants 
(26). The instrument  comprises 10 items assessing the impact of skin disease on participant’s  
HRQoL over the previous week. The items cover symptoms, leisure activities, work/school or 
holiday time, personal relationships including intimate, the side effects of treatment, and 
emotional reactions to having a skin disease. It is a validated question naire used in clinica l 
practice and clinical trials ( 32). The r esponse scale is a 4 -point Likert scale (0  = “Not at all” and 
3 = “Very much”)  for 9  items. The remaining 1 item about work/studying asks whether 
work/study has been prevented and then (if “No”) to what degree the skin condition has been a 
problem at work/study; the item is rated on a 3 -point Likert scale ( “Not at  all” to “A lot”). Overall 
scoring ranges from 0 to 30, with a high score indicative of a poor HRQoL. Using an integrated 
analysis of distribution and anchor -based approaches using the change in DLQI total score and 
participant -assessed itch severity scores, the MID for the DLQI in participants with chronic 
idiopathic urticaria was reported to be in th e range of 2.24 to 3.10 points ( 33). So far , there is  no 
MID value determined for chronic inducible ColdU  patients.  
The CDLQI  is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on 
children’s HRQoL ( 34). Participants  provide responses to 10  questions (symptoms feelings 
associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leisure, school or holidays, personal

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 69 relationships, sleep, and side effects of treatment for the skin disease). The instrument has a recall 
period of 7 days. Nine of the 10 questions are scored on a 4-po int Likert scale ranging from 0 =Not 
at all/question unanswered to 3 =Very much. Question  7 has an additional possible response 
(prevented school), which is assigned a score of 3. The CDLQI total score is the sum of the score 
of each question with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the greater the 
impact is on the child’s HRQoL.  
Participants  will complete the DLQI (≥16 years old) or CDLQ I (≥12 to <16 years old) as 
described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.7  Cold Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire   
The C oldU -QoL questionnaire is a newly developed disease -specific PRO questionnaire designed 
to assess the impact of cold urticaria on patients’ HRQoL. It has been developed and 
comprehensively tested with adults and adolescent patients with cold urticaria. The questionnaire 
contains 19 items, each rated using 5 -point Li kert scale from 0 (Not at all / Never) to 4 (Very 
much / Very often), with a “Last 2 weeks” recall period.  The total raw score of the ColdU -QoL is 
transformed to a 0 -100 scale with higher scores indicating higher ColdU -related QoL impairment . 
Participants  will complete the ColdU -QoL as described in the SoA ( Section  1.3) 
8.1.8  Patient Global Impression of Change of chronic inducible ColdU  disease and 
Patient Global Impression of Severity of chronic inducible ColdU  disease   
The PGIC  is a 1 -item questionnaire that asks the participant to provide the overall self -assessment 
of change in their chronic inducible ColdU  on a 7 -point scale, compared with  just before 
participant started taking the study tre atment. Response choices are:  0=“Very much better”, 
1=“Moderately better”, 2=“A little better”, 3=“No change”, 4=“A lit tle worse”, 5=“Moderately 
worse”, 6= “Very much worse”.  
The PGIS  is a 1 -item questionnaire that asks participants to provide the overall self -assessment of 
their chronic inducible ColdU  current severity on a 4 -point  scale. Response choices are: 
1=“None”, 2= “Mild”, 3=“Moderate”, 4= “Severe”.  
Participants  will complete the 2 items  after having answered the peak pruritus NRS, pain NRS, 
and skin burning sensation NRS  as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.9  Acquired  Cold Urticaria Severity Index   
The Acquired Cold Urticaria Severity Index (ACUSI ) is a measure  designed to evaluate the 
severity o f the ACU  signs/symptoms ( 35). It is composed of 4 questions regarding the severity of 
ACU : 1) worst problems ever caused by cold urticarial; 2) season during which problems with 
outdoor activities occur because it w as too cold; 3) maximum treatment needed; 4) frequency of 
complains. Questions 1, 3, and 4 are attributed 1 to 4 points, and question 3 is attributed 1 to 
3 points, thus resulting in a score ranging from 4 to 15. Scores of 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to

in the e CRF.  
8.1.10  EuroQol -5 Dimensions questionnaire   
The EuroQol -5 dimensions (EQ -5D) is a standardized PRO measure of health status developed by 
the EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal. The EQ -5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EuroQol visual 
analog ue scale (EQ -VAS ). The EQ -5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 
5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension has 5 l evels of perceived problems: “no problem”, “slight problems”, “moderate 
problems”, “severe problems”, and “ extreme  problems” ( 36). The respond ent is asked to indicate 
his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5  dimensions; this results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level for that 
dimension. The digits for 5  dimensio ns can be combined in a 5 -digit number describing the 
respondent’s health state. The EQ -VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, 
visual analogue scale  where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state (100)” and 
“worst imag inable health state (0)”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of 
health outcome as judged by the individual respondents.  
The recall period is “today”.  
Participants  will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.11  Health care resource utilization/ productivity   
A questionnaire on health care resource utilization and productiv ity (missed days of school [12 to 
17 years old]/workdays [18 and above]) will be collected by the Investigator for all participants 
throughout the study through eCRF.  
Participants  will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA (Section  1.3).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 71 • Any new findi ng or worsening of previous finding should be reported as a new AE. 
8.2.2  Vital signs   
• Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine or sitting position after 5 minutes rest and 
will in clude axillary  or oral  temperature  (same method of temperature measurement 
should be used during the course of the study) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 
pulse and respiratory rate. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be assessed 
using  the same arm with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used 
only if an automated device is not available.  
• Body weight (kg) will be measured at screening (Visit 1) and at EOT/EOS Visits. Height 
will be measured at screening visit (Visit  1). Height and weight should be measured with 
indoor clothing but without shoes.  
8.2.3  Electrocardiograms   
• A single standard 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at the screening  visit (Visit 1) as outlined 
in the SoA ( Section  1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate 
and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. The ECG should be recorded after 
10 minutes of rest in the supine position.  The ECG will be read locally  and results reported 
in the e CRF. In ca se of a clinically significant finding the  Investigator should assess if it 
impacts a participant’s  eligibility and document this in the medical records. An AE should 
be reported if appropriate.  
8.2.4  Clinical safety laboratory assessments   
• See Appendix  2 (Section  10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests including pregnancy 
testing to be performed and to the SoA  (Section  1.3) for the timing  and frequency.  
• The Investigator  must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease.  
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline 
or are no longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator . 
• If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by the Investigator , the etiology should be identified and  the Sponsor  notified.  
• All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in  Appendix  2 (Section  10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
• If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered 
clinically significant by the Investigator  (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the eCRF.

The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in  Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
An AE will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a car egiver, parent, surrogate, 
or the participant ’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that 
caused th e participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information   
All AEs, serious or nonserious,  will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS Visit at 
the time points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESIs  will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE /AESI  data to the Sponsor  within 24  hours of it 
being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE s or SAE s after conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reas onably 
related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor.  
8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs   
The method of recording, eval uating, and assessing causality of AE s and SAE s and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/ AESI/ SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. At the  pre-specified study end date, a ll SAEs,  and 
non-serious AESIs  (as defined in  Section  8.3), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is provided  in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 73 8.3.4  Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs   
• Prompt notification by the Investigator  to the Sponsor  of an SAE is essential so that l egal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of 
a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The Sponsor  has a l egal responsibility to notify b oth the local r egulatory authority and 
other r egulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor  will comply with country specific r egulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the r egulatory aut hority, Institutional Review Boa rds 
(IRB )/Independent Eth ics Committees  (IEC ), and Investigator s. 
• Adverse events that are con sidere d expected will be specified  in the reference safety 
information.  
• Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR ) are reported to regulatory 
authorities, Investigators, and IRBs/IECs as follows:  
- For SUSARs that are life -threatening or result in death, reporting is no later than  
7 days after first knowledge by the Sponsor, with all relevant follow -up information 
subsequently reported within an additional 8 days  
- For SUSARs, other than those that are life -threatening or r esult in death, reporting is 
no later than 15 days after first knowledge by the Sponsor . 
• An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report  describing  an SAE, SUSAR , or 
any other specific safety information ( eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor 
will review and then file it along with the  IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements.  It is the resp onsibility of the Sponsor to assess whether an 
event meets the criteria for a SUSAR, and therefore, is expedited to regulatory authorities.  
IB is reference safety information for considering AEs as expected.  
8.3.5  Pregnancy   
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected  from the signing of the 
ICF up to the EOS  Visit or within 12  weeks after last study intervention, wh ichever was  
later. Details of all pregnancies in female partners of male participants  will be collected  
after the start of study  intervention up to the EOS  Visit or within 12  weeks after last study 
intervention, wh ichever was  later. 
• If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigat or should inform the Sponsor  within 24 hours  of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in  Appendix  4 
(Section  10.4). The IMP should be permanently discontinued in case of pregnancy of 
female participant (see  Section  7.1.1 ).

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 75 - An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the participant (not based on systematic pills 
count)  and defined as at least twice the intended dose during an interval of less than 
11 days. The circumstances (ie,  accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in 
the overdose form.  An overdose (accidental or intentional) with any NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneously notified by the participant (not based on 
systematic pills count)  and defined as at least twice the maximum prescribed daily 
dose, within the intended therapeutic interval. The circumstances (ie, accidental or 
intentional) should be clearly specified in the overdose f orm. 
8.3.7.1  Anaphylactic  reactions   
A serious feature of ColdU  is anaphylaxis. Thirty -five percent to 70% of patients with chronic 
inducible ColdU have experience d systemic reactions inc luding anaphylaxis in severe cases.  (6, 
37, 38). 
Anaphylaxis is defined as a severe, potentially life -threatening systemic hypersensitivity reaction, 
characterized by being rapid in onset with life -threatening airway, breathing, or circulatory 
problems that is usually, though not always, associated with skin and mucosal changes . 
When the diagnosis of anaphylaxis is made, the basis for having suspected the diagnosis must  be 
documented, using the criteria  in Appendix 10 (Section  10.10 ), established by the Second 
Symposium on the Definition and Manageme nt of Anaphylaxis  (37, 39). Reports of anaphylaxis 
will be collected as AESIs in the eCRF . 
All p articipants  with ColdU  and their parents /legal representative/caregiver  should be cautioned 
regarding the risk of anaphylaxis and provided with an epinephrine autoinjector.  
The proportio n of participants  with cold exposure triggered urticaria  requiring emergency medical 
care visit or treatment with epinephrine (after provocation test and/or at home) will be evaluated.  
8.3.8  Guidelines for reporting product complaints   
Any defect in the IMP  must be reported as soon as possible by the Investigator  to the monitoring 
team  who will complete a product complaint form within required timelines.  
Appropriate information ( eg, samp les, labels or documents like pictures or photocopies) related to 
product identification and to the potential deficiencies may need to be gathered. The Investigator  
will assess whether or not the quality issue has to be reported together with an AE or SAE.  
8.4 TREATMENT OF OVERDOSE   
Symptomatic o verdose  (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP  is considered as an AESI (defined 
in Section  8.3.7 ). No antidote is available for dupilumab.  The Sponsor does not recommend 
specific treatment for an overdose .

and require s treatment, PK and ADA samples will be collected at or near the onset of the event for 
any additional analysis if required or for archival purposes. The exact date and time of sample  
collection must be recorded and entered into the database by the central laboratory. An 
unscheduled systemic drug concentration page in the eCRF must be completed as well. If 
necessary for safety monitoring, additional PK and ADA samples may be collected after the EOS 
Visit until resolution of the A E. 
8.6 PHARMACODYNAMICS   
See Section  8.8 for IgE measurement. No other PD parameters will be evaluated in this study.  
8.7 GENETICS   
For those participants who  consent to the optional pharmacogenetic/pharmacogenomic sample 
collection section of the ICF, blood samples for exploratory genetic analysis of DNA or RNA will 
be collected and stored for possible future use , including sequencing . Participation is optiona l. 
Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the 
study.  
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested 
from the participant. Signed informed consent will be req uired to obtain a replacement sample 
unless it was included in the original consent.  
Details on processes for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in 
the laboratory manual.

Adolescents will not participate in the optional assessments. See SoA for additional details.  
In addition, for participant(s) who have cons ented to it, samples that are unused or left over after 
planned testing may be used for additional research purposes, including developing assay 
methods, possible analysis of potential biomarkers of drug response,  disease activity, safety, and 
type 2 infla mmation , and developing companion diagnostics . 
8.8.1  Use of Biological Samples and Data for Future Research   
Future research may help further the understanding of disease subtypes, disease biology, related 
conditions, drug response and toxicity, and can help identify new drug targets or biomarkers that 
predict participant response to treatment. Therefore, data and biological samples will be stored 
and used for future research when co nsented to by participants (see  Section  10.1.3 ) unless 
prohibited by local laws or IRBs/IECs (in such case, consent f or future use of sample will not be 
included in the local ICF ). 
For participants who consent to the storage and use of their data and remaining and/or extra 
clinical samples, data and samples may be used after the study ends for future research related 
either to the drug, the mechanism of action, and the disease or its associated conditions. Such 
research may include, but is not limited to, performing assessments on DNA, RNA, proteins or 
metabolites. If future research on genetic material is performed, this  will also be limited to the 
purpose of addressing research questions related to the drug, the mechanism of action, the disease 
or its associated conditions.  
In the event future research is conducted for other purposes, the study participants will be 
infor med of those purposes and will be given means to object to those research projects.  
Data and samples will be used in compliance with the information provided to participants in the 
ICF Part 2 (future research).  
All study participant data and samples will be coded such that no participant direct identifiers will 
be linked to them. Coded data and samples may be transferred to a Sponsor site (or a 
subcontractor site), which may be located outside of the country wher e the study is conducted. 
The Sponsor adopts safeguards for protecting participant confidentiality and personal data (see 
Section  10.1.4 ). 
The samples will be stored for a maximum of 15 years after the end of the study  (or according to 
local regulations) . Any samples remaining at the end of retention period will be destroyed. If a

Study participant coded data will be stored for future research for up to 25 years after the end of 
the study. If data are still considered of important scientific value after this period, coded data 
already available will be anonymized unless otherwise required by applicable laws (the same will 
apply to the data of a study participant who has requested the destruction of his/her samples).  
Participant’s coded data sets provided to researchers for a specific research project will be 
available to the researchers for a maximum of 2 years after the end of their specific project (end of

9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESE S  
The statistical hypothesis for compar ing dupilumab against placebo for  the primary endpoint of 
the proportion of participants with negative i ce cube provocation test at Week 24 is: 
• Null hypothesis H0: No treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo.  
• Alternative hypothesis H1: There is a treatment difference between dupilumab and 
placebo.  
The statistical hypotheses to be tested on the secondary endpoints can be specified sim ilarly.  
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION   
To adequately power the study for the comparison of the primary endpoint of the proportion of 
participants with negative ice cube provocation te st at Week 24  between the  2 groups, the sample 
size was calculated based on the following assumptions:  
1. The placebo group has  of participants with negative ice cube provocation test at 
Week 24 and the dupilumab group has  of participants with negativ e ice cube 
provocation test at Week 24.  
2. There is a drop -out rate of 10% in both groups.  
3. The statistical test is a Z test that is based on the difference of the  2 proportions with 
unpooled variance estimate and 2 -sided 1% significance level.  
4. Participants  are equally randomized to the dupilumab group and the placebo group.  
With these assumptions, 39 participants  per group ( 78 participants  in total) will provide 
90% power  to detect the difference of  response rate in the dupilumab group and  
response rat e in the placebo group . The sample size calculations were performed using

taking highly influential prohibited medications and/or highly influential 
rescue medications (details of selection will be specified in the SAP), 
their data after the medication usage will be set to missing, and the 
WOCF approach (worst postba seline observation for the participant 
will be carried forward) will be used to impute missing Week 24 value 
(for participants whose postbaseline values are all missing, the 
participant’s baseline value will be used to impute the missing

prematurely are encouraged to follow the planned clinical visits. For 
participants who did not take the highly influential prohibited 
medications and/or highly influential rescue medications, all data 
collected aft er treatment discontinuation will be used in the analysis. 
For these participants, missing data may still happen despite all efforts

participants who discontinue study intervention du e to lack of efficacy, 
all data collected after discontinuation will be used in the analysis, and 
a WOCF approach will be used to impute missing Week 24 value if

health emergency on the efficacy (eg ; missing data due to COVID -19) and safety will be detailed 
in the SAP.  
For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, contin gency measures 
are included in Appendix 9 ( Section  10.9). 
9.5 INTERIM ANALYSES   
No interim analy sis is planned for this study.  
A primary database lock will be performed when all randomized participants have completed their 
treatment phase. Final analyses in the CSR  will be based on all data collected up to this database 
lock.  
The database  will be updated at the end of the study fo r all participants to include the 
post-treatment follow -up information and updates for the events previously ongoing at the time of 
the primary lock. Additional data between this database lock and last participant completing last 
visit will be summarized i n a CSR addendum.

RECORDING, EVALUATIN G, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING   
10.3.1  Definition of AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention , whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention . 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention . 
Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistr y, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator ( ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention  administratio n even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention  or a concom itant medication.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the 
Investigator  to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/di sorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.

SAR231893 - EFC16720  - dupilumab  Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 97 • Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did  not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
10.3.2  Definition  of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a) Results in death  
b) Is life -threatening  
The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of  the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has b een detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitaliza tion are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for electiv e treatment  of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This d efinition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life fu nctions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 98 f) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical  events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize 
the participant or may require medical or surg ical intervention to prevent 1  of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events sh ould usually be considered 
serious.  
- Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a 
guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically 
important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive:  
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow 
aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc)  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc).  
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse  
- ALT >3 × ULN + total bilirubin >2 × ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase 
>10 × ULN  
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality  
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of 
blood s ampling)  
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions  
- Cancers diagnosed during the study  
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases diagnosed during the study . 
10.3.3  Recording and foll ow-up of AE and/or SAE   
AE and SAE recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all  
documentation ( eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all rele vant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to Sponsor’s representative  in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
Sponsor’s representative . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to  the Sponsor .

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 99 • The Invest igator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Invest igator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following cat egories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyd ay activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a c ategory utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as “serious ” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention  and 
each occurrence o f each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There ma y be situations in which an SAE has oc curred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to  the Sponsor’s representative . However, it is 
very important that the Investigator  always make an assessment of causality for 
every  event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to  the Sponsor  
• The Investigator  may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment  is 1 of the criteria used when determining r egulatory reporting 
requirements.

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 100 Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as reques ted by  the Sponsor  to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator  will provide the Sponsor  with a copy of any post -mortem findings 
including histopathology , if available.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
10.3.4  Reporting  of SAEs  
SAE re porting to  the Sponsor  via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to  the Sponsor  will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the study center will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section)  in order to report the event within 24 hours . 
• The study center  will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given  study center , the electronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a study center  receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives 
updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data c ollection tool has 
been taken off -line, then the  study center  can report this information on a paper SAE form 
(see next section) or to the  Sponsor’s representative  by telephone.  
• Contacts fo r SAE reporting can be found in the protocol . 
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this 
information to the Sponsor’s representative . 
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone 
is acceptable  with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator  to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  the protocol .

INFORMATION   
DEFINITIONS : 
Woman of childbearing potential (WO CBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following m enarche and until becoming post menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following cat egories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above,  (eg, mullerian agenesis, androg en insensitivity), I nvestigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the  study center’s personnel : review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 consecutive months without  an 
alternative medical cause.  
- Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT )and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective 
contra ception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study

Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use 
a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly  as described below.  
Table  10 - Methods of contraception   
• CONTRACEPTIVESa ALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE : 
• Highly Effective Methodsb That Have Low User Dependency Failure rate of <1% per year when used 
consistently and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine device  
• Intrauterin e hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Vasectomized partner  
• (Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual 
partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional 
highly effective method of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
• Highly Effective Methodsb That Are User Dependent Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and 
correctly.  
• Combined (estro gen- and progestogen -containing ) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovu lation  
- oral 
- intravaginal  
- transdermal  
- injectable  
• Progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
- oral 
- injectable  
• Sexual abstinence  
• (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from  heterosexual intercourse 
during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. ) 
a Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for those 
participating in clinical studies.  
b Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  Typical use failure rates differ from those when used consistently 
and correctly.  
Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides  only, and 
lactational amenorrh ea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male condom and female condom should not be used 
together (due to risk of failure with friction)

Male participants with partners who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator  will attempt to collect pr egnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pr egnant while the male participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male participants who receive  study intervention . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pr egnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator  will record pr egnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor  within  24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pr egnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pr egnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor . 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any ter mination of the pr egnancy will be reported r egardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator  will collect pr egnancy information on any female participant  who 
becomes pr egnant while participating in this study. The initial information  will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor  within  24 hours  of learning 
of a participant ’s pregnancy.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pr egnancy. The 
Investigator  will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor . Generally, follow -up will not be required 
for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the est imated delivery date. Any termination of 
pregnancy will be reported, r egardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for the procedure.  
• Any pr egnancy complication or elective termination of a pr egnancy  for medical reasons  
will b e reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion  (occurring at <22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at 
>22 weeks gestational age)  is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
• Any post -study pr egnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention  by the Investigator  will be reported to the Sponsor  as described in 
Section  8.3.4 . While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pr egnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue the study intervention.

Use/Analysis of DNA and RNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s respo nse to study intervention, susceptibility 
to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be 
due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; safety, mechanism of act ion of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular 
subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulati ons and IRB/IEC 
allow,  blood sample s will be collected for DNA and RNA analysis from consenting 
participants.  
• Deoxyribonucleic acid (DN A) and RNA samples will be used for research related to 
dupilumab or CIndU  and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays 
including diagnostic tests related to dupilumab or related drugs and atopic/allergic 
diseases. Genetic research m ay consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or the 
analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (including whole -exome sequencing, 
whole -genome sequencing, and DNA copy number varia tion). Transcriptome sequencing 
(or other methods for quan titating RNA expression) may also be performed. The samples 
may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the 
response to study intervention or study interventions of this class to understand study 
disease or related co nditions.  
• The Sponsor will store the DNA and RNA samples in a secure storage space with 
adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained while research on study intervention or study interventions of 
this class or indication conti nues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local 
requirements.

10.8.1  Japan   
Section 6.5.1 Rescue medicine  (see Section  6.5.1 ) 
Use of H1 -antihistamines for chronic inducible cold urticarial  treatment  
In Japan, patients with chronic inducible ColdU  who are not we ll-controlled on approve d 
H1-antihistamine dose may escalate the H1 -antihistamine  dose only up to 2 -fold the approved 
dose.  
During the study, participants should continue their established standard of care background 
therapy with a long-acting non -sedat ing H1 -antihistamine, at up  to 2-fold the approved dose for 
CSU.  
• Participants who used H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily prior to study entry should 
continue to take it daily. Note: regular/daily use of H1 -antihistamine prior to study entry is 
defined as H1 -antihistamine intake for a t least 4 days per week for at least 1  month prior to 
screening visit (Visit 1)  
• Participants who took H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should limit the use 
to short -term. 
Rescue therapy  
All participants will be allowed to take  additional doses of their H1 -antihistamine  medications as 
rescue therapy as long as they do not exceed 2 -fold the approved dose during the screening, 
treatment, and follow -up periods. If symptoms are still un controlled after increase of 
H1-antihistamine t o the maximum allowed dose , or if the participant is already on the 2 -fold 
approved H1 -antihistamine, the participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 2 -fold 
approved dose  for CSU or a short course of OCS is allowed as rescue therapy during the t reatment 
and follow -up periods.  
Due to an episodic nature of ColdU , it is recommended to prescribe rescue therapy for a short 
period of time (not more than 7 days). In order to ensure consistency, when possible, it is 
recommended to use a short course of OC S for 5 to 7 days with a starting dose of oral prednisone 
40 mg (or clinically comparable OCS) followed by taper per the Investigator’s judgment . 
The ice cube provocation test should be delayed  if rescue therapy (H1 -antihistamine or OCS) is 
taken within 5 days prior to the test . The ice cube provocation t est can be done when the 
participant  is back to prescreening H1 -antihistamine  dose or is off H1 -antihistamine  (or OCS)  
intake for at least 5 consecutive days  to allow to have ice cube provocation test perfo rmed under 
the same background condition for each participant from screening visit (Visit 1) to EOS (Visit  5). 
The initial background therapy should remain unchanged throughout the study . Participants 
should continue their prescreening  dose of initial H1 -antihistamine once rescue treatment is no 
longer required  or stop H1 -antihistamine intake .

Continuation of the study in the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency : 
A regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency (eg, public health 
emergency, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorist attack) may prevent access to the clinical trial 
site. 
Contingency procedures are suggested for an emergency that prevents access to the study site, to 
ensure the safety of the participants, to consider continuity of the clinical study conduct, protect 
trial integrity, and assist in maintaining compliance with GCP  in Cond uct of Clinical Trials 
Guidance. Sponsor agreement MUST be obtained prior to the implementation of these procedures 
for the duration of the emergency.  
Study Intervention Administration  
The following contingencies may be implemented for the duration of the  emergency (after 
Sponsor agreement is obtained) to make clinical supplies available to the participant for the 
duration of the emergency:  
• In case of emergency (eg, natural disaster, pandemic, etc.), IMP may be supplied from the 
site to the participant vi a a Sponsor -approved courier company where allowed by local 
regulations and approved by the participant (or parent/legally authorized representative).  
• When the participant has a study visit, the IMP will be administered following clinical 
procedures and bl ood collection. Participants should be monitored for at least 30 minutes. 
The monitoring period may be extended as pe r country specific or local study 
center -specific requirements.  
Temporary discontinuation/ rechallenge  
In addition, for a regional or natio nal emergency declared by a governmental agency, the 
temporary discontinuation will be allowed as defined in Section  7.1.2 . 
During a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, reinitiation of IMP 
can only occur once the Investigator has determined,  according to his/her best judg ment, that th e 
contribution of the IMP(s) to the occurrence of the epidemic event (eg. COVID -19) was unlikely.  
Study Assessments and Procedures  
Attempts should be made to perform all assessments in accordance with the approved protocol to 
the extent possible. In case t his is not possible due to a temporary disruption caused by an 
emergency, focus should be given to assessments necessary to ensure the safety of participants 
and those important to preserving the main scientific value of the study. During  the emergency, if  
the site will be unable to adequately follow protocol mandated procedures, alternative treatment 
outside the clinical trial should be proposed, and

Property of the Sanofi group - strictly confidentia l Page 125 screening/enrollment/randomization/administration of study intervention may be temporarily 
delayed (see als o Section  5.5). 
In the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, the 
continuity of clinical study conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or 
alternative mechanisms, such as phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, extension of visit 
windows for on -site visits, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by skilled 
staff. The primary focus should be collection of safety information and provision of daily e -diary 
data collection for key efficacy assessments.  Implementation of such mechanisms may differ 
country by country, depending on country re gulations and local business continuity plans. 
Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 (or any 
other pandemic) will be granted. All temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned 
study procedures ar e to be documented as being related to COVID -19 (or any other public health 
emergency) and will remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency. 
Contingencies implemented due to emergency will be documented.  
Statistical Consideration  
The impact of the regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency on study 
conduct will be summarized (eg, study discontinuation or discontinuation/delay/omission of the 
intervention due to the emergency). Data collected regarding the impa ct of the COVID -19 or 
other pandemics on the participants will be summarized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). 
Any additional analyses and methods required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 or other 
events requiring public health emergency on the efficacy (eg, missing data due to COVID -19) and 
safety will be deta iled in the SAP . 
Informed Consent Process  
For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, contingency procedures 
may be implemented for the duration of the emergency . The participant or their legally authorized 
representative should be verbally informed prior to initiating any changes that are to be 
implemented for th e duration of the emergency (eg,  study visit delays/treatment extension, use of 
local laboratories).

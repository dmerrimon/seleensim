INTRODUCTION
AND
STUDY
RATIONALE
Backgr ound
1.1
Overview
of
the
Disease
Multiple
myeloma
is
the
second
most
common
hematological
malignancy ,
affecting
about
55,000 
Americans.
Limited
control
of
disease
can
be
achieved
with
conventional
dose
chemotherapy 
but
randomized
studies
reported
improved
response
rates
for
patients
who
are
treated
with 
dose-intense
therapy
and
autologous
hematopoietic
stem
cell
(HSC)
transplantation.
However , 
most
patients
who
under go
dose-intense
therapy
will
require
salvage
therapy
at
a
median
of
two 
to
three
years
after
transplantation.
High-dose
melphalan
(200
mg/m
2
)
appears
to
be
the
most 
effective
conditioning
regimen
but
the
potentially
greater
tumor
cell
kill
of
dose-intense 
melphalan
in
syner gistic
combination
with
other
drugs
is
only
now
being
studied.
1.1.1
Multiple
Myeloma
Multiple
myeloma
is
a
malignancy
of
plasma
cells
and
belongs
in
a
family
of
diseases
known
as
plasma
cell
dyscrasias.
It
accounts
for
about
1%
of
all
cancers
and
10%
of
all
hematological
malignancies.
Thus,
it
is
the
second
most
common
“blood
cancer ,”
affecting
approximately
55,000
Americans.
The
annual
incidence
is
about
20,000
cases;
the
annual
death
rate
is
about
11,000.
The
median
age
at
diagnosis
is
65
years
old.
The
disease
is
more
common
in
males
(1.3
to
1)
and
the
frequency
doubles
in
African-Americans
compared
to
Caucasians.

Standard
dose
therapy
for
most
plasma
cell
disorders
includes
regimens
such
as
low-dose
melphalan
(32
mg/m
2
/month)
with
prednisone.
For
patients
with
multiple
myeloma,
this
regimen
results
in
a
40%
overall
response
rate,
but
few
patients
achieve
a
complete
remission
and
the
median
duration
of
response
is
only
2
years.
The
median
survival
is
in
the
range
of
3
years
and
few
(<15%)
survive
5
years.
More
aggressive
chemotherapy
regimens,
including
VAD,
VBMCP
and
M2,
induce
remissions
more
quickly
but
overall
survival
rates
are
not
substantially
improved
(Alexanian
and
Dimopoulos,
1994).
These
poor
outcomes
led
many
investigators
explored
high-dose
chemotherapy
regimens.
In
1983,
McElwain
used
melphalan
140
mg/m
2
without
stem
cell
support
as
a
salvage
therapy
in
nine
patients
with
refractory
myeloma
and
noted
all
patients
responded
to
treatment
with
five
patients
achieving
complete
biochemical
and
bone
marrow
responses
(McElwain
and
Powles,
1983).
This
observation
of
dose-response
led
to
a
series
of
phase
I/II
trials
with
and
without
stem
cell
support
in
both
newly
diagnosed
and
refractory
disease
(Attal
et
al.,
1992;
Harousseau
et
al,
1995).
A
matched-pair
analysis
by
the
Arkansas
group
and
SWOG
comparing
dose-intense
with
standard-dose
therapy
demonstrated
the
benefit
of
autologous
HSC
transplantation
for
the
treatment
of
multiple
myeloma
(Barlogie
et
al.,
1997).
Event-free
(49
vs
27
months)
and
overall
survivals
(62+
vs
48
months)
were
improved
for
patients
treated
with
dose-intense
therapy
as
part
of
the
initial
treatment.
A
number
of
randomized
studies
comparing
dose-intense
therapy
with
autologous
stem
cell
support
to
standard
therapy
regimens
have
been
conducted.
The
French
Myeloma
Intergroup
reported
a
large-scale
randomized
trial
(IFM
90)
that
randomized
two
hundred
patients
to
either
conventional
dose
VMCP/VBAP
or
autologous
bone
marrow
transplantation
with
melphalan
and
total
body
irradiation
after
four
cycles
of
induction
treatment
(Attal
et
al.,
1996).
The
findings
were
strikingly
in
favor
of
the
dose-intense
approach
with
improvements
in
complete
response
rates
(22%
vs
5%)
and
median
probabilities
of
event-free
(27
months
vs
18
months)
and
overall-survivals
(60+
months
vs
37
months).
In
contrast,
the
USIG
found
no
difference
in
overall
survival
using
the
same
transplant
conditioning
regimen
but
a
much
more
intensive
“standard”
non-transplant
chemotherapy
regimen
(Barlogie
et
al.,
2006).
These
authors
also
acknowledged
that
the
combination
of
melphalan
and
TBI
is
now
recognized
as
an
inferior
transplant
regimen.
The
French
group
Myelome
Autogref fe
(MAG)
achieved
results
comparable
to
the
IFM
90
trial;
however ,
there
was
no
significant
difference
in
overall
survivals
as
a
result
of
unexpected
prolonged
survivals
in
the
chemotherapy
arm
(Fermand
et
al.,
2005).
The
Spanish
PETHEMA
group
did
not
find
a
statistically
significant
difference
in
EFS
and
OS
between
chemotherapy
and
dose-intensive
therapy
(Blade
et
al.,
2005).
However ,
only

7
patients
who
responded
(CR:
15%;
PR:
68%;
MR:
17%)
to
conventional
dose
chemotherapy
were
randomized
and
patients
in
the
chemotherapy
arm
were
allowed
to
cross
over
into
the
dose-intensive
therapy
group.
The
Italian
MMSG
compared
melphalan-prednisone
to
two
courses
of
melphalan
at
100
mg/m
2
with
autologous
stem
cell
support
(Palumbo
et
al.,
2004).
They
found
significant
improvement
in
CR
and
EFS
in
the
transplant
arm.
The
Medical
Research
Council
Myeloma
VII
trial
of
407
patients
reported
similar
results
for
a
comparison
of
six
cycles
of
BCNU,
doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide
and
melphalan
to
at
least
three
cycles
of
doxorubicin,
vincristine,
methylprednisolone,
and
cyclophosphamide
followed
by
melphalan
at
200mg/m
2
and
autologous
stem
cell
transplant
(Child
et
al.,
2003).
This
trial
deserves
special
consideration
in
that
it
is
the
most
recent
of
the
randomized
trials
and
was
carried
out
in
the
era
of
more
advanced
supportive
care
and
the
availability
of
newer
therapeutic
agents.
It
still
showed
a
statistically
significant
advantage
for
HDT
in
terms
of
CR,
EFS
and
OS.
In
addition,
it
did
not
show
any
increase
in
treatment-related
mortality
relative
to
conventional
therapy .
These
randomized
trials,
all
of
which
showed
a
trend
to,
or
significantly
improved
results
for
patients
treated
with
dose-intense
therapy ,
with
the
support
of
numerous
phase
II
trials,
clearly
indicate
that
dose–intense
therapy
with
autologous
HSCT
should
be
offered
to
appropriate
patients
as
part
of
their
initial
treatment.
The
median
EFS
is
remarkably
constant
(25-31
months).
It
is
more
difficult
to
analyze
OS
results
since
OS
partly
depends
on
subsequent
salvage
therapy .
However ,
median
OS
was
significantly
longer
in
the
three
studies
where
differences
in
EFS
were
more
marked.
In
all
studies,
procedure-related
death
rate
was
<5%
and
not
greater
than
that
observed
with
conventional
chemotherapy .

About
10
years
ago,
the
Arkansas
transplant
program
showed
the
feasibility
of
2
consecutive
autologous
transplants
(Vesole
et
al.,
1994).
They
described
42
patients
who
received
two
consecutive
autologous
PBSC
transplants
using
melphalan
200mg/m
2
.
In
patients
that
were
capable
of
receiving
2
transplants,
the
CR
rate
increased
from
24%
after
the
first
transplant
to
43%
after
2
transplants.
This
experience
has
now
been
extended
in
over
1000
patients
with
overall
complete
remission
rates
of
40%
and
projected
5
year
event-free
and
overall
survivals
of
25%
and
40%
respectively
(Desikan
et
al.,
2002).
The
French
Intergroup
randomized
399
newly
diagnosed
myeloma
patients
under
age
60
to
single
versus
tandem
transplants
(Attal
et
al,
2003).
They
found
similar
CR
rates
between
the
two
groups
(42%
single
transplant
vs.
50%
tandem
transplant),
but
superior
seven
year
event-free
(10%
vs.
20%,
P=0.03)
and
overall
survivals
(21%
vs.
42%,
P=0.01)
for
the
tandem
transplant
group.
For
patients
who
did
not
achieve
a
very
good
partial
response
(less
than
90%
reduction
in
serum
or
urine
paraprotein)
after
one
transplant,
the
improvement
in
seven
year
overall
survival
was
more
dramatic
(11%
vs.
43%,
P<0.01).
These
results
support
tandem
autologous
transplants
for
patients
with
a
diagnosis
of
multiple
myeloma
who
do
not
show
disease
progression
after
the
first
transplant.
1.1.4
Impact
of
Impaired
Renal
Function
on
Dose-Intense
Therapies
Many
patients
with
plasma
cell
dyscrasias
have
renal
impairment
as
a
result
of
their
disease;
early
studies
of
dose-intense
therapy
tended
to
exclude
these
patients.
However ,
the
favorable
characteristics
of
melphalan
permits
transplant
therapy
to
be
extended
to
patients
with
renal
impairment
including
patients
with
end-stage
renal
failure
(ESFR).
Pharmacokinetic
studies
of
melphalan
show
comparable
clearance
rates
regardless
of
renal
function
(Tricot
et
al.,
1996).
The
Arkansas
group
compared
42
patients
with
renal
failure
(including
19
requiring
dialysis)
with
84
patients
matched
for
other
prognostic
features.
Regimen-related
mortality
was
7%
for
the
group
with
renal
impairment
compared
to
6%
for
those
with
normal
renal
function.
Engraftment
kinetics
and
probabilities
of
event-free
and
overall
survivals
were
also
similar .
This
group
reported
a
subsequent
series
involving
81
patients
with
renal
insuf ficiency
that
showed
no
difference
in
quality
of
stem
cell
collection
and
engraftment,
even
for
patients
on
dialysis
(Badros
et
al.,
2001).
1.1.5
Age
as
a
Limiting
Factor
The
plasma
cell
disorders
strike
older
populations

1.2
Melphalan
1.2.1
Melphalan
Non-clinical
Pharmacology
Melphalan
is
a
bifunctional
alkylating
agent
that
acts
principally
through
covalent
reactions
with
DNA,
resulting
in
the
formation
of
drug-DNA
adducts
with
cross-linking
of
DNA
strands
(Samuels
and
Bitran,
1995).
Melphalan’ s
cytotoxic
effects
are
related
to
its
concentration
and
the
duration
of
exposure
to
melphalan
of
the
cell
(Hall
and
Tilby,
1992).
Enhanced
repair
of
DNA
interstrand
crosslinks
may
be
a
mechanism
of
resistance
that
develops
after
prior
exposure
to
this
drug
(Spanswick
et
al.,
2002).
Melphalan
is
actively
transported
into
cells
by
the
high-af finity
L-amino
acid
transport
system;
glutamine
and
leucine
compete
for
carrier
uptake
and
high
levels
of
these
amino
acids
can
reduce
drug
uptake.
Other
drugs
such
as
tamoxifen,
chlorpromazine,
and
indomethacin
can
also
impair
melphalan
uptake
and
accumulation.
1.2.2
Clinical
Pharmacokinetics
and
Pharmacodynamics
Studies
of
the
pharmacokinetics
of
oral
melphalan
were
complicated
by
the
highly
variable
absorption
of
the
drug.
Moreover ,
studies
of
intravenous
melphalan
have
also
showed
considerable
inter-patient
variability
in
plasma
clearance.
Pinguet
et
al
studied
the
pharmacokinetics
of
melphalan
administered
at
a
dose
of
140
mg/m
2
in
combination
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
to
20
patients
under going
autologous
PBSC
transplantation
(Pinguet
et
al.,
1997).
The
medians
time
to
neutrophil
and
platelet
recoveries
were
16
and
14.6
days,
and
the
majority
of
patients
(80%)
developed
WHO
grade
3/4
stomatitis.
Plasma
concentration
profiles
were
biphasic
and
fitted
with
a
two-compartment
model.
The
maximal
concentration
at
the
end
of
infusion
averaged
7.94±3.73
mg/l
(range,
1.65-14.5).
The
mean
elimination
half-life
and
the
mean
residence
time
were
83.1±27.1
minutes
(range,
51.6-16681)
and
98.7±26.9
minutes
(range
59.5-166.9),
respectively .
The
volume
of
distribution
averaged
1.00±0.62
l/kg
(range
0.46-3.12)
and
total
plasma
clearance
548.3±300.0
ml/min/m
2
(range,
218.6-1378.8).
Plasma
levels
were
below
the
limits
of
detection
for
all
patients
by
24
hours
after
melphalan
administration.
These
authors
noted
large
inter-individual
variability
of
these
pharmacokinetic
parameters.
Total
clearance
of
melphalan
was
significantly
correlated
with
creatinine
clearance
(r=0.49,
p<0.05).

relationship
between
melphalan
clearance
and
renal
function
was
also
described
by
Kergueris
et
al.,
but
this
relationship
did
not
explain
the
large
variation
in
inter-individual
overall
clearance
of
the
drug
(Kergueris
et
al.,
1994).
Similar
pharmacokinetic
results
were
reported
for
20
pediatric
and
10
adult
patients
treated
with
melphalan
140
mg/m
2
as
a
single
agent
(infused
rapidly
over
5
minutes;
Gouyette
et
al.,
1986).
For
the
adult
patients,
the
elimination
half-life
(t½
β)
was
50±7
minutes
for
patients
treated
with
140
mg/m
2
dose
and
41±12
minutes
for
the
higher
dose
of
180
mg/m
2
.
Plasma
clearance
averaged
525
ml/min/m
2
at
140
mg/m
2
and
532
ml/min/m
2
at
180
mg/m
2
.
Melphalan
under goes
hydrolysis
in
the
circulation
and
the
amount
cleared
by
the
kidneys
is
not
well
defined.
However ,
the
toxicity
of
melphalan
(hematological
or
gastrointestinal)
is
reported
higher
for
patients
with
diminished
renal
function.
A
study
of
nine
patients
given
a
melphalan
dose
of
5
mg/m
2
(four
of
whom
subsequently
treated
with
220
mg/m
2
)
showed
highly
variable
renal
clearance
of
melphalan
with
the
percentage
of
dose
excreted
unchanged
in
the
urine
ranging
from
2.5%
to
92.8%
(Reece
et
al.,
1988).
These
authors
speculated
that
the
variation
in
renal
clearance
observed
for
these
patients
could
account
for
the
large
variation
in
plasma
clearance
observed
in
all
studies
of
melphalan
pharmacokinetics.
1.2.3
Clinical
Toxicities
of
Melphalan
Dose-related
leukopenia,
thrombocytopenia,
anemia,
usually
with
nadir
2-3
weeks
and
with
recovery
4-5
weeks
after
dosing
(without
HSC
support)
will
occur
with
moderate
melphalan
dose
schedules.
Hematological
toxicity
is
the
most
prominent
serious
toxicity
associated
with
the
use
of
high-dose
melphalan
regimens,
with
neutrophil
counts
falling
to
<100/uL
about
7
days
after
administration.
However ,
initial
hematological
recovery
occurs
about
3
to
5
days
later
for
patients
given
hematopoietic
stem
cell
and
cytokine
support.
About
50%
of
patients
will
require
blood
component
(red
blood
cells
and/or
platelet)
support
or
will
develop
neutropenic
fevers
during
the
period
of
marrow
hypoplasia.
Dose-related
nausea
and
vomiting
beginning
2-4
hrs
after
dosing,
peaking
at
12
hrs,
and
persisting
for
several
days,
and
delayed
nausea
and
vomiting
starting
24-48
hrs
after
administration
and
persist
for
multiple
days
to
3
or
4
weeks
occurs
with
high
doses
of
melphalan.
Stomatitis
will
occur
in
most
patients
can
be
almost
completely
prevented
by
prophylactic
cooling
of
the
mouth
with
ice
during
the
infusion
of
melphalan.
A
small
proportion
of
patients
will
develop
diarrhea.

1.3
VELCADE
(bortezomib)
for
Injection
1.3.1
Scientific
Background
VELCADE™
(bortezomib)
for
Injection
is
a
small
molecule
proteasome
inhibitor
developed
by
Millennium
Pharmaceuticals,
Inc.,
(Millennium)
as
a
novel
agent
to
treat
human
malignancies.
Bortezomib
is
currently
approved
by
the
United
States
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(US
FDA)
and
it
is
registered
in
Europe
for
the
treatment
of
multiple
myeloma
patients
who
have
received
at
least
one
prior
therapy .
By
inhibiting
a
single
molecular
target,
the
proteasome,
bortezomib
affects
multiple
signaling
pathways.
The
anti-neoplastic
effect
of
bortezomib
likely
involves
several
distinct
mechanisms,
including
inhibition
of
cell
growth
and
survival
pathways,
induction
of
apoptosis,
and
inhibition
of
expression
of
genes
that
control
cellular
adhesion,
migration
and
angiogenesis.
Thus,
the
mechanisms
by
which
bortezomib
elicits
its
antitumor
activity
may
vary
among
tumor
types,
and
the
extent
to
which
each
affected
pathway
is
critical
to
the
inhibition
of
tumor
growth
could
also
differ.
Bortezomib
has
a
novel
pattern
of
cytotoxicity
in
National
Cancer
Institute
(NCI)
in vitro
and
in
vivo
assays
(Adams
et
al.,
1999).
In
addition,
bortezomib
has
cytotoxic
activity
in
a
variety
of
xenograft
tumor
models,
both
as
a
single
agent
and
in
combination
with
chemotherapy
and
radiation
(Steiner
et
al.,
2001;
Teicher
et
al.,
1999;
Cusack
et
al.,
2001;
LeBlanc
et
al.,
2002;
Pink
et
al.,
2002).
Notably ,
bortezomib
induces
apoptosis
in
cells
that
over
express
bcl-2,
a
genetic
trait
that
confers
unregulated
growth
and
resistance
to
conventional
chemotherapeutics
(McConkey
et
al.,
1999).
Bortezomib
is
thought
to
be
efficacious
in
multiple
myeloma
via
its
inhibition
of
nuclear
factor
κ
B
(NF-
κ
B)
activation,
its
attenuation
of
interleukin-6
(IL-6)-mediated
cell
growth,
a
direct
apoptotic
effect,
and
possibly
anti-angiogenic
and
other
effects
(Hideshima
et
al.,
2001).
1.3.2
Non-clinical
Pharmacology
Pharmacokinetic
(PK)
and
pharmacodynamic
studies
were
conducted
in
the
rat
and
cynomolgus
monkey .
Upon
intravenous
(IV)
bolus
administration,
bortezomib
displays
a
rapid
distribution
phase
(t½
α
<10 minutes)
followed
by
a
longer
elimination
phase
(t½
β
5–15
hours).
Bortezomib
has
a
large
volume
of
distribution
(range
5–50
L/kg).
The
plasma
PK
profile
is
well
described
by
a
2-compartment
model.
Tandem

The
pharmacodynamic
action
of
bortezomib
is
well
established
and
can
be
measured
through
an
ex
vivo
assay
(20S
proteasome
activity)
(Lightcap
et
al.,
2000).
This
assay
was
used
to
determine
the
duration
of
drug
effect
in
lieu
of
the
PK
data
in
the
early
preclinical
toxicology
studies
as
well
as
to
set
a
guide
for
dose
escalation
in
humans.
Following
dosing
with
bortezomib
in
the
rat
and
cynomolgus
monkey ,
proteasome
inhibition
in
peripheral
blood
had
a
half-life
less
than
24
hours,
with
proteasome
activity
returning
to
pretreatment
baseline
within
24
hours
in
monkey
and
within
48
to
72
hours
in
rat
after
a
single
dose
of
bortezomib.
Further ,
intermittent
but
high
inhibition
(>70%)
of
proteasome
activity
was
better
tolerated
than
sustained
inhibition.
Thus,
a
twice-weekly
clinical
dosing
regimen
was
chosen
in
order
to
allow
return
of
proteasome
activity
towards
baseline
between
dose
administrations.
1.3.3
Non-clinical
Toxicity
Single-dose
IV
toxicity
studies
were
conducted
with
bortezomib
in
the
mouse,
rat,
dog,
and
monkey
to
establish
the
single-dose
maximum
tolerated
dose
(MTD).
The
MTDs
were
0.25
mg/kg
(1.5
mg/m
2
)
and
0.067
mg/kg
(0.8
mg/m
2
)
in
the
2
most
sensitive
species,
rat
and
monkey ,
respectively .
Repeat-dose
multi-cycle
toxicity
studies
of
3
and
6
months
in
the
rat
and
9
months
in
the
monkey ,
each
with
8-week
recovery
periods,
were
conducted
to
characterize
the
chronic
toxicity
of
bortezomib
when
administered
by
the
clinical
route
and
regimen
of
administration.
The
MTD
in
the
6-month
rat
study
was
0.10
mg/kg
(0.6
mg/m
2
)
and
the
key
target
organs
were
the
gastrointestinal
(GI)
tract,
hematopoietic
and
lymphoid
systems.
The
MTD
in
the
9-month
monkey
study
was
0.05
mg/kg
(0.6
mg/m
2
)
and
the
key
target
organs
were
the
GI
tract,
hematopoietic
and
lymphoid
systems,
peripheral
nervous
system,
and
kidney .
Full
or
partial
reversibility
was
observed
for
each
of
the
toxicities
described
to
date.
In
general,
the
nature
of
the
toxicity
of
bortezomib
is
similar
across
species,
and
target
organs
of
toxicity
in
animals
have
been
largely
predictive
of
human
toxicity .
The
toxicity
of
bortezomib
in
animals
is
characterized
by
a
steep
dose-response
with
mortality
seen
at
dosages
above
the
MTD.
The
cause
of
death
at
acutely
lethal
dosages
is
considered
to
be
related
to
indirect
cardiovascular
(CV)
effects
of
hypotension
and
vascular
changes
with
secondary
bradycardia
and
the
cause
of
death
in
long-term
studies
has
been
attributed
to
GI
or
hematologic
toxicity .
The
pharmacologic
effects
of
bortezomib
on
the
CV
system
have
been
extensively
characterized
and
have
demonstrated
that
indirect
effects
on
CV
function
occur
only
at
acutely
lethal
dosages
and
are
abrogated
by
routine
supportive
care.

detailed
information
regarding
the
nonclinical
pharmacology
and
toxicology
of
bortezomib
may

1.3.4
Clinical
Pharmacokinetics
and
Pharmacodynamics
The
clinical
pharmacology
characterization
of
bortezomib
has
been
determined
from
phase 1
studies
in
subjects
with
solid
tumors
and
hematological
malignancies,
and
confirmed
in
phase 2
studies
in
subjects
with
multiple
myeloma.
Bortezomib
demonstrates
multi-compartmental
pharmacokinetics.
Following
intravenous
administration
of
1.0
mg/m
2
and
1.3
mg/m
2
dose,
the
mean
first-dose
maximum
observed
plasma
concentrations
of
bortezomib
were
57
and
112 ng/mL,
respectively
in
11
patients
with
multiple
myeloma
and
creatinine
clearance
values
>50
mL/min
participating
in
a
pharmacokinetics
study .
In
subsequent
doses,
mean
maximum
observed
plasma
concentrations
ranged
from
67
to
106
ng/mL
for
the
1.0
mg/m
2
dose
and
89
to
120
ng/mL
for
the
1.3
mg/m
2
dose.
The
mean
elimination
half-life
of
bortezomib
upon
multiple
dosing
ranged
from
40
to
193 hours.
Bortezomib
is
eliminated
more
rapidly
following
the
first
dose.
Mean
Total
Body
Clearances
were
102
and
112
L/h
following
the
first
dose
for
doses
of
1.0
mg/m
2
and
1.3
mg/m
2
,
respectively ,
and
ranged
from
15
to
32
L/h
following
subsequent
doses
for
doses
of
1.0
and
1.3 mg/m
2
,
respectively .
Clinical
experience
has
shown
that
the
change
in
clearance
does
not
result
in
overt
toxicity
from
accumulation
in
this
multidose
regimen
in
humans.
In
subjects
with
advanced
malignancies,
the
maximum
pharmacodynamic
effect
(inhibition
of
20S
activity)
occurred
within
1-hour
post
dose.
At
the
therapeutic
dose
of
1.3
mg/m
2
in
subjects
with
multiple
myeloma,
the
mean
proteasome
inhibition
at
1-hour
post
dose
was
approximately
61%.
The
time
course
of
proteasome
inhibition
in
subjects
is
characterized
by
maximum
inhibition
observed
within
the
first
hour
after
administration,
followed
by
partial
recovery
of
proteasome
activity
over
the
next
6
to
24
hours
to
within
50%
of
the
pretreatment
activity .
On
the
Day
1,
4,
8,
and
11
schedule,
variable
(10%–30%)
levels
of
proteasome
inhibition
have
been
observed
at
next
scheduled
dosing.
In
theory ,
this
advantage
allows
cells
to
recover
proteasome
activity
for
normal
cellular
housekeeping
functions
between
doses.
The
relationship
between
bortezomib
plasma
concentrations
and
proteasome
inhibition
can
be
described
by
a
maximum
effect
(E
max
)
model.
The
E
max
curve
is
initially
very
steep,
with
small
changes
in
plasma
bortezomib
concentration
over
the
range
of
0.5
to
2.0
ng/mL
relating
to
large
increases
in
the
percent
inhibition
(0–60%).
After
that,
a
plateau
occurs
where
marginal
increases
of
proteasome
inhibition
are
observed
in
spite
of
large
changes
in
plasma
bortezomib
concentrations.

malignancies,
the
MTD
for
a
twice
weekly
for
4
weeks
of

/dose,
with
DLTs
of
thrombocytopenia,
hyponatremia,
hypokalemia,
fatigue,
and
malaise
(Orlowski
et

2002).
The
toxicity
was
greatest
during
the
third
and
fourth
weeks
of
therapy .
In
the
3-week
schedule
of
bortezomib
monotherapy
(4
doses,
given
on
Days
1,
4,
8,
and
11
of

occurred
at
1.56
mg/m
2
/dose
(3
subjects
with
Grade
3
diarrhea
and
1
with
peripheral
sensory

Therefore,
the
MTD
at
this
schedule
was
1.3
mg/m

In
a
35-day
treatment
cycle
with
4
weekly
doses
of
bortezomib
monotherapy ,
the
MTD
was
1.6
mg/m

and
DLT
included
hypotension,

Combination
of
Bortezomib
and
Other
Agents
A
pre-clinical
study
reported
by
the
Dana
Farber
Jerome
Lipper
Multiple
Myeloma
Center
demonstrated
syner gy
in
cell
line
kill
between
bortezomib
and
other
agents
such
as
doxorubicin
and
melphalan
(Mitsiades
et
al.,
2003).
Syner gy
was
found
with
co-incubation
of
bortezomib
with
doxorubicin,
or
with
pre-exposure
to
either
of
the
drugs.
Bortezomib
exposure
after
prior
doxorubicin
exposure
achieved
the
greatest
cell
kill.
Myeloma
cell
lines
known
to
be
resistant
to
doxorubicin
or
melphalan
confirmed
sensitization
by
bortezomib,
as
did
studies
involving
freshly
isolated
myeloma
cells
from
patients
known
to
be
resistant
to
bortezomib
or
doxorubicin.
A
proposed
mechanism
for
this
enhancement
of
chemosensitivity
is
the
down-regulation
of
several
effectors
involved
in
the
cellular
response
to
genotoxic
stress,
restoring
sensitivity
to
DNA-damaging
chemotherapeutic
agents.
Berenson
et
al
recently
published
a
phase
I/II
trial
of
bortezomib
and
low-dose
melphalan
combination
therapy
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
relapsed
or
refractory
multiple
myeloma
(Berenson
et
al.,
2006).
Bortezomib
was
administered
from
0.7
to
1.0
mg/m
2
on
days
1,
4,
8,
and
11
of
a
28-day
cycle
for
up
to
eight
cycles,
and
oral
melphalan
was
administered
in
escalating
doses
form
0.025
to
0.25
mg/kg
on
days
1
to
4.
Thirty-five
patients
were
enrolled
and
dose-limiting
grade
4
neutropenia
in
two
of
six
patients
in
the
highest
dose
cohort
led
to
the
assignment
of
bortezomib
1.0
mg/m2
and
melphalan
0.10
mg/kg
as
the
maximum-tolerated
dose.
Responses
were
observed
in
23
of
34
evaluable
patients.
Myelosuppression
was
the
most
prominent
toxicity;
Grade
1/2
neurotoxicity
developed
in
8
patients
and
worsened
in
4
of
15
patients
with
pre-existing
neurotoxicity .
Diarrhea
and
nausea/vomiting
were
observed
at
all
dose
levels
and
no
relationship
to
drug
dosage
was
evident.
Hollmig
et
al
described
treatment
of
37
patients
with
bortezomib
and
high-dose
melphalan 
(Hollmig
et
al.,
2004).
Bortezomib
was
dosed
at
1.0
mg/m
2
or
1.3
mg/m
2
on
days
-4
and
-1 
before
autologous
HSC
transplantation,
with
melphalan
(50-200
mg/m
2
)
given
on
the
same 
days
for
26
patients
and
on
day
-1
only
for
11
patients.
All
patients
achieved
granulocyte 
(median,
13
days)
and
platelet
(median,
17
days)
recoveries.
Serious
(grade
3/4)
mucositis 
and/or
diarrhea
occurred
in
14%
and
29%
of
patients,
respectively .
No
transplant-related 
deaths
were
reported.
A
partial
or
better
response
was
observed
in
73%
of
evaluable 
patients.
This
same
group
also
reported
the
use
of
3
or
4
fractions
of
high-dose
melphalan 
given
along
with
bortezomib
(1.0
or
1.3
mg/m
2
)
in
a
standard
day
1,
4,
7,
±10
fashion 
(Pineda-Roman
et
al.,
2006).
Maximum
doses
of
melphalan
reached
240-250
mg/m
2
.
Only 
1
of
22
patients
treated
experienced
significant
(grade
2)
mucositis
with
grade
3/4
diarrhea 
(primarily
infectious)
in
8
patients.
These
reports
suggest
a
safe
starting
dose
of
bortezomib 
in
combination
with
high-dose
melphalan
of
1.0
mg/m
2
.

(PegLD)
enrolled
42
patients
(24
with
multiple

with
advanced
hematological
malignancies
(Orlowski

,
and
was

PegLD,
30

,
was
given
on
day
4
of
each
cycle.
A
bortezomib
dose
of
1.3
mg/m
2
was
recommended
for
further
study
because
of
frequent
dose
reductions
and
delays
at
the
MTD
of
1.5

2
.
Hematological
toxicities
were
the
most
common,
with
fatigue
being
the
most-common
non-hematological
toxicity .
Again,
diarrhea
was
observed
at
all
dose
levels.
Of
the
22
evaluable
patients
treated
for

8
achieved
a

and
bortezomib
on

were
observed;
dose-limiting
non-hematological

were
diarrhea,
skin

and
the
highest

and
the
MTD
was
determined
to

Melphalan
for
Injection
is
a
sterile
lyophilized
powder
for
reconstitution
and
will
be
obtained
from
the
manufacturer
in
accordance
with
standard
pharmacy
purchasing
criteria.
Melphalan
will
be
reconstituted
by
pharmacy
staff,
in
accordance
with
usual
pharmacy
practices,
immediately
before
patient
infusion.
Melphalan
is
a
bifunctional
alkylating
agent
that
acts
principally
through
covalent
reactions
with
DNA,
resulting
in
the
formation
of
drug-DNA
adducts
with
cross-linking
of
DNA
strands.
Melphalan’ s
cytotoxic
effects
are
related
to
its
concentration
and
the
duration
of
exposure
to
melphalan
of
the
cell.
Enhanced
repair
of
DNA
interstrand
crosslinks
may
be
a
mechanism
of
resistance
that
develops
after
prior
exposure
to
this
drug.
Melphalan
is
actively
transported
into
cells
by
the
high-af finity
L-amino
acid
transport
system;
glutamine
and
leucine
compete
for
carrier
uptake
and
high
levels
of
these
amino
acids
can
reduce
drug
uptake.
Other
drugs
such
as
tamoxifen,
chlorpromazine,
and
indomethacin
can
also
impair
melphalan
uptake
and
accumulation.
Studies
of
the
pharmacokinetics
of
oral
melphalan
were
complicated
by
the
highly
variable
absorption
of
the
drug.
Moreover ,
studies
of
intravenous
melphalan
have
also
showed
considerable
inter-patient
variability
in
plasma
clearance.

140
mg/m
2
in
combination
with
other
chemotherapeutic
agents
to
20
patients
under going
autologous
PBSC
transplantation.
The
medians
time
to
neutrophil
and
platelet
recoveries
were
16
and
14.6
days,
and
the
majority
of
patients
(80%)
developed
WHO
grade
3/4
stomatitis.
Plasma
concentration
profiles
were
biphasic
and
fitted
with
a
two-compartment
model.
The
maximal
concentration
at
the
end
of
infusion
averaged
7.94±3.73
mg/l
(range,
1.65-14.5).
The
mean
elimination
half-life
and
the
mean
residence
time
were
83.1±27.1
minutes
(range,
51.6-166.81)
and
98.7±26.9
minutes
(range
59.5-166.9),
respectively .
The
volume
of
distribution
averaged
1.00±0.62

(range
0.46-3.12)
and
total
plasma
clearance
548.3±300.0
ml/min/m
2
(range,
218.6-1378.8).
Plasma
levels
were
below
the
limits
of
detection
for
all
patients
by
24
hours
after
melphalan
administration.
These
authors
noted
large
inter-individual
variability
of
these
pharmacokinetic
parameters.
Total
clearance
of
melphalan
was
significantly
correlated
with
creatinine
clearance
(r=0.49,
p<0.05).
A
relationship
between
melphalan
clearance
and
renal
function
was
also
described
by
Kergueris
et
al.,
but
this
relationship
did
not
explain
the
large
variation
in
inter-individual
overall
clearance
of
the
drug
(Kergueris
et
al.,
1994).
Similar
pharmacokinetic
results
were
reported
for
20
pediatric
and
10
adult
patients
treated
with
melphalan
140
mg/m
2
as
a

For
the
adult
patients,
the
elimination
half-life
(t½

was
50±7
minutes
for
patients

Adverse
Events
4.1
Definitions
4.1.1
Adverse
Event
Definition
An
adverse
event
(AE)
is
any
untoward
medical
occurrence
in
a
patient
administered
a
pharmaceutical
product,
which
does
not
necessarily
have
a
causal
relationship
with
the
treatment.
An
adverse
event
can
be
any
unfavorable
and
unintended
sign
(eg,
including
an
abnormal
laboratory
finding),
symptom,
or
disease
temporally
associated
with
the
use
of
the
drug,
whether
or
not
it
is
considered
to
be
drug
related.
This
includes
any
newly
occurring
event
or
previous
condition
that
has
increased
in
severity
or
frequency
since
the
administration
of
drug.
4.1.2
Serious
Adverse
Event
Definition
A
serious
adverse
event
(SAE)
is
any
adverse
event,
occurring
at
any
dose
and
regardless
of
causality
that:
●
Results
in
death.
●
Is
life-threatening.
Life-threatening
means
that
the
patient
was
at
immediate
risk
of
death
from
the
reaction
as
it
occurred,
i.e.,
it
does
not
include
a
reaction
which
hypothetically
might
have
caused
death
had
it
occurred
in
a
more
severe
form.
●
Requires
inpatient
hospitalization
or
prolongation
of
existing
hospitalization.
Hospitalization
admissions
and/or
surgical
operations
scheduled
to
occur
during
the
study
period,
but
planned
prior
to
study
entry
are
not
considered
AEs
if
the
illness
or
disease
existed
before
the
patient
was
enrolled
in
the
trial,
provided
that
it
did
not
deteriorate
in
an
unexpected
manner
during
the
trial
(eg,
surgery
performed
earlier
than
planned).
●
Results
in
persistent
or
significant
disability/incapacity .
Disability
is
defined
as
a
substantial
disruption
of
a
persons’
ability
to
conduct
normal
life
functions.
●
Is
a
congenital
anomaly/birth
defect.
●
Is
an
important
medical
event.
An
important
medical
event
is
an
event
that
may
not
result
in
death,
be
life-threatening,
or
require
hospitalization
but
may
be
considered
an
SAE
when,
based
upon
appropriate
medical
judgment,
it
may
jeopardize
the
patient
or
subject
and
may
require
medical
or
surgical
intervention
to
prevent
one
of
the
outcomes
listed
in
the
definitions
for
SAEs.
Examples
of
such
medical
events
include
allergic
bronchospasm
requiring
intensive
treatment
in
an
emer gency
room
or
at
home,
blood
dyscrasias
or
convulsions
that
do
not
result
in
inpatient
hospitalization,
or
the
development
of
drug
dependency
or
drug
abuse.

Clarification
should
be
made
between
the
terms
“serious”
and
“severe”
since
they
ARE
NOT
synonymous.
The
term
“severe”
is
often
used
to
describe
the
intensity
(severity)
of
a
specific
event
(as
in
mild,
moderate,
or
severe
myocardial
infarction);
the
event
itself,
however ,
may
be
of
relatively
minor
medical
significance
(such
as
a
severe
headache).
This
is
NOT
the
same
as
“serious,”
which
is
based
on
patient/event
outcome
or
action
criteria
described
above
and
are
usually
associated
with
events
that
pose
a
threat
to
a
patient’ s
life
or
functioning.
A
severe
adverse
event
does
not
necessarily
need
to
be
considered
serious.
For
example,
persistent
nausea
of
several
hours
duration
may
be
considered
severe
nausea
but
not
an
SAE.
On
the
other
hand,
a
stroke
resulting
in
only
a
minor
degree
of
disability
may
be
considered
mild,
but
would
be
defined
as
an
SAE
based
on
the
above
noted
criteria.
Seriousness
(not
severity)
serves
as
a
guide
for
defining
regulatory
reporting
obligations.
4.2
Procedur es
for
AE
and
SAE
Reporting
Investigator -sponsor
must
report
all
serious
adverse
event
(SAE)
regardless
of
relationship
with
any 
study
drug
or
expectedness
to
the
IRB
as
required
by
the
institution.
Intensity
for
each
adverse
event,
including
any
lab
abnormality ,
will
be
determined
by
using
the 
NCI
CTCAE,
version
3.0,
as

Every
effort
should
be
made
by
the
investigator
to
explain
each
adverse
experience
and
assess
its
relationship,
if
any,
to
study
drug
treatment.
Causality
should
be
assessed
using
the
following
categories:
Not
Related,
Unlikely ,
Suspected
(Reasonable
Possibility),
Probable.
Not
related:
The
adverse
experience
is
definitely
not
related
to
the
test
drug.
Unlikely:
There
are
other ,
more
likely
causes
and
the
drug
is
not
suspected
as
a
cause.
Suspected
(reasonable
possibility):
A
direct
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
the
drug
and
the
adverse
experience
has
not
been
demonstrated
but
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
the
experience
was
caused
by
the
drug.
Probable:
There
probably
is
a
direct
cause
and
effect
relationship
between
the
adverse
experience
and
the
study
drug.

The
degree
of
certainty
with
which

is
attributed
to
drug
treatment
(or
alternative
causes,
e.g.:
natural

of
the
underlying
diseases,
concomitant
therapy ,
etc.)
will
be
determined
by
how
well
the
experience
can
be
understood
in
terms
of
one
or
more
of
the
following.
Known
pharmacology
of
the

Accrual,
Registration
and
Follow-up
The
targeted
sample
size
for
the
single
arm
is
97
subjects
that
successfully
under go
the
2
nd
transplant. 
It
is
estimated
that
eight
years
1
month
(97
months)
of
accrual
will
be
necessary
to 
enroll
this
number
of
subjects.  
The
Blood
and
Marrow
Transplantation
Program
at
HUMC 
treats
over
120
patients
with
this
diagnosis
every
year.
In
the
last
two
years,
an
estimated
50 
multiple
myeloma
patients
each
year
underwent
tandem
autologous
hematopoietic
stem
cell 
transplantation
using
the
high-dose
melphalan
conditioning
regimen.
It
is
assumed
that
patients 
will
enroll
into
the
study
uniformly
over
the
accrual
period
at
the
rate
1
patient
per
month. 
After
eligibility
is
established,
subjects
will
be
enrolled
into
the
single
arm
using
high-dose 
melphalan
and
high-dose
melphalan-bortezomib
as
a
conditioning
regimen.
All
subjects
will
be
“on-study”
for
three
years
post-transplant,
during
which
they
will
be 
monitored
for
the
effects
of
treatment
through
regular
clinic.
With
four
years
of
planned 
accrual,
and
a
minimum
of
three
years
of
additional
follow-up
post-transplant,
subjects
will
be 
followed
for
progression-free
survival
for
at
least
36
months.
5.4   
Sample
Size
and
Power
Calculations
In
this
section,
the
power
of
the
analysis
of
time
to
progression
or
death
is
considered
and 
performed
based
on
the
proportion
surviving
without
progression
at
three
years. 
The
standard 
tandem
autologous
HSCT
with
high-dose
melphalan
conditioning
regimen
is
assumed
to
have 
PFS
of
56%.
It
is
posited
that
the
high-dose
melphalan
and
melphalan-bortezomib
conditioning 
regimen
will
increase
the
three-year
PFS
to
76%.
To
estimate
the
3-year
PFS
in
tandem 
autologous
HSCT
followed
by
high
dose
Mel-V el
based
on
an
anticipated
advantage
over
3-PFS 
observed
in
historical
controls,
the
method
of
Simon
and
Dixon
(9)
was
used
to
derive
the 
sample
size.
At
the
design
stage,
it
was
stated
that
there
were
150
patients
in
the
historical 
control
cohort
who
had
received
tandem
auto
HSCT
with
HD
melphalan.
Median
event-free 
survival
in
the
150
was
3.58
years
(42.96
months)
and
44%(66
of
150)
had
had
progression
of 
disease.
Hazard
rate
in
the
HC
is
0.44
and
hazard
rate
in
the
experimental
arm
(with 
melphalan-bortezomib)
is
0.24
thus
the
ratio
of
the
hazard
rates
is
1.8333.
However ,
to
adjust 
for
the
dropout
due
to
MD
decision,
Patient
decision,
PD
before
2
nd
transplant,
or
loss
of 
insurance
averaging
to
a
rate
0.3,
the
hazard
rate
is
(.44+.3)/(.24+.3)=1.37.
If
we
assume 
accrual
rate
of
1
patient
per
month,
5%
level
of
significance
and
80%,
a
sample
of
97
patients 
that
successfully
under go
the
2
nd
transplant
will
be
required
and
this
calculation
will
achieve 
80.17%
power
to
show
that
PFS
is
at
least
76%
in
the
single
arm. 
Adjusted
Sample
Size
This
is
adjustment
was
not
preplanned,
however ,
after
observing
the
slower
accrual
of
1
patient 
per
month
and
the
larger
than
anticipated
dropouts
post-first
transplant,
it
was
deemed
necessary 
to
employ
an
adjustment
with
respect
to
dropout,
for
the
single
arm
versus
historical
control
if 
the
power
to
detect
the
efficacy
of
high-dose
melphalan
and
high-dose
melphalan-bortezomib 
were
to
be
preserved.

This
is
a

II
study
comparing
the
progression-free
survival
after
tandem
autologous
HSCT 
with
high-dose
melphalan
to
high-dose
melphalan
and
bortezomib
in
patients
with
a
diagnosis 
of
multiple
myeloma. 
5.6  
Statistical
Hypothesis
The
null
hypothesis
is
that
the
three-year
progression
free
survival
rate
in
multiple 
myeloma
patients
receiving
tandem
autologous
HSCT
with
high-dose
melphalan 
(control
arm)
is
56%.
The
alternative
hypothesis
for
this
study
posits
that
the
treatment 
plan
consisting
of
tandem
autologous
HSCT
with
high-dose
melphalan
followed
by 
high-dose
melphalan-bortezomib
(experimental
arm)
will
increase
the
3
year
progression 
free
survival
to
76%,
which
is
20
%
more
than
PFS
in
the
historical
arm.
Note
that
the 
hazard
rate
for
progression
in
historical
tandem
cohort,
λ
c
,
is
0.44
(1-0.56)
and
the 
experimental
arm
with
HD
Mel-V el
has
a
hazard
rate,
λ
E,
of
0.24
(1-0.76),
so
that
the 
minimum
hazard
ratio,
δ
=
λ
c/
λ
E
,
is
0.44/0.24=1.833.
Thus
this
single
arm
trial
of 
increased
PFS
at
3
years
post-HSCT
is
equivalent
to
evaluating
hypotheses:
H
O
:
δ
(3)≤1 
 H
A
:
δ
(3)
>
1
S
E
(3) 
where
δ
(3)
=
the
three-year
progression
of
disease
hazard
ratio
Thus,
a
one-sided
log-rank
test 
stratified
on
risk
status
will
be
conducted
to
determine
if
tandem
autologous
HSCT
with 
high-dose
melphalan
and
melphalan-bortezomib
improves
the
progression
free
survival
over 
that
in
historical
controls
using
high-dose
mephalan
alone
using
a
5%
level
of
significance. 
Equivalently ,
estimating
a
90%
confidence
interval
of
the
3
year
progression-free
survival 
would
achieve
the
desired
goal.
5.7
Primary
endpoint
The
primary
analysis
will
include
all
eligible
autologous
transplantation
subjects
that
receive
the 
high-dose
Mel-MelV el
conditioning
regimen
and
historical
control
of
standard
tandem
HSCT 
recipients
using
high-dose
melphalan
conditioning
regimen.
3
–year
PFS
and
corresponding 
90%
confidence
interval
will
be
estimated
using
Kaplan-Meier
method.
It
is
anticipated
that
the 
estimated
90%
confidence
interval
should
include
76%
and
exclude
56%
to
show
evidence
that 
tandem
autologous
HSCT
with
high-dose

and
melphalan-bortezomib
improves
the 
progression-free

in

INTRODUCTION
1.
The
World
Medical
Association
has
developed
the
Declaration
of
Helsinki
as
a
statement
of 
ethical
principles
to
provide
guidance
to
physicians
and
other
participants
in
medical 
research
involving
human
subjects.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
includes 
research
on
identifiable
human
material
or
identifiable
data.
2.
It
is
the
duty
of
the
physician
to
promote
and
safeguard
the
health
of
the
people.
The 
physician's
knowledge
and
conscience
are
dedicated
to
the
fulfillment
of
this
duty.
3.
The
Declaration
of
Geneva
of
the
World
Medical
Association
binds
the
physician
with
the 
words,
"The
health
of
my
patient
will
be
my
first
consideration,"
and
the
International
Code 
of
Medical
Ethics
declares
that,
"A
physician
shall
act
only
in
the
patient's
interest
when 
providing
medical
care
which
might
have
the
effect
of
weakening
the
physical
and
mental 
condition
of
the
patient."
4.
Medical
progress
is
based
on
research
which
ultimately
must
rest
in
part
on
experimentation 
involving
human
subjects.
5.
In
medical
research
on
human
subjects,
considerations
related
to
the
well-being
of
the 
human
subject
should
take
precedence
over
the
interests
of
science
and
society .
6.
The
primary
purpose
of
medical
research
involving
human
subjects
is
to
improve 
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
procedures
and
the
understanding
of
the
aetiology 
and
pathogenesis
of
disease.
Even
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
Tandem

methods
must
continuously
be
challenged
through
research
for
their
effectiveness, 
efficiency ,
accessibility
and
quality .
7.
In
current
medical
practice
and
in
medical
research,
most
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and 
therapeutic
procedures
involve
risks
and
burdens.
8.
Medical
research
is
subject
to
ethical
standards
that
promote
respect
for
all
human
beings 
and
protect
their
health
and
rights.
Some
research
populations
are
vulnerable
and
need 
special
protection.
The
particular
needs
of
the
economically
and
medically
disadvantaged 
must
be
recognized.
Special
attention
is
also
required
for
those
who
cannot
give
or
refuse 
consent
for
themselves,
for
those
who
may
be
subject
to
giving
consent
under
duress,
for 
those
who
will
not
benefit
personally
from
the
research
and
for
those
for
whom
the
research 
is
combined
with
care.
9.
Research
Investigators
should
be
aware
of
the
ethical,
legal
and
regulatory
requirements
for 
research
on
human
subjects
in
their
own
countries
as
well
as
applicable
international 
requirements.
No
national
ethical,
legal
or
regulatory
requirement
should
be
allowed
to 
reduce
or
eliminate
any
of
the
protections
for
human
subjects
set
forth
in
this
Declaration.
BASIC
PRINCIPLES
FOR
ALL
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
1.
It
is
the
duty
of
the
physician
in
medical
research
to
protect
the
life,
health,
privacy ,
and 
dignity
of
the
human
subject.
2.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
must
conform
to
generally
accepted
scientific 
principles,
be
based
on
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
scientific
literature,
other
relevant 
sources
of
information,
and
on
adequate
laboratory
and,
where
appropriate,
animal 
experimentation.
3.
Appropriate
caution
must
be
exercised
in
the
conduct
of
research
which
may
affect
the 
environment,
and
the
welfare
of
animals
used
for
research
must
be
respected.
4.
The
design
and
performance
of
each
experimental
procedure
involving
human
subjects 
should
be
clearly
formulated
in
an
experimental
protocol.
This
protocol
should
be
submitted 
for
consideration,
comment,
guidance,
and
where
appropriate,
approval
to
a
specially 
appointed
ethical
review
committee,
which
must
be
independent
of
the
investigator ,
the 
sponsor
or
any
other
kind
of
undue
influence.
This
independent
committee
should
be
in 
conformity
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
country
in
which
the
research
experiment
is 
performed.
The
committee
has
the
right
to
monitor
ongoing
trials.
The
researcher
has
the 
obligation
to
provide
monitoring
information
to
the
committee,
especially
any
serious 
adverse
events.
The
researcher
should
also
submit
to
the
committee,
for
review ,
information 
regarding
funding,
sponsors,
institutional
affiliations,
other
potential
conflicts
of
interest
and 
incentives
for
subjects.
5.
The
research
protocol
should
always
contain
a
statement
of
the
ethical
considerations 
involved
and
should
indicate
that
there
is
compliance
with
the
principles
enunciated
in
this 
Declaration.
6.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
should
be
conducted
only
by
scientifically 
qualified
persons
and
under
the
supervision
of
a
clinically
competent
medical
person.
The 
responsibility
for
the
human
subject
must
always
rest
with
a
medically
qualified
person
and 
never
rest
on
the
subject
of
the
research,
even
though
the
subject
has
given
consent.

7.
Every
medical
research
project
involving
human
subjects
should
be
preceded
by
careful 
assessment
of
predictable
risks
and
burdens
in
comparison
with
foreseeable
benefits
to
the 
subject
or
to
others.
This
does
not
preclude
the
participation
of
healthy
volunteers
in 
medical
research.
The
design
of
all
studies
should
be
publicly
available.
8.
Physicians
should
abstain
from
engaging
in
research
projects
involving
human
subjects 
unless
they
are
confident
that
the
risks
involved
have
been
adequately
assessed
and
can
be 
satisfactorily
managed.
Physicians
should
cease
any
investigation
if
the
risks
are
found
to 
outweigh
the
potential
benefits
or
if
there
is
conclusive
proof
of
positive
and
beneficial 
results.
9.
Medical
research
involving
human
subjects
should
only
be
conducted
if
the
importance
of 
the
objective
outweighs
the
inherent
risks
and
burdens
to
the
subject.
This
is
especially 
important
when
the
human
subjects
are
healthy
volunteers.
10.
Medical
research
is
only
justified
if
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
populations
in 
which
the
research
is
carried
out
stand
to
benefit
from
the
results
of
the
research.
11.
The
subjects
must
be
volunteers
and
informed
participants
in
the
research
project.
12.
The
right
of
research
subjects
to
safeguard
their
integrity
must
always
be
respected.
Every 
precaution
should
be
taken
to
respect
the
privacy
of
the
subject,
the
confidentiality
of
the 
patient's
information
and
to
minimize
the
impact
of
the
study
on
the
subject's
physical
and 
mental
integrity
and
on
the
personality
of
the
subject.
13.
In
any
research
on
human
beings,
each
potential
subject
must
be
adequately
informed
of
the 
aims,
methods,
sources
of
funding,
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest,
institutional
affiliations 
of
the
researcher ,
the
anticipated
benefits
and
potential
risks
of
the
study
and
the
discomfort 
it
may
entail.
The
subject
should
be
informed
of
the
right
to
abstain
from
participation
in 
the
study
or
to
withdraw
consent
to
participate
at
any
time
without
reprisal.
After
ensuring 
that
the
subject
has
understood
the
information,
the
physician
should
then
obtain
the 
subject's
freely-given
informed
consent,
preferably
in
writing.
If
the
consent
cannot
be 
obtained
in
writing,
the
non-written
consent
must
be
formally
documented
and
witnessed.
14.
When
obtaining
informed
consent
for
the
research
project
the
physician
should
be 
particularly
cautious
if
the
subject
is
in
a
dependent
relationship
with
the
physician
or
may 
consent
under
duress.
In
that
case
the
informed
consent
should
be
obtained
by
a 
well-informed
physician
who
is
not
engaged
in
the
investigation
and
who
is
completely 
independent
of
this
relationship.
15.
For
a
research
subject
who
is
legally
incompetent,
physically
or
mentally
incapable
of 
giving
consent
or
is
a
legally
incompetent
minor ,
the
investigator
must
obtain
informed 
consent
from
the
legally
authorized
representative
in
accordance
with
applicable
law.
These 
groups
should
not
be
included
in
research
unless
the
research
is
necessary
to
promote
the 
health
of
the
population
represented
and
this
research
cannot
instead
be
performed
on
legally 
competent
persons.
16.
When
a
subject
deemed
legally
incompetent,
such
as
a
minor
child,
is
able
to
give
assent
to 
decisions
about
participation
in
research,
the
investigator
must
obtain
that
assent
in
addition 
to
the
consent
of
the
legally
authorized
representative.
17.
Research
on
individuals
from
whom
it
is
not
possible
to
obtain
consent,
including
proxy
or
Tandem
MelMelVel,

CONFIDENTIAL
Page
50
advance
consent,
should
be
done
only
if
the
physical/mental
condition
that
prevents 
obtaining
informed
consent
is
a
necessary
characteristic
of
the
research
population.
The 
specific
reasons
for
involving
research
subjects
with
a
condition
that
renders
them
unable
to 
give
informed
consent
should
be
stated
in
the
experimental
protocol
for
consideration
and 
approval
of
the
review
committee.
The
protocol
should
state
that
consent
to
remain
in
the 
research
should
be
obtained
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
individual
or
a
legally
authorized 
surrogate.
18.
Both
authors
and
publishers
have
ethical
obligations.
In
publication
of
the
results
of 
research,
the
investigators
are
obliged
to
preserve
the
accuracy
of
the
results.
Negative
as 
well
as
positive
results
should
be
published
or
otherwise
publicly
available.
Sources
of 
funding,
institutional
affiliations
and
any
possible
conflicts
of
interest
should
be
declared
in 
the
publication.
Reports
of
experimentation
not
in
accordance
with
the
principles
laid
down 
in
this
Declaration
should
not
be
accepted
for
publication.
ADDITIONAL
PRINCIPLES
FOR
MEDICAL
RESEARCH
COMBINED
WITH
MEDICAL
CARE
1.
The
physician
may
combine
medical
research
with
medical
care,
only
to
the
extent
that
the 
research
is
justified
by
its
potential
prophylactic,
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
value.
When 
medical
research
is
combined
with
medical
care,
additional
standards
apply
to
protect
the 
patients
who
are
research
subjects.
2.
The
benefits,
risks,
burdens
and
effectiveness
of
a
new
method
should
be
tested
against 
those
of
the
best
current
prophylactic,
diagnostic,
and
therapeutic
methods.
This
does
not 
exclude
the
use
of
placebo,
or
no
treatment,
in
studies
where
no
proven
prophylactic, 
diagnostic
or
therapeutic
method
exists.
3.
At
the
conclusion
of
the
study ,
every
patient
entered
into
the
study
should
be
assured
of 
access
to
the
best
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods
identified
by
the 
study .
4.
The
physician
should
fully
inform
the
patient
which
aspects
of
the
care
are
related
to
the 
research.
The
refusal
of
a
patient
to
participate
in
a
study
must
never
interfere
with
the 
patient-physician
relationship.
5.
In
the
treatment
of
a
patient,
where
proven
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
methods 
do
not
exist
or
have
been
ineffective,
the
physician,
with
informed
consent
from
the
patient, 
must
be
free
to
use
unproven
or
new
prophylactic,
diagnostic
and
therapeutic
measures,
if
in 
the
physician's
judgment
it
offers
hope
of
saving
life,
re-establishing
health
or
alleviating 
suffering.
Where
possible,
these
measures
should
be
made
the
object
of
research,
designed 
to
evaluate
their
safety
and
efficacy .
In
all
cases,
new
information
should
be
recorded
and, 
where
appropriate,
published.
The
other
relevant
guidelines
of
this
Declaration
should
be 
followed.

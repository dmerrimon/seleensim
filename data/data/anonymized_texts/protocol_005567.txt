 1.0 Background  
 
Asthma is characterized by chronic airway inflammation, repea ted episodes  of reversible airway 
obstruction and airway hyper-reactivity. Airway inflammation and clinical symptoms of asthma are most 
often initiated by IgE-mediated responses  following exposu re to environmental allergens. Inflammatory 
cell recruitment into the lungs and airway hyper respon siveness  are key componen ts of the allergen-induced 
inflammatory respo nse, which results from the interaction of resident airway cells and inflammatory cells that 
release  local mediators. Patients with severe, recurrent asthma also have remodeling of the airway wall with 
increased  airway smooth muscle, increased  inflammatory cells and collagen  depos ition. 
For many decade s, corticosteroids have been used  to control airway inflammation, while β-adrenergic 
bronchod ilators have  been  the primary  treatment  for bronchoconstriction .  Although these  therapies  
are e ffective  for the vast majority of asthmatics, they are limited by high cost, poor adhe rence, and 
increasing conce rn about long-term adverse effects. The FDA has issued  a black-box warning linking long-
acting β- adrenergic bronchod ilators to asthma deaths, and other studies have linked corticosteriods to 
fracture risk and growth retardation10-12. Recen tly introduced  therapies that focus  on inhibiting a single 
component  of the allergic inflammatory respons e, such  as anti-lL-5 or anti-IL-13 antibodies, have had limited 
efficacy13. Thus, there is a compelling need  for new, safe and effective approaches  to asthma treatment, 
particularly in children with severe asthma, where there is generally a lifelong burden of diseas e, use of 
medications, and accoun ts for the majority of health care expend itures among all children with asthma. The 
development  of a therapeu tic approach  that could reduce  both airway respons iveness  and airway 
inflamm ation would be an impo rtant ad vance  in the treatment of asthma. 
During the previous funding period of this project, our laboratory demonstrated that chronic mechan ical 
strain imposed  on the airways in vivo using continuous  positive airway pressu re (CPAP ) results in a dramatic 
reduc tion in airway reactivity in vivo in mice, ferrets and rabbits1-3. Lungs, airways and airway smooth muscle 
(ASM) tissues isolated from CPAP-treated an imals studied in vitro exhibited lower respons iveness to 
bronchocon strictors1-3. We also observed this supp ression of airway respons iveness  by chronic 
mechan ical s train in a rabbit model of allergic asthma5. These an imal studies led to a small clinical trial in 
which adults with as thma were treated with nocturnal CPAP for 1 week.  CPAP caused  a significant 
reduction in airway reactivity in these patients6. This novel approach  for treating airway hyper-reactivity is 
currently being evaluated in a NIH multi-center Phase  II clinical trial of adults with mild to moderate asthma 
(U01 HL108730 ). 
We now  propose  to determine the efficacy of chronic mechan ical strain as an inhibitor of airway 
inflammation. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that chronic mechan ical strain can supp ress the 
responses  of airway tissues  to allergic inflammatory stimuli and supp ress the activation of signaling 
molecules involved in these  respo nses3,14,15. Based  on these studies, we hypothesize that chro nic 
mech anical strain will inhibit signaling processes  in airway tissues that lead to airway inflammation, 
hype r-reactivity and remode ling. We propose a novel molecular mechanism for the inhibitory effects of 
chronic mechanical strain on the responses  of ASM to inflammatory stimuli. Anti-inflammatory agents such  
as corticosteroids remain the primary treatment for severe chronic asthma. The conse quences of long term 
steroid therapy can be extremely de leterious, particularly in children, for whom steroids can have a 
significant adverse impact on growth and de velopment. Our proposed study will provide the basis for a new 
non-pharmacologic therapy for the control of asthma that may be particularly important for the treatment 
of children with severe steroid-depende nt disease.  We will determine whether mechan ical strain, as 
delivered using CPAP , is an effective therapy for suppressing airway hyper-reactivity and inflammation in 
pediatric subjects with severe asthma. The concept  that a non-pharmac ologic therapy  may play such  a 
pivotal role in suppress ing ASM contraction, inflamma tion and tissue remode ling is novel  and 
exciting. Furthermore, elucidation of the molecular mechan isms by which strain suppresses  inflammatory 
signaling pathways could also provide a bas is for the development of new pharmacologic targets for asthma 
therapy. 
  
Pathophysiology of airway inflammation in asthma. Th2 cytokines derived from CD4+ T lymphoc ytes 
play a pivotal role in the airway pathology assoc iated with asthma16-19. The structurally related Th2 ce ll 
derived c ytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 s timulate allergic and eos inoph ilic inflammation as well as 
4 
 
 
epithelial and s mooth muscle change s, and they are widely recognized as mediators of allergen-induced  
airway hyperrespons iveness  and airway remodeling8,18-21. Th2 cytokines can induce  airway hyper-
reactivity without inflammatory cell recruitment which indicates that many of the pathoph ysiologic effects of 
allergic inflammation in asthma result from the direct actions of IL-4 or IL-13 on airway cells9,19,20,22-24. The 
incuba tion of ASM with IL- 
13 or IL-4 in vitro caus es ASM hypercontractility, inhibits relaxation to isoproterenol and stimulates release  of 
the eosinoph il chemo-attractant eotaxin and IL-57,9,25-28. The cytokines secreted by ASM and other airway 
cells have paracrine effects on inflammatory cells and thus contribute to airway inflammation29-31. 
Pheno typic alterations in airway cells induced  by the direct actions of cytokines may be a primary 
mechan ism for airway remodeling in asthma. Changes in gene expression induced  by IL-13 or IL-4 have 
been de monstrated in airway cells including ASM, fibroblasts and airway epithelial cells15,32,33. Both IL-4 and 
IL-13 ac tivate signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and proliferation as well as the expression of 
respons ive genes34. The direct stimulation of resident airway cells with inflammatory cytokines in vitro 
stimulates cell growth and proliferation and the secretion of matrix proteins13,35,36. In our previous animal 
studies, , we  evaluated the effects of chronic mechan ical strain on the phys iologic responses  of ASM tissues  
to inflammatory mediators in vitro, and  on airway inflammation and remodeling in vivo using murine models 
of asthma. 
 
Molecular mecha nisms for the direct effects of inflammatory cytokines on ASM cells. 
IL-4 and IL-13 both signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex that 
cons ists of an IL-4Rα chain and an IL-13Rα chain (Fig.1). In response  to 
stimulation, the IL-4/IL-13 receptor subunits assoc iate with Janus  kinases 
(Jak) that phospho rylate the IL4Rα and IL13 receptor side cha ins, 
activating two distinct signaling proteins that bind to the phospho rylated 
IL-4Rα recep tor side chain: insulin recep tor-2 (IRS-2) and “signal 
transducer  and activator of transcription 6”(STAT6)34. IRS2 activates the 
PI3 kinase-dependent  protein kinase  Akt, a regulator of cell growth and 
hypertrophy, as well as ERK1/2 MAP kinase and o ther MAP kinases.  After 
phospho rylation by Jak, activated STAT6 dimerizes and migrates to the 
nucleus where it initiates the transcription of IL-4/IL-13 respons ive genes. 
Stimulation of ASM ce lls or tissues  by IL-4/IL-13 in vitro results in the 
phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2 and  STAT6,  the  synthesis  and  
secretion  of  eotaxin  and  IL-5,  and supp resses  the expression of smooth muscle pheno type-spec ific 
proteins7,8,15,26,37-40 (Figs.1,4-6). Our previous s tudies and preliminary data have shown that chronic 
mechan ical strain supp resses  the activation of Akt and ERK, and that strain inhibits eotaxin secretion and  IL-
13-mediated gene transcription (Figs. 5,6,9).  
 
Chron ic mechan ical strain suppresses  airway respons iveness  and ASM contractility. 
Mechan ical s train  of  the  lungs  during  breathing  has  an  important  role  in  reduc ing  airway  
respons iveness41.  Deep inspirations and tidal breathing decrease  airway respons iveness  acutely in 
healthy adults and animals and their absence  increases  airway respons ivenes s42-47. Similar effects of 
mechanical s train have been  obse rved in isolated airway segments and trachea lis smooth muscle strips 
studied in vitro, demonstrating that the effects of mechan ical strain on airway reactivity reflect its direct effects 
on ASM45,48-52. Although the effects of deep inspiration on airway reactivity are short-lived, these  obse rvations 
suggest that mechan ical strain cou ld be a us eful app roach for sup pressing airway 
hyperrespons ivenes s46,47,53,54. 
We initially explored the effects of imposing mechanical strain on the airways for prolonged time periods 
to determine whether it could cause  a longer term reduction of airway respons ivenes s. Chronic mechan ical 
strain for 1-2 days applied to bronch ial segments or tracheal muscle  strips in vitro resulted in a decrease 
in their con tractile respons iveness  to ACh as assessed subse quently under  unstrained cond itions4. These 
results sug gest that chronic strain can induce  persistent alterations in the functional properties of the ASM 
tissues.  
We subs equen tly tested the effects of chronic strain in vivo by applying CPAP to rabbits and ferrets for 
periods of 4 days to 2 weeks and found  that CPAP supp ressed  airway reactivity to ACh in vivo1,2. Lobes, 
5 
 
 
airway segments and tracheal  smooth muscle tissues  
excised from the lungs of these  CPAP treated animals 
also exhibited reduced  contractility in vitro. The effects 
of chronic mecha nical strain on airway reactivity were 
persistent and could be detected for at least 24 hours 
after CPAP5. In addition, the continuous  use of CPAP 
was not necessa ry for it to be effective: limiting CPAP to 
nocturnal periods for 4 days in rabbits was similarly 
effective in reduc ing airway respons iveness  (Fig. 2A). 
We also tested the efficacy of chronic mechanical strain 
at reducing airway hyperrespons iveness  in the presence of allergic airway inflammation. In Ova-sens itized 
and challenged rabbits continuous CPAP ad ministered for 4 days was effective at supp ressing airway 
reactivity5 (Fig 2B). We recently extended  this study to human asthmatics:  Adults with stable asthma and  
normal spirometry used  nocturnal CPAP for 7 da ys6.  CPAP resulted in a s ignificant dec rease in airway 
reactivity while a Sham-treated group of asthmatics had no significant chan ge in airway reactivity.  
 
Effects of chro nic mechan ical strain on ASM pheno type and its responses to inflamma tory med iators. 
ASM cells in culture modulate their properties between a synthetic and differentiated pheno type84-86.  
Integrin proteins a re widely recognized to be important regulators of cell phen otype, and can mediate 
transitions in the pheno typic status of cells in response to chan ges in the co mposition or stiffness of the 
extracellular matrix. Changes in ECM have been  shown to modulate the secretion of eotaxin by ASM cells in 
culture in response  to stimulation with IL-1387. 
Our data indicate that mechan ical s train imposed on ASM 
tissues  is a potent stimulus for regulating the pheno type and 
synthetic status ASM tissues14,15. When we imposed  chronic 
mechan ical strain on ASM tissues  in vitro, the activation of 
pathways mediated by PI3-kinase  depend ent Akt were 
supp ressed while the exp ression of smooth muscle pheno type- 
spec ific proteins was potentiated15  (Fig. 4). We confirmed 
this effect on the a irways of mice subjected to chronic 
mechan ical s train in vivo: the activation of Akt was 
significantly depressed in animals subjected to prolonged high 
mechan ical strain using PEEP as compared with control-
treated animals (Fig. 13C)3. Because  Akt is a critical mediator 
of pathways activated by inflammatory stimuli such  as IL-13, 
we hypothesized that mechan ical loads would suppress 
the inflammatory responses  of ASM to local mediators and 
might thereby mitigate airway inflamma tion (Fig.4). 
We performed  studies  on  ASM tissues  in  vitro  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  mechan ical  strain on  the 
responses  of ASM tissues to stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine IL-1314,15. The administration of IL-
13 to ASM tissues  in vitro stimulated the synthesis and expression of the chemokine, eotaxin, and supp ressed  
the e xpression of smooth muscle pheno type-spec ific proteins (Figs. 5,6). Subjecting ASM tissues  to 
mechan ical s train supp ressed  IL-13 stimulated eotaxin synthesis and secretion and potentiated the 
expression of smooth muscle spec ific proteins, promoting the differentiated pheno type. Thus,  while IL-13 
promotes chemok ine syn thesis and the synthetic pheno type of ASM, mechan ical strain opposes  this 
effect, suppress ing IL-13 stimulated eotaxin synthesis and promoting the differentiated phenotype. 
(Fig. 4) 
Our studies have also established  the role of integrin signaling in the regulation of ASM differentiation and 
mechano -sens itive signaling to the nucleus. We found  that integrin-linked kinase  (ILK), a multi-domain 
β integrin-binding protein kinase  that regulates Akt, is a critical upstream regulator of signaling pathways 
that regulate the synthetic and differentiation functions of ASM tissues88. ILK forms a stable heterotrimeric 
complex with PINCH , an adap tor protein, and α-parvin, which binds to actin filaments89. ILK also binds 
directly to β integrin proteins and to the mechano -sens itive adheso me protein paxillin, and paxillin binding is 
necessa ry for the localization of ILK to integrin adheso mes90. ILK regulates the PI3 kinase-dependent  
6 
 
 
activation of Akt91. We found  that Akt activation inhibits the transcriptional regulator, serum response factor 
(srf) in ASM, thereby supp ressing the expression of smooth muscle pheno typic proteins88. Mechan ical loads  
inhibit the ILK- dependen t activation of Akt, thus p romoting the d ifferentiated phen otype15(Fig. 4). Our 
preliminary data also show that the ILK complex also plays a critical role in regulating the mechanosens itivity 
of eotaxin synthesis in response  to the stimulation of ASM with IL-1314 (Fig. 10). 
 
Summar y. 
We have shown that chronic mechan ical strain supp resses  allergen-induced h yper-respons iveness  in 
vivo in animal models of asthma and the effectiveness  of nocturnal CPAP at reduc ing airway hyper-reactivity 
in adu lts with mild-moderate asthma. Our studies of ASM tissues indicate that mechan ical strain is sensed  
and transduced  by integrin adheso mes to signaling pathways that regulate the synthetic and differentiation 
status of ASM. Our proposed studies will use in vitro models to assess the effects of strain on the 
inflammatory responses  of ASM tissues  (SA #1), will evaluate the supp ression of airway inflammation by 
chronic strain in murine models of asthma (SA #2), and will test the efficacy  of mechan ical s train as 
therapy to suppress airway inflammation and hyper-reactivity in children with severe asthma (SA #3). 
 
SPECIFIC  AIM #3: DETER MINE WHETHER CPAP SUPPRESSES  AIRWAY HYPER -REACTIVITY AND 
AIRWAY INFL AMMATION IN CHI LDREN WITH SEVERE  ASTHMA. 
 
RATIONALE.  Whereas some children with asthma have intermittent symptoms that are improved with 
short-acting bronchod ilators, many have persistent symptoms requiring daily treatment with inhaled 
corticosteroids. Children with severe asthma often have ongoing symptoms, airway inflammation and hyper-
reactivity desp ite treatment with high doses  of inhaled corticosteroids. They a re at high risk for asthma 
exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids, emergency room visits and hosp italization. Children with 
severe asthma are often highly atopic with increased  peripheral blood eosinoph ilia, aeroallergen sens itivity, 
elevated serum IgE concen trations, e levated eNO, and  eosinoph ilia in induced  sputum and  BALF120-125. A 
novel non -pharmacologic treatment that supp resses airway hyper-reactivity and inflammation in children 
with severe asthma cou ld provide a significant advance  in the therapy for these  difficult to treat patients. We 
hypothesize that chron ic mechan ical strain will suppress  airway reactivity and inflammation in 
children with severe asthma. In SA #3 we will determine whether the use of nocturnal CPAP for 1 month in 
children with severe asthma supp resses  airway reactivity as assessed  by bronchial challenge, and  airway 
inflammation by  induced  sputum. 
 
PRELI MINARY DATA. Our recent  study of  adults with mild-moderate clinically stable asthma demonstrated that 
treatment with nocturnal CPAP for 1 week decreased airway reactivity (increase  in PC20) compared to a 
Sham-treated group6.These results provided the pilot data for our current NIH phase  II multi-center 
clinical trial designed to asse ss the effectiveness  of using nocturnal CPAP to supp ress airway reactivity in 
subjects with mild-moderate asthma. However, this trial is restricted primarily to adult patients who may 
not be steroid- dependent  and are less likely to have persistent airway inflammation or exhibit airway 
remodeling. Therefore we plan to evaluate children with severe asthma, as CPAP therapy may be particularly 
bene ficial to this group. Our study will also assess  airway inflammation which is not included  in previous or 
ongoing clinical trials.  
 
Fig.16. Nocturnal CPAP suppressed  airway hyper-reactivity in an 8 yr old girl.  
We assessed  the effect of 1 month treatment with nocturnal CPAP (8 cmH2O) or Sham (0 cm H2O) in two 8 
year old girls who had PC 20 <1 mg/ml, which is indicative of airway hyper -reactivity. The child treated with 
CPAP showed a marked decrease in airway reactivity (increased PC20), while the ham -treated child maintained 
airway. This demonstrates our ability to recruit an d evaluate young children, and is consistent with our 
hypothesis .

3.0 Enrollment/Randomization  
 
TREATMENT:   
1. Nocturnal CPAP (8-12 cmH2O) or Sham (0 cmH2O).  
2. Subjects will be rando mized to use CPAP or Sham CPAP at night for a total of 28 days (+/- 3 
days ) with a minimum of 4 hrs/night for at least 5 days/wk. If patient is hav ing asthma symptoms at 
time of f inal visit , treatme nt may be extended up to 14 additional days.  If patient receives oral

visit. Adherence and tolerance of CPAP will be evaluated b y periodic phone calls and documented 
daily calendar diary with hours of use . 
 
4.0 Study Procedures:  
 
1. Spirometry : Spirometry will be performed after withholding bronchodilators.  Forced vital capacity 
(FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) will b e measured using ATS guidelines.  
2. Airway Reactivity assessed by MCh Bronchial Challenge : Testing will use the 5 breath dosimeter 
protocol recommended by ATS126. Following inhalation of saline, MCh will be inhaled in  quadrupling 
concentrations starting with 0.0625 mg/ml and continuing until the MCh con centration required for FEV 1 
to decrease by 20% from baseline (PC 20) is achieved or a maximum MCh concentration of 16 mg/ml is 
inhaled.  
3. Airway Inflammation assessed by Exhaled Nitric Oxide (eNO): eNO will be measured at a constant 
expiratory flow of 50 ml /s with a chemiluminescence analyzer (NIOX; Aerocrine) using ATS 
guidelines127.  
4. Airwa y Inflammation assessed by Induced Sputum . Sputum induction will be performed after MCh 
challenge and treatment with albuterol to return FEV 1 to > 70% predicted. Sputum will be induced by 
inhaling increasing concentrations  (3 to 7% ) of saline at 5 min inte rvals . Oscillating  positive expiratory  
pressure (PEP) therapy  may be used if needed to assist with sputum expectoration in conjunction with 
8 
 
 saline treatments  for up to 20 min or until an adequate sample is produced. Spirometry is performed 
after each expec toration to check that the FEV 1 has not decreased by >20%, in which case the child 
would be given bronchodilator and no more hypertonic saline. Sputum will be processed for differential 
cell counts and supernatants stored at -80ºC for subsequent analysis o f eotaxin and eosinophil cationic 
protein128. 
5. Asthma Symptom control:  Asthma control will be assessed by using the Asthma Control Test129. 
6. Berlin score:  Questionnaire will be used to determine high or low risk status for obstructive sleep 
apnea130. 
 
5.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others  
 
Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medic al occurrence in a clinical investigation of a patient that does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporall y associated with the 
administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that investigational product.   
 
The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs during each subject visit 
and record the information in the site’s source documents.  Adverse events will be recorded in the subject 
internal data collection forms.  Adverse events will be described by duration (start and stop dates and times), 
severity, outcome, treatment and relation to study m edication, or if unrelated, the cause.  
 
Serious Adverse Experiences (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward med ical occurrence that : 
 
 Results in death  
 Is considered life threatening (i.e., in the view of the investigator the adverse experience places the 
subject at immediate risk of death from the reaction, as it occurred; it does not include a reaction that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death)  
 Requires hospital admission or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 Is an important medical event (i.e., when based upon appropriate medical judgment, the adverse 
experience may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the above listed outcomes)  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
 
Data Safety Monitor Gregory Montgomery, MD will monitor this study on an annual ba sis.  Data to be 
monitored includes:  data quality, subject recruitment, accrual and retention and adverse events.  The results 
of related studies that impact subject safety and privacy will also be assessed.   
 
Data monitoring will also include the interp retation of the data and confirming that the data is kept in a secure 
database.  The co -investigators of the study will be doing an interim analysis and interpretation of the data on 
an annual basis.  
 
Adverse events will be dealt with on a case by case bas is and all institutions (IRB/ NIH) involved in the study 
will be notified by either a formal letter or memo.  
 
The following information will be reported to the IRB on an annual basis with the continuing review:  
1. Dates of monitoring  
2. Summary of cumulative adv erse events  
9 
 
 3. Assessment of external factors that impact the safety of subjects  
4. Summary of subject privacy and research data confidentiality  
5. Any changes in risk -benefit ratio  
 
6.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  
 
If the parent/guardian chooses to withdraw the s ubject from the study, then the parent/guardian will inform a 
member of the research team.  At that time, no further testing will be obtained.  Samples already obtained from 
the subject prior to withdrawal will still be included in analysis.   
 
Management o f Increased Asthma Symptoms : If a subject’s asthma symptoms worsen during the course of 
the treatment period, they will be directed to their pediatric pulmonologist or the High Risk Asthma clinic for 
management.  Any changes in therapy, including controlle r medications or courses of systemic steroids will be 
recorded. As the enrolled subjects have severe asthma, one course of systemic steroids in 4 weeks would not 
be considered unusual and would not trigger withdrawal from the study. However, an inpatient h ospitalization 
or two courses of systemic steroids in the 4 week treatment period will trigger withdrawal from the study  
 
7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
ANALYSIS :  
Primary  Outcome : The change  in airway reactivity (logPC20) measu red prior to and after 4 wks of either 
CPAP or SHAM treatment. We will compare the change in PC20 between two groups  using an analysis of 
covariance  (ANC OVA) model, adjusting for baseline PC20. We anticipate that PC20 will increase  for the 
CPAP treated group, but not cha nge for the SHAM treated subjects. 
Secondary  Outcomes: Airway Inflammation assessed  as the change  in the percentage eosinoph ils in the 
induced  sputum measured prior to and after 4 wks CPAP or SHAM treatment. We will compare the change 
between two groups  using an ANC OVA model adjusting for base line percentage eosinoph ils. We 
anticipate that eos inoph ilia will dec rease  for the CPAP treated group, but not in the SHAM treated subjects. 
 
Justification of Sample Size:  Change in Airway Respons ivenes s: We calculated the sample size based on  
the difference  of logPC20 chan ges between groups.  Our previous study showed a difference of  change in 
logPC20 between CPAP and SHAM groups  as 0.41 with a standa rd deviation of 0.46. With a 1 month 
intervention period in our study (compared to 1 week in previous study), we expect a larger effect size. 
Therefore, we conse rvatively assu me a 0.41 difference  and a 0.46 standa rd deviation. With 30 patients in 
each group, we expect 27 of them will complete the study. We will have more than 85% power to detect 
such  a difference  with a 5% Type I error rate using a two-sample t-test. ANCOV A model will be more 
powerful than the t-test. Change in Airway Inflammation: We calculated the smallest changes in airway 
inflammation that can be  detected with the sample size generated above. With 27 patients completing the 
study, we have 80% power to detect an  effect s ize as small as 78% (difference of changes is 78% of the 
standa rd deviation) using a t-test.  
 
 
ANTICIPATED RESULTS.   
Based  upon  our previous experience  that CPAP suppresses  airway reactivity in adults with  mild-
moderate  asthma,  our  preliminary data  in  children  and  our  animal  models,  we  anticipate  that 
nocturnal CPAP will suppress airway reactivity in children with severe asthma. These  findings would have 
important clinical implications and justify a multi-center trial for much longer periods of CPAP treatment to 
evaluate its potential in decreasing asthma symptoms and medication usage in children with severe asthma. 
We also expect CPAP to supp ress airway inflammation. Although our primary measu rement of airway 
inflammation is induced  sputum eosinoph ilia, we will evaluate additional inflammatory markers. It is 
poss ible that our sample size will be too small to obtain statistical significance for these  markers. However, 
if we find that CPAP shows a tendency to decrease  airway inflammation, our results could be used  to power a 
larger clinical trial. It is poss ible that CPAP will increase  airway inflammation, but this seems unlikely as 
10 
 
 CPAP in adu lts with obstructive sleep apnea  has been  found to decrease systemic inflammatory 
markers131,132. 
 
8.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 
Each study subject will be assigned a subject number.  All samples will be identified only by subject number 
when submitted to t he research laboratory for analysis.  The enrollment list containing both the subject number 
and identifiable information will be kept on a password protected server.  
 
Security and confidentiality  
To comply with HIPAA guidelines, processes and procedures have been documented and implemented to 
ensure the security and protection of the study data within the computer operations center, the server, and the 
database.   IU uses a three level security model to secure and protect data collected and stored within 
REDCap.   This model is as follows:   1) an individual must register an account within the Indiana CTSI Hub and 
either be assigned a username/password if external to IU or use their IU login credentials and authenticate via 
IU’s Central Authentication Service  (CAS); 2) once a Hub account has been established, an individual must 
submit a request for a REDCap account; the request must be approved and then a REDCap account is 
established; and, 3) an individual must have their REDCap account be granted appropriate  access and 
privileges to the specific project database by the project PI or delegate.   In addition, since REDCap is web -
based, IU utilizes SSL (https) encryption for secure connectivity.  
 
9.0 Follow -up and Record Retention  
 
Enrollment:  
Enrolling sufficient subjects is always challenging; however we were succes sful at this in our previous 
CPAP study6. Riley Hospital for Children  is the primary referral center for all of Indiana and our  pediatric 
pulmonary group manages most of the severe pediatric asthma, so we do not expect problems recruiting 
subjects for this study. In multiple previous studies we recruited more than 100 subjects133-137. 
 
CPAP Measures:  
In our preliminary studies, the use of CPAP for an average of 4 hrs/night was effective. Our CPAP devices c an 
monitor the number of hours that CPAP is actually being used  by measu ring respiratory pressu re fluctuations. 
Daily usa ge statistics can be stored on an SD card that is downloaded  after 1 week, 2 weeks and  4 weeks  of 
treatment. To reinforce adhe rence,  we insure mask comfort at the initial visit, use humidification to 
prevent nasal d rying and reinforce adhe rence  with regular telephone  calls and  documented  daily calendar 
diary  with of hours of use.  
 
Data Capture System  
The Research Electronic Data CAPture ( REDCap) database system will be used to collect data for this study.   
The REDCap software toolset provides a secure, web -based environment that is flexible enough to be used 
for a variety of types of research, provides an intuitive interface for users to e nter data and have real time 
validation rules (with automated data type and range checks) at the time of entry.   The system offers easy 
data manipulation with logged auditing, functionality for reporting, monitoring and querying patient records, 
and an aut omated export mechanism to common statistical packages such as:   SPSS, SAS, Stata, R/S -Plus.  
REDCap has been used within Indiana University and affiliates since April 2009 and it currently supports 177 
projects and over 380 users within IU, Purdue, Notre Dame, IU Health, VA, Rehabilitation Hospital of Indiana, 
and Wishard Health.   The input data will be stored in secured server for storage and analysis.  
 
Backup  
At all times, appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be maint ained and the 
information will be appropriately protected from illegitimate access. At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., 
11 
 
 production of interim reports and final reports), a permanent archive of the database will be made. Archived 
versions of the da tabase will be saved for at least three years after the end of the study.  
 
Availability and Retention of Investigational Records:  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to authorized representatives of the NIH and IRB/IEC upon 
request.  A file fo r each subject must be maintained that includes the signed Informed Consent, HIPAA 
Authorization and copies of all source documentation related to that subject.  The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which t he information on the internal data collection forms 
was derived.  All study documents (subject files, signed informed consent forms, copies of internal data 
collection forms, Study File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of three years.   
 
10.0 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 
50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR  312).  
To maintain confidentiality, all lung function data, evaluation forms, reports and other records will be identified 
by a coded number and initials only.  All study records will be kept in a locked file cabinet and code sheets 
linking a subject’s nam e to a subject identification number will be stored separately in another locked file 
cabinet.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary 
for monitoring by the FDA.  The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC).  
 
Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by the Study Principal Investigato rs and submitted to the IRB for 
their approval.  
 
Publications  
The preparation and submittal for publication of manuscripts containing the study results shall be in 
accordance with a process determined by mutual written agreement among the study Sponsor an d 
participating institutions.  The publication or presentation of any study results shall comply with all applicable 
privacy laws, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.

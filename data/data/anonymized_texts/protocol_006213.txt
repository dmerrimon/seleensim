1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) is a collection of at least three out of five cardiometabolic risk 
factors including abdominal obesity, hypertension, elevated blood glucose, hypertriglyceridemia, 
and low high -density lipoprotein chol esterol [1]. The prevalence of MetS  is rising worldwide, 
and as of 2012, more than one third of all US adults met the criteria for MetS [2].  This is 
important as MetS is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is considered a state of 
prediabetes [3]. Improving metabolic parameters through dietary, behavioral, and 
pharmacological interventions can improve or reverse MetS [4, 5] . For instance, a 5-year study 
in Spain (PREDIMED) evaluated the effects of the Mediterranean diet on primary prevention of 
cardiovascular disease in subjects at high ris k of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [6].  PREDIMED 
was a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial of 7,447 participants who were 
randomized to one of three diets: Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil 
(EVOO), Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a lo w-fat control diet. The 
PREDIMED study found a reduction in the cardiovascular event rates in both intervention groups 
compared to the low fat control group . Additionally, post -hoc analysis of individuals meeting the 
criteria for MetS at baseline revealed E VOO and nut consumption (compared to controls) was 
more likely to result in reversion of MetS (HR = 1.35 95% CI: 1.15 – 1.58, p<0.001), and 
significant reductions in central obesity (p<0.001) and high fasting glucose (p = 0.02) compared 
to the low fat cont rol group [7].  However, lower levels of adherence  to the PR EDIMED 
intervention was found in participants with a higher number of cardiovascular risk factors, larger 
waist circumference, and lower physical activity levels at baseline [8]. New strategies to convey 
 
6 
 one’s risk of morbidity and mortality at the onset of a dietary intervention may improve 
intervention adherence, particularly among individuals meeting the criteria for Met S. 
DNA methylation patterns change with age, and can be used to estimate chronological age [9-
12]. A gr eater DNA methylation -based predicted age relative to chronological age, often referred 
to as “ epigenetic age acceleration ”, has been associated with many lifestyle factors, including 
physical activity and diet, as well as components of MetS, including obe sity, blood pressure, 
HDL cholesterol and blood glucose levels [13]. A higher number of MetS components are cross -
sectionally associated with epigenetic age acceleration [14]. Epigenetic age acceleration is more 
strongly predictive for the risk of morbidity and mortality than chronological age [9, 11] . We 
hypothe size that the majority of people with MetS have advanced epigenetic aging, and among 
those that have advanced epigenetic age, learning about  epigenetic age  and its relationship to  
morbidity and mortality at the onset of a dietary intervention will improve participant adherence 
to the dietary intervention. Further, we hypothesize that daily consumption of EVOO and tree 
nuts in participants with MetS and advanced epigenetic age could  help reverse MetS and 
potentially slow epigenetic aging.   Therefore, we plan to conduct this feasibility pilot study to:  
 
1.1 Primary Objective s 
To determine the proportion of participants with MetS with epigenetic age 
acceleration  
To assess adherence to dail y EVOO and tree nut consumption  over the 4 -week 
intervention , and compare adherence in participants educated about  epigenetic age 
acceleration at baseline compared to intervention arm not educated about  
epigenetic age  acceleration  
Qualitatively explore how participants perceive epigenetic age, and how 
participants’ experiences would impact the feasibility of a larger clinical 
intervention in terms of challenges and motivators  
1.2 Secondary Objective s 
Compare epigenetic age acceleration  before and after the 4 -week intervention  
 
1.3 Exploratory  Objectives  
Compare changes in MetS related traits ( body mass index, waist circumference, 
blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, and fasting glucose 
levels ) before vs. after the 4 -week intervention   
2.0 Participant  Selection  
This study  can fulfill its objective only if pa rticipants appropriate for this intervention are 
enrolled. All relevant medical and other considerations will be taken into account when 
decidi ng whether this protocol is  appropriate for a particular candidate .

2.3 Inclusion of Women , Minorities  and Children  
Males and f emale s of all races and ethnic grou ps are eligible for this trial.  Children will not be 
included in this study as children with metabolic syndrome may have very different underlying 
etiologies for metabolic syndrome than adults . 
 
2.4  Identification of Cohort  
We propose to draw our sample of 50 men and women from the popu lation residing in Winston -
Salem/Forsyth County, North Carolina.  Over 361,220  persons live in th e county.  In addition, 
over 1.3  million people reside in the eight contiguous counties comprising the Piedmont Triad 
area.  We anticipate that recruitment for  the study can be accomplished in Forsyth County.  
However, if needed, we will extend recruitment to the surrounding communities.  
 
3.0  Recruitment Procedures  
Investigators at Wake Forest School of Medicine have extensive experience in recruitment for 
both observational and clinical trials.  Based on our previous experience in large -scale studies, 
we have found the use of several approaches for recruitment subst antially better than relying on 
one recruitment strategy.  These approaches include: community -wide methods designed to 
reach large numbers of men and women  and contacting participants through MyWakeHealth 
communications .  We will  also recruit participants  through advertising on  the WFBH website 
 
8 
 ‘Be Involved’  and using s tudy flyers posted at local medical clinics including Family Medicine 
and Internal Medicine.  
 
We anticip ate it will take approximately 12 week s to recruit 50 participants for this project.  
Candidates will complete  a telephone screening.  The baseline visit will consist of an in-person 
assessment  visit, scheduled  for a morning time , and participants will be asked to be fasting  and 
will be instructed to bring their medications to the visit. Candidates  will review the informed 
consent document at the baseline visit for in-person screening with study staff prior to beginning 
their participation.  
 
Each candidate  will be greeted by a  study staff member who will take the candidate to a private 
consulting room.  A final eligibility checklist and each section of the informed consent will be 
reviewed with the candidate.  Once the candidate fully understands each section of the consent, 
he/she will sign the document and be giv en a copy to take home. A copy will be retained by the 
study staff.  
 
Recruitment of Participants  
 
The goal of the recruitment phase is to enroll 5 0 men and women with MetS into the study.   
        Female  Male  
American Indian or Alaska Native         1     1 
Asian or Pacific Islander          1     1

Hispanic            2     2 
White, not of Hispanic Origin         14               14 
Other or Unknown           1     0 
TOTAL                                                                                      25    25 
 
3.1 Epigenetic Age Acceleration  
For all participants providing informed consent, blood samples will be collected at each in -
person visit to calculate epigeneti c age acceleration.  
 
4.0 Treatment Plan : Tree Nuts and Extra Virgin Olive Oil  
At the intervention  visit, all participants will receive the full  4-week supply of EVOO  and tree 
nuts, including unsalted English walnuts, almonds  or pistachios (approximately  10-day supply of 
each type) . Participants will be asked to supplement their normal diets with these products  and 
will be provided recipes and other information that will al low them to replace other foods with 
the nuts and oil . We will ask participants to consume one ounce  of tree nuts  per day  and two 
tablespoons  of EVOO per day by incorporatin g these foods into their diet. D ietary adherence 
diaries will be given to measure i ncorporation of the study foods.  
 
 
9 
 Participants will be randomized to learn about epigenetic age acceleration (arm 1) or not to learn 
about epigenetic age acceleration (arm 2) in a 1:1 allocation  at the intervention visit.  Those in 
the intervention arm 1 that are to  learn about epigenetic age acceleration will receive some 
educational materials and a brief description of epigenetic age acceleration.   
 
A telephone visit  will be conducted  at the end of we ek 1 for additional diet counseling, to assess 
safety/potential side effects, to collect adherence diaries . A follow -up phone call for compliance 
assessment and to answer participant questions will be  conducted at the end of week 2 . A final 
measurement visit w ill be scheduled for the end of week 4  for a morning time and participants 
will be asked to be fasting . 
 
4.1 Toxicities  
Side effects will be monitored by staff contact  at the end of week  1 visit, and at the end of week 
2 (by phone) and  at the final measurement  visit at the end of week 4 .  Participants will be 
encouraged to contact the Study manager during the study period if they feel they are 
experiencing effects related to the study foods . 
 
EVOO  and tree nuts  are generally recognized a s safe and are consumed by free living adults on a 
regular basis.  The amount to be given in this study are within the range given to the participants 
in the PREDIMED  study [6] and found  to have only minor side effects, mainly stomach upset , 
bloating and nausea , and none of the side effects advanced to  serious adverse event s.  
 
Administration  
Study foods  will consist of one o unce  of tree nuts  per day  and two tablespoons of EVOO per 
day.  Participants will be instructed how to consume the proper amount of tree nuts and EVOO  
and reporting  the consumption on the compliance diary  (Appendix A) . The tree nuts  will be 
provided in daily s ervings (one ounce  per day) and EVOO will be provided in bottles , along with 
a tablespoon . Participants will be instructed to use the tablespoon to measure EVOO.  
Participants will also receive recipes and other written information that will assist them in 
incorporating both the nuts and EVOO into their existing dietary patterns.  
 
Dose Modification/Toxicity management :   
Side effects will be monitored via the telep hone vis it at the end of  week 1  and 2 and by 
participant report. Participants will be encouraged to contact the study team  during the study 
period if they feel they are experiencing side effects related to the study foods .  For those 
participants with exis ting medical conditions (e.g., gallbladder removal or bariatric surgery) or 
who are experiencing nausea related to consumption of the olive oil,  a titrated dosing plan will 
be used. These participants will begin their olive oil consumption at 1 tablespoon/ day for 5 days 
and increasing to 2 tablespoons/day on the sixth day if it is well tolerated. If this increase is not 
tolerated, the participant can be returned to 1 tablespoon per day and attempt an increase after an 
additional 5 days.  
 
 
 
Withdraw al from study intervention  
 
10 
 Any side effects experience d by the participant may or may not be due to the study foods . If the 
side effects become intolerant for the participant, he/she may be withdrawn from the study at the 
discretion of the study team.

4.3 Study Visits  
4.3.1  Baseline Visit: In-person screening  
At the in-person screening visit each participant will be greeted by a staff member who will take 
the candidate to a private consulting room.  A final eligibility checklist and each section of the 
informed consent will be reviewed with the candidate.  Once the candidate fully unders tands 
each section of the consent, he/she will sign the document and be given a copy to take home. A 
copy will be retained by the study staff.  
 
After providing informed consent, fasting participant s will complete study questionnaires in a 
quiet private room  and show current medications to a staff member that will record the names of 
medications brought to the clinic . Next, blood pressure will be measured  after resting 5 minutes 
and sitting upright.  Blood pressure may be measured twice.  Body weight will then be measured 
using a beam scale with movable weights with participant wearing indoor clothing with no 
shoes.  Height and waist circumference will also be measured. Participant will also have a fasting 
blood collection.  Participants will be asked to complete a validated 14 -item Questionnaire of 
Mediterranean diet adherence  [15] to assess their baseline diet  including consumption of olive oil 
and nuts  (Appendix B) . 
4.3.2  Intervention visit 
Eligible participants  (those that provided informed consent, were fasting at the in -person visit 
and met the criteria for MetS, and provided blood samples for epigenetic age acceleration 
 
11 
 measurements ) will be contacted to schedule the  intervention visit. The study is set to en d on 
March 21, 2022 , which means t he study intervention visits need to be completed  by March 3, 
2022 . Participants that have not attended their intervention visit by March 3, 2022  will be 
discontinued from the study.  
 
At the intervention visit, participant s will have a fasting blood collection.  Participants  will 
receive counseling  and recipes to help them incorporate the nuts and EVOO into daily meal s. 
Dietary adherence diaries will be given to participants to measure incorporation of the study 
foods  and participants will be instructed to complete the adherence diaries on a daily basis . 
Participant s will be given a 4-week  supply of EVOO , tree nuts, and a tablespoon  for measuring 
the EVOO.   
 
Participants will be randomized to learn about epigenetic age  acceleration (arm 1) or to not learn 
about epigenetic age acceleration (arm 2) in a 1:1 allocation  at the baseline visit .  Those in arm 1 
will receive some educational materials and a brief explanation of  epigenetic age acceleration.  At 
the end of this vi sit, all participants will be scheduled for the  remainder of their telephone and in 
person study visits.  
4.3.3  End of week 1 and week 2  telephone call s 
During the end of w eek 1 telephone call , participants will be contacted via telephone and asked 
questions about their adherence , and any potential side effects observed. Participants will receive 
additional counseling for how to incorporate the nuts and oil into a daily meal as needed. A 
follow up phone call at the e nd of week 2  will be scheduled to assess compliance and to answer 
participant questions , and a final measurement visit will be scheduled for the end of week 4 for a 
morning time and participants will be asked to be fasting.  
4.3.4 Final measurement visit, end of w eek 4  
The same measures , as listed in the in-person screening  visit will be performed.  Study 
questionnaires , with the exception of demographics and health history,  will be distributed and 
completed , and adherence diaries will be  collected .  
For participants of the intervention arm 1 (participants educated about  epigenetic age  
acceleration ), a self-administered exit questionnaire will be given to  qualitatively explore 
participants’ perception of epigenetic age, and challenges and motivators for behavior change 
during the intervention. The open -ended questions will be designed to ascertain understanding of 
epigenetic age, and assess the challenges and motivators participants encountered during the 
intervention.  
Participants in both arms will be administered an  Intervention E xperience Assessment to explore 
how participants’ experiences would impact the feasibility of a larger clinical intervention i n 
terms of challenges and motivators . 
 
5.0 Study Measures  
5.1 Anthropometric Measures  
Weight:  Weight will be assessed using a digital scale in kilograms  with participants wearing 
indoor clothing with no shoes.   
 
12 
  
Height : Height will be measured using a stadiometer attached to a beam scale, in centimeters, 
with no shoes worn.   
 
Blood pressure : First-phase systolic and fifth -phase diastolic Korotkoff blood  pressure will be 
auscultated from the right arm of the subject, after resting 5 minutes and sitting upright.  We will 
use a standard manometer with a cuff sized appropriately.  .  If the  blood pressure reading is 
elevated, it will trigger an "alert" and s ubsequent participant/physician notification.   
 
Waist circumference : Waist circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the lowest 
rib and the iliac crest.   
 
5.2  Blood -based  Biomarkers  
 
HDL cholesterol , triglycerides, HbA1c, and fasting glucose  levels  will be  analyzed using serum 
samples at a local LabCorp facility . 
 
Epigenetic age acceleration : DNA methylation will be measured from b lood samples frozen/ 
stored at -80 C within 2 hours of collection. After recruitment of 50 participants meeting the 
criteria for MetS is completed , blood samples will be sent for DNA methylation analysis in the 
lab of Dr. Howard at WFBMC. DNA will be extracted from whole blood samples, and will be 
bisulfite -converted using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo , Irvine, CA). Illumina 
Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, which targets over 850,000 CpG sites, and the Illumina 
iScan Reader will be used to determine the proportion of DNA methylation at each site.  The 
ratio of the fluorescence intensity of the methyla ted versus the combined methylated and 
unmethylated probes will be determined with Illumina GenomeStudio. As a quality control 
measure, the cumulative fluorescent signal must be significantly greater than the negative 
controls included for each sample. We will use a threshold of this “detection p -value” of ≤0.05 in 
at least 90% of the samples as criteria for adequate assays. Finally, adjustments will be made to 
normalize the fluorescent signals from the Infinium I and Infinium II fluorescent assays used 
prior to analysis (in Bioconductor).  
DNA methylation profiles  (beta -value, after adjustment chip and position effects) at 1,030 
unique DNA methylation profiles will be used for epigenetic age acceleration predictions, using 
the DNA GrimAge predictor [11]. We will calculate predicted lifespan and regress predicted 
lifespan on chronological age to produce estimates of epigenetic age acceleration.  
5.3 Questionnaires  
Demographic information : Name, marital status, date of birth; racial/ethn ic group; occupation; 
education . 
 
Personal medical history : Select questions abou t the participant’s me dical history, past and 
present . 
 
Dietary intake : Participant s will be asked to complete Mediterranean Diet 14 item dietary 
screener .  
 
 
13 
 Current medications : Prescription medications ; participants will be instructed to bring 
medications  to the clinic.  
 
Intervention Assessments  (see appendix A)  
Compliance -Intake of the study foods, tree  nuts and EVOO  will be tracked on a daily basis using 
a compliance diary.  The participant will record on a daily diary the following  informati on: 
Did you eat the nuts today?  - Yes, No  
Did you consume the oil today? -Yes, No  
 
Telephone contacts and maintenance of the cohort :  Telephone contact will be used to monitor 
participants for study compliance and side effects by phone at the end of week 1 and 2.  During 
the phone call participants will be invited to ask any questions and to discuss any problems with 
the study, specifically their adherence to the study foods .  Participants’ medication history will 
be reviewed.   
 
 Perception of Epigenetic A ge Assessment  -For participants of the intervention arm 1 
(participants educated about epigenetic age acceleration), a self -administered exit questionnaire 
will be given to qualitatively explore participants’ perception of epigenetic age, and challenges 
and motivators fo r behavior change during the intervention. The questions will be designed to 
ascertain understanding of epigenetic age, and assess the challenges and motivators participants 
encountered during the intervention.  
 
Intervention Experience Assessment - Partici pants in both study arms will be administered an 
intervention experience assessm ent to explore  how participants’ experiences would impact the 
feasibility of a larger clinical intervention in terms of challenges and motivators.  
 
5.4 Duration of Participatio n in Intervention  
Participation will be for a 4-week  period  unless the following occur :  
• Illness that prevents furt her administration of treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
• General or specific changes in the participant’s  condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in t he judgment of the investigator  
5.5 Duration of Follow Up  
Participants will be involved in the stud y intervention for a period of 4 week s. Participants  
removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event.   
5.6 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Participants  will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed above  applies.  The 
reason for study removal and the date the pa rticipant  was removed will be documented in the 
Case Report Form.  
The study is set to end on March 31, 2022. As such, all study intervention visits need to be 
completed by March 3, 2022. Any participant s remaining on study, that have not attended their 
intervention visit by that date, will be discontinued from the study.

 6.0 Adverse Events and Reporting Requirements  
The risk of harm or discomfort that may happen as a result of taking part in this research study is 
not expected to be more than in daily life or from routine physical or psychological examinations 
or tests.    
 
There is risk, although minor , involved in obtaining blood samples.  There may be some 
discomfort, bruising and/or bleeding where the needle is inserted for blood draws.   Some people 
become dizzy, lightheaded, or feel faint.  Infection may occur on rare occasions.  Frequent 
donation of blood can result in low iron in the blood.   
 
There is also a risk of weight gain from  the increased caloric intake that may occur as a result of 
consuming the nuts and oils.  Participants will be provided with recipes and other information on 
incorpora ting the nuts and oils by replacing other foods to reduce the risk of weight gain and will 
be encouraged to contact the study team if they believe they are gaining weight.   
 
There is a slight risk that study participants may  have an unknown allergy to nut s or olive oil and 
may therefore have an allergic reaction to one of these substances . Mild allergic symptoms that 
can occur include: raised red bumps of skin – hives, swelling of the lips, tingling of the throat 
and mouth, itchy skin and rash, runny nose,  tightening of the throat, and digestive symptoms – 
cramps, stomach pain, nausea , or vomiting. If study participants feel they are experiencing one of 
these mild allergic reactions, they will be instructed to contact the study team and report the 
reaction.  
 
Although unexpected in adults without prior knowledge of an allergy to tree nuts, consumption 
of tree nuts can also result in severe allergic reaction symptoms including: difficult or noisy 
breathing, swelling of the tongue, swelling or tightness of the throat, difficulty talking or a hoarse 
voice, wheeze or persistent cough, or persistent dizziness or collapse. If study participants feel 
they are experiencing one of these severe allergic reaction symptoms, they will be instructed to 
call 911 and seek imm ediate medical care. After treatment, they will be instructed to contact the 
study team and report the reaction.  
 
Study staff will re port any adverse events to the PI, Dr. Reynolds , who will review all 
unanticipated problems involving risk to participants or others, serious adverse events, and 
provide a written report of the event to the IRB.  If necessary, the study team  will direct 
appropriate referrals for health care needed to address  study -related adverse events.   
 
Results of routine clinical labs and physical measures obtained as part of study visits that meet the 
criteria for “Alert Values” will be communicated as described in the table below.   The PI, Dr. 
Lindsay Reynolds, will rev iew medical eligibility criteria as needed, as well as clinical measures 
and laboratory reports. Dr. Kristina Lewis, the Study Medical Director, will serve as the primary 
contact for staff  and participants regarding medical issues  and labs and physical mea sures meeting 
alert values . Dr. Lewis will review summaries of alerts on a periodic basis along with the AEs.

6.1  WFHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adverse events shall be 
promptly reported to the  IRB, according to institutional policy .  Reporting to the IRB is required 
regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, or whether the event involves an investigational 
or marketed drug, biologic or device.  Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but 
include psychological, ec onomic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result of 
drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a result of 
questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions with research subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to the IRB and 
other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others.  The 
 
16 
 Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible for ensuring the prompt reporting of 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others to the IRB.  The Principal 
Investigator is also responsible for ensuring that all reported unanticipated risks to subjects and 
others which they receive are reviewed to determine whet her the report represents a change in 
the risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the informed consent, 
protocol or other study -related documents are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or other s occurring at a site where the 
study has been approved by the WF HS IRB (internal events) mus t be reported to the WF HS IRB 
within 7 calendar days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
7.0 Data Reporting  
Data will be tracked and entered  by study staff on a secure server .  No data reporting is 
necessary.  
 
8.0 Statistical Considerations  
Objectives: This feasibility study, incorporating epigenetic age estimates with a nuts and EVOO 
intervention in individuals with  MetS , is an initial step in building our understanding of the 
relationship between metabolic syndrome and epigenetic age  and how epigenetic age estimates 
may be perceived by p articipants with MetS . This study will provide preliminary longi tudinal 
data examining the potential to slow epigenetic age acc eleration after a 4 -week nuts and EVOO  
intervention. This longitudinal study is designed to provide pilot information that will be used to 
design a larger study of the effects of the nuts and EVOO on epigenetic aging .   This line of work 
will be an important foundation towards translating epigenetic age prediction from a research 
concept towards a tool to meaningfully promote healthy lifestyle changes to improve 
cardiometabolic health among indi viduals at high risk for cardiovascular disease.  
8.1  Prevalence of e pigenetic age  acceleration  
Primary Outcome 1: proportion of participants with MetS with advanced epigenetic ag ing  
 
To characterize the relationship between MetS and epigenetic aging, we will examine epigenetic 
age acceleration prevalence among the 50 participants with metabolic syndrome. E pigenetic age 
acceleration will be calculated as described in 5.2 . Advanced e pigenetic age acceleration  will be 
defined as a positive epigenetic age acceleration (higher than expected based on chronological 
age).  
8.2  Assess adherence  
Primary Outcome 2: proportion of days for which EVOO was taken  
Primary Outcome 3: proportion of days for which tree nuts were taken  
Primary Outcome 4: pro portion of days for which EVOO and tree nuts were taken  
 
For adherence, we will examine the daily diaries  for intake of the two study foods , tree nuts and  
EVOO .  Adherence f or each participant will be measured as the proportion of days in 4 weeks 
for which  nuts, and of EVOO were taken, and by the proportion of days for which both were 
taken.  Problems associated with consuming the study foods will be defined as non -adherence 
(ceasing to consume either or both study foods) and low adherence (not consuming bo th foods 
 
17 
 on a daily basis).  The number of days on average each food was consumed and the overall 
completion rate of adherence diaries will be used to refine plans to both monitor and boost 
adherence in a future longer, larger trial.  
8.3  Participants’ perception of epigenetic age, challenges and motivators  
Primary outcome 5: Perception of Epigenetic Aging Assessment and Intervention Experience 
Assessment  
  
To gain preliminary data supporting the feasibility of testing epigenetic age acceler ation as a 
motivating factor for behavior change in a larger trial, participants of the intervention arm 1 
(participants educated about epigenetic age acceleration), will be given a self -administered exit 
questionnaire to qualitatively explore participants ’ perception of epigenetic age .  All participants 
will given a self -administered Intervention Experience Assessment to explore participant 
experiences in the study , and the challenges and motivators for behavior change during the 
intervention. The \ questi ons will be designed to ascertain understanding of epigenetic age, and 
assess the challenges and motivators participants encountered during the intervention. All 
participants will be asked if they can be contacted for future studies.  
8.4  Test for changes in epigenetic age  acceleration  
Secondary outcome: Changes in epigenetic age acceleration  
 
It is not clear if changes in nut and EVOO consumption can slow or reverse epigenetic age 
acceleration. As a secondary goal, we will compare change in epigenetic age acceleration  from 
the baseline visit to the intervention visit (control period) to change in epigenetic age 
acceleration from the intervention visit to the final visit  using a paired sample t -test.  
8.5 Test for changes in MetS -related traits  
Exploratory outcomes: Changes in body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, HDL 
cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, and fasting glucose levels   
 
Although longer clinical trials involving daily consumption of EVOO and nuts have observed 
improvement in MetS -related traits, it is u nclear if improvements in MetS -related traits will be 
observed after 4 -weeks. As an exploratory analysis, we will test for changes in MetS -related 
traits before vs. after the 4 -week intervention, including changes in body mass index, waist 
circumference, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, and fasting glucose levels  using a paired 
sample t -test. 
8.6 Sample size justification  
The prevalence of epigenetic age acceleration in people with metabolic syndrome  is unknown. 
Also, it is unknown if a short term nuts and EVOO  intervention will have measureable effects on 
estimates of epigenetic age. Thus, this pilot study will provide feasibility data necessary to 
estimate sample sizes for larger trails. Assuming 50 individuals and a type 1 error rate of α=0.05, 
the study has 0.80 power to detect difference of 0.4 standard deviations in the difference in 
epigenetic age and chronological age. We acknowledge that power is a limitation of the current 
study, and designed the study to maximize the sample size based on budg et constraints  to 
provide prevalence and potential effect size estimates to guide power calculations when planning 
a future larger, longer trial .

We would like to ask you some questions about epigenetic age.  Epigenetic age 
is a DNA -based measure that  predicts the  biological age  of your cells. Having an 
accelerated epigenetic age means that the  biological age of your cells may be  
more advanced than your chronological age.   
 
20. Using the scale below, indicate how much you want to know your epigenetic age:  
 
1  2  3  4  5  
Not at all   Not much   Neutral   Somewhat   Very much   
 
21. For question #1, why did you select that answer?  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
22. Before beginning this study, if you were told your epigenetic age appeared more advanced 
than your chronological age , do you think you would be more or less motivated to eat the nuts 
and olive oil everyday?  
 
1  2  3  4  5  
  Not 
motivated 
at all   Less 
motivated   Neutral   More 
motivated    Very 
motivated

 23. Before beginning this study, if you were told your epigenetic age appeared younger  than your 
chronological age , do you think you would be more or less motivated to eat the nuts and olive 
oil everyday?  
 
1  2  3  4  5  
  Not 
motivated 
at all   Less 
motivated   Neutral   More 
motivated    Very 
motivated   
 
24. If eating tree nuts and olive oil slowed biological aging, how likely would you be to continue to 
eat tree nuts and olive oil daily?  
 
1  2  3  4  5 
  Very 
unlikely   Unlikely   Neutral   Somewhat 
likely    Very likely  
 
 
25. If consuming olive oil slowed biological aging, how likely would you be to continue to consume 
olive oil daily?  
 
1  2  3  4  5 
  Very 
unlikely   Unlikely   Neutral   Somewhat 
likely    Very likely  
 
 
26. Do you feel we did a good job explaining the concept of epigenetic aging?  
 
1  2  3  4  5 
Not at all   Not much   Neutral   Somewhat   Very much  
 
 
         
27. For question #7 6, can you comment on why you selected that answer?

RESEARCH STRATEGY  
 
A. Specific Aims  
As our nation seeks a healthcare system that provides timely, equitable and patient -centered care, appropriate use of 
emergency departments (EDs) is a focus  of national attention .1–3 In a landmark report, the Institute of Medicine 
describes our emergency medical system as overburdened , fragmented, and at the breaking point .1 Despite this, over 
the last two decades EDs have increasingly served as portals for hospital admission , contributing to care fragmentation 
and ED crowding.4 Of the  1.5 million non-elective pediatric hospitalizations that occur each year,  75% originate in EDs. 
The remainder occur via direct admission, defined as admission to hospital from the community without first receiving 
care in the hospital’s ED .5 Direct admission to hospital may originate from patients’ homes or from primary care or 
specialty clinics, typically facilitated by direct conversations between referring and accepting healthcare providers. 
While ED utilization patterns have been well studied, there is a paucity of research comparing the effectiveness of direct 
and ED admissions, particularly in children .4,6,7 Direct admission may offer benefits for both patients and healthcare 
systems, including reduced ED volumes,  improved coordination between outpatient and hospital -based healthcare 
providers , and improved family experience of care . In addition, our systematic review identified several studies 
demonstrating that purposefully designed  direct admission processes are  associated with improved timeliness of clinical 
care for adults with acute myocardial infarction  (AMI).8–21 However, unstructured direct admission processes  may result 
in delays in clinical evaluation and treatment, which could adversely impact patient safety and quality of care.22,23  
The overall goal of this project is to compare the effectiveness of a standardized direct admission  approach  to admission  
beginning in the ED for hospitalized children . We will achieve this goal by addressing the following Specific Aims:  
Aim 1. Determine the effect of a pediatric direct admission  intervention on timeliness of healthcare provision, family 
experience of care, and rates of clinical deterioration compared to pediatric hospital admission beginning in the ED.  
Hypothesis 1 : Direct admission will be associated with more rapid initiation of clinical care  (our primary outcome ) and 
improved family experience of care with no significant differences in rates of clinical deterioration (as measured by rapid 
response calls and unexpected transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU)), compared with admission beginning in the ED.  
Aim 2. Identify the pediatric populations and conditions that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission 
with respect to timeliness of healthcare provision and family experiences of care. Hypothesis 2: Children with urinary 
tract infections  (UTIs) , skin and soft tissue infections  (SSTIs) , and co -morbid complex chronic illness will experience the 
greatest benefits from direct admission  with respect to timeliness of care provision and family experience of care.  
Aim 3. Applying mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing 
direct admission processes.  We will apply the RE -AIM implementation framework using mixed methods to carefully 
assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and m aintenance of the intervention, as well as multi -level 
assessment of barriers of and facilitators to implementation.24 
We will accomplish these Aims by conducting a stepped-wedge cluster rand omized control led trial (RCT) to compare the 
effectiveness of direct and ED admission at 3 structurally and geographically diverse hospitals, randomizing 70 practice  
sites in the hospitals’ catchment area to crossover to the d irect admission intervention at  4 time points , with a  
conservatively estimated sample size of 190 direct admissions and  1506 ED admissions  from these practices. This 
research will be the first prospective study to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of direct and ED admissions  for 
children , engaging diverse stakeholders to identify the populations, settings and processes most appropriate for this 
admission approach . In completing this research, we will generate knowledge of tremendous interest to both patients 
and families and their healthcare teams, enabling evidenced-informed decisions about how and when to admit childr en 
to hospital via direct admission.

 2 B. Background  
Transitions from outpatient settings into the hospital , whether via direct or ED admission,  are experienced  by almost 
every child and ad ult who requires hospital -based care . Approximately two million children are admitted to hosp itals in 
the United States each year.25 These hospitalizations are costly, incurring healthcare costs that represent 40% of all 
national pediatric healthcare expenditures.26,27 In addition, hospital admissions have major implications for patients’ and 
families’ quality of life, disrupting normal routines, resulting in time lost from work and school, and contributing to both 
financial and emotional stress.28 These stressors are disproportionately experienced by children with chronic illnesses, 
who account for more than 50% of pediatric hospital admissions each year.25 Characterizing the effectiveness  of direct 
and ED admissions will generate essential data to inform clinical decisions made by fa milies and healthcare teams .29 
While hospital discharge processes have been the focus of tremendous research, policy, and quality improvement efforts over the last decade, research determining quality of care at the tim e of hospital admission is scant .
30–32 
National programs have dedicated significant resources to improving hospital discharge processes: the Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality supported a major initiative to re -engineer discharge practices, the Centers for 
Medicaid and Medicare transfor med payment structures with a focus on hospital readmissions, and national physicians 
organizations developed a Transitions of Care Consensus Policy Statement.30,33,34 Accordingly, t he phrase “transition of 
care” is widely understood to describe the changes in setting, healthcare providers, and disease management strategies 
experienced by patients at the time of discharge. Like hospital discharge, hospital admission involves tr ansitions in sites 
of care, handoffs between healthcare providers , and changes in medical therapies . Both are associated with significant 
stress to patients and their families.29,31 As a result, hospital admissions expose patients to many of same risks that have 
been the focus of hospital discharge reform: unstructured patient handoffs, poor communication between healthcare providers, and inefficient care. However, almost no research has aimed to improv e transitions of care into the hospital .  
Direct admission accounts for 25% of all unplanned hospital admissions for children, with significant variation in rates of direct admission across hospitals and conditions .
5 In our ret rospective analysi s using nationally representative data , 
we found  that direct admission rates vary  substantially  across hospitals and conditions , with condition -specific direct 
admission rates for unplanned hospitalizations ranging from 8.9% for appendectomy to 38.0% for bipolar disorder.5 
Findings from  this quantitative analysis are  mirrored in our national survey of pediatric medical directors, with  97% of 
respond ents reporting that they accept pediatric direct admissions ; direct admission rates ranged  from <10% to >50%.35 
Despite this, only one -third  reported  having formal direct admission policies in place , while 50% reported their belief 
that more children should be admitted directly. This significant variation across hospitals and conditions  indicates clinical 
uncertainty regarding hospital admission best practices, emphasizing the value of our proposed research . 
Evidence Gaps  
Our systematic review of outcomes associated with direct admission to hospital reveals a paucity of research focused on children . In this recently completed review (manuscript currently being prepared), we identified 19 studies that 
reported outcomes associated with direct admission processes of care compared to admission through EDs.
5,8– 23,36,37 The 
vast majority of these evaluated purposefully designed direct admission systems targeting  adult patients with signs and 
symptoms of AMI. Of the 14 studies focused on this population, 13 reported timeliness of care outcomes, and 12 of the 
13 reported more rapid definitive clinical management in adults who were directly admitted compared to those 
admitted through EDs .8–21 In contrast, two studies of adult populations conducted using administrative data have raised 
concerns about increased mortality associated with direct admission. The first, by Powell and colleagues, found that adults with sepsis experienced higher mortal ity when admitted directly than when admitted through EDs.
23 The second, 
a study of unscheduled adult hospitalizations for a variety of common conditions, found that patients admitted directly had higher mortality for time-sensitive conditions such as AMI and sepsis; t hese differences were not observed among 
adults admitted less with emergent  conditions including pneumonia, asthma and cellulitis.
22                                                     
Only three studies compared the effectiveness of direct and ED admission in children, and all were retrospective cohort 
studies  using health system data . The first  study of children hospitalized with pneumonia found that children admitted

PCORI Cycle 2 2018 Broad PFA:  Research Plan Template                                                                        
 3 directly received fewer diagnostic tests and incurred significantly lower healthcare costs than children admitted through 
the ED with no significant differences in rates of ICU transfer or hospital readmission.37 The second found that direct 
admission incurred healthcare costs 5 -31% lower than ED admission.5 The third , focused on  the relative risk of 
unplanned transfers to the ICU among di rect- and ED -admitted children  at a single children’s hospital , found  no 
significant differences in rates of ICU transfer between the groups .38 Based on this syste matic review, we conclude: (i) 
studies examining the comparative effectiveness of direct and ED admission are primarily focused on adult populations 
with heart disease; it is unknown if the results of these studies will translate to other populations;  (ii) the vast majority 
of existing studies are cohort studies at high risk of bias based on application of a validate d risk of bias assessment tool; 
and (iii) s tudies in children, a PCORI priority population, are under -represent ed in the existing literature .  
Completion of our proposed research has the potential to fill existing evidence gaps . Our proposed study represents 
the first RCT  study to compare the effectiveness of direct and ED admission. Second, o ur rigorous design  will examine 
admission processes and outcomes across the diversity of settings where children are admitted to hospital: at two  
children’s hospital s and one general  hospital without pediatric subspecialty services.25 Third, w e propose a focus on 
children, a PCORI priority population that is under -represented in research. Fourth, o ur direct admission intervention, 
developed based on a process of multistakeholder engagement  with parents and both inpatient - and outpatient -based 
healthcare providers , will examine outcomes prioritized by diverse  stakeholders .39 Finally, our proposal to augment our 
RCT with qual itative analyses of barriers and facilitators of project implementation will provide important contextual 
information about factors that support and hinder effective direct admission processes.  
C. Significance  
The rapid growth of hospital medicine in the United States has contributed to our need to evaluate direct and ED 
admission processes. Historically, many pediatric patients were adm itted to hospitals by their primary care pediatricians 
(PCPs)  or specialists who continued to provide their medical care  during hospitalization  and following hospital 
discharge.40 As a result, for physicians wi th hospital admission privileges, direct admission could be as  straightforward as 
calling the pediatric ward to request a hospital bed  and provide verbal orders . Pediatric Hospital M edicine  (PHM), the 
pediatric specialty dedicated to the inpatient care of children,  is the fastest growing specialty in pediatrics ; an increasing  
number of hospitals have pediatric hospitalists in -house for up to 24 hours a day.41–43 While the consistent presence of 
hospitalists allows for around -the-clock pediatric-specific care , PHM also creates a discontinuity of care between 
outpatient and inpatient providers . As a result, direct admission requires a system to facilitate patient referrals and 
handoffs between ambulatory and inpatient settings. W ithout such direct admission systems, the majority of  hospital 
admissions will begin in EDs. Given the rapid growth of PHM , research is needed to evaluate contemporary, 
standardized  direct admission processes.  
Better understanding of the comparative effectiveness of direct and ED admission is important to parents of 
hospitalized children and to their healthcare teams.  In our formative work, we conducted interviews with parents of 
hospitalized  children at four hospitals to characterize their  experiences as 
they transitioned fr om outpatient to inpatient care and  to identify 
hospital admission processes and outcomes most important to them .29 In 
addition, we conducted a  national survey of pediatric medical directors 
regarding their  experiences with and perspectives about  direct admission 
to hospital.35 Both parents and physicians discussed potential benefits and challenges  of direct and ED admission, and 
articulated a desire for standardized admission processes  (Inset quote) . Consistent with the Institute of Medicine’s 
domains of healthcare quality, parents’ described the importance of timely, effective, safe, and patient -centered clinical 
care, and expressed variation in their experiences with direct and ED admissions in achieving these aims.29   
We will evaluate outcomes of direct interest to patients, families, and healthcare teams.  To inform our proposed 
research we conducted a series of studies  with rigorous multistakeholder engagement . As described above , we first 
conducted  interviews with parents of hospitalized children to identify outcomes most important to them.29 We   “The process needs to be standardized. We currently 
have an open policy regarding direct admissions and 
utilize them according to our judgment. It would be 
useful to have a policy regarding suitable and unsuitable 
candidates for direct admission.” (Pediatric hospitalist)

 4 subsequently conducted  deliberative discussions at three hospital s, discussing hospital admission processes and 
outcomes .39 Participants included parents, nurses, ED physicians, specialists, PCPs, pediatric hospitalists, and payers.  
Finally, we convened a panel of 9 experts representing these stakeholder groups, nominated  via national organizations. 
Using a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi approach, stakeholders prioritized processes and outcomes to evaluate hospital 
admission systems at both children’s hospitals and general hospitals.44 Our proposed study is built  directly upon this 
formative work, implementing both  processes and outcomes  prioritized by parents and other key stakeholders  ( Table 
Key stakeholders in hospital admission decision -making processes are included in our study teams and advisory 
panels to ensure that our study processes and outcomes align with diverse stakeholder needs.  Key stakeholders in the hospital admission process include children and their families and referring healthcare providers who, together, often  
recognize t he need for hospital admission. Pediatric hospitalists, ED physicians, resident physicians and nurses are key 
decision-makers influencing whether hospital admissions o ccur 
via direct or ED admission. At each of our three partner sites, we 
have therefore convened teams comprised of a senior health 
services researcher , a PHM clinical leader, and PCP and Parent 
Partner s. If funded, these Direct Admission Leadership Teams  
(DALTs) , will expand to include nurses, resident physicians (when 
applicable), complex care physicians, administrators, and practice 
managers. These site-based teams will be supported by a central 
research team and a national D irect Admission Advisory Panel 
(DAAP ) that has co ntributed to our preliminary work.39 We 
provide examples of how these results will inform clinical decisions in Table 2.  Table 1. Outco mes prioritized by key stakeholders to evaluate pediatric hospital admission processes , these will be evaluated in our proposed research .

provider  “Sometimes the good thing is you get a lot of the tests a lot faster because it is in the ER and they need to get results pre tty 
quickly to determine where they need to go from there. That is kind of a real benefit. That's why my doctor sent him to the E R 
too.” (parent)  
“I just feel like she gets better quicker because she doesn’t have to wait for so long…We go [for direct admission] and I know she 
will have an IV in her in an hour versus if we go to the emergency room it could be three to four hours before she has that I V.” 
(parent)  
“I think my biggest concern would be a child arriving on the floor and having no one see them for a period of time and having 
them get very sick before someone - either a nurse or a physician - to go in and see them. I mean I see that as the biggest 
potential risk. Making sure that if we do accept the direct admission, there is some person - some staff - free to go and assess 
that patient right away.” ( Inpatient nurse)  
Patient and family 
experience of care  
 “I had brought a copy of the x -ray with me, but they wanted their own copy.  So then they took another one…If I had my dream 
admission, the pediatrician…  would have called somebody here and said, ‘This is what I saw on the x -ray. I'm e -mailing you a 
copy of it. Pull it up on your screen. He or she would have pulled it up on the screen and said ‘Yes, I concur. Have them com e to 
Floor 7 and check in at the desk a nd we will have the room ready.’  That would have been my perfect admission. ” (parent)  
“… I’m making a generalization, but from our experience, when you’re in an ER situation people a re just more stressed out... Like 
how could you not be? ... And you might be on a stretcher with like curtains between each of you... Whereas, this is much more 
comfortable in terms of knowing like you’re coming right from a doctor’s office to a hospital room that’s ready for you, there’s a 
bed, there’s a nurse re ady to come help you with needs.  She might have other patients but she’s not running around like an ER  
nurse. ”  (parent)

Rapid response calls within

Table 2 . Clinical decisions that will be informed by completion of 
this study . 
A child is seen by their primary care pediatrician with a skin infection that has not gotten better with oral antibiotics. The pediatrician thinks the child needs hospital admission. Should the pediatrician send the child to the emergency department for 
evaluation, or will the child receive more timely, safe and/or 
patient -centered care with a direct admission?  
A pediatric hospitalist receives a call from a primary care provider 
requesting a direct admission for a child with a presumed diagnosis 
of pneumonia.  Should the pediatric hospitalist accept the child for direct admission, or should s/he recommend initial  evaluation and 
management in the ED instead?

 5 Our local and central research team structure will enable dissemination of research findings beyond peer -reviewed 
publications and national conferences . We anticipate several scholarly papers and presentations resulting from this  
work. Beyond this, members of our  central DAAP  have committed to sharing summaries of our findings with the national 
organizations that they represent ( Family Voices, the Health Care Delivery Committee of the Academic Pediatric 
Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hospital Medicine, Council o n Pediatric Subspecialties,  
and Value in Inpatient Pediatrics Network; please see the ir Letters of Support  (LOS) ). In addition, we have the 
institutional support of senior admin istrators and clinical leaders at each of our performance sit es; all have expressed a 
strong interest in receiving the results of this research to inform their clinical operations . Finally,  Paige Stein, Director of 
Communications at The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice (TDI) , has committed to assist with 
purposeful dissemination of findings via social media, press releases, and media alerts (please see her LOS ).  Our 
scientific approach, pairing a robust RCT  design with a multi -level assessment of barriers to and facilitators of 
implementation, will generate valuable data about how positive findings can be reproduced  at other healthcare 
systems nationally.   
D. Study Design or Approach  
1. Summary. We will conduct a stepped -wedge cluster randomi zed control led trial to evaluate  outcomes associated 
with a direct admission intervention at three health systems : Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh ( CHP)  in Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania, Nationwide Children’s Hospital (NCH ) in Columbus, Ohio, and Providence Regio nal Medical Center  (PRMC -
E) in Everett, W ashington. We have partnered with these health systems  given their  structural diversity, current low 
direct admission rates, and strong insti tutional support to implement and evaluate direct admission processes . A total of 
70 practices affiliated with these hospitals will be randomized to cross over from ED admission (usual care at these 
hospitals) to the direct admission intervention at 4 time point s, stratified by practice group . Given 3 practice closures 
and mergers during the first year of the project, an additional 2 practices will be randomized to participate in the second 
half of the project. Our p rimary outcome  will be timeliness of clinical care provision. Secondary outcomes include family -
reported experience of care and two measures of clinical deterioration:  unplanned transfe r to the ICU and rapid 
response calls within 6 hours of hospital admission. We will compare o utcomes in children  and adolescents  with five 
common diagnoses  from practices randomized to the direct admission intervention to those admitted from practices 
not yet eligible for the intervention, adjusting for appropriate covariates.   
2. Conceptual Framework . Direct admission to hospital has several prerequisites, including access to timely ambulatory 
care  for children with acute illnesses,  and communication between outpatient and inpatient healthcare providers  to 
initiate direct admission referrals . Our research approach reflects these prerequisites and is modified from  Donabedian’s 
structure, process, outcome framework to also incorporate  patient characteristics and family preferences  (Figure 1).45 
This framework illustrates how systems factors and processes of care may influe nce where children  access ambulatory  
care  for acute illnesses  (ED or primary care clinic)  and whether admission  occurs directly or through the ED. These 
factors, in turn, influence health outcomes. The System Factors summarized in this model, including clinic and ED factors,  were described by parents of hospitalized children as influential to their decisions about when and where they

care for their child’s acute illnesses.29 The Processes of Care factors are derived from deliberative discussions with 
stakeholders in the hospital admission process ,39 as well as our systematic review of the hospital admission literature.  
Finally, the health outcomes shown were prioritized by these same stakeholders.39 Accordingly this conceptual  
framework reflects a process of intensive stakeholder engagemen t in the development of our research question and in 
selecting our primary and secondary outcomes . From this Conceptual Framework, our Causal Model may be 
summarized as follows: We hypothesize that, by eliminating ED wait times , exposure t o the often hectic ED 
environment, and  reducing the number of healthcare teams involved in care provision, directly admitted children will 
have reduced time to clinical care and improved experiences. The relative benefits of direct admission may differ based 
on medical complexity, with complex patients , often well known to the hospital -based  healthcare teams , more likely to 
receive timely , personalized care. Primary reason for hospitalization may also influence timeliness of care provision, with 
conditions requiring minimal diagnostic testing prior to treatment initiation  (for example UTIs and SSTIs)  having the 
greatest benefit f rom direct admission.29,35  
3. Comparators . This study will involve a comparison of outcomes in children who are admitted from eligible primary 
care practices where the direct admission intervention is available (including children admitted directly and through EDs) 
to those admitted from practices not yet eligible for the intervention (hence all ED admissions).  B oth ED and direct 
admission are in current clinical use, with national statistics showing that 25% of children with unplanned 
hospitalizations are admitted via direct admission while 75% ar e admitted through EDs.5 Children who are transferred 
from another hospital (inter -hospital transfers) will be excluded, given our inability to account for types and duration of 
healthcare received at the transferring hospital. All hospitals in the US that receive reimbursement from  the Centers for 
Medicare and Medicaid Services are required  to document this variable on Universal Billing forms, and the validity  of 
this variable  has been demonstrated in two previous studies .46,47 
Intervention Core Elements . The direct  admission intervention will involve five core elements, all of which were 
prioritized by our  nationa l multi stakeholder panel in our preliminary work:39 (i) direct admission education an d tools for 
both referring healthcare providers ( PCP practices) and accepting healthcare providers (nurses, resident physicians and 
pediatric hospitalists) , including diagnoses  and populations eligible for direct admission, and patient referral methods; 
(ii) a system to facilitate direct communication between referring and accepting healthcare providers,  enabling a single 
telephone call from a referring physician to an accepting physician  (currently in place at all hospitals to facilitate 
acceptance of inter -hospital transfers) , and use of a structured data collection tool to facilitate determination of the 
appro priateness of the patient for direct admission; (iii) instructions for families regarding when/where/how to proceed 
for direct admission; (iv) rapid evaluation of clinical stability of the patient upon hospital arrival  by the inpatient 
healthcare team ; and (v) timely initiation of appropriate clinical care. These five core elements will be augmented by 
supplemental  intervention elements prioritized by our multi -stakehold er panel and detailed in Appendix A.39  
Local Adaptation and Fidelity Monitoring. All sites have agreed to implement the above-described core elements , but we

 7 recognize that resources available within each healthcare system will differ somewhat, as may the priorities, preferences 
and values expressed by key stakeholders at each project site. As a result, during the pre-rollout period each site’s  DALT 
will meet wit h the central research team to adapt the  core elements as needed while concurrently maintaining  high 
implementation fidelity. This process will be informed by the Dynamic Adaptation Process developed by Aarons et al. , 
engaging mult iple stakeholders to take into account the local context and resources .48 During  the pre-implementation 
period, each DALT will meet monthly via conf erence call with the central research team to discuss the core and 
supplemental  intervention elements within the context of local system, organization, provider, and patient 
characteristics .48 These discussions will be supported by review of local administrative data and pilot data of study 
outcomes, with tailoring of  educational materials  and tools  as appropriate . During the implementation phase, the DALT 
and central research team will meet quarterly to discuss implementation fidelity and the need for potential adaptation.  
Covariates. In addition to the above-described co mparators, we will evaluate , at baseline , patient -level characteristics 
that may be associated with portal  of hospital admission. These include: child age, gender, race/ethnicity, primary payer 
(Medicaid, commercial, other), primary reason for hospital admission (clinical condition), medical complexity , and level 
of care (observation or inpatient status) . Medical complexity will be  categorized as no concurrent chronic illness, chronic 
non-complex illness (i.e.  diabetes, asthma), 
or complex chronic disease (i.e. 
neuromuscular disease, technology 
depen dence ) by applying the validated 
Pediatric Medical Complexity Algorithm 
(PMCA).49 All variables will be extracted  
from hospitals  EHRs using standardized 
processes developed and piloted during 
the pre-rollout period. 
4. Study Design & Randomization. To 
achieve our research objectives,  primary 
and urgent care practices at each hospital 
will be randomized to cross over from ED 
admission to the direct admission 
intervention using a cluster -randomized 
stepped wedge design (SWD). The direct 
admission intervention will be sequentially deployed to 4 groups of practices as shown 
in Figure 2. This crossover will be unidirectional and occur  at 4 time points, 
with the first two blocks being six months in duration , and the second two blocks 
being nine months in duration given 
relatively slow enrollment during the 
COVID -19 pandemic. Additionally, to 
increase the number of children in the direct admission arm, we will continue to evaluate the direct admission program 
during a 9 -month maintenance block 
(months 3 7-45 ) at NCH and PRMC -E 
following the current approach to 
recruitment and enrollment . Because of Figure 2. a) Original design: Characteristics of stepped wedge cluster randomized

We will randomize 70 p rimary a nd urgent care practices : 18 at NCH, 34 at C HP, and 18 at PRMC-E  (Please s ee LO S from 
PCP practices affiliated with eac h hospital). Practices in each group will be randomized using a stratified approach, with

Justification for Study Design.  Our proposed S WD, like a ll studies o f this type, will  randomize the primary care 
practices t o a t ime p oint to receive the intervention, but analyze outcomes a t the individual le vel. Our proposed 
randomization approach is ethical, given un certainty regarding the relative timeliness and patient- centeredness of direct 
and ED a dmissions f or children.50 However, r andomization at t he level of the individual i s impractical, as consent an d 
randomization w ould n eed t o occur by h undreds o f PCPs in their office settings – a feat t hat would b e extraordina rily 
difficult to a ccomplish. Beyond t his, w e have se lected th e SW D for se veral  reasons. First, t his study design h as an 
advantage over c onventional  cluster r andomize d trials in that it allows stepwise rollout of the direct admission 
interventio n to practices, requiring fewer resources than would be needed to offer the interventio n to all clusters 
simulta neously. Relatedly, the SWD will allow the PHM services accepting direct admissions to start with a relatively low 
number o f direct a dmissions,  and to ma ke necessary organizational  and infrastructur e changes i f needed t o support o ur 
direct a dmission ev aluation d uring a l ower -volume time period. This study d esign h as an analytic a dvantage as w ell, 
allowing us to ma ke comparisons w ithin gr oups o ver t ime,  as well as between groups a t the s ame time p eriod.  Finally, 
because of the perceived benefits of direct admission and to optimize the enrollment of PCP practices, t his design i s 
advantageous to maintain control  practice engagement i n the study.50–5 2 
5. Statistical Analysis Plan  Overview. Our analytic approach addresses some key features of SWD. First, because the 
design involves unidirectional crossover from the control (ED) to the intervention arm,  our models will  include an 
indicator specific to the practice and ti me point. Second, our analyses will take into account the hierarchical structures of 
the data. Each patient contributes a single observation of each outcome; hence, the data are cross-s ectionally structured 
at the patient l evel and longitudinally structured at the clinic level with patients and clinics nested within hospitals. Third, 
our analyses will carefully evaluate secular time trends, to separate the effect of the intervention from the effect of time. 
Fourth, to identify the populations that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission, we will test several  a 
priori  hypotheses.
Data Adequacy & Management . With the exception of o ur parent -reported outcome, all require d data for this project 
will be extracted from the hospitals’ EHRs; all proposed variables exist in EHRs, thereby minimizing data collection 
burden a nd missingness a s a result o f non-respons e. Durin g the p re-im plementation period, all sites will conduct pilot 
data extraction from EHRs to assess data source adequacy; any deficiencies will be addressed prior to the rollout. 
Following data ext raction a t hospital  sites, d e-identified data will be sent via HIPAA-s ecure me thods to a secure 
Dartmouth R esearch C omputing Server, w here all d ata a nalyses w ill be conducted a nd subsequently s hared w ith s ites. 
Prior t o study rollout, a comprehensiv e Data M anagement P lan w ill be created with f eedback from study sites a nd 
stakeholders. Although w e anticipate very low rates o f missing data based o n our preliminary w ork, w e will monitor for 
and r eport m issing data a nd u se multiple imputation to p rotect a nalyses a gainst t he mi ssing -at-random assumption.53,54 
In all analyses, we will examin e the s ensitivity o f this a pproach,  and c onsider t his in our interpretation a nd c onclusions.

PCORI Cycle 2 2018 Broad PFA:  Research Plan Template                                                                        
 9 We hypothesize that our direct admission intervention  will be associated with more rapid initiation of clinical care and 
improved family experience of care with no significant differences in rates of clinical deterioration (as measured by rapid 
response calls and unexpected transfer to the ICU) . We test two variants of this hypothesis: (i) a patient -level version 
and (ii) a clinic -level version. The patient -level version is direct  in that it evaluates the aim and tests the hypothesis as 
stated. The clinic -level version is indirect in that it tests whether the intervention has a n overall effect across all patients , 
whether or not they were directly admitted.  
We will first determine crude differences in baseline clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, and in our primary 
and secondary outcomes , between children admitted directly and through EDs, using  t-tests and chi -square tests as 
appropriate. However, because these unadjusted anal yses do not adjust for observed predictors related to direct and ED 
admission , including temporal trends, for our main analys es we will use regression models. Because all patients receive 
some form of clinical care at the hospital irrespective of form of admission, there is no censoring associated with the 
measurement of time to clinical care. Therefore, standard regression models may be used. Patient characteristics 
incorporated in models will include diagnosis, medical complexity,49 level of care (observation versus inpatient), as well 
as age, gender, race/ethnicity and payer. The statistical model for our direct patient -level comparison of direct 
admission (DA) versus ED admission patients  (analysis i) is   
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽4ℎ+𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 
in which 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is the outcome variable for patient i  seen by  clinic  j at hospital h  at time t; 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is a binary variable 
indicating whether the patient was admitted via direct admission ( 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=1 ) or the ER ( 𝐷𝐷𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=0 ), 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 is a vector 
of patient -level controls  and 𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ is a random effect for clinic  within hospital. In addition, the model includes fixed-effects 
for time -period, 𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡, and hospital, 𝛽𝛽4ℎ, to capture the general unstructured trend across calendar time and hospital -
specific effects, respectively. The key coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽1, which captures the association of  a patient being 
admitted directly versus by an ED with the outcome . A crucial feature of this analysis is that the predictor of primary 
interest, DA, varies within clinic and time -period mitigating almost all forms of clustering. Therefore, although the data 
are clustered by clinic and time, the primary source of information about the association of DA with the outcome is from 
contrasts within clinic and time -period. Hence, accounting for time -period and clinic  effects  is likely to strengthen the 
statistical significance of our results . 
When estimating the model in (i), for our primary analysis we plan to only use observations from the post -period. This 
avoid s any contamination from outcomes of  ED observations when DA was not available. However, to gain some insight 
into the closeness of the results from this analysis with those that we’d expect to see if it was possible to have patient -
level randomization, in a supplemental analysis we will include the pre-intervention ED observations and test if there is a 
change in the mean  ED outcome in the post -intervention period. A result consistent with minimal change over time will 
support a finding that,  in the absence of the intervention,  the outcomes for DA patients would have been the same as 
those observed for ED patients . 
The statistical model for analysis (ii)  has a similar form : 
𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡=𝛽𝛽0+𝛽𝛽1𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽2𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽3𝑡𝑡+𝛽𝛽4ℎ+𝜃𝜃𝑖𝑖ℎ+𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 
differing only in that the direct admission indicator is replaced with 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡, a time -varying practice within hospital 
indicator of whether the intervention has been rolled-out  (1 = intervention transition has occurred by time period t and 
0 = direct admission intervention has not occurred by time-period t). The key coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽1, which captures 
the structural shift in the outcome that occurs when a practice receives the direct admission intervention. Because 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡 does not vary  within  a clinic and  time -period, the information in the observations made within a clinic and time -
period depends on the size of the effects of clinic and time-period  with the statistical significance of inferences about 𝛽𝛽1 
is likely to be reduced by the clustering of observations in clinics . An additional component of clustering arises because 
the four groups are aligned with  nine practice groups that in turn are embedded in three hospitals. We acknowledge 
that there may be separate level s of clustering in the data  due to hospital  and below that due to practice groups.

PCORI Cycle 2 2018 Broad PFA:  Research Plan Template                                                                        
 10 However, the nine practice groups emanating from the 3 hospitals will be randomly distributed across the four groups of 
the stepped- wedge design  in a manner that balances the four groups with respect to the characteristics of these groups . 
Because the practice groups  and hospitals are cross -classified with the SWD groups, their effects on the statistical 
precision of the results will be much less than under a purely hierarchical arrangement.  
Recognizing that the addition of two practices at CHP midway through the project, randomized to either Group 3 or 
Group 4, has the potential to have some unique or differential effect on our outcomes of interest, we will conduct a 
sensitivity analysis excluding these two practices. This will allow us to determine the extent to which our findings are associated with the addition of these two practices.  A substantial difference in results would be suggestive of 
heterogeneous effects of the intervention acros s the sites and our conclusions would discuss  such a finding. The 
prolongation of Steps 3 and 4 from 6 months to 9 months, and the addition of a 9 -month maintenance block (months 
37-45),  will be naturally addressed with our statistical model due to observations being at the level of the individual. 
Each observation will be coded according to the time-period the study is in at the time of the observation. The width of the intervals will not have an effect on the results of the analysis. If we have concerns a bout trends within an interval, 
we will add an additional covariate (including in the vector 𝑥𝑥
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖ℎ𝑡𝑡)  that reflects the precise date when the observation is 
made.  These analytic additions will apply to both Aim 1 and Aim 2.  
Aim 2 . Identify the pediatric populations and conditions that experience the greatest benefits from direct admission with 
respect to timeliness of healthcare provision and family experiences of care.   
To test our hypothesi s that children with UTI, skin and soft tissue infections, and 
co-morbid complex chronic illness will experience the greatest benefits from 
direct admission relative to children admitted with other clinical diagnoses,  we 
will evaluate group -level heterogeneity of treatment effects (HT E) by conducting 
subgroup analyses  as specified a priori. Although there is no prior literature about 
the relative benefits of direct admission for these subgroups, this hypothesis is derived from our deliberative discussions with multidisciplinary stakeholders, based on their lived experiences. Our anticipated sample size for subgroups is derived from national statistics about pediatric inpatient stays 
(HUCPnet.ahrq.gov) , shown in Table 3 . Although our assessment of  HTE will follow 
methodological guidance that all subgroups be specified a priori, we will consider 
other subgroup analyses based on recommendations from P arent P artners and 
hospitals’ DALTs .
55,56 Subgroup analyses will  be performed by estimating an analogous model to that for analysis (i) given 
above  for the subgroups of interest. To evaluate whether the effect of the direction admission intervention varies 
significantly across subgroups, we will augment the model  specified in Aim 1  analysis (i)  with a predictor for the product 
of the subgroup -defining variable and DA; the coefficient of the additional variable is referred to as an interaction effect 
and its value captures the extent to which the effect of DA  differs bet ween one level of the subgroup to the other. This 
approach is based on the recommendations by Kent et al., who recommend analysis and reporting of multivariate  risk-
based HTE to account for the fact that patients have multiple characteristics simultaneously that affect the l ikelihood of 
benefiting from an  intervention.56,57  
Aim 3 . Applying mixed qualitative and quantitative methods, identify barriers to and facilitators of implementing direct 
admission processes .  Table 3. Projected subgroup sample sizes

 11 To determine the impact of our direct admission intervention  and to inform post -project implementation in other health 
systems, we will conduct a mixed -methods process evaluation appl ying the RE-AIM implementation framework  to 
assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, 
implementation and m aintenance of our direct 
admission intervention.24 These domains, 
definitions, and our proposed approach are 
summarized in Table 4 . This approach 
combines analysis of our primary and 
secondary outcomes  with analysis of process 
measures and qualitative interviews with 
stakeholders . Semi-structured interviews  
focused on Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance domains ( Table 4) will be 
conducted with parents of hospitalized 
children, referring PCPs, and inpatient 
healthcare team members including nurses, 
resident phys icians, hospitalists, and other key 
stakeholders. We anticipate completing 12 -16 
in-depth interviews with stakeholders each 
calendar year, for a total of 36 -48 interviews 
per site over the 4-year implementation 
period. However, interviews will be continued 
until thematic saturation is reached.58 Interviews will be recorded with permission and transcribed verbatim, and 
analyzed iteratively (concurrent with ongoing qualitative work)  using a general inductive approach.59–61 Analysis will be 
led by Dr s. Leyenaar  and McDaniel , in partnership with Ms. Arthur (Co -investigator , Years 1 -3), Ms. Jacob -Files (Years 3 -
5), Ms. Taylor (Years 3-5)  and Ms. Stevens (Parent  partner) . Results summaries will be shared with interview 
participants, and with hospitals’ DALTs, both to  return results to participants  and to  member -check the credibility of 
findings.62,63  
6. Study Population and Setting  
Eligibility Criteria. We will limit our analysis to children < 18 years of age admitted with the following common medical 
reasons for hospitalization: gastroenteritis/dehydration, skin and soft tissue infection, UTI, pneumonia,  viral infection 
not otherwise specified, and influenza . These diagnoses comprise approximately 25% of all u nscheduled PHM 
admissions nationally, and represent conditions that have been identified as appropriate for direct admission but not 
currently accepted for direct admission at the participating hospita ls.25,39 Children with planned admissions (i.e. 
chemotherapy ), those admitted to non -PHM Services (i.e. the ICU), and those transferred from other hospitals will be 
excluded.  
Selection of Study Sites . To achieve our overall goal of implementing and evaluating a  standardized direct admission 
intervention, we aimed to select hospital sites with the following characteristics: (i) low baseline direct admission rates, 
allowing us to implement a standardized direct admission system; (ii) institutional support to increase direct admission rates using a standardized direct admission system; and (iii) interest from and capacity among pediatric primary care 
practices to refer children for direct admission when indicated. Beyond this, to optimize the external validity  of ou r 
study findings, we aimed to work with geographically and structurally diverse hospitals, including both general (non -
children’s) hospitals and children’s hospitals. Relatedly, we sought project partners that had differing relationships/levels of integration between PHM services and PCP practices (i.e. primary care practice ownership versus independence). To solicit interest from a diverse prospective sample of partner sites, we received the support of the Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS), a  research network with more than 100 participating hospitals nationally.

 12 The PRIS Executive Council, comprised of physician -researchers from 10 research institutes nationally, reviewed our 
proposed study design and approach, providing valuable methodological feedback. Following this review PRIS assisted 
with recruitment of pote ntial sites via their national listserv. Through this process, we identified our 3 partner hospitals 
as those best meeting the key characteristics described above. (Please see LOS  from PRIS Chair, Dr. Karen Wilson).  
Structure of Study Sites : CHP  has a Pediatric ED with an annual volume of  over 80,000 visits and a PHM Service that 
provides care to  > 9000 children each year. At  CHP, the ambulatory care partners will be  Pediatric Alliance ( 11 practices) , 
Kids Plus Pediatric s (3 practices) , Children’s Community Pediatrics ( 18 practices including 14  primary care and 4 urgent 
care ), and General Academic Pediatrics  (2 practices) . These practices are affiliated with  CHP as part of a regional 
Pediatric Clinical Integrated Network. Excluding General Academic Pediatrics , these practice groups  are independently 
owned and operated. NCH  has a Pediatric ED annual volume of  >90,000 visits, and a PHM Service that provides care to 
6000 children each year. At NCH,  the ambulatory care partner will be their NCH -owned Primary Care Network of 12 
clinics , and 6 NCH -owned urgent care centers. Dr. Ryan Bode, Site Principal Investigator at NCH is Division Chief in 
Hospital Medicine ; he is fully supportive of randomizing their 1 2 primary care practices for this project. Finally, PRMC-E  
is a general hospital in Everett, W ashington, where PHM services are provided by the Division of PHM at Seattle 
Children’s Hospital.  At this hospital, children seeking care in their ED are cared for in a general (non-children’s) ED by 
general (non -pediatric) emergency medicine physicians.  PRMC-E  admits approximately 650 children annually. The 
ambulatory care partners at this site include the t hree primary care groups that together account for two -thirds of 
PRMC-E’s referrals : The Everett Clinic (TEC),  comprised of 10 pediatric primary care practices; the Providence Medical 
Group (PMG), comprised of 6 pediatric primary care practices; and Community Health Clinics of Snohomish County 
(CHC), comprised of 2 pediatric primary care practices.    
7. Recruitment Plan for Prospective Studies . Each of our three hospital partners examined administrative data from the 
2017 calendar year to identify the number of children admitted to their PHM services , with an eligible diagnosis , from 
our partnering pediatric primary care practices. The resulting projected sample size is shown in Table 5 , with hospital -
specific estimates provided in Appendix  B.  Given the availability of historic data from all of our partner sites, we are 
confident in  our sample size estimate . Because our primary outcome will be derived from EHR data, which is available 
for all hospitalized children by hospital protocol and procedures, we anticipate no missing data for this timeliness outcome. This is also true of our secondary outcomes derived from EHR data, includin g ICU transfer and rapid response 
calls. However, for our parent -reported measure of family experience of care, we estimate a response rate of 75%, 
accounting for potential parental refusals, absence of parents from the bedside, and inability to complete the survey in 
English , Spanish , Somali, Nepali or Arabic. (This 
response rate aligns with past work requesting parental participation in a survey during their 
hospital stay
64,65). To collect this parent -reported 
outcome, we will approach parents/guardians 
during their child’s hospital stay, either by phone or in-person, keeping with each site’s COVID -19 
regulations. A research assistant will explain the 
study, and administer the survey via tablet or via 
personal cellphone to those parents/guardians 
who provide informed consent.  Our sample size estimate for the relative number of direct admissions is de pendent upon three 
assumptions/ components of the direct admission 
process – first, that approximately 13% of 
children who are admitted to hospital will be seen by their PCPs prior to hospital admission (an Table 5 .  Estimated Sample Size, Attrition, and Monthly Enrollment

 13 estimate derived from administrative data at NCH ); second that these PCPs will contact the hospital for direct admission 
(a component of our direct admission  intervention education);  and third, that the PHM service will deem the child 
appropriate for direct admission and have a bed available . For this third criteria, we conservatively estimate that 80% of 
children referred for direct admission from PCPs will be accepted. Based on these assumptions, we estimate that 10% of 
children cared for by these PCPs wi ll be directly admitted  following rollout  (Figure 2).  Please note that our estimate that 
13% of children who are admitted to hospital will be seen by the ir PCP is conservative; our PCP stakeholder partners 
have estimated that between 15 and 50% of their admitted patients are seen in their clinics prior to admission. For children considered for direct admission from urgent care centers, we anticipate that eligible urgent care providers will 
call to request direct admission in 80% of cases, and that 80% of th ese patients will be accepted. Our projected sample 
size of children admitted through the ED takes into account our assumption that these children may be more acutely unwell and/or clinically unstable. Correspondingly, we estimate that 70% of children who are admitted through  the ED 
at children’s hospitals with our target conditions will be eligible for inclusion, and that 95% of those who are admitted through the ED at our community hospital will be eligible for inclusion (given lower levels of acuity of c hildren admitted 
to community hospitals than children’s hospitals) . 
8. Sample Size and Power . Our projected sample s ize is shown in T able 5  and Figure 2 . Based on the conservative 
assumptions above , we anticipate that 190 children and adolescents will be directly admitte d and 1506 will be admitted 
through the ED . Of those admitted through the ED, 870 will be during post time -period s. Therefore , for analysis (i) there 
will be 190 direct admissions and 870 concurrent control ED admissions. Because the effect of all forms of clustering in 
analysis (i) of Aim 1 are minimal, we illustrate the statistical power for this analysis by using a two -group t -test. To 
inform our effect size determination, the PHM program at Lowell General Hospital (Lowell, MA), which has a well-established direct admission program, collected timeliness data from April- July 2018, applying the same eligibility 
criteria and definition proposed for this study. ED timeliness data was similarly derived from Lowell and PMRC -E. We 
found that mean time to clinical care for ED admissions was 85 min [SD 83 min], and mean time for direct admissions 
was 40 minutes [SD 28 min].  
With the  above  means and standard deviations, a two -sided 0.05 -level test that allows for unequal standard deviations 
performed in the context of analysis (i) of Aim 1 has power well in excess of 0.99. There is also substantial power for sub -
group analyses. For example, the power of a subgroup analysis that involves 10% of the sample ( applied evenly across 
clinics and time -intervals) has power of 0.98. It is only when the subgroup is as small as 5% that power falls below 0.80. 
These power  calculation s can be performed using self -calculation or a variety of software packages. In this instance, it 
was performed using Satterwaite’s approximation (i.e., evaluating a pooled variance to approximate the sampling 
distribution of the actual test -statistic by a t- distribution)  under nQuery . 
For analysis (ii) we only compute power for the effect of Post , the effect of a clinic receiving the intervention and 
entering the post period, for the analysis of the entire sample. The method of computing the power for this stepped -
wedge design (SWD) with unequal standard deviations in the prior and post time-periods  is to first determine the 
design -effect for the SWD and then compute the power for a t wo-population comparison using the effective-sample-
sizes based on the design- effect. The design-effect  is estimated  using the expression  in Woertman et al (2013) , also 
described in Hemming (2016) . Because hospital and practice group are cross -classified across the four SWD  groups, and 
because little is known about likely levels of interclass correlation coefficients (i.e., the level of clustering) for each of 
hospital, practice -group and clinic, we perform illustrative power calculations assuming that the net impact of clustering 
is equivalent to hospital-level clustering alone with an ICC of hospital of 0.05. Based on results for past c luster -
randomized studies at the clinic level, an intraclass correlation of 0.05 appears to be a conservative estimate of clustering by clinic
66,67 and so it is not unreasonable for 0.05 to still be conservative once the upper -level sources of 
cross -classified clustering are absorbed. The other inputs are 70 practices (clusters), 4 waves of intervention onset, no-
baseline period, 1 ,696 patients in total and equal numbers of patients per clinic per time-interval. Under this scenario 
the design -effect is 2.385. Therefore, the effective sample -size  (ESS)  is 711.

PCORI Cycle 2 2018 Broad PFA:  Research Plan Template                                                                        
 14 The second part of the calculation is to determine the power of a two -group comparison of a continuous outcome in the 
absence of clustering when the total sample-size is 711. Because there are 10 group-times in the post-period and 6 in 
the pre-period each with 106 observations, the spl it in the ESS between the post and the pre period is 444 and 267. The 
mean and standard deviation of the outcome in the pre-period is given by the above values for ED admissions; the mean is 85 and the standard deviation is 83. To determine the mean and standard deviation of the outcome expected in th e 
post period, we take  weighted averages  of the DA and ED admission means and standard, using the total theorem of 
probability  to compute marginal effects . The weight of DA to total patients is 19/106 = 0.094. The weighted average 
marginal mean and weighted average marginal standard deviation  of the observations in the post period are 76.93 and  
84.99, respectively . Because the sample- sizes are reasonably large, an asymptotic normal approximation is well justified 
(i.e., the true distribution of the outcome is bimodal will be averaged out). Given the ESS’s and these means and 
standard deviations, a two -sided 0.05 -level test has power of 0.23. In order to have 0.80 power, we would need a much 
larger effect -size. Specifically, the mean for the post -period would need to be approximately 66.5. Due to the small 
fraction of ED patients, this will only be plausible if there is a spillover effect of the intervention such that the outcome reduced for DA and ED patients, not just for DA patients.  
9. Outcomes . Our primary outcome , prioritized by multidisciplinary stakeholders  including parents and healthcare teams 
in our preliminary work ,
39 will be timeli ness of clinical care provision. Timeliness of clinical care  will be defined as the 
time from arrival at the hospital until initiation of clinical care by the accepting healthcare provider ( including diagnostic 
testing and/or medical management). This outcome will be derived from EHR time stamps; all project sites use EHRs to document times of patient registration, orders, administration of medications and therapies, and diagnostic tests. EHR 
time stamps have been previously validated using time motion data;
68 during the pre-implementation period we will 
similarly validate the accuracy of time stamps by conducting time motion studies at each hospital.69 The feasibility of 
collecting timeliness outcome data is supported by preliminary data from Lowell General Hospital and PRMC -E, as 
described above (see Power Calculation, effect size estimation ).  
Secondary outcomes  will include: (i)  parent-reported family expe rience of care (detailed below); (ii) unanticipated 
transfer to the ICU within 6 hours of hospital admission, a marker of clinical deterioration;38 and (iii)  rapid response calls 
within 6 hours of hospital admission, a second marker of clinical deterioration defined as  calls to the hospital’s medical-
emergency team placed by any person concerned about signs of critical clinical deterioration. Outcomes (ii) and (iii) will be extracted from the EHR; these are 
tracked routinely by PHM programs as quality markers .
70,71  Family experience of 
care  will be determined by  caregiver/ parent-report  using questions derived from 
the Child Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems 
Survey (Child HCAHPS) hospital admission module and global ratings72 and the 
Consumer Quality Index Inpatient Hospital Care admission module .73 The Child 
HCAHPS is a validated and publicl y available parent -reported measure of pediatric 
inpat ient family experience of care, available in English and Spanish . It contains 
several modules and composite measures; to evaluate hospital admission experience we will use the hospital admission module, which focuses on 
communication and medication reconciliation during the hospital admission, as 
well as the global hospital rating. We will augment the Child HCAHPS with 
questions derived from the validated Consumer Quality Index Inpatient Hospital Care admission module  (Table 6 ).
73 
These parent -reported measures will be reported on a 0 -100 scale, with high scores indicating better experiences of 
care. Six to seventy -two  hours following hospital admission (and prior to hospital discharge), parents will be approached 
by a research team member , in person or via phone,  to explain the study and request completion of the survey via tablet  
or via their personal electronic devices. This time period was selected to allow sufficient time to have passed to allow parents to reflect on their hospital admission, yet to minimize bias in their responses due to post -admission experiences. 
In our past studies we have had response rates of >75% using this approach.

 15 or telephone following hospital discharge, the Child HCAHPS had a response rate of <20%, which substantially limits the 
generalizability of findings.72 To account  for all patients , we will categorize and report reasons for non-participation , 
including refusals, absence from the bedside,  and inability to complete the survey in an available language . To facilitate 
future quality measure development, we will request all parents of children admitted directly from participating 
practices (with all diagnoses during the study period) to complete the family experience of care survey.  
 10. Engagement Plan  
Planning the Study : Broadly speaking, k ey stakeholders in the hospital admission process include: (i) children and their 
families, (ii) referring healthcare providers, (iii) healthcare teams that provide hospital-based care (including ED 
physicians, pediatric hospitalists, resident physicians, and nurses), (iv) hospital administrators, (v) practice managers, (vi) payers , and (vii) policymakers (including professional societies such as the American Academy of Pediatrics).  
Stakeholders from these groups have played an  integral role in prioritizing  components of our proposed intervention, 
and in selecting the outcomes they deemed most relevant to evaluating this intervention. In our  formative work , 
multidisciplinary stakeholders engaged in interviews, deliberative discussions  and a Delphi process  to identify the 
populations and syst ems appropriate for pediatric direct admission , and to prioritize outcomes to evaluate ho spital 
admission processes.
29,39 This preliminary work has directly informed our proposed intervention and outcomes.   
Conducting the Study : Members of the multistakeholder panel  that developed the direct admission guidelines in our 
formative work  will scaffold the proposed project  as members of our DAAP , providing feedback on quarterly  conference 
calls to guide project planning,  implementation and analysis ( Please see their LOS). Because this is a clinical int ervention 
being implemented in real- world settings, implementation at each site will be lead by a PHM Clinical Leader  (Co-
investigator) . All of our Clinical Leaders are full time pediatric hospitalists who provide  direct clinical care, actively 
engage with multidisciplinary stakeholders daily, and understand  the clinical context . His/her roles will be supported by 
site-specific DALT s comprised of parents, PCPs , and healthcare providers who will participate in monthly implementation 
meetings to make key decisions about how to adapt the intervention to the local context, data collection considerations 
to maximize participation while minimizing disruptions to clinical operations, adherence to the intervention, and 
designing and revising  monthly data reports and qualitative analys is summaries . As described above, Ms. Cathy Stevens,  
Parent Partner, will work with the research team to identify key concepts and themes  in interview transcripts .  
Disseminating the Study Results :  We aim to disseminate our results broadly, providing results that are both meaningful 
and timely . The site -specific DALTs  will, in their monthly  meetings, design and revise monthly data reports and 
qualitative analysis summaries to ensure that data presentation is useful and meaningful. Paige Stein, TDI Director of Communications has also agreed to support these dissemination efforts via social media, infographics and press 
releases. Members of the DAAP  have agreed to disseminate results through their professional networks  (see their LOS ). 
To reach pediatric hospitalists, we  will disseminate findings via a PRIS network webinar . Beyond these strategies, the 
DAAP  and DALTs  will brainstorm additional means of disseminating results to key stakeholders beyond traditional 
methods.  
11. Timeline. The timeline for rollout of our direct admission intervention is summarized in Figure 2.  During the first six-
month period, we will pursue IRB  approvals and all sites will conduct a time -motion study to validate EHR time stamps  
and EHR data extraction protocols . In addition, all sites will convene their multi- disciplinary DALTs to adapt the direct 
admission intervention and educational materials a s needed to their local context, and Clinical Leaders will conduct site  
visits with PCP practices randomized to the first group. The implementation period will span 45 months, with the final 6   
months of the funding period dedicated to analyses and results dissemination.

Study Title:   A phase Ib study of the combination of MLN0128 (Dual TORC1/2 Inhibitor) 
and MLN8237 (Aurora A inhibitor, alisertib) in patients with advanced solid tumors with 
an expansion cohort in metastatic triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC)  
Phase:   Ib 
Number of Patients:  A maximum of 6 patients can be enrolled at each dose level.  With 5 
potential dose levels and an expansion cohort of 30 patients, including TNBC, the 
maximum number of patients that can be enrolled is 56 and the minimum number is 6. 
Study Objec tives  
Primary  
• To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) 
of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in adult patients with advanced solid 
tumors. 
Secondary  
• To determine the safety profile and tolerability of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors.  
• To determine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 and alisertib in the combination. 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of MLN0128 and alisertib in serial tumor biopsies and blood samples in patients with metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors 
enrolled in the expansion cohort at the MTD. 
• To estimate the objective response rate using RECIST 1.1 and time to progression in patients with advanced solid tumors treated with MLN0128 and alisertib.  
Tertiary/Exploratory  
• To explore biomarkers predictive of response to MLN0128 and alisertib including the investigation of mechanisms of acquired resistance to treatment in patients with metastatic TNBC and other solid tumors treated in the expansion cohort at the MTD. 
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effect of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib on cellular metabolism using functional imaging with FDG -PET (5 -fluoro -
deoxy-glucose-PET) and diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI-MRI).  
Overview of Study Design:    
This is a single institution, Phase Ib study designed to evaluate the safety and toxicity of the combination of MLN0128 and alisertib in patients with advanced solid tumors with an expansion cohort in patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid 
tumors.  
The dose escalation portion of the trial with be conducted using a standard 3 + 3 dose-
escalation design in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard 
therapies or where no standard therapy exists (see Figure 1 for dose escalation

V4 25July2018 4 schema and Table 1 for planned dose levels).  Once the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is identified, the dose 
expansion portion will be conducted in patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors.  Exploratory correlative studies will 
be conducted in the expansion cohort including:  evaluation of pharmacodynamics markers in serial tumor biopsies and blood samples, exploration of predictive biomarkers using fresh and archival tissue samples, and evaluation of cellular metabolism using functional imaging.  
A total of 20 patients will be treated in the dose -expansion cohort at the MTD/RP2D (see 
Figure 2 for dose expansion cohort schema).  All patients in the expansion cohort group 1 and 2, will be required to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy prior to initiating treatment, Cycle 1 Day 7, and Cycle 2 Day 7.  In expansion cohort Group 1, single agent alisertib will be administered at the MTD on Days 1-7 and MLN0128 will be administered on Days 8-21.  In Cycle 2 and beyond, dosing with both agents will begin on Day 1.  In expansion cohort Group 2, MLN0128 will be administered at the MTD in Cycle 1 Days 1-28 and alisertib will be administered at the MTD on Days 8 -15.  An attempt will be made to obtain a repeat 
tumor biopsy at the time of progression in patients with an initial response to treatment in group 1 and 2. Objective tumor response using RECIST 1.1 will be evaluated every three cycles (approximately 9  weeks i n the dose escalation cohort and 10 weeks in the dose 
expansion cohort Group 2). 
 An additional 10 patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic 
cancer will be treated at the MTD/RP2D to further evaluate tolerability and explore efficacy in this population.

       Dose Expansion Cohort Schema for more details.  Functional imaging should be performed before the biopsy if specific tumor biopsied  
       is being followed on imaging.  See Study Procedure Manual for additional details.  
     13 For patients who undergo baseline FDG -PET/CT for evaluation of their disease, an additional optional FDG -PET/CT may be performed  
       for explorat ory correlatives only at Cycle 2 Day 7.  This scan will not be used to determine response to treatment.  Functional imaging 
       should be performed before the biopsy if specific tumor biopsied is being followed on imaging.  See Study Procedure Manual for 
       additional details.  
    14 CT of the chest and abdomen is recommended in all patients; additional scans should be obtained depending on where baseline d isease  
       was known.  MRI brain should be considered if clinical symptoms concerning for brain mets and is required in patients with previously  
       treated brain mets.  Scans must be performed within 28 days of starting study treatment.  Imaging at Cycle 4 Day 1 and beyond  may be  
       performed  within 7 days of Day 1.  Imaging should be repeated every 3 cycles beyond Cycle 4.  
     15 Single, 12 -lead ECGs will be collected predose and 2 hours (± 30 min) postdose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1.  Further

V4 25July2018 24 1.    BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
1.1    Scientific Background  
1.1.1    Metastatic Triple- Negative Breast  Cancer  
Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in women worldwide and accounts for more 
than 400,000 cancer deaths annually ( 1).  Triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined 
as breast cancer which is negative for the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  TNBC accounts for 10-15% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer (2,3), although there is a higher incidence in breast 
cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA1) mutation carriers (4) in African -American women (5).  
The molecular profiling of breast cancers has revealed that a basal -like gene expression 
signature most commonly characterizes TNBC; however, the overlap is not complete (6,7).  
Patients with TNBC are more likely to develop distant metastasis and have an increased risk of death from breast cancer compared to other breas t cancer subtypes (2,8). 
 Systemic chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for advanced or metastatic TNBC (9).  
The principle goal of chemotherapy in metast atic breast cancer is the palliation of symptoms 
related to sites of disease; however, prolongation of survival is also a goal where feasible.  Combination chemotherapy generally has higher response rates compared to the sequential administration of single  agents.   Combination chemotherapy, however, does not always 
confer a survival benefit and can produce significantly more toxicity ( 10).  First line 
chemotherapy for TNBC generally involves an anthracycline or taxane-based regimen.  A number of other chemotherapeutic agents have some degree of activity ( 11) and there are 
currently no targeted agents FDA- approved for the treatment of TNBC.  Patients with 
metastatic TNBC have a median overall survival of around 13 months and a median duration of first line therapy of just 12 weeks ( 12). 
1.1.2         MLN0128  
Millennium has developed MLN0128, which is a novel, highly selective, orally bioavailable adenosine 5’ triphosphate (ATP)-competitive inhibitor of the serine/threonine kinase referred to as the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). MLN0128 (formerly INK128)  
targets 2 dist inct mTOR  complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. 
 MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (IC
50 = 1.1 nM), inhibits 
mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular proliferation. The mTOR is a kinase that regulates cell growth, translational control, angiogenesis, and cell survival by integrating nutrient and hormonal signals. mTOR kinase plays a key role in several pathways that are requently dysregulated in human cancer ( 13).  mTORC1 is best known as a key regulator of 
protein translation through phosphorylation of 4EBP1 (the eukaryotic translation Initiation Factor 4E -binding Protein 1) and ribosomal protein S6 (known as S6) kinase. mTORC2 is 
best known for its ability to fully activate protein kinase B (AKT) by phosphorylation on the S473 site, which regulates proliferation and survival pathways ( 14). 
 
The mTORC  is an important therapeutic target that is a key intracellular point of 
convergence for a number of cellular signaling pathways. Inhibiting mTOR may inhibit

providing the rationale for mTOR inhibitors as potential agents in the treatment of a number of indications including solid tumor and hematological malignancies, as either monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Like rapamycin, several newly approved rapalogs (temsirolimus and everolimus) are specific and allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1, and only partially inhibit mTORC1 signaling pathways. They do not directly inhibit mTORC2,  which has shown to be an emerging target in cancer research. MLN0128 
was developed to address the incomplete inhibition of the mTOR pathway by rapalogs by targeting both mTORC1 and mTORC2. 
 MLN0128 is being developed for both oncology and non-oncology indications. In oncology, MLN0128 is being investigated as a treatment for advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, other molecularly targeted therapies, or antihormonal agents. Non- oncology indications  
being investigated include fibrotic and inflammatory diseases .  
 
2.    NONCLINICAL SUMMARY  
2.1 Pharmacology 
MLN0128 selectively and potently inhibits mTOR kinase (the concentration inhibiting 50% 
of enzyme activity [IC
50] is 1.1 nM), inhibits mTORC1/2 signaling, and prevents cellular 
proliferation.  MLN0128 inhibited phosphorylation of downstream modulators of mTORC1and mTORC2 in human U87 glioblastoma tumor xenograft models in mice and showed strong tumor growth inhibition (TGI) at tolerable oral (PO) doses in all 8 xenograft models tested  (see IB 
Ed8 for details).  
2.2  Safety Pharmacology 
MLN0128 has a low potential to affect the human ether-à- go-go related gene (hERG)  
potassium ion channel and did not affect cardiovascular (CV) parameters in vivo in telemeterized monkeys.  
 
2.3 Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics  
MLN0128 was rapidly absorbed after PO administration to mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys, with high oral bioavailability. [
14C]MLN0128 was rapidly and widely distributed 
throughout the body in Long- Evans rats; radioactivity was eliminated from most tissues at  
48 hours postdose. MLN0128 displayed dose-proportional plasma exposures, a moderate propensity to cross the blood-brain barrier, and was modestly bound (70.5%) to human plasma proteins. MLN0128 distributed mainly to the plasma of human blood. There was no obvious concentration-dependent red blood cell (RBC) distribution of MLN0128 in human

V4 25July2018 26 blood. 
 MLN0128 did not inhibit P-glycoprotein, but did inhibit breast cancer- resistance protein  
(BCRP), or ganic cation transporter (OCT)1 and OCT2. 
 M1, the single metabolite (monohydroxylation product) observed in human microsomal incubations, was also observed in rats and monkeys. The main isozymes responsible for phase 1 metabolism appear to be cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9, 2C19, and 3A4. MLN0128 did not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, and 3A4 activity and expression at concentrations up to 
10 µM. MLN0128 displayed low potential for inhibition and is not a time-dependent 
inhibitor of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5. 
 Oral administration of MLN0128 in humans has a low potential for metabolic and transporter- based drug -drug interactions (DDIs), especially given clinical exposures 
observed to date after administration of the highest anticipated therapeutic dose to be used in 
the clinic in oncology indications (total maximum plasma concentration [C
max] of 0.48 µ M 
[free C max of 0.14 µM] at 30 mg once weekly [QW]). 
2.4 Toxicology 
The toxicologic profiles obtained in the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant and 
non-GLP -compliant studies in rats and monkeys were generally consistent with 
pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1/2 activity. Observed toxicities were mostly consistent 
between sexes. MLN0128 repeat -dose GLP studies include completed 28- day and 
preliminary 3 -month toxicology studies in rat and monkeys, and embryo- fetal studies in rats 
and rabbits. 
 The primary dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MLN0128 in rats and monkeys were 
secondary to an exaggerated pharmacologic response and consisted of body weight loss and associated clinical observations that included hunched posture, dehydration, gastrointe stinal 
(GI) distress and decreased activity, appetite, and body temperature. In addition to the previously mentioned effects, a single monkey in the 3-month toxicology study demonstrated a DLT of skin toxicity characterized as progressive acanthosis. The highest exposures tolerated in the preliminary 3-month rat and monkey toxicology studies were 
1233 and 194 ng ⋅hr/mL, respectively.  
 
Adverse effects in rats included body weight loss, decreased activity, increased glucose and insulin levels, alterations in w hite blood cells, bone marrow and lymphoid depletion, thymic 
necrosis, oligospermia, testes degeneration/atrophy, nonglandular stomach epithelial degeneration/ulceration/hyperplasia, pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, lens fiber degeneration with cataract correlate, adrenal cortex hypertrophy, pituitary atrophy secondary to body weight loss, liver hepatocellular vacuolation, retinal dysplasia with or without optic nerve atrophy, and alveolar histiocytosis. The alveolar histiocytosis was only present in the 28-day rat study and was absent in the 3-month rat study. Both retinal dysplasia and alveolar histiocytosis are thought to be potential background findings. The pancreatic islet degeneration and fibrosis, as well as the other findings of lens fiber degeneration, pituitary atrophy, and liver vacuolation, were consistent with the mechanism of action (MOA) and

V4 25July2018 27 effects observed with other rapalogs. The microscopic findings observed in the testes, 
epididymides, and eyes in the 28-day and/or 3-month rat studies were not resolved after a 14-day recovery period, while partial to complete resolution was seen in the pancreas, adrenal gland, pituitary, liver, lungs, thymus, nonglandular stomach, and bone marrow.   The adverse effects in monkeys included hunched posture, dehydration, GI distress, and decreased activity, appetite, and body weight; increased glucose and insulin; lymphoid and bone marrow depletion; adrenal hypertrophy/hyperplasia; pancreatic and salivary gland acinar cell secretory depletion;  neutrophilic inflammation of GI tract with occasional erosion 
and ulceration, skin effects including ulceration, epidermal hyperplasia, acanthosis and hyperkeratosis; and adipose tissue depletion. Additionally, there were sporadic inflammatory findings am ong some animals that were of uncertain association to the test article. The 
findings in the pancreas, adrenal glands, and salivary glands may have been related to a stress response or reduced food consumption. The findings observed in repeat-dose monkey studies were generally reversible after a 14 -day recovery period. 
 The findings in rat and monkey repeat-dose toxicology studies with MLN0128, including bone marrow and lymphoid depletion; GI, liver, pancreas, and skin effects; and effects on glucose and insulin levels, can be monitored in clinical trials. The toxicities seen in the repeat -dose toxicology studies, such as GI effects and glucose and insulin increases, are 
consistent with the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), including mucositis and hyperglycemia, observed to date in patients receiving MLN0128.  Rat and rabbit range-finding embryo-fetal studies demonstrated teratogenic, fetotoxic, and abortive effects with MLN0128. Embryo- fetal lethality and/or teratogenic effects have been 
reported with the mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin and the rapalogs.  MLN0128 was negative for genotoxicity in an in vitro bacterial mutagenesis (Ames) assay, an in vivo rat micronucleus assay, and an in vivo rat comet assay. An in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with MLN0128 in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) was 
positive for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. However, the weight of evidence from the combined results of a negative mutagenicity assay and negative genot oxicity assessments in 2  in vivo assays in 3 tissues (bone marrow, 
liver, and duodenum) demonstrate that MLN0128 does not present a genotoxic risk. MLN0128 was negative for phototoxicity in the 3T3 fibroblast assay.  
3.    SUMMARY OF EFFECTS IN HUMANS

MLN0128 dosing regimens tested thus far include QD, QW, QD×3days per week  (once 
daily for 3  consecutive days followed by a 4-day dosing holiday every week), and 
QD×5days per week  (once daily for 5 consecutive days followed by a 2-day dosing holiday

Please note that the data described in this section (sections 3.1 and 3.2) was obtained with 
the original unmilled  MLN0128 active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); current 
manufacturing process produces milled  MLN0128 API (see section 4). 
 
3.1  Pharmacokinetics  
Overall, pharmacokinetic (PK) data from Studies INK128- 001, INK128-002, and 
INK128-003 indicate that MLN0128 exhibits fast oral absorption (time to reach C max [tmax], 
generally between 1 -4 hours after dosing); has dose- linear PK, with a mean plasma half -life 
of approximately 8 hours; and does not accumulate meaningfully in plasma when dosed as frequently as once daily (QD) and under any of 4  tested dosing regimens. The PK of 
MLN0128 was generally consistent, with no appreciable differences across the clinical studies that measured PK. Neither paclitaxel nor MLN0128 appeared to alter the PK of the other agent when co -administered.   
 
3.2  Safety  
As of the clinical data cutoff (09 December 2014), a total of 335 patients had received ≥ 1 dose of study drug across studies. A total of 18 deaths that occurred within 30 days of the last study drug dose had been reported to the clinical database as of the data cutoff; of these events, 1  (cardiac arrest; Study INK128 -001) was considered related to MLN0128 (see 
section 5.3.1.1 of the IB Ed 8)  At least 1  treatment -emergent SAE, regardless of causality, had been reported in 
125/335 patients (37%). Across the studies and regardless of causality or dosing regimen, the most common TEAEs included nausea, fatigue, hyperglycemia, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, and decreased appetite.  
  
3.2.1Study INK128-001 
Study INK128-001 is a phase 1, first- in-human, dose-escalation study of single- agent  
MLN0128 administered to patients diagnosed with advanced solid malignancies, including, but not limited to, colorectal, renal, endometrial, and urothelial tumors. Four dosing schedules are being evaluated (QD, QW, QD×3days per week , and QD×5days per week ). 
Each schedule is administered in 28 -day cycles.

V4 25July2018 29 As of 09 December 2014, a total of 194 patients had been enrolled. Median age at baseline 
was 60  years (range, 24 -89 years), most (95%) patients are white, and 54% are women. As 
of data cutoff, 42% had received ≥1 dose of MLN0128 in 2 treatment cycles, while 8% had entered 3  cycles, and 10% had enter ed 4 cycles. The highest number of cycles that had been 
initiated as of data cutoff was 46.   The maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) for the 4 schedules investigated in INK128-001 were determined to be 6 mg for QD dosing, 16 mg for QD×3days per week  dosing, 10 mg for  
QD×5days per week  dosing, and 40 mg for QW dosing. 
 
Deaths  
As of 09 December 2014, a total of 7 patients in this study had died within 30 days of their last dose of study drug as reported to the clinical database. One death was due to ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, 1  was due to pleural effusion, 1 was due to sepsis, 1 was due 
to respiratory failure, and the remainder was due to disease progression. The event of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest was the only case considered study drug -related; 
details are provided in section 5.3.1.1. of the I B Ed8. 
 
Serious Adverse Events 
As of the clinical database cutoff date, treatment -emergent SAEs had been reported for 
82 patients (42%) in this study. The most commonly reported (≥4 patients, overall) preferred terms were stomatitis in 7  patients (4%), pneumonia in 6 patients (3%), abdominal pain or 
anemia in 5, each (3%), and vomiting, asthenia, or renal failure acute in 4, each (2%).   
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
Overall, ≥1 TEAE was reported for 194 (100%) of the patients. Across the dosing groups, the most commonly reported TEAEs were nausea or hyperglycemia, which were each reported in 125 patients (64%). The second most common TEAE was vomiting (54% of patients ), followed by fatigue (51%).  
 Across all dosing groups, ≥1 TEAE of severity ≥Grade 3 had been reported for 68% of treated patients as of the clinical data cutoff date. Severity ≥Grade 3 TEAEs, regardless of causality, that were reported in ≥5% of patient s as of the data cutoff were hyperglycemia 
(14% of patients), fatigue or hypophosphatemia (8% each), asthenia (7%), anemia or stomatitis (6% each), and lymphopenia or nausea (5% of patients each).  
Events leading to study discontinuation 
Of the 194 patient s treated  in Study INK128-001 as of the clinical data cutoff, 110 (57%) 
discontinued because of disease progression, 20 (10%) withdrew consent, and 15 (8%) were lost to follow -up or discontinued for other reasons.  
 A total of 68 AEs led to study discontinuation among 35 patients (18%). Of these events, 32 (47%), including 16 nonserious AEs, were reported as severity Grade 3, and 6 SAEs were Grade 5. No Grade 4 events were reported as resulting in study discontinuation. Most (71%) events were considered stu dy drug -related and had resolved as of the data cutoff date.

3.2.2 Study INK128-002 
Study INK -002 is a completed phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of oral MLN0128 
administered as a single agent in patients with relapsed or refractory hemato logic  
malignancies (MM or non -Hodgkin lymphoma, including WM). A total of 39 patients 
received MLN0128 in 1 of 2 regimens: 26 patients received QD doses (range, 2-7 mg) and 13 patients were dosed on a QD×3days per week  schedule (range, 9 -12 mg). The MTD for 
the QD  schedule was 4 mg. The MTD for the QD×3days per week schedule was 9 mg.  
 A total of 21 of the patients (54%) in this study were male and 87% were white. The median age at baseline was 61 years (range, 46 -85 ye ars). 
 
Deaths  
Two patients died during Study INK128-002. One death was due to a subdural hemorrhage, and the other was due to disease progression. Both events were considered by the investigator to be unrelated to MLN0128.  
Serious Adverse Events 
Treatment -emergent SAEs were reported in Study INK128-002 for 11 patients (28%). No 
SAE occurred in more than 1 patient. Overall, most SAEs were considered severity Grade 2 or 3. Grade 4 SAEs were reported in 2 patients: hyperviscosity syndrome and hyponatremia were reported in 1 patient in the 2-mg QD dose group (both events resolved); and acute renal failure was reported in 1 patient in the 12 -mg QD×3days per week  dose 
group (resolved with sequelae).  
 No SAEs were considered to be related to MLN0128 treatment, with the exception of 3 events that were reported in 1 patient. This patient experienced Grade 2 pneumonia on Day 58 that resolved without sequelae on Day 60. On Day 121, the same patient experienced SAEs of pneumonia (Grade 2) and hypoxia (Grade 3). The 3 events improved by Day 125 and were resolved as of Day 142. All 3 events were considered by the investigator to be related to MLN0128.  
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
All patients in Study INK128 -002 experienced at least 1 TEAE. Overall, nausea was the  
most frequently reported preferred term (in 56% of patients), followed by fatigue (49%), hyperglycemia (38%), thrombocytopenia (36%), and diarrhea (28%).  TEAEs of severity ≥ Grade 3 were reported in 24 patients (62%); of these, 18 patients (46%) experienced ≥ Grade 3 events that were considered related to study drug. The most common

Events Leading to Study Discontinuation 
Overall, a total of 20 patients  (51%) in Study INK128-002 discontinued due to progressive 
disease, 11 patients (28%) withdrew consent, and 6 (15%) discontinued due to investigator decision or other reasons. Most events leading to study discontinuation were considered nonserious. Fatigue was reported as resulting in study discontinuation in 2 patients; all other events were reported as leading to study discontinuation in 1 patient only.   
3.2.3  Study INK128-003 
Study INK128-003 is a phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of oral MLN0128 
administered in 4 -week cycles in combination with paclitaxel in patients with advanced  
solid malignancies (lung, ovarian, endometrial, breast, pancreatic, prostate, etc). As of t he 
clinical data cutoff date, the treatment period for the primary endpoint had completed and long- term treatment for 1 patient remained ongoing.  
 In this study, 67 patients received ≥1 study drug dose under 1 of 3  dosing schedules: QW; 
QD×3days per week ; and QD×5days per week . With each regimen, paclitaxel 80  mg/m
2 was 
dosed on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle. Patients who tested positive for HER2+ received 
the combination and also received trastuzumab QW.  At total of 57% of the patients are women and 93% are white. At baseline, the median age was 60  years (range, 21 -81 years).  
 On the basis of dose escalation data, 8 mg of MLN0128 on the QD×3days per week  
schedule was selected for the dose expansion phase in patients with breast cancer. The QD×5days per week  and QW schedules were abandoned before MTDs were declared, as 
they were viewed as being less convenient relative to the QD×3days per week  schedule from 
the perspective of administering the paclitaxel and trastuzumab combination.   Overall  in the dose expansion phase, patients entered a median of 3.0 treatment cycles 
(range, 1 -19 cycles) and a mean (SD) of 5.6 (6.07) cycles. The overall median duration of 
exposure was 7.5 weeks, with a duration over 2- fold greater (11.1  weeks) in the MLN0128 
8 mg QD×3da ys per week  HER2 - treatment group relative to the MLN0128 8 mg 
QD×3days per week  HER2+ plus trastuzumab group (5.2 weeks). The median cumulative 
dose was 189.0 mg. Across treatment groups, patients received approximately 75% of their planned dose of MLN0128.  
Deaths  
As of the clinical data cutoff date, 9  patients in this study had died within 30 days of 
administration of their last dose of study drug. Of these patients, 6 died due to disease progression, 1 died due to failure to thrive, 1 died due to enlarging tumor mass causing

were reported in >1  patient in the Dose Escalation phase.  
 
Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events  
All patients treated in Study INK128 -003 reported at least 1 TEAE. The most common 
(≥10% of patients) TEAEs, regardless of causality, that we re reported as of the clinical 
database cutoff include fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea, which were reported in 67%, 60%, and 52% of patients, respectively.  Regardless of causality, TEAEs reported in 54 patients (81%) overall were assessed as severity ≥Grade 3. The most commonly reported ≥Grade 3 TEAEs included neutropenia (21% of patients), hypophosphatemia (15%), diarrhea or hyperglycemia (12% of patients each), and fatigue, hypokalemia, and vomiting (10% of patients each).   
Events Leading to Study Discontinuation 
All but 1  patient had discontinued from MLN0128 treatment in Study INK128-003 as of the 
clinical data cutoff. Reasons for discontinuation for the other 66 patients included disease progression (54%), patient decision (24%), or ≥1 TEAE (21%). Event s reported as leading 
to study discontinuation for more than 1 patient included fatigue (4  patients) and pneumonia, 
rash (erythematous or macular), failure to thrive, or vomiting (2 patients, each). A majority (52%) of the events were considered not related to MLN0128. A total of 9 events (43%) were considered serious and 12 were assessed as severity ≥Grade 3, including 3 fatal events . 
Ten events remained ongoing as of the last contact with the patients.

5.    CLINICAL SUMMARY OF SAFETY  
5.1 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use 
5.1.1  Insulin and Glucose Levels  
Hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia are known toxicities associated with inhibition of 
mTOR a nd related pathways based  on nonclinical studies. 
 A rise in fasting plasma glucose has been observed as early as 1 to 2 days following oral administration of MLN0128. Daily in-home glucose monitoring and early initiation of treatment  of the hyperglycemia are essential. For subject self -monitoring of blood glucose, 
a finding of fasting blood glucose ≥ 140 mg/dL measured by glucometer would initiate closer monitoring of serum glucose and possible intervention. Subjects with Grade 1 hype rglycemia (fasting serum glucose [FSG] > the upper limit of the normal range  
≤ 160 mg/dL) are treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (eg, metformin), and subjects with ≥ Grade 2 hyperglycemia (FSG > 160 mg/dL) are treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic  agents and/or insulin as clinically indicated. Daily home monitoring and

Confidential   
V4 25July2018 35 early treatment , have resulted in good control of glucose levels for the 
majority of MLN0128- treated subjects who developed hyperglycemia.  
 
5.1.2  Cardiac Effects  
Cardiac events (including QT interval corrected for heart rate prolongation and arrhythmias) 
have been infrequently observed in clinical studies of MLN0128. To date, there has been 
1 report of ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest postdose that had a fatal outcome and  
was assessed as related to MLN0128. Routine cardiac monitoring with baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) or multigated acquisition  (MUGA)  scan and on-study ECGs and 
physical examination constitute the core cardiac safety monitoring in all MLN0128 studies.  
 For subjects showing any signs of cardiac instability after MLN0128 dosing, additional monitoring onsite before clinic discharge should be considered.  
5.1.3  Renal Function 
Elevations in creatinine (regardless of causality) have been observed in  subjects receiving 
MLN0128, all of which have been reversible with drug interruption and/or supportive care with IV  hydration. Further evaluation of the renal insufficiency with urine electrolytes 
suggested a pre- renal etiology with a low fractional excretion of sodium < 1%. However, the 
adverse event cases were confounded by multiple factors such as nausea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, concomitant medications with GI side  effects such as metformin, and 
hydronephrosis, any of which may have also contributed to dehydration a nd elevated 
creatinine. Subjects should be encouraged to drink at least 20 ounces of fluids a day, especially on days requiring fasting (per protocol), with administration of IV fluids in the clinic as indicated to avoid dehydration.  Baseline macroscopic urinalysis and routine serum chemistries along with other safety 
laboratory assessments are performed in all MLN0128 studies. Additionally, microscopic urinalysis, a 12-hour urine collection, spot urine electrolytes, protein and creatinine, and serum  chemistry should be collected at any time when the serum creatinine is ≥ Grade 1, 
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, to further evaluate possible etiologies for the renal dysfunction.  
5.1.4  Rash  
Rash observed in clinical studies of MLN0128 tends to be maculopapular and pruritic and has ranged from Grade 1 to 3. For the most part, rash and pruritus improve with antihistamines, topical steroid creams, and/or dose interruption. Some subjects have required pulse systemic steroids, dose reduction, and/or study treatment discontinuation.

V4 25July2018 36 5.1.5  Pneumonitis  
Pneumonitis is a known potential risk of mTOR inhibitors. Early recognition, prompt 
intervention, and a conservative risk management approach are recommended due to pneumonitis that has been observed with rapalog therapy and with MLN0128 administration. Symptoms of pneumonitis will be closely monitored in all MLN0128 study subjects.  
 
5.2  Interactions With Other Medicaments and Other Forms of Interaction  
Clinical drug -drug interaction studies have not been conducted with MLN0128. At this 
time, there are no known drug interactions. In vitro data, including cytochrome P450 induction/inhibition and transporter inhibition studies conducted for MLN0128, suggest a low risk for MLN0128 to precipitate a drug-drug interaction. Although potential drug- drug 
interactions with MLN0128 cannot be ruled out based on the known metabolism characteristics of MLN0128, the potential risk is considered low.  
 
6.  ALISERTIB (MLN8237 ) 
6.1  Aurora A Kinases and the Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor Alisertib (MLN8237) 
Alisertib (International Proprietary Name, also known as MLN8237) is a selective small 
molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase that is being developed for the treatment of advanced malign ancies.  Aurora A kinase (AurA) belongs to a highly conserved family of 
serine/threonine protein kinases that also includes Aurora B and Aurora C.  AurA and Aurora B are expressed in all actively dividing cells, while Aurora C expression is largely restric ted to dividing germ cells (15,16).  AurA localizes to centrosomes and the proximal 
mitotic spindle during mitosis where it functions in a diverse set of mitotic processes.  
 The evidence supporting AurA kinase as a therapeutic target for the treatment of malignancies comes from several sources.  First, the AurA kinase gene is amplified, overexpressed, or both in many tumors, including colon, breast, pancreatic, and bladder cancers, as well as certain lymphomas, leukemias, and myeloma (16). AurA overexpression 
in human cancers has been correlated with increased aneuploidy and centrosome amplification (16,17). Second, forced overexpression of AurA kinase in experimental 
models results in the transformation of normal cells, suggesting that AurA overexpression may be oncogenic (15). Lastly, in a number of different experimental systems, AurA 
inhibition leads to mitotic delays and severe chromosome alignme nt and segregation defects, 
followed by cell death ( 18-20). Overall, the essential role of AurA in mitotic progression 
and its dysregulation in certain cancers makes it an attractive therapeutic target.   
 Given the obligatory role of mitosis in tumor proliferation, an AurA inhibitor would be expected to have potential applications across a broad range of human tumors.  Indeed, alisertib has demonstrated activity against a variety of nonclinical solid tumor and 
hematological malignancy models grown in vitro  and in vivo , as described below.  Alisertib

V4 25July2018 37 is also expected to be toxic to proliferating normal tissues, such as the bone marrow, 
gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium, and hair follicles because any cell that is in mitosis, where AurA is expressed and active, should be susceptible to the effects of an AurA kinase inhibitor.  
6.1.1  Alisertib In Vitro  Studies  
Alisertib is an ATP -competitive and reversible inhibitor of AurA kinase in vitro  with an 
inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.43 nM. The data from both enzymatic and cell- based assays 
demonstrated that alisertib is a selective and potent inhibitor of AurA kinase. Alisertib inhibited proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cell lines grown in culture. Moreover, treatme nt of tumor cell lines with alisertib induced phenotypes consistent with AurA kinase 
inhibition, including mitotic spindle defects, mitotic delay, and apoptosis ( 21-24) . For 
further details, refer to the Investigators’ Brochure (IB).   
6.1.2     Alisertib In Vivo  Studies  
Alisertib demonstrated antitumor activity when administered orally on a daily basis for approximately 21 days (maximal tumor growth inhibition [TGI] > 90%) i n several 
experimental human solid and hematologic tumor models grown as xenografts in immunocompromised mice. The maximally efficacious dose (ED) for each model varied: between 10 and 30 mg/kg if given once daily (QD) and 20 mg/kg if given twice daily (BI D). 
Studies in the HCT-116 colon tumor model showed that less frequent dosing (eg, 5 days on followed by 5 days off) was also efficacious, demonstrating that continuous dosing is not necessary for antitumor activity. A single oral dose of alisertib given t o nude mice 
bearingsubcutaneous HCT-116 human colon tumors resulted in inhibition of activated AurA kinase and an increase in mitotic cells. Therefore, mitotic index (MI) can be used as a pharmacodynamic marker of alisertib in some in vivo settings. The re lationship between 
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and efficacy was further studied in HCT-116 xenografts using oral dosing and subcutaneous osmotic mini-pumps. Both a pharmacodynamic response and efficacy (antitumor activity) were achieved using either route of administration. The data from these studies suggest that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (mitotic accumulation) and efficacy are achieved at steady state plasma concentrations of 1- µM. Moreover, the maximally efficacious oral doses of al isertib 
in the HCT-116 model (30 mg/kg QD) resulted in plasma concentrations of 1 µM for 8 to 12 hours postdose. Plasma concentrations of alisertib associated with saturating levels of pharmacodynamic and antitumor activity (1 μM) were exceeded at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of alisertib in patients (50 mg BID).  To determine whether alisertib would enhance the antitumor effects of standard of care agents in solid and hematologic malignancies, nonclinical combination studies were performed. Combinat ion therapy with alisertib and docetaxel resulted in additive or 
synergistic effects during the dosing period, with prolonged tumor growth delay in multiple solid tumor xenograft models after terminating treatment. These effects were also observed in alter native intermittent dosing schedules. In DLBCL xenograft models, combination 
therapy with alisertib and rituximab resulted in synergistic, additive, or subadditive effects

V4 25July2018 38 depending on the dose and model; however, prolonged tumor growth delays were observed 
in every case after terminating treatment, and in some cases complete cures were maintained.  
 
6.1.3    Alisertib Safety Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Drug Metabolism 
Safety pharmacology studies with alisertib did not identify significant adverse effects in nonclinical studies, including in the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular systems. No alisertib -related effects on clinical signs or physical examination findings 
indicative of impaired respiratory function (ie, labored or shallow breathing), or microscopic changes in the lungs of animals that survived until scheduled termination, were noted at tolerated doses in Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) -compliant, repeat-dose, toxicology 
studies. Alisertib exhibited minimal activity against the rapidly activating component of IKr, which is encoded by hERG (IC50 and Ki > 100 µM). Alisertib had in vitro  activity against 
the GABAAα1 benzodiazepine binding site (Ki = 290 nM).  The dose- limiting toxicities (DLTs) for alisertib in both rats and dogs after repeat d aily oral 
dosing for 2 cycles (each cycle consisted of 7 consecutive days separated by a 14 -day dose 
holiday) or for 6 cycles (each cycle consisted of 21 consecutive days of dosing separated by a 7-day dose holiday) were consistent with inhibition of AurA kinase by alisertib. Principal 
findings in toxicology studies in rats and dogs included gastrointestinal (GI) signs, panleukopenia, decreased reticulocyte counts, and increased mitotic figures and apoptosis (single -cell necrosis) in tissues with a high bas al cellular replication rate. These findings are 
indicative of toxicity to rapidly replicating cell populations and are consistent with the outcomes associated with AurA kinase inhibition. No off- target effects were seen in the 
GLP -compliant toxicology studies.Alisertib was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation 
assay (Ames assay) both in the absence and presence of Aroclor™ 1254-induced rat liver S9 fractions. In a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay, alisertib was considered to be equivocal for clastogenicity.  
 Alisertib is metabolized by multiple phase I (cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP1A2) and phase II (uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase [UGT] 1A1, 1A3, and 1A8) enzymes.  Using human liver microsomes with the appropriate cofactors, the percent contribution of CYP and UGT was calculated to be 13.1% and 86.9%, 
respectively, showing that CYP isozymes play a minor role in the metabolism of MLN8237.  MLN8237 is unlikely to inhibit the 5 major CYP enzymes, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 μM) when administered at the projected human efficacious dose.  MLN8237 is not a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP3A4/5.  Alisertib inhibited the P glycoprotein (Pgp)- mediated efflux of paclitaxel (Taxol®) in Caco 2 cells with an IC50 of 
4.0 μM.  Detailed information regarding the nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology of alisertib may be found in the IB.  
 
6.1.4 Alisertib Clinical Experience  
As of 29 March 2012, the following company-sponsored alisertib studies were in progress or completed: 6  single -agent phase 1 studies, 3 single-agent phase 2 studies, 1 single- agent 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 39 phase 1/2 study, and 3 combination studies.  Alisertib for clinical studies is being developed 
in 2 dosage formulations:  Enteric- coated -tablet (ECT) and oral solution (OS).  The dose-
escalation, phase 1 study, C14007, evaluated multiple dose levels from 10 to 60 mg BID for 7 days in repeat, 21-day cycles and 50 mg BID has been determined to be the MTD.  Alisertib is structurally related to the benzodiazepines (BZD) (eg, diazepam, lorazepam) and also has activity against the GABAAα1 BZD receptor.  BZD-like effects (eg, somnolence, confusion, memory loss) have been observed to be associated with the onset of maximal plasma concentration (eg, Tmax [time to maximum plasma concentratio n]).  CNS effects 
associated with peak plasma levels have been generally managed by administration of divided doses (eg, BID administration), although dose reductions have sometimes been required.  While CNS effects attributed to alisertib were also generally reversible and manageable by dose delay or reduction, the causal relationship, and thus optimal approach to management, were sometimes confounded by diverse causes including, but not limited to, concomitant medications (eg, narcotic analgesics, antianx iety medications), comorbidities 
(eg, infection, anemia, electrolyte abnormalities), or progressive malignancy (eg, brain metastases).  The clinical experience with alisertib includes treatment with multiple doses and schedules and is summarized in the IB.    
6.1.5  Alisertib Pharmacokinetics  
Upon oral administration to patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies, absorption of alisertib was fast, with peak plasma concentrations generally achieved by 3 hours postdose. Negligible urinary excretion of alisertib was observed in humans. The renal 
clearance of alisertib in humans was less than 0.1% of apparent oral clearance. Steady -state 
plasma exposures of alisertib increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the range of 5 to 200 mg/day in patients with advanced solid tumors. Overall mean steady state terminal half -life following multiple -dose administration in patients with 
nonhematologic malignancies was approximately 22 hours. The overall mean peak/trough ratios were 2.6 and 5.0 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. The overall mean accumulation ratios were 2.8 and 1.9 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic steady -state conditions were approximately achieved by Day 7 following daily oral 
administration. The PK properties of alisertib in patients with hematologic malignancies 
were generally consistent with those observed in patients with nonhematologic malignancies. Based on PK and genotype data in patients with nonhematologic malignancies, there was a substantial overlap in exposures (dose- normalized steady -state 
area under the plasma concentration versus time curve [AUC]) of alisertib in patients with 0, 1, or 2 copies of the UGT1A1 *28 allele, indicating the lack of readily apparent effects of UGT1A1 genotype on alisertib s ystemic exposure.  
 Clinical pharmacokinetic data available as of 20 April 2012 are summarized in the IB. Upon oral administration to patients with advanced nonhematologic malignancies, absorption of alisertib was fast, with peak plasma concentrations gener ally achieved by 2 hours post dose. 
Negligible urinary excretion of alisertib was observed in humans. The renal clearance of alisertib in humans was less than 0.1% of apparent oral clearance. Steady -state plasma 
exposures of alisertib increased in an approximately dose proportional manner over the

V4 25July2018 40 range of 5 to 200 mg/day in patients with advanced solid tumors. Overall mean steady- state 
terminal half -life following multiple -dose administration in patients with nonhematologic 
malignancies was approximately 2 2 hours. The overall mean peak/trough ratios were 2.6 
and 5.0 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. The overall mean accumulation ratios were 
2.8 and 1.9 for BID and QD dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic steady-state conditions were approximately achieved by Day 7 following daily oral administration.   Based on the results of a population PK analysis in 294 adult cancer patients, the apparent oral clearance of alisertib CL/F was unaffected by age, body weight, BSA, or the UGT1A1 genotype (number of *28 alleles). These results support the use of a common fixed starting dose of alisertib independent of UGT1A1 genotype status, age or body size in the adult patient population, in the ongoing and planned clinical trials.  The absolute bioavailability of alisertib in humans has not been determined; however, the single -dose pharmacokinetics of a prototype oral solution formulation of alisertib (25- mg 
dose) were characterized in a cross -over relative bioavailability evaluation in Study C14010 
in 15 patients with nonhematologic malignancies.  
 The effect of a standardized high -fat meal on the PK of single dose alisertib administered as 
a 50-mg strength was evaluated in 14 patients with advanced solid tumors.  The lack of an 
effect of food on alisertib AUCinf observed in this study supports the conclusion of the lack of a clinically meaningful effect of food on the PK of alisertib.  The results of this study, therefore, support a recommendation that alisertib may be dosed without regard to the timing of meals in future  clinical studies, unless otherwise specified in the clinical study 
protocol.  
6.1.6   Alisertib Potential Risks and Benefits  
Seven -hundred fourteen patients (excluding 13 patients from a company-sponsored, non- US 
IND study in Japan) have been treated with alisertib as of 29 March 2012. Clinical safety data includes experience from patients who received multiple cycles followed by treatment free periods between each cycle, and from patients who reduced or discontinued treatment. Based on the available clinical d ata, drug abuse, dependency, and drug withdrawal effects 
were not observed.   To date, the observed risks associated with alisertib treatment, as detailed in the Safety Management Attachment of the IB, include: (1) reversible myelosuppression including leukopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia; 
(2) GI toxicity including stomatitis/mucositis/oral pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, diarrhea, and dehydration; (3) sedation, somnolence, confusional state, disorientation (and associated memory loss), and gait disturbances; (4) alopecia; (5) asthenia/fatigue; (6) fever, (7) infection, (8) abnormal liver function tests (including aspartate transaminase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], bilirubi n, alkaline phosphatase 
[ALP], and gamma glutamyl transferase [GGT]), and (9) rash, which may include bullous dermatitis, and palmar -plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome.While these toxicities are 
potentially associated with risk or discomfort to the patie nt, they are anticipated to be 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 41 reversible.   To mitigate the inherent risks in clinical studies of alisertib, patients are 
evaluated frequently while they are receiving treatment.   
 Because alisertib inhibits AurA kinase, it is possible that alisertib may  interfere with cancer 
growth and cause cancer cell death. Preclinical results indicate that alisertib is not a major substrate for efflux mechanisms that have been associated with cross -resistance between 
some types of anticancer agents. Thus, alisertib h as potential through a potentially non- cross 
resistant pathway as compared to other agents the patients may have received.  The clinical utility of these effects will be investigated in current and future studies.  
 This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, applicable regulatory requirements, and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), guidelines. 
6.2  Risk of MLN0128 and Alisertib Combination Therapy 
Overlapping toxicity is not expected with the combina tion of MLN0128 and alisertib, 
however, the risk of increased toxicity with combination therapy is possible. Dose limiting adverse events observed with MLN0128 treatment include mucositis, hyperglycemia, diarrhea and fatigue.  Dose limiting adverse events observed with alisertib treatment include 
myelosuppression and CNS depression. As described in Section 10.1 and Table 1, dosing will begin below the MTD for each agent in the dose escalation cohort.  Patients will be monitored for toxicity and management g uidelines are provided to facilitate early detection 
and rapid, appropriate management of toxicity. 
7. STUDY RATIONALE  
7.1  Alisertib and MLN0128 in TNBC 
Metastatic TNBC is a biologically heterogeneous disease and the development of active 
targeted therapies in conjunction with effective biomarker selection strategies is an area of unmet clinical need (25,26 ).  AurA plays a critical role in mitosis including functions in 
chromosome alignment, spindle formation, and cytokinesis ( 27,28).  It functions as an 
oncogene through the promotion of genetic instability ( 15) and over-expression of AurA has 
been linked to inferior outcomes in patients with early stage breast cancer ( 29).  Aurora 
kinase inhibitors (AKIs) are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of TNBC based on their anti- mitotic mechanism of action and  the high mitotic index observed in TNBC. ( 30). 
 Alisertib is an orally bioavailable, second -generation selective AKI with broad 
antiproliferative and anti- tumor activity in preclinical in vitro  and in vivo  TNBC models 
(23).  Alisertib treatment resulted in a G2/M cell cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis 
in a subset of p53 wildtype and mutant sensitive TNBC cell lines ( 23). TP53 is the most 
commonly mutated gene in TNBC with an incidence of approximately 85% ( 31).  While the 
majority of mutations are missense mutations in the DNA binding domain, more complex mutations (ie frameshift and nonsense mutations) occur at a higher frequency in TNBC as 
compared to luminal breast cancers (32).  Mutations in p53 may abrogate its tumor 
suppressor function resulting in impairment of cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 42 (33).  AurA over-expression may lead to increased p53 degradation via phosphorylation of 
p53 at Ser315, leading to increased ubiquitination by MDM2 ( 34). Furthermore, silencing of 
AurA resul ts in stabilization of p53 and a characteristic G 2/M cell cycle arrest (34).    
 
Sensitivity to the pro -apoptotic activity of alisertib in TNBC is mediated by both p53 and the 
p53 family member p73.  Knock-down (KD) of either p53 or p73 using shRNA in the p53 wildtype CAL- 51 TNBC cell line led to an  increase in resistance to the antiproliferative and 
proapoptotic effects of MLN8237 ( 23). This shift to resistance was associated with an 
increase in senescence associated -β-galactosidase (SA -β-gal) activity and phenotypic 
features consistent with senescence (23). These findings support the induction of senescence 
as a mechanism for resistance to the anti -apoptotic effects of MLN8237 in cells lacking 
functional p53 or p73.    Alisertib is active against TNBC xenograft and patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models where apoptosis is observed in sensitive models as detected by cleaved caspase-3 staining (23).  Senescence and upreg ulation of genes in the PI3K/AKT/mTor pathway were 
observed in PDX models treated with alisertib to resistance.  This finding is consistent with an emerging body of literature supporting a critical role for mTOR in oncogenic and DNA-damage induced senescence (35). 
 Based on the role of mTOR in senescence and upregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTor pathway in TNBC models resistant to AKIs, we investigated the combination of alisertib and the Torc1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 in TNBC PDX models.  The combination of MLN8237 and 
MLN0128 resulted in greater TGI as compared to either agent alone (Figure 3A), accompanied by an increase in apoptosis as measured by BAX and DR5 expression (Figure 
3B) and a decreased senescence as evaluated by SA -β-gal and phenotypic changes (Figure 
3C).

V4 25July2018 43 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the combination of alisertib and MLN0128 in 
patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard treatment followed by an expansion cohort of patients with metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors with exploratory 
correlative studies  in select cohorts.  The starting dose of MLN0128 is 1 mg PO daily with 
continuous dosing.  This dose is 75% lower than the MTD of single agent milled MLN0128 
(4 mg) PO daily when administered in a continuous dosing schedule.  The starting dose of alisertib is 30 mg PO BID.  This dose is in the biologically active dose range and is 40% lower than the MTD of single agent alisertib (50 mg PO BID Days 1 -7 repeat every 21 
days).   
7.2  Correlative Studies  
Serial tumor biopsies will be performed in the Expansion Cohort Group 1 and Group 2.  Tumor tissue will be obtained prior to initiating study drug treatment, Cycle 1 Day 7, Cycle 2 Day 7 and at the time of progression in patients with an initial response t o treatment.  
Tissue samples will be processed, assayed and analyzed at the University of Colorado 
Cancer Center.  Testing will include immunohistochemistry (IHC), SA -β-gal staining, gene 
expression profiling and DNA mutation testing.  Other markers may be investigated 
depending on ongoing preclinical work.  Functional Imaging with diffusion- weighted MRI (DWI) and 5- fluoro -deoxy-glucose- PET 
(FDG -PET) will be performed at the University of Colorado Cancer Center in a subset of 
patients enrolled in Dose Expansion Groups 1 and 2 depending on the presence of tumor lesions amenable to imaging evaluation.  Oncologic imaging has evolved and now represents a  key diagnostic platform for cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to capabilities in determining tumor  size, molecular and physiologic imaging is now available 
in order to assess tumor metabolism, physiology and molecular targets non-invasively in  real time. As such, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a crucial role in assessing tumor metabolic aggr essiveness by determining uptake rates of the 18F- radioactive glucose 
analogue (FDG) which is up- regulated in TNBC and is a sensitive marker for treatment 
response to novel targeted agents. Tumor cellularity can be assessed by measuring water tissue proper ties by diffusion -weighted MRI (DWI) which is clinically used to assess tumor 
response to chemotherapy as a marker of apoptosis (36,37). These studies will be performed 
and analyzed by Natalie Serkova, PhD (Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Radiology; Director, Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute Imaging Core) and  her staff.

b. p53 and mTor pathway target gene expression (gene expression profiling and RT-PCR)  
c. Senescence- associated beta- galactosidase staining (SA -β-gal) 
d. DNA mutation testing (baseline and time of progression only, Ion Ampliseq Cancer Hotspot Panel or similar platform depending on advancement of technology at the time of analysis)  
e. Possibly other markers depending on ongoing preclinical work  
• Functional Imaging with diffusion- weighted MRI (DWI) magnetic resonance 
imaging and 5 -fluoro -deoxy-glucose- PET (FDG -PET) will be performed at the 
University of Colorado Cancer Center in a subset of patients enrolled in Dose Expansion Groups 1 and 2 depending on the presence of tumor lesions amenable to imaging evaluation.  These studies will be performed and analyzed by Natalie Serkova, PhD (Associate Professor of Anesthesiology, Pharmacology and Radiology; Director, Colorado Clinical Translational Science Institute Imaging Core) and her staff.  
10.    STUDY DESIGN  
10.1    Overview of Study Design 
This is a Phase Ib open-label, single institution, dose- escalation study designed to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 administered by mouth (PO) in combination with alisertib administered PO to patients with advanced solid tumors and previously treated metastatic TNBC  and other solid tumors in an expansion cohort.  The 
initial schedule of MLN0128 administration will be on ce daily with continuous dosing.  If 
this schedule is not tolerable in combination with alisertib, other schedules may be considered including once weekly dosing or other interrupted schedules.  The initial schedule of alisertib administration will be twic e daily for 7 days of a 21 day cycle.  If this 
schedule is not tolerable in combination with MLN0128 then other interrupted dosing schedules may be considered.   The dose escalation portion of the trial wi ll be conducted using a standard 3 + 3 dose-
escalat ion design in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapies or 
where no standard therapy exists (see also Figure 1, Table 1  and Section 10.2). Once the

V4 25July2018 46 maximum tolerated dose (MTD) / recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is identified, the dose 
expansion portion will be conducted in patients with previously treated metastatic TNBC and other solid tumors.  Exploratory correlative studies will be conducted in the expansion cohort including:  evaluation of pharmacodynamics markers in serial tumor biopsies and blood samples, exploration of predictive biomarkers using fresh and archival tissue samples, and evaluation of cellular metabolism using functional imaging.   A total of 30 patients will be treated in the dose -expansion cohort at the MT D/RP2D (see 
Figure 2 for dose expansion cohort schema).  All patients in the expansion cohort group 1 and 2, will be required to undergo fresh tumor biopsy prior to initiating treatment, Cycle 1 Day 7, and Cycle 2 Day 7.  In expansion cohort Group 1, singl e agent alisertib will be 
administered at the MTD on Days 1-7 and MLN0128 will be administered on Days 8-21.  In Cycle 2 and beyond, dosing with both agents will begin on Day 1.  In expansion cohort Group 2, MLN0128 will be administered at the MTD in Cycle 1 Days 1 -28 and alisertib will 
be administered at the MTD on Days 8- 15.  An attempt will be made to obtain a repeat 
tumor biopsy at the time of progression in patients with an initial response to treatment in group 1 and 2.

1.  MLN0128 will be administered orally once daily with continuous dosing.  A single dose of MLN0128 will 
be administered on Cycle 1 between Day  -7 to Day -3.  Continuous dosing in Cycle 1 during the Dose 
Escalation Cohort will begin on Cycle 1 Day 2.  
2.  Alisertib will be administered orally twice daily days 1 -7 of each 21 day cycle.  A single dose of alisertib 
will be administered on Cycle 1 Day  1 and BID dosing will be initiated on Cycle 1 Day 2.  
 
Based on an efficacy signal observed in a patient with metastatic pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma, an expansion cohort of 10 patients with previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be treated at the MTD/RP2D.  
All patients will be followed carefully for adverse events during the study period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of MLN0128 or alisertib or until initiation of another cancer treatment.  Additionally , patients with unresolved adverse events or abnormal laboratory 
values related to MLN0128 or alisertib may be contacted by telephone for follow-up of these events.  Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), version 4.03.  Blood samples will be taken before and at predetermined times after a single dose of MLN0128 on Cycle 1 Day -7 to Day -3, after a single dose of alisertib on Cycle 1 Day 1, and after

Confidential   
V4 25July2018 47 combination treatment on Cycle 1 Day 7 and Day 1 of subsequent cycles to determine the 
PK properties of MLN0128 and alisertib. 
Disease status will be assessed using RECIST 1.1.  Patients will undergo tumor assessments at screening, at the end of Cycle 3 and every three cycles thereafter, or as clinically indicated.  Tumor status will be categorized as a complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease per RECIST 1.1.  An objective response will be considered confirmed once the same assessment is  made by repeat evaluation > 4 weeks after the initial 
documentation, per RECIST 1.1. 
Protocol treatment will be discontinued in patients who experience disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or who are not compliant with the study protocol.  Treatme nt with 
MLN0128 or alisertib alone may be continued if the other agent is discontinued for unacceptable toxicity related to only one study agent.  A study completion visit will be performed within 30 days after the last dose of protocol treatment in all pa tients.  
In addition to the protocol, the Investigator should refer to the associated Investigator’s Brochure, the Study Procedures Manual, and the appendices of this clinical study protocol for further information regarding this investigational product or details of the procedures to be followed during the course of this study. 
10.2 Dose Escalation Cohort 
The starting dose for MLN0128 is 1 mg (milled formulation) PO once daily with con tinuous 
dosing.  This dose is 75% lower than the MTD of MLN0128 in the Ph1b/2 study C31001 which is 4 mg (milled formulation).  The starting dose of alisertib is 30 mg PO BID Days 1 -
7 repeat every 21 days.  This dose is 40% lower than the MTD of alisertib (50 mg) for this dosing schedule.  During Cycle 1 in the Dose Escalation Cohort only, a single dose of MLN0128 will be administered on Cycle 1 between Day -7 to -3 to allow for single agent MLN0128 PK analysis.  Continuous dosing with MLN0128 will begin Cycle 1 Day 2.  A single dose of alisertib will be administered on Cycle 1 Day  1 to allow for single agent 
alisertib PK analysis and BID dosing with alisertib will begin on Cycle 1 Day 2.   
 
DLTs will be assessed during the DLT assessment window of up to 28 days following the first dose of MLN0128 (Cycle 1 Day -7 to Cycle 1 Day 21).  Patients who withdraw from the study prior to completing the DLT assessment window for any reason other than a DLT will be replaced.  In addition, patients who miss a total of > 3 days of scheduled dosing for 
MLN0128 or alisertib during the DLT assessment window for reasons other than a DLT will be replaced.  See Section 12.2 for DLT definition. 
 After dosing has been completed in each cohort, data pertaining to dose- escalation decisions 
for MLN0128 and alisertib will be reviewed by the Sponsor Investigat or, Clinical Trial 
Manager and at least 2 other Phase I Oncologists (co -investigators). Available adverse event 
data, laboratory assessments, ECGs, dose administration logs and PK parameters (when available) will be used to determine whether dose escalatio n should continue and, if so, at 
what dose level and schedule (see Table 1).  The dose escalation schema may be altered if toxicity is observed related to one agent which would favor escalation of the other agent.

COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023

V4 25July2018 48  
Dose escalation will procede in accordance with the following rules (see Figure 1): 
• A minimum of 3 patients will be treated in each cohort.  
• If 0 patients experience a DLT in a cohort, dose escalation will proceed. 
• If 1 of the first 3 patients in a cohort experiences a DLT then 3 additional patients will be enrolled in that cohort. 
• If less than 1/3 of the evaluable patients in a cohort experience a DLT then escalation 
will proceed  
• If 1/3 or more evaluable patients in a cohort experience a DLT, then the MTD has 
been exceeded and the precedi ng dose level will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients 
(If 6 patients have not already been evaluated at that level).  Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated at the discretion of the Sponsor Investigator after discussion with the study team.  
• If the MTD is exceeded in the first dosing cohort, lower doses or alternate schedules 
of MLN0128 or alisertib will be evaluated as guided by observed toxicities. 
• If the MTD is exceeded at a given dose level then the next highest dose at which less than 1/3 of at leas t 6 evaluable patients experiences a DLT will be declared the 
MTD.  
• If fewer than 1/3 of at least 6 evaluable patients experiences a DLT at the highest planned dose level then this dose level will be declared the RP2D.

Procedure Manual.  
10.4 N umber of Patient s 
The total number of patients enrolled in the Dose Escalation Cohort will depend on the number of dose cohorts required to identify the MTD.  Escalation to the next dose cohort will depend on the probability of DLT at a given dose.  When 1 of 3 patients develops a DLT and the cohort is expanded to 6 patients, the proposed plan for dose escalation provides a 91% probability that dose escalation will proceed at doses associated with DLT probability of < 10%.  A maximum of 6 patients can be enrolled at each dose level.  With 6  potential dose levels 
and an Expansion Cohort of 30 patients, the maximum number of pat ients that can be 
enrolled is 56 and the minimum number is 6.  Patients will be considered enrolled on the first day of MLN0128 or a lisertib study drug treatment.  
10.5    Duration of Study  
Patients will continue to receive treatment with MLN0128 and alisertib until they experience disease progression or have an unacceptable drug- related toxicity.  There is no maximum 
duration of treatment.  The study will be terminated 6 months after the last patient completes the End-of- Treatment (EOT) study visit.

All protocol-specific criteria for administration of MLN0128 and alisertib must be met and 
documented before drug administration. Study drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator or identified subinvestiga tor(s).  
 MLN0128 will be administered orally on an empty stomach once daily . Patients should be 
instructed to refrain from eating and drinking (except for water and prescribed medications) for 2  hours before and 1 hour after each dose.  Alisertib will be administered orally twice 
daily for 7 days of a 21 day dosing schedule.  The doses of MLN0128 and alisertib will be determined as outlined in Sections 10.1 and 10.2.  On days when MLN0128 and alisertib are both administered, the first dose of alisertib should be administered in the morning with the MLN0128 dose.  The second dose of alisertib should be administered approximately 12 hours later with or without food. 
 
Patients should be instructed to take their study medication at approximately the same time on each scheduled dosing day and not to take more than the prescribed dose at any time. Patients should swallow the study medication whole and not chew it, open it, or manipulate it in any way before swallowing. If a patient does not take their MLN0128 or alisertib  dose 
within the time frame specifie d (+/- 8h for MLN0128 or +/- 4 hours for alisertib), then the 
dose should be skipped and considered a missed dose. Patients should record any missed

prescribed dosage. Under no circumstance should a patient repeat a dose or double-up doses. 
12.2 Definitions of Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
Dose limiting toxicities  are defined according to the AE profile observed during the first 
28 days of study drug administration in the dose escalation portion of the study and as 
described below. All AEs should be considered possibly related to the study drug unless such relationship can be definitively excluded.   Toxicity will be evaluated according t o NCI CTCAE Version 4.03 . A DLT will be defined 
as any of the following events that are considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to treatment with MLN0128 or alisertib: 
 
• Grade 3 or higher nonhem atologic toxicity, despite adequate treatment, except for the 
following: 
1. Grade 3 hyperglycemia lasting ≤ 72 hours (all  patients should receive optimal 
antiglycemic treatment, including insulin, as clinically indicated).  
2. Grade 3 rash that resolves to  ≤ Grad e 1 within  3 days (all patients should receive 
topical steroid treatment, oral antihistamines, and oral steroids, if necessary).  
3. Inadequately treated Grade 3 nausea and/or vomiting and Grade 3 diarrhea (all patients should receive optimal antiemetic and/or  antidiarrheal prophylaxis and/or 
treatment).  
4. Grade 3 nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea lasting < 72 hours despite maximal 
supportive therapy. 
• Grade 4 neutropenia lasting > 7 days in the absence of growth factor support. 
• Grade 3 neutropenia of any duration accompanied by fever ≥ 38.5°C and/or systemic 
infection. 
• Thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding.  
• Any other ≥ Grade 4 hematologic toxicity.  
• Inability to administer at least 75% of planned doses of MLN0128 or alisertib  within 
Cycle  1, due to study drug- related toxicity.  
• Any clinically significant occurrence that the investigator and sponsor agree would place patients at an undue safety risk.  
Patients who experience an AE that meets the definition of a DLT during or after compl eting 
Cycle  1 should have their study drug treatment interrupted. If the event resolves to Grade 1 
or baseline values within  2 weeks of interrupting planned therapy, and in the opinion of the 
invest igator  the benefits of continuing treatment outweigh the r isks posed by the toxicity, 
patients may continue study treatment with MLN0128  and alisertib with  dose reduction of 
the agent responsible for toxicity.

V4 25July2018 58 12.3  MLN0128 Dose modification Guidelines  
MLN0128 should be administered in continuous cycles, which should continue unless the 
patient has a Grade 3 or greater MLN0128 -related event. Guidelines for dose interruption and for dose reduction are as follows:
 
 
Criteria for Dose Interruption and Dose Modification During a Cycle  
Administration of MLN0128 should be withheld for MLN0128 treatment -related toxicities 
that are Grade 3 or higher, despite supportive treatment per standard clinical practice.  The following nonhematologic toxicities attributed to MLN0128 would not require dose interruption:  
• Grade 3 or high er nausea and/or emesis in the absence of optimal anti -emetic 
prophylaxis. (Optimal anti- emetic prophylaxis is defined as an anti -emetic regimen that 
employs both a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid given in standard doses and 
according to standard sch edules.) 
• Grade 3 or higher diarrhea that occurs in the absence of optimal supportive therapy.  
 If the event resolves to Grade 1 or baseline values within 2 weeks of interrupting treatment, the patient may resume study treatment at a dose reduced by 1 level (see Table 1). Two dose 
reductions of MLN0128 will be allowed according to Table 1.  If further dose reduction is required from 1 mg PO daily, then the dosing schedule can be modified to 5 days of treatment followed by 2 days rest without dosing.  Dosing interruptions/delays of up to 14 days will be allowed for recovery from toxicities or inter -current illness. Longer 
interruptions can be considered if the patient is benef iting from therapy with 
MLN0128.Guidance for the management of common toxicities observed with MLN0128 hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, oral mucositis, rash, nausea/vomiting, and non-infectious pneumonitis are outlined in Section 12.8.

12.4  Alisertib Dose Modifications Guidelines   
Treatment with alisertib will be repeated every 21 days.  In order for a new cycle of therapy 
to begin, the patient must meet the following criteria: 
• ANC mus t be  ≥ 1,500/mm3 
• Platelet count must be ≥ 75,000/mm3.   
• In addition, all toxicities considered by the investigator to be related to therapy with alisertib must have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or to the patient’s baseline values before a new cycle of therapy may begin.  
If the patient fails to meet the above -cited criteria for retreatment, then initiation of the next 
cycle of therapy should be delayed for up to 1 week.  At the end of that week, the patient 
should be re- evaluated to determine whether the criteria for retreatment have been met.  
Should treatment need to be delayed for more than 1 week (ie, a rest period of more than 21 days) because of incomplete recovery from treatment -related toxicity, the dose of alisertib 
should be reduced by one dose level (Table 1) when therapy resumes.  A second dose reduction may occur should treatment need to be delayed for more than 1 week because of incomplete recovery from treatment -related toxicity on the reduced dosage of alisertib.  If 
further dose reduction is required from 20 mg PO BID, then the dosing schedule can be modified to 3 days of treatment followed by 4 days rest without dosing.  Only 2 dose reductions of alisertib will be allowed according to Table 1. Dosing interuptions/delays of up to 14 days will be al lowed for recovery from toxicities or inter -current illness.  Longer 
interuptions can be considered if the patient is benefiting from therapy with alisertib.  
Growth factor support is permitted at the treating Investigator’s discretion following delay or neutropenic fever, but should not be used prophylactically during Cycle 1. 
12.4.1  Dose Modifications for Hematological Toxicity 
If a patient experiences any of the following hematological toxicities during the dosing 
period, dosing with alisertib will be discon tinued for the remainder of that cycle and the 
dose will be decreased 1 level for all subsequent cycles of treatment.  
• Grade 4 neutropenia (ANC <  500 cells/mm3) lasting more than 7 consecutive days 
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 25,000/µL) lasting more than 7 consecutive days 
• Platelet count less than 10,000/µL at any time  
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023

V4 25July2018 60 • Grade 3 neutropenia with fever or infection, or both, where fever is defined as an 
oral temperature greater than 38.5 °C 
• Any thrombocytopenia with clinically significant bleeding  
12.4.2    Dose Modifications for Non-Hematological Toxicities 
If a patient experiences any of the following toxicities that are at least possibly related to 
alisertib during the dosing period, dosing will be discontinued for the remainder of that cycle 
and the dose will be decreased 1 level for all subsequent cycles of treatment, and treatment 
may resume after drug -related toxicities have resolved to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline. 
• Any Grade 3 nonhematological toxicity that is considered by the investigator to be related to alisertib other than: 
o Grade 3 or greater nausea or emesis, or both, that occurs in the absence of optimal antiemetic therapy (5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 [5- HT3] 
serotonin receptor antagonist); 
o Grade 3 or greater diarrhea that occurs in the absence of opt imal 
supportive therapy with loperamide or a comparable anti- diarrheal;  
• Grade 2 non- hematological toxicities that are considered by the investigator to be 
related to study drug and in the opinion of the investigator require dose reduction. 
In general, study drug treatment should be discontinued if a patient experiences a Grade 4 
toxicity.  If, in the opinion of the investigator and study sponsor it is in the patient’s interest 
to continue therapy with alisertib, then after recovery from the toxicity or toxi cities in 
question to ≤ Grade 1 or to baseline values, the dose of alisertib should be reduced by at 
least 1 dose level with subsequent cycles of therapy.  
When a dose reduction of alisertib is required, no re- escalation of dose will be permitted.  If 
a pat ient requires more than 2 dose reductions, therapy with alisertib will be discontinued.

for treatment of MLN0128 related AE, ie, rash.  
• Anti-epileptic drugs for subjects with treated brain metastasis  
• Concomitant administration of any PPI is not permitted during the study. Pa tients 
receiving PPI therapy before enrollment must stop using the PPI for 7 days before their first dose of study drugs. Examples of PPIs include omeprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazole. 
• Consumption of grapefruit or grapefrui t juice is not permitted during the study. Patients 
should not consume food or beverages containing the fruit or juice of grapefruits or Seville oranges within 7 days before the first dose of study drug and throughout the study (See  Appendix 4).   
• Histamine -2 (H2) receptor antagonists are not permitted within 12 hours before and 
within 6 hours after MLN0128 or alisertib administration.  Patients receiving histamine H2 receptor antagonists before enrollment must stop using these medications for at least 24 hours before their first dose of study drug. Examples of histamine H2 receptor antagonists include ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and cimetidine. 
• Neutralizing antacids and calcium preparations are not permitted within 2 hours before and 2 hours after MLN0128 or alisertib administration. Some anti-gas preparations may also have antacid properties, and should also not be permitted from 2 hours before until 2 hours after MLN0128 or alisertib administration. 
 
12.6  Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures  
Prophylactic use of anti-emetic, antinausea, and antidiarrheal medications is encouraged, 
and these may be administered before the first dose and subsequent doses of study drug, as needed throughout the study, and as clinically indicated per standard pr actice. When 
selecting an anti -emetic agent, drugs that do not have an effect on the QT interval, such as 
palonosetron, are preferred.  Histamine H2 receptor antagonists may be allowed, if needed provided that the histamine H2 receptor antagonist is not taken within 12 hours before and within 6 hours after study drug administration. Patients receiving histamine H2 receptor antagonists before enrollment must stop using these medications for at least 24 hours before their first dose of study drug. Examples of  histamine H2 receptor antagonists include ranitidine, famotidine, nizatidine,

Strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducers and/or inhibitors and moderate inhibitors of 
CYP2C9 should only be administered with caution, at the discretion of the investigator ( see 
Appendix 4):  
CYP3A, 2C9, and 2C19 inducers: rifampin, rifapentine, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, St. John’s Wort, bosentan, nafcillin, modafinil.  
CYP3A, 2C9, and 2C19 inhibitors: ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, boceprevir, telaprevir, fluconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, troleandomycin, erythromycin, nefazodone, mibefradil, coniva ptan, diltiazem, 
verapamil, dronedarone, aprepitant, casopitant, tofisopam, ciprofloxacin, amiodarone, fluvoxamine, and ticlopidine.  Other medications considered necessary for the safety and wellbeing of the patient may be administered at the discretion of the investigator. 
 
Medications with potential CNS effects are not prohibited in this study, but it is 
recommended that their use be minimized to avoid confusion in the interpretation of CNS effects should they occur during the course of treatment with a lisertib.  Because of alisertib’s 
structural and pharmacological similarity to the benzodiazepines, concomitant therapy with benzodiazepines is discouraged but not prohibited. 
Treatment with myeloid growth factors is permitted at the treating Investigator’ s discretion 
following delay or neutropenic fever, but should not be used prophylactically during Cycle 
1. 
12.7 Precautions and Restrictions  
Patients who show evidence of hyperglycemia during the study should be encouraged to 
follow a low carbohydrate diet.  
Patients should not drive, operate dangerous tools or machinery, or engage in any other 
potentially hazardous activity that requires full alertness and coordination if they experience sedation while enrolled in this study. 
Patients are to be instructed to limit the use of alcohol while enrolled in this study.  Patients 
should consume no more than 1 standard unit of alcohol per day during the study and for 
30 days from the last dose of alisertib.  A standard unit of alcohol is defined as a 12 oz beer (350 mL), 1.5 oz (45 mL) of 80-proof alcohol, or one 6-oz (175 mL) glass of wine. 
It is not known what effects MLN0128 or alisertib  have on human pregnancy or

contraception from the time of signing of the informed consent form (ICF) through 90 days after the last dose of study drug, OR 
• Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods] and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.) 
Men, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of the following: 
• Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 
through 120 days after the last dose of study drug, OR 
• Agree to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. (Periodic abstinence [eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods for the fe male partner] and withdrawal are not acceptable 
methods of contraception.) 
• Agree not to donate sperm during the course of this study or 120 days after receiving their last dose of study drug. 
 
12.8  Management of Clinical Events Related to MLN0128 and Alisertib  
12.8.1 Management of Hyperglycemia 
In addition to obtaining fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels at clinic visits, all subjects will 
be given a glucometer to monitor their daily pre-dose fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels at home.  Subjects will be instructed to notify the study staff immediately with any abnormal readings (ie, ≥ 150 mg/dL) for further instructions on the management of their hyperglycemia.  Hyperglycemia observed during home glucose monitoring should be confirmed in the clinic.  Investigators will be responsible for reviewing the home glucose monitoring logs for hyperglycemia.  If no irregularities in the fasting blood glucose level are observed during a minimum of 6 consecutive months, then the frequency of in-home fasting glucose testing  may be reduced to twice weekly if the investigator approves.  Subjects will 
continue to notify the investigator of fasting blood glucose levels that exceed 150 mg/dL and, if blood glucose levels are not well-controlled, or if the subject requires either oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin to control blood glucose levels, then the frequency of in-home testing of fasting blood glucose levels will be reinstated to daily. 
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 64 In the event that any FSG reading performed at the site indicates hyperglycemia (> upper 
limit of normal [ULN] or ≥ 110 mg/dL), the study staff should first ascertain that the subject was fasting at the time of the blood draw (ie, nothing by mouth for at least 8 hours prior to blood being obtained), had continued to take their concomitant anti glycemic medications 
should the subject have underlying diabetes mellitus, and repeat the FSG as needed.  If the repeat FSG continues to demonstrate hyperglycemia, investigators should initiate steps to aggressively manage the hyperglycemia per standard cl inical practice.  The following 
guidelines are provided to aid the investigator in initiating antiglycemic therapies.  
Based on the clinical experience from MLN0128 trials, most episodes of hyperglycemia observed have been Grade 1 or 2 that have responded quickly to oral metformin.  Hyperglycemia has not been dose- limiting since instituting a standard regimen for early 
treatment of hyperglycemia.  All subjects developing hyperglycemia on the study should have their glucose closely monitored by study staff.  The investigator may choose either to continue close monitoring of subjects who develop Grade 1 hyperglycemia (FSG  > ULN  ≤ 160 mg/dL) or, alternatively, consider initiating treatment with an oral 
hypoglycemic agent, such as metformin.  All subjects with Gr ade ≥ 2 hyperglycemia 
(FSG  > 160 mg/dL) must be treated aggressively with oral hypoglycemic agents and/or 
insulin as clinically indicated while continuing on MLN0128.  The investigator should consult an endocrinologist if needed to aid in optimizing the subject’s hyperglycemia treatment plan.  
It is recommended that subjects be treated initially with a fast acting, insulin sensitizer, such as metformin at 500 mg PO QD, and titrate up to a maximum of 1000 mg PO BID as needed.  Concurrent addition to metformin of DPP -4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin or 
vildagliptin) and/or insulin should also be considered.  Oral sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide or glyburide) should be used with caution due to the higher risk of inducing hypoglycemia in subjects.  The dose of oral hypoglycemic agents should be adjusted in subjects with renal insufficiency. In addition, patients should also  be encouraged to follow a low carbohydrate 
diet once hyperglycemia is first observed.  
 Guidance on study drug dose modification for patients with hyperglycemia is provided in the following table

12.9  Management of Clinical Events Related to alisertib 
12.9.1  Management of Central Nervous System Effects 
If a patient experiences excessive sedation believed to be related to alisertib, treatment with 
alisertib should be interrupted.  Patients whose sedation is not considered immediately life-threatening should be carefully monitored and given appropriate supportive care. 
If the patient’s level of consciousness is considered to be life- threatening, necessary 
measures should be instituted to secure the airway, ventilation, and intravenous access.  
Flumazenil (Romazic on
®) is a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that is intended 
as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, the proper management of benzodiazepine overdose.  Although there is neither preclinical nor clinical experience with flumazenil and alisertib, the use of flumazenil should be considered if the level of alisertib- associated sedation is 
considered to be life-threatening.  Patients treated with flumazenil should be monitored for resedation, respiratory depression, and other residual benzodiazepine effects for an appropriate period after treatment.  Continued monitoring is particularly important in the

13.    STATISTICAL AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES  
13.1    Statistical Methods  
Primary Objective:   
The MTD will be defined as the highest dose level evaluated in which 0 or 1 patient out of 6 
patients experiences DLT.  
Secondary Objectives:  
1. Safety:  Adverse events will be tabulated by type and grade.  
2. Pharmacokinetics:  The AUC and Cmax will be determined for MLN0128 and MLN8237.  The distribution of these parameters for MLN0128 when administered with MLN8237 and for MLN8237 when administered with MLN0128 will be compared to the appropriate single agent administration control data.  
3. Translational Endpoints:  All analyses with respect to the translational component of this study are intended to be hypothesis- generating and descriptive in manner.  Biologic 
correlates will be obtained from tumor biopsies as outlined above.  Baseline levels of these markers will be correlated with clinical outcome (i.e. response, time to progression, and adverse events) using regression methods (Cox model for tie to event, logistic reg ression for 
binary outcome, Poisson regression for counts).  Additionally, the dynamic change in markers will be assessed from baseline to Cycle 1 Day 7 and Cycle 2 Day 7 in both Expansion Cohort Groups using repeated measures/mixed models analysis.  For t he 
functional imaging performed in select patients in the Dose Expansion Groups, FDG- PET 
images will be analyzed with AsiProVM and mean change in SUV will be compared to baseline.  For DCE -MRI analysis, the AUC for the gadolinium versus time curve and the 
initial AUC will be calculated using the trapezoidal rule in Microsoft Excel.  Data will be

COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 76 fitted to a two -compartment model to estimate K trans and K ep which will be compared to 
baseline.  
4. Efficacy:  Analysis of efficacy measures will be descriptive.  The best overall 
response will be summarized using the number and percent of patients in each tumor 
response category along with the two-sided exact binomial 95% confidence intervals. Time to progression will be defined as the time from the first day of treatment to the first observation of disease progression.  If a patient dies without documentation of disease progression, the patient will be considered to have had tumor progression at the time of their death unless there is sufficient documented evidence to conclude no progression occurred 
prior to death.  The distribution of disease- free survival will be estimated using the method 
of Kaplan and Meier.  The median time and its 95% confidence interval will be reported.  
13.1.1     Determination of Sample Size  
The total number of patients enrolled in the Dose Escalation Cohort will depend on the 
number of dose cohorts required to identify the MTD. 
Design considerations were not made 
with regard to explicit power and  type I  error considerations, but to obtain prelim inary safety , PK, 
and efficacy information  in this patient population.  Escalation to the next dose cohort will 
depend on the probability of DLT at a given dose.  When 1 of 3 patients develops a DLT and the cohort is expanded to 6 patients, the proposed plan for dose escalation provides a 91% probability that dose escalation will proceed at doses associated with DLT probability of < 10%.
 
 A maximum of 6 patients can be enrolled at each dose level.  With 6  potential dose levels 
and an Expansion Cohort of 30 patients with TNBC, the maximum number of patients that can be enrolled is 56 and the minimum number is 6.  The total planned enrollment in the expansion study is up to approximately 30 patients in  
three cohort groups. This sample size will provide a reasonable chance (> 75%) of   
observing at least one or more adverse events when the true frequency of the adverse  event is between 10%−15% at the given dose level. Specifically, for a given adverse event   
with a true rate of 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1%, the probability of observing at least one such  adverse event in the combined cohort of 20 patients is 99%, 86%, 64%, or 18%, respectively In addition, assessment of the response rate in 20 patients will exclude with 95% confidence,  a true response rate of 15% or higher if no response is observed. 
13.1.2    Randomization and Stratification   
Randomization and stratification will not be used in this trial.  
13.1.3    Populations for Analysis 
Safety, PK and efficacy   analysis  will be based on patient data collected through study 
discontinuation. The analyses will all be based on all patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug.

Missing values will not be estimated or imputed given the small sample size. All available   
data will be  included in data listings.  Repeated measures analyses of dynamic changes in   
biomarkers will use maximum likelihood methods which are  robust to data being missing at 
random.   
 Sensi tivity analyses will be used to assess impact on spurious observations on statistical 
summaries.  
 
13.1.5    Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline data will be summarized by dose level.  No formal statistical analysis will be performed  on these data.  
13.1.6   Efficacy Analysis 
Best overall response rate will be computed with an exact 95% Binomial confidence interval for each tumor response category.  Progression free survival will also be analyzed using Kaplan Meier methods including 95% conf idence interval for median PFS.  
 Efficacy will be performed using all the patients who received at least one cycle of study drug 
or were withdrawn during cycle 1 for progression.  
 
13.1.7    Pharmacokinetics   
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from the blood PK samples and will be 
analyzed using descriptive statistics, including the median, mean and 95% confidence 
intervals around parameter estimates by dose level and time point . PK analyses will be 
conducted on all patients that received at least one do se of the drug and provide at least one 
post- treatment sample.  
 
13.1.8    Safety Analysis 
The safety evaluation will be based on all patients that received at least one dose of the drug and will include AEs, SAEs, and changes from baseline in laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and physical examinations. Summaries will be provided overall and by does group. The number and percentage of subjects reporting treatment- emergent AEs  (TEAE)  will be 
summarized overall and by the worst CTCAE grade, with a breakdown by dose . Similarly, the number and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs considered related to each study drug will be summarized.

V4 25July2018 78 14. ADVERSE EVENTS    
14.1    Definitions  
14.1.1    Adverse Event Definition  
Adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product; the untoward medical occurrence does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product.  This includes any newly occurring event, or a previous condition that has increased in sever ity or frequency since the administration of 
study drug. 
An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the inves tigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline.    
14.1.2    Serious Adverse Event Definition  
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life-threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
(see clarification  in the paragraph below on planned hospitalizations). 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . (Disability is defined 
as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is a medically important event .  This refers to an AE that may not result in death, 
be immediately life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, or involves suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent.   Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (eg, prion protein transmitting Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.   
MLN0128/alisertib   
COMIRB 15 -1135 
Takeda Protocol X31023  
Confidential   
V4 25July2018 79 Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered 
severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous.  The general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 headache).  This is NOT the same as serious , which is based on 
patient/event outcome or action criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or ability to function.  A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to  be considered serious.  For example, a white blood cell count of 
1000/mm
3 to less than 2000 is considered Grade 3 (severe) but may not be considered 
serious.  Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
14.2    Procedures for Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Events  may be spontaneously identified  by the patient and/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures.  Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an AE.  When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event.   
Adverse Events which are serious must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or 
designee) from the time of consent up to and including 30 days after administration of the 
last dost of MLN0128 or alisertib . Any SAE that occurs at any time after completion of 
MLN0128 treatment or after the designated follow -up period that the sponsor-investigator 
and/or sub-investigator considers to be related to any study drug must be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee).  Planned hospital admissions or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before the patient was enrolled in the trial are not to be considered AEs unless the condition deteriorated in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery was performed earlier or later than planned).  All SAEs should be monitored until they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness(es). 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the sponsor-investigator Jennifer R. Diamond, 
MD, also referred to as the sponsor-investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse 
events (SA Es) to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor- investigator’s EC or IRB.   
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs must also be reported in English to 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance or designee: 
• Fatal and Life Threatening SAEs: within 24 hours of the sponsor-investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event 
• All other serious (non -fatal/non life threatening) events: within 4 calendar days 
of the sponsor-investigator’s observation or awareness of the event  
The Sponsor will send all SAE reports to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) 
within  24 hours but no later than 4 calendar days as per any agreements.  
The SAE report must include at minimum:  
• Event term(s)

• Intensity of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investiga tor’s 
determination.   Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will 
be determined by using the NCI CTCAE version specified in the protocol, as a 
guideline, whenever possible.  The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html. 
• Causality of the event(s): Sponsor-investigator’s or sub-investigator’s 
determination of the relationship of the event(s) to MLN0128 and alisertib administration.  
Follow-up information on the SAE may be requested by Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) .   
In the event that this is a multisite study, the sponsor -investigator is responsible to ensure 
that the SAE reports are sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance (or designee) from all sites participating in the study.  Sub -investigators must report all SAEs to  the sponsor-
investigator so that the sponsor-investigator can meet his/her foregoing reporting obligations to the required regulatory agencies and to Millennium Pharmacovigilance, unless otherwise agreed between the sponsor-investigator and sub- investigat or(s).   
Relationship to all study drugs for each SAE will be determined by the investigator or sub -
investigator by responding yes or no to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is associated with the study drug(s)?

15.    ADMINISTRATIVE REQUI REMENTS  
15.1   Product Complaints    
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a drug product.  Individuals who identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact Millennium (see below) and report the event.  Whenever possible, the associated product should be maintained in accordance with the label instructions pending furt her guidance from a 
Millennium Quality representative.  
For Product Complaints,  call  
1-844- ONC -TKDA (1/844 -662-8532)  
email: GlobalOncologyMedinfo@takeda.com 
 
Product complaints in and of themselves are not AEs.  If a product complaint results in an 
SAE, an SAE form should be completed and sent to Millennium Pharmacovigilance  (refer to 
Section 12.2).   
16.  DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
The Sponsor Investigator will be responsible for monitoring the trial per the trial monitoring plan, in addition to overseeing the safety and efficacy of the trial, executing the DSM plan, and complying with all reporting requirements to local and federal authorities. This oversight will be accomplished through additional oversight from the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) at the University of Colorado Cancer Center (CU Cancer Center).  The DSMC is responsible for ensuring data quality and patient safety for all clinical studie s at the CU Cancer Center.   A summary of the DSMC’s activities is as 
follows: 
• Conduct of internal audits  
• Ongoing review of all serious adverse events (SAEs), unanticipated problems (UAPs) and reportable adverse events (AEs)  
• Has the authority to close and/ or suspend trials for safety or trial conduct issues

Confidential   
V4 25July2018 82 • May submit recommendations for corrective actions to the CU Cancer Center’s 
Executive Committee  
 
Per the CU Cancer Center Institutional DSM Plan, SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are reported to the DSMC, IRB and the sponsor per protocol.  All SAEs, UAPs and reportable AEs are to be reported to the DSMC within 5 business days of receiving notification of the occurrence.  
 Each subject’s treatment outcomes will be discussed by the Investigators and Clinical Research Coordinators (CRCs) at weekly disease -oriented working group meetings.  Data 
regarding number of subjects, significant toxicities, dose modifications, and treatment responses will be discussed and documented in the meeting’s minutes.  The Sponsor Investigator will provide a DSM report to the CU Cancer Center DSMC on a six month basis. The DSM report will include a protocol summary; current enrollment numbers; summary of toxicity data to include specific SAEs, UAPs and AEs; any dose modifications; all protocol deviations; and protocol amendments. The DSM report to the DSMC will also include, if applicable, the results of any efficacy data analysis conducted, as well as any internal DSMB reports. Results and recommendations from the review of this six m onth report by the DSMC will then need to be submitted by the site to the IRB of 
record at the time of continuing review.

Note that these lists are not exhaustive.    
(a) The effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration- , dose -, and preparation -
dependent.  Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain 
preparation was used (eg, high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another 
preparation was used (eg, low dose, single strength).  
(b) Withdrawn from the United States market because of safety reasons.

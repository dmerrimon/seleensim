Version 3.0  3. Introduction  
This is a Prospective, Interventional, Single Center, comparative product study to collect CO 2 
measurements on human subjects as a function of the carbon dioxi de (CO 2) cannula sampling filterline 
(CCSF) during simulated patient activity to provide guidance on filterline selection in the clinical setting 
for Microstream™  enabled monitors.  
This document provides a detailed description of the statistical methods an d procedures to be 
implemented during the analysis of the study.   
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) is based on the CIP version 2.0 dated on 30MAY2018 .   
4. Study Objectives  
4.1. Primary Objective(s)  
The primary objective of this clinical study is to compare the performance of the Medtronic 
Microstream™ FilterLine™ compared to the non -Medtronic CCSF products during predefined expected 
patient activities to provide a quality sample of breath gas to the Microstream™ enabled capnography 
monitor.  
The prima ry endpoints will be the frequency and duration of false physiological alarms, device 
notifications regarding a reduction in CO 2 Waveform device messages/notifications such as filterline 
blockage, performing auto zero, clearing the filterline and CO 2 error . 
4.2. Secondary Objective(s)  
The secondary objective is to score the performance of the non -Microstream™ CCSFs compared to the  
Medtronic (MDT) Microstream™ FilterLine™. The endpoints will be the foundation to score  sampling 
performance per activity by subject and in aggregate.  
The need to score performance by the scripted simulated patient activities will provide information on  
optimal filterline selection based upon end use clinical setting and expected patient activity.  
5. Investigation Plan  
Prospective,  interventional, single center, comparative product study design on a convenience sample of  
out-of-hospital volunteers.   
There is no blinding or randomization to subject procedure. Intervention assignments (CCSF sequence) 
for each subject will be  based upo n a randomized sequence by subject ID . Subjects will serve as their 
own control within each  of the repeated scripted activity periods ( such as variations on mouth positions,

Version 3.0  partial and full unilateral nasal  obstruction, nasal/oral respiration shifting pat tern, variations in 
respiratory effort and rate, variations of  head position, variations of body position) in the study design.   
6. Determination of Sample Size  
Up to 50 consented subjects at one clinical site in USA to secure a minimum of 30 evaluable  subjec t data 
sets.  Based upon a previous study on cannula design investigating both CO 2 sampling and O 2 delivery 
(Ebert & Novalija, 2015), a sample size of 30 will provide more than 90% power to test a normalized 
effect size of 5 or more using the Tukey -Kramer m ultiple comparison test at the 0.05 significance level.  
7. Statistical Methods  
7.1. Study Subjects  
7.1.1.  Disposition of Subjects  
Subject disposition (e.g., number completing the study) will be summarized with frequency tables.  
7.1.2.  Clinical Investigation Plan (CIP) Deviation s 
Deviations are instance(s) of failure to follow, intentionally or unintentionally, the requirements of the  
CIP. All deviations must be documented and explained, regardless of the reason for the deviation.  
7.1.3.  Analysis Sets  
Subjects will be considered enrolled in the study once it has been confirmed that they meet all the 
inclusion and none of exclusion criteria. Unless otherwise specified, analysis of reported outcomes will 
include all available data for all subjects enrolled.  
7.2. General Method ology  
In general, descriptive statistics will be used to summarize baseline and study outcomes. For continuous 
variables, number of available observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum 
values will be provided. For categorical varia bles, frequency and percentage will be used. Unless 
otherwise specified, statistical assessments will be based on 2 -sided tests at an alpha level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) for  Windows (vers ion 9.2 
or higher, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC) or other widely accepted statistical or graphical software.  
The study objectives will be based on all evaluable data from this study. The primary objective will be 
evaluated using the Tukey - Kramer honest sig nificant difference test for multiple mean comparisons.  All 
corresponding P values and confidence intervals for pairwise mean differences will be Tukey corrected 
as appropriate. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis will be used to generate measures of 
central tendency and to perform data distribution diagnostics.

Version 3.0  Analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare across multiple groups . Moreover, multivariate 
regression models will be used to explore the relationship between EtCO 2 and supplemental O 2 flow rate 
after adjusting for factors including cannula type, subject activity and O 2 flow rate.  
7.3. Center Pooling  
N/A 
7.4. Handling of Missing , Unused, and Spurious  Data and 
Dropouts  
Electronic device data will be compared to subject CRF to verify the match in CCSF code name and time 
for activity effect on the device measured data. A subject will be withdrawn from the final data pool if 
there is missing electronic device data for that subject.  
7.5. Adjustments for Multiple Comparisons  
For Tukey - Kramer honest significant difference test , all corresponding P values and confidence intervals 
for pairwise mean differences  will be Tukey corrected as appropriate. Multivariate regression models 
will be used to explore the relationship between EtCO2 and su pplemental O2 flow rate after adjusting 
for factors including cannula type, subject activity and O2 flow rate.  
7.6. Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic information and baseline characteristics data will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  
7.7. Treatment Characteristics  
N/A.  
7.8. Interim Analyses  
An early  evaluation  of the device data will be conducted after the first 5-10 subjects enrolled. This 
evaluation  may result in a reduction in the CRF scripted activities for the remaining subjects  in order to 
remove those activities that would need more than a total of 30 subjects to detect a statistically 
significant difference in EtCO 2 means as a function of the CCSF for each activity period. This adaptive 
filtering of the CRF activities purpose is to reduce enrollment time down to activities that may be 
identified as a potentially statistically significant difference in the sample size and not include those 
activities that would require a n unnecessarily large sample size for significance.  
7.9. Evaluat ion of Objectives  
The study hypothesis is that the Medtronic (MDT) solution of pairing the Microstream™ FilterLine to the 
Microstream™ enabled device provides a more reliable gas sample for measurement across many of the

Version 3.0  patient simulated scripted activiti es. Performance reliability of each CCSF for sampling breath gas will be 
measured using the mean and standard deviation for EtCO 2, the frequency of false physiological alarms, 
the frequency of CS35 device notifications, and the frequency of missing CO 2 data (drop -outs) as a 
function of both the CCSF variable and activity variable by subject and in aggregate.  
This hypothesis is based upon the CS35 IFU that recommends that Microstream® EtCO 2 consumables 
(FilterLine) should be used to ensure the monitor functions properly.  
The statistical design is a randomized CCSF sequence assignment with each subject serving as their own 
control within each scripted activity period with the up to study desi gn of 8 CO2 sampling cannula 
filterline designs worn in each separate activity period. The randomized sequence by subject is by CCSF 
code name letters from A – F with the CCSF product assignment to the code name letters done by 
Clinimark and blinded to MDT  until after the device data has been evaluated.  
7.10.  Safety Evaluation  
Adverse events for all enrolled subjects will be collected and reported. Summary of overall event, events 
relatedness, seriousness and severity will be provided. To assess safety, the numb er and percentage of 
subjects with adverse events will be summarized by severity. And the total number of events will be 
provided as well.  
7.11.  Health Outcomes Analyses  
N/A 
7.12.  Changes to Planned Analysis  
Any deviations from the original statistical plan will be justified and documented appropriately.  
 
8. Validation Requirements  
Primary and secondary objectives  will be validated by level I validation and the rest of the tables, listings 
and figures will be validated by level II validation.  
 
Level I: The peer revi ewer independently programs output and then compares the output with that 
generated by the original Statistical Programmer.  
 
Level II: The peer reviewer reviews the code; where appropriate, performs manual calculations or simple 
programming checks to veri fy the output.

1.1 Syno psis
Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Randomized, Active -Controlled, Double -Blind Clinical Study to 
Evaluate a Switch to Doravirine/Islatravir (DOR/ISL) Once -Daily in Participants With HIV -
1 Virologically Suppressed on Bictegravir/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide 
(BIC/FTC/TAF)
Short Title: DOR/ISL Blinded Label Switch
Acronym: Not applicable
MK-8591A (hereafter referred to as DOR/ISL) is a novel 2- drug FDC of DOR and ISL.
Hypotheses, Objectives ,and Endpoints :
Hypotheses are aligned with objectives in the Objectives and Endpoints table.
The following objectives will be evaluated in participants ≥ 18 years of age with HIV -1 who 
have been virologica lly suppressed for ≥3 months on BIC/FTC/TAF .
Primary Objectives Primary Endpoints
-To evaluate the antiretroviral activity 
following switch to DOR/ISL compared to 
continued treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF as 
assessed by the percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at 
Week 48.
Hypothesis (H1): DOR/ISL is non- inferior to 
BIC/FTC/TAF as measured by the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA 
≥50 copies/mL at Week 48. A margin of 
4percentage points is used to define non-
infer iority.
If non -inferiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL at Week 48 and superiority of 
HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 96 are 
met:
Hypothesis (H2): DOR/ISL is superior to 
BIC/FTC/TAF as measured by the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA 
≥50 copies/mL a t Week 48.-HIV-1 RNA

percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA 
≥50 copies/mL at Week 96. A margin of 
4percentage points is used to define non-
inferiority.
Ifnon-inferiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL at Week 48 is met:
Hypothesis (H4): DOR/ISL is superior to 
BIC/FTC/TAF as measured by the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA 
≥50 copies/mL at Week 96.-HIV-1 RNA
-To evaluate the antiretroviral activity
following switch to DOR/ISL compared to 
continued treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF as 
assessed by the percentage of participants 
with the following at Week 48, Week 96 and 
Week 144: 
-  HIV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL
-  HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL-HIV-1 RNA
-To eval uate the immunologic effect of 
switch to DOR/ISL compared to continued 
treatment with BIC/FTC/TAF as measured 
by change from baseline in CD4+ T- cell 
count at Week 48, Week 96, and Week 144-CD4+ T- cell count

resistance to any study intervention in 
participants who switch to DOR/ISL and 
participants who continue treatment with 
BIC/FTC/TAF.-Viral resistance -associated substitutions
-To evaluate the effect of switch to 
DOR/ISL compared to continued treat ment 
with BIC/FTC/TAF on weight, as measured 
by the mean change from baseline to Week 
48, Week 96, and Week 144.
Hypothesis (H5): DOR/ISL is superior to 
BIC/FTC/TAF as measured by lower mean 
increase from baseline in body weight at 
Week 48.
Hypothesis (H6) : DOR/ISL is superior to 
BIC/FTC/TAF as measured by lower mean 
increase from baseline in body weight at 
Week 96.-Weight

2 INTRODUCTION
DOR/ISL (also known as MK-8591A or MK-8591 /DOR) is a novel 2 -drug FDC of DOR ( a 
recently approved NNRTI) and ISL (a first -in-class investigational NRTTI ).DOR /ISL is
being developed for QDtreatment of HIV -1 infection in adults and adolescents .
2.1 Study Rationale
As treatment regimens have improved, HIV -1 infection has become a chronic, manageable 
condition, and those receiving effective ART regimen s can expect t o live near -normal 
lifespans [Trickey, A., et al 2017] . With anticipation of long -term treatment, long -term 
tolerability and safety of antiretrovirals have become increasingly important considerations .
The current standard- of-care for the treatment of HIV -1 is a combination of 2 NRTIs with a 
third agent ( eg, InSTI, NNRTI, or PI) [AIDS info 2017] [European AIDS Clinical Society 
2016] [World Health Organization 2016] . Although such regimens have become increasingly 
well tolerated and highly efficacious, the current paradigm of lifelong daily treatment is 
associated with a need for simpler andsafer regimens, with reduced long -term drug 
exposure. Furthermore, as the population living with HIV ages, there is increasing concern 
for the risks of long -term toxicity andDDIs with r espect tocomorbid conditions (ie ,
neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular).
There is accumulating evidence that simplified 2-drug regimens can achieve efficacy 
comparable to that of 3-drug regimens , better tolerability ,and improve quality of life, which 
can help to sustain virologic suppression [Llibre, J. M., et al 2018] [Cahn, P., et al 2019] 
[Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents 2018] .Theviability of 2-
drug regimens depends on both components having distinct mechanisms of action with at 
least 1 of the components having a relatively high barrier to resistance.
DOR/ISL has the potential to be an agent for the treatment of HIV- 1 infection in the s witch 
setting due to its potent antiretroviral activity (including activity against common NRTI -and 
NNRTI -resistant variants ) by multiple mechanisms of action , lack of food requirements, and 
favorab letolerability and DDI profile sobserved to date.
2.2 Background
Refer to the IB s/approved labeling for detailed background information on DOR and ISL.
2.2.1 Islatravir
ISLis the first member of a new class of antiretroviral agents, known as NRTTIs, that block 
HIV-1 reverse transcriptase by novel mechanisms of action. Itis an inactive nucleoside 
analogue that is converted to the pharmacologic ially-active triphosphate (ISL -TP)form via 
endogenous intracellular kinases. It acts through multiple mechanisms, including immediate 
chain termination by blocking translocation and delayed chain termination by preventing 
nucleotide excision [Michailidis E 2014] .

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 018-06 
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
ISLis differentiated from other HIV -1 antiretrovirals byits high potency, long half -life, and 
favorable drug resistance profile. At the proposed dose of 0.75 mgQD, ISL achieves higher 
steady- state IQs(the ratio of drug exposure t o viral susceptibility [Ctrough/IC 50]) against 
wild-type HIV -1 than any NRTI currently approved for treatment. It also exhibits potent 
activity against the most prevalent NRTI resistance mutations, including M184V.
2.2.2 Doravirine
DOR ,a potent NNRTI with demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability ,wasfirst approved 
for the treatment of HIV -1 infection by the FDA and EMA in 2018. It is differentiated from 
other NNRTIs by its distinct resistance profile, low likelihood of selection for viral resistance 
in vivo, and low potential for DDIs. Itexhibits potent activity against both wild -type HI V-1 
virus and frequently- transmitted NNRTI -resistant variants (eg, K103N, Y181C, G190A, and 
E138K) .The safety and efficacy profiles of DOR have been well characterized in Phase 3 
clinical studies conducted in treatment -naïve adult participants [Orkin, C., et al 2018] 
[Molina, J. M., et al 2018] and in virologically suppressed adult participants switching from a 
stable a ntiretroviral regimen [CSR P024MK1439A ] .
2.2.3 Doravirine /Islatravir
DOR/ISL is an FDC containing DOR (100 mg) and ISL (0.75 mg), administered as a single 
tablet QD. DOR and ISL represent 2 distinct classes of antiretrovirals that inhibit reverse 
transcription by different mechanisms. Based on the profiles of each of these drugs and data 
available to- date, the combination DOR/ISL is expected to be well tolerated and highly 
efficacious, with a high barrier to resistance . The combination has demonstrated additive 
antiretro viral activity in vitro and has suppressed emergence of resistance at clinically
relevant concentrations.
The combination of DOR and ISL (administered as single -entities, DOR + ISL) is being 
evalu ated in an ongoing randomized Phase 2 study (MK -8591 P011) in approximately 
90treatment -naïve adult participants with HIV -1. Participants were initially assigned to 
receive either DOR + ISL and 3TC or an FDC of DOR, 3TC, and TDF (DOR/3TC/TDF). 
Participant s receiving DOR +ISL + 3TC who achieved HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 
20 (or later) discontinued 3TC at their next study visit (most were able to discontinue 3TC at 
Week 24) while continuing DOR + ISL. At Week s48and 96 , the percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA <50 copies/mL among those who received the 2- drug regimen of DOR + 
ISLwas comparable to those who received the 3 -drug regimen of DOR/3TC/TDF. The 
majority of participants maintained virologic suppression through Week 144. None of the 
participants with protocol -defined virologic failure rebounded above the clinically relevant
HIV-1 RNA >200 copies/mL cut off. As such, no participant met the criteria for resistance 
testing. DOR + ISL, administered with 3TC or alone as a 2 -drug regi men, had a favorable 
safety and tolerability profile through Week 96, comparable to that of DOR/3TC/TDF . Mean 
changes from baseline in CD4+ T -cell count were comparable for DOR/3TC/TDF and each 
dose of ISL as a 3- drug regimen (at Week 24) or a 2 -drug regim en (at Weeks 48, 96, 144).   
The clinical development program of DOR/ISL includes ongoing studies in treatment -naïve 
adults (P020), virologically suppressed adults (P017 and P018), and heavily treatment -

experienced participants (P019) and participants <18 years of age and weighing ≥35 kg 
(P028) .
2.2.4 Information on Other Study -related Therapy
BIC/FTC/TAF was first approved in 2018 for the treatment of HIV -1 infection and will be 
administered at the approved marketed dose . Refer to approved label ing for detailed 
information on BIC/FTC/TAF .
2.3 Benefit/Risk Asse ssment
Although i t cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit 
from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information 
about the safety and effectiveness of an investigational medicine, the totality of available 
nonclinical and clinical data supports continued evaluation of DOR/ISL in Phase 3 clinical
studies.
The comprehensive nonclinical safety evaluations of DOR (an appr oved NNRTI) and ISL 
(an investigational NRTTI) as mono -entities have not revealed toxicities of concern for daily 
dosing. Nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity studies did not identify any 
clinically relevant concerns that would preclude continued dosing of DOR/ISL in participants 
who become pregnant during the study. Both mono- entities are differentiated by a high 
barrier to resistance in vitro with DOR exhibiting potent activity against the most prevalent 
NNRTI -resistant mutations (eg, K103N, Y181C, G190A, and E138K) and ISL against 
common NRTI -resistant mutations (eg, M184V and TAMs). Both may be administered 
without regard to food, have a low potential for DDIs, and have favorable PK and tolerability 
profiles.
High potency against wild- type and resistant variants of HIV- 1 virus and a long half -life 
make ISL a suitable candidate for development for the treatment of HIV -1 infection. Across 
the clinical development program, ISL administered alone or with DOR was generally well 
tolerated. In the dose-ranging study ( MK-8591 P011), ISL+DOR+3TC (as a 3 -drug regimen) 
achieved virological suppression in most (>90%) treatment- naïve participants by Week 24. 
ISL+DOR (as a 2 -drug regimen) maintained virologic suppression of HIV -1 RNA 24 and 48 
weeks after switching from the 3 -drug regimen and through Week 144. In 2ongoing Phase 3 
studies evaluating DOR/ISL for daily treatment of HIV -1 in virologically suppressed 
participants ( MK-8591A P0 17 and MK -8591A P018) ,approximately 95% of 658 
participants enrolled in the DOR/ISL arm completed 48 week softreatment in both studies .
In P017 and P018, t he percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL was <1% 
for the DOR/ISL group and a high percentage of participants ( >93%to 95% )in the DOR/ISL 
group maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL) comparable to baseline 
ART (P017) and BIC/FTC/TAF (P018) at Week 48. To date, no viral resistance to either 
component of DOR/ISL has been shown in the Phase 2 (P011) and Phase 3 studies (P017 and 
P018). At the doses administered for daily treatment, DOR/ISL has been well tolerated and 
associated with low rates of drug -related AEs.

Downward trends of total lymphocyte counts and CD4+ T -cell counts were observed in 
studies with ISL alone or in combination with other antiviral agents. In a Phase 2 study 
(MK- 8591 P013) for once weekly HIV- 1 treatment, decreases in lymphocyte and CD4+ 
T-cell counts from baseline were observed in the ISL 20 mg + MK -8507 treatment arms at 
Week 12 and Wee k 24. Decreases from baseline in lymphocyte count were observed in all 
dosing arms of ISL + MK- 8507 starting at Week 8 with further decreases continuing through 
Week 24. Twenty of 58 participants on ISL + MK- 8507 had a decrease in lymphocyte count 
of >30% (of whom 9 had a >50% reduction) by Week 24. These reductions were more 
pronounced in the 2 higher MK- 8507 dose arms (200 and 400 mg), potentially indicating a 
dose-response relationship. Dosing of ISL+MK -8507 in P013 has been stopped.
In the Phase 2 randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study evaluating 60 mg and 
120mg of ISL monthly for PrEP in participants at low -risk of HIV -1 infection (MK -8591
P016), there was a 21% mean decrease in total lymphocytes observed in the 60 mg arm (the 
dose being ev aluated in Phase 3 PrEP studies )anda 36% decrease in total lymphocytes 
observed in the 120 mg arm. In this population of HIV -1 uninfected participants, the mean 
decreases were in the normal range and there was no increase in clinical AEs related to 
infec tion. Dosing o foral ISL 60 mg QM has been stopped in PrEP clinical studies. 
In an interim analysis for each of the Phase 3 studies studying DOR/ISL 100mg/0.75 mg for 
HIV-1treatment ,P017 and P018, there were mean decreases from baseline in lymphocyte 
counts at Week 48 of 10.6% and 8.5% in the DOR/ISL groups (in P 017 and P018, 
respectively) compared with mean increases from baseline of 2.27% and 3.46% in the 
comparator arms (in P 017and P0 18, respectively) .In the same studies, DOR/ISL- treated 
participants had mean changes from baseline in CD4+ T -cell count of -0.7% (P017) and 
+0.9% (P018) compared with mean increase sof 8.7% in the baseline ART group (P017) and 
12.8% in the BIC/FTC/TAF group (P018) . The decreases in CD4+ T- cell counts and 
lymphocyte counts have not been associated with an increase dincidence of infection or other 
AEs.The clinical impact of these laboratory changes over the long term is unknown, and the 
Sponsor is assessing the reversibi lity of the reductions in CD4+ T- cell and lymphocyte 
counts. To mitigate the risk, increased monitoring of CD4+ T -cell and lymphocyte counts 
and strict stopping rules have been added to DOR/ISL studies. At this time, the data review 
support scontinuation o f the Phase 3 clinical studies for the DOR/ISL 100mg/0.75 mg HIV-1 
once -daily treatment program.
Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants in this clinical study 
may be found in the accompanying IBs and informed consent documents.

4 S TUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design
This is a P hase 3, randomized, active -controlled, multi- site, double -blind, double -dummy 
study to evaluate a switch from BIC/FTC/ TAF QD to DOR/ISL QD in participants with 
HIV-1 who have been virologically suppressed on BIC/FTC/TAF for ≥3 months with no 
history of treatment failure .
A total of approximately 578 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 
2treatment groups ( Figure 1 ):
Group 1 (n= approximately 289): Switch from BIC/FTC/TAF to DOR/ISL on Day 1
(taken with matching placebo to BIC/FTC/TAF through Week 96).
Group 2 (n= approximately 289): Continue BIC/FTC/TAF (taken with matching 
placebo to DOR/ISL through Week 96 ).
Clinical site personnel and participants will remain blinded through Week 96while Sponsor 
personnel will remain blinded through Week 48. Safety and efficacy l aboratory results, 
including HIV -1 RNA, will remain unmasked throughout the study. At Week 96, all 
participants and site personnel will be unblinded and participants will continue to receive 
their assigned study intervention open -label through Week 144. All participants who reach 
Week 144 will be considered to have completed the study. At Week 144, p articipants who
were randomized to Group 1 will be offered to continue to receive open- label DOR/ISL in 
therollover study. Participants who were randomized to Group 2 will be given the option to 
beswitched to open- label DOR/ISL and continue to be monitored in P018 through 
Week 156, at which time they will be offered to continue to receive open- label DOR/ISL in 
therollover study. Group 2 participants who opt out of switching to DOR/ISL will complete 
the study at Week 144. Participant sin Group 2 who are pregnant at Week 144 will not be 
offered the option to switch to DOR/ISL .
Any participants with confirmed viremia, as described in Section 4.2.1.1.2 , will be assessed 
for development of viral drug resistance and potential discontinuation from study

intervention. Viral resistance data will remain masked to the Sponsor through Week 48 and 
to site personnel and participants through Week 96 .
Participant safety will be monitored by an independent eDMC through periodic review of 
safety and efficacy data (received from an unblinded independent statistician) throughout the 
study (Appendix 1).When 40% of target enrollment have completed Week 24, i ncluding
visit assessments, a n interim analysis (which will hereafter be refer redto as the “ Week 24 
interim analysis”) to assess futility based on Week 24 data is planned (Section 9.7).
Specific procedures to be performed during the study, as well as thei r prescribed times and 
associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure 
are provided in Section 8.
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The randomized active -controlled non- inferiority study design is consistent with FDA 
regulatory guidance [Food and Drug Administration (CBER) 2015] and is considered 
appropriate for a treatment- experienced study population that is switching from another 
stable ART regimen with HIV RNA <5 0copies/mL . Small d ifferences in virologic efficacy, 
emergence of resistance, and loss of tolerability or safety may be detected prior to 48 weeks
of treatment ,particularly for therapies with largely comparable characteristics. Thus, aligned 
with regulatory guidance [Food and Drug Administration (CBER) 2015] , the primary 
efficacy analysis will occur after 48 weeks of treatment with DOR/ISL or BIC/FTC/TAF . 
Blinded study intervention will continue through Week 96 and participants’ originally 
assigned therapy will be continued open- label from Week 96 to Week 144 to enable a longer -
term comparison between the 2 treatment groups. Participants from Group 2 will have the 
optio n of switching to DOR/ISL at Week 144 followed by a 12- week safety and tolerability 
monitoring period (until Week 156).
4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints
4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints
4.2.1.1.1 HIV -1 RNA Measurements
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is plasma HIV -1 RNA ≥50 co pies/mL. Eligible 
participants in the switch population being studied are virological lysuppressed, with HIV- 1 
RNA <50 copies/mL at baseline. The assessment of interest is the percentage of participants 
who are unable to maintain virologic suppression after switching to a new antiretroviral 
regimen.
Clinical studies of antiretroviral agents in multiple drug classes have demonstrated that 
virologic suppression of HIV -1 RNA to <50 copies/mL reflects a clinically relevant standard 
used across development programs for antiretroviral therapies and in clinical practice 
[Vandenhende, M. A., et al 2015] .Suppressing HIV- 1 RNA to <50 copies/mL preserves the 
immune system and minimizes the risk of opportunistic infections and disease progression.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 018-06 
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
The secondary efficacy endpoint of plasma HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL corresponds to the 
lower limit of quantification of the assay being used in this study.
4.2.1.1.2 Definition of Clinically significant Confirmed Viremia
For the purpose of managing participants in this study , clinically significant confirmed 
viremia is defined as :
Virologic Rebound : Two consecutive ( 2to 4week sapart) occurrences of HIV-1 
RNA ≥200 copies/mL at any time during the study.
There is currently no global standard for definition of patients with low -level viremia (viral 
load ≥50 and <200 copies/mL), and the predictive implication of such low -level viremia is 
uncertain [Vandenh ende, M. A., et al 2015] [Charpentier, C., et al 2014] . The US 
Department of Health and Human Services guidelines currently define virologic failure as 
confirmed HIV RNA ≥200 copies/mL and do not recommend that low -level viremia 
(detectable HIV RNA <200 copies/mL) automatically result in treatment modification or 
more frequent virologic monitoring [Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and 
Adolescents 2018] . Participants with HIV- 1 RNA between 50 and 200 copies/mL have a 
lower risk of developing resistance compared to those with HIV -1 RNA >200 copies/mL 
and should continue on their current regimen, with HIV -1 RNA levels monitored as outlined 
in Section 8.2.2.
An HIV- 1 RNA level of ≥50 copies/mL must be con firmed and requires further management 
as described in Section 8.2.2.
4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints
Safety evaluations will include physical examinations (including vital signs) and laboratory 
tests ( eg, hematology, chemistry ,and urinalysis) performed per SoA (Section 1.3). AEs will 
be evaluated at each visit and assessed according to the guidelines in Section 8.4 and 
Appendix 3. Participants may be asked to return for unscheduled visits to perform additional 
safety monitoring.
4.2.1.3 Weight, L aboratory, and Radiological Markers
The study will evaluate weight, laboratory, and radiological markers as changes from 
baseline in the treatment arms to evaluate the impact of DOR/ISL as per the SoA 
(Section 1.3):
Weight
Compared with other antiretroviral classe s, use o f integrase inhibitors in patients with HIV -1 
has been associated with greater increases in body weight [Hill, A., et al 2019] . The mean 
change in body weight will be compared between participants who switch to DOR/ISL and 
participants who continue taking BIC/FTC/TAF.

Inflammation
Causes of persistent inflammation and thrombotic activity in patients with HIV -1 remain 
topics of debate and ongoing research [Baker, J. V., et al 2011] [Knudsen, T. B., et al 2016] 
[Wang, H., et al 2016] ; thus, k ey indicators of inflammation w illbe m easured (Section 
8.8.2 ).
Renal Function
Decreases in renal function have been noted with the use of certain NRTIs [U.S. Prescribing 
Information 2019] ;thus, key indicators of renal function will be measured (Section 8.8 .3).
Fasting Lipid and Metabolic Profiles
Some antiretroviral shave been associated with lipid abnormalities [U.S. Prescribing 
Information 2017] ; thus, key indicators of fasting lipid profiles will be measured (Section 
8.8.4 ).
Insulin resistance has been reported with certain antiretroviral therapies [Carr, A., et al 1998] . 
It isassociated with metabolic complications including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, fatty 
liver and weight gain [Vazquez -Carrera, M. 2016] . Fasting insulin and glucose will be 
measured to calculate HOMA -IR(Section 8.8.4) .
Body Composition
Decreases in BMD and lipodystrophy (peripheral and central fat redistribution) have been 
reported in patients with HIV -1 receiving ART [AIDS info 2017] , particularly with the use of 
certain NRTIs. Key indicators of body composition (including DEXA assessments) will be 
measured (Section 8.8 .6).
4.2.1.4 Pharmacokinetic Endpoints
PKsamples collected from all participants as described in the SoA and Section 8.6 will be 
used to evaluate PK concentrations of ISL, and as appropriate , PK-efficacy , PK-
pharmacodynamic, and PK -AE relationships of ISL.PK values such as AUC, C max, and 
C24will be explored.
4.2.1.5 Patient -reported Outcomes
PROs can provide unique information on the impact of HIV infection and its treatment from 
the patients’ perspective as some domains are difficult to o bserve or are subjective and best 
collected through patient report. HIV infection and its treatment can impair HRQoL. 
Symptom burden associated with HIV treatment has decreased with improvements in ART 
regimens butpersists despite viral suppression and im munologic recovery. In conjunction 
with efficacy and safety, PRO data may help clinicians and patients in making informed 
decisions on appropriate ART regimens. HTA authorities in many countries recommend 
patient perspectives data and HRQoL measurement as part of their drug benefit evaluations.

HRQoL data is used to estimate health utility scores, which inform cost -effectiveness model 
analysis.
This study will include 3 self -administered PRO questionnaires. The EQ -5D-5L, a generic 
HRQoL questionnaire, will provide a simple descriptive profile and index value for health 
status used to compute health utilities for health economic analyses. The HIV -SI (also known 
as HIV SDM) is a 20 -item HIV disease -specific questionnaire designed to assess the 
prevalence and b urden of adverse effects associated with ART regimens. The HIVTSQ is a 
10-item instrument used to measure satisfaction with medications for people with HIV 
infection. The status version (HIVTSQs) will be used to evaluate treatment satisfaction over 
time.
4.2.1.6 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research
4.2.1.6.1 Planned Genetic Analysis
Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therapy, susceptibility to, severity, 
and progression of disease. Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants 
that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of 
the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, 
where local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA analysis 
from consenting participants.
DNA samples may be used for research related to the study intervention( s), the disease under 
study, or related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnostic 
tests related to the disea se under study, related diseases, and study intervention(s). Genetic 
research may consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes , the analysis of genetic 
markers throughout the genome , or analysis of the entire genome. Analysis may be 
conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.
The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to understand study disease or related conditions.
4.2.1.7 Future Biomedical Research
The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical r esearch on specimens for which consent was 
provided during this study. This research may include genetic analyses (DNA), gene 
expression profiling (RNA ),proteomics, metabolomics (serum, plasma), and/or the 
measurement of other analytes, depending on whi ch specimens are consented for future 
biomedical r esearch.
Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not described elsewhere 
in the protocol (as part of the main study) and will only be conducted on specimens from 
appropriately consented participants. The objective of coll ecting/retaining specimens for 
future biomedical r esearch is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific 
understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use 
such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that

participants receive the correct dose of the correct drug/vacc ine at the cor rect time. The 
details of future biomedical r esearch are presented in Appendix 6.
4.2.2 Rationale for the Use of Comparator/Placebo
The recently approved 3- drug regimen of BIC/FTC/TA F will be the comparator in this study . 
BIC/FTC/TAF has been appro ved by the EMA and the FDA forboth treatment -naïve and 
switch patients andis a recommended initial regimen for most people infected with HIV-1
[Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents 201 8]. Although some 
previous switch studie s have been conducted within- class (eg ,from one NNRTI to another), 
this study is designed to compare switching to DOR/ISL from an InSTI -containing regime n.
TheInSTI -containing regimen was chosen as the comparator because the InSTI class is
recommended by both the US Department of Health and Human Services [Panel on 
Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents 2018] and the European AIDS Clinical
Society[European AIDS Clinical Society 2018] as part of all first -line,standard- of-care 
treatment regimens . However, e merging data suggest that some InSTIs may have tolerability 
issues including possible weigh t gain and CNS side effects .Furthermore, long- term renal and 
bone defects have been associated with the use of TAF [U.S. Prescribing Information 2016] . 
Thus ,some patients may want to switch from the combination of BIC/FTC/TAF [Norwood, 
J., et al 2017] [Hoffmann, C., et al 2017] .
Matching placebo will be used to provide a robust evaluation of the safety and t olerability 
profile of DOR/ISL by maintaining double -blind ,double -dummy therapy through Week 96.
4.2.3 Rationale for the Selected Participant Population
The rationale for the participant population selected for this study is as follows:
Participants Switching A RT Regimens: Although many ART regimens are 
associated with a high likelihood of achieving and maintaining undetectable HIV -1 
RNA levels, globally, while 70% of all persons living with HIV know their HIV 
status, only 44% are virologically suppressed [Joint United Nations Programme on 
HIV/AIDS 2017] . Drug- associated adverse effects and toxicities, food requirements, 
high pill burdens, and/or dosing frequency and DDIs with concomitant medications 
are among the reasons that may contribute to lack of adherence to prescribed ART 
regimens. These are the same motivators for patients and prescribers to consider 
switching components of an antiretroviral regimen even in the setting of viral 
suppression, before failure can o ccur.
Furthermore, given the aging of the population with HIV, it is anticipated that 
switches will become even more common in the setting of ongoing concerns for the 
risks of long -term toxicity, DDIs, and co morbid conditions (ie, neuropsychiatric, 
cardiovascular).
Participants W ith Virological Suppression for ≥3 Months: With increasing 
prevalence of early treatment initiation, increasing life expectan cy for those who are 
infected with HIV -1,anddecreasing incidence rates of new HIV -1 infections in many 
07YG7P

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 018-06 
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
parts of the world, an important population in need of improved treatment regimens 
arethose who are already virologically suppressed. Data from the on going 
Phase 2study ( MK-8591 A P011) demonstrate that after receiving at least 3months of 
the 3- drug regimen of DOR +ISL+3TC, almost all participants with HIV -1 RNA 
<50copies/mL maintained virologic suppression on a 2- drug regimen of DOR +ISL
through an additional 24 weeks. Based on the results of the Phase 2 study ,enrollment 
in this study will be open to those who have demonstrated stable suppression with an 
HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL for≥3months.
4.2.4 Rationale for Collecting Race and Ethnicity Data
The differential effect on the safety and efficacy based on any demographic parameter, 
including race or ethnicity, cannot be predicted when evaluating a new investigational drug. 
Therefore, it is important to collect race and ethnicity data to ensure that there is not a 
differential effect based on these parameters and to gain assurance the results observed in the 
clinical study will be representative of the drug’s use in a broader patient population. As an 
example, non- Caucasian females and males were found to have higher plasma concentrations 
of EFV(an NNRTI) than their Caucasian counterparts, indicating an increased risk of EF V-
induced toxicity in non- Caucasian patients [Burger, D., et al 2005] . As another example, 
among the population with HIV in the US, those of African heritage have been found to be 
less likely to maintain virologi c suppression compared to other groups ,and the factors 
contributing to this remain to be elucidated [Weintrob, A. C., et al 2009] [Ribaudo, H. J., et 
al 2013] . Thus, subgroup analyses on race and ethnici ty will be performed to better 
understand how these parameters may influence clinical outcome and toxicity.
4.2.5 Rationale for Collecting Gender Identity Data
Transgender people, defined as those whose gender identities and/or expressions differ from 
the sex as signed to them at birth, have a high prevalence and incidence of HIV infection 
globally [Poteat, T., et al 2016] . Specifically, transgender women have an increased risk of 
HIV infection attributed to challenges associated with coping with psychosocial issues such 
as discrimination, stigmatization ,and marginalization [Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 2019] [Department of HIV/AIDS 2015] . When considerin g HIV treatment, t he 
WHO considers transgender people to be a separate key population because of their specific 
health needs and high vulnerability [Department of HIV/AIDS 2015] . Data will be collected 
in this study to assess clinical outcomes in the transgender population.
4.2.6 Rationale for Infant Safety Data Collection
Follow -up through 1 year of age for infants born to participants who become pregnant while 
receiving study intervention provides the ability to monitor growth and development as well 
as potential adverse effects that may be associated with prenatal drug exposure. Growth 
parameters (ie, length, weight, and head circumference) within normal range at 
approximately 1 year of age are key noninvasive indicators that a serious congenital 
malformation caused by in utero drug exposure is unlikely.

MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
4.2.7 Rationale for Continuing Study Intervention During Pregnancy
The US Department of Health and Human Services guidelines currently advise that women 
who become preg nant while receiving ART for HIV infection should continue their regimen 
provided it is safe, well tolerated, and effective at virologic suppression since altering the 
regimen could cause an increase in viral load [Panel on Treatment of Pregnant Women with 
HIV Infection and Prev 2018]. Nonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicology 
studies did not identify any teratogenicity or other clinically relevant concerns ,that would 
preclude continued dosing of DOR /ISL in participants who become pregnant and who 
consent to continue study intervention (where allowed by local regulations ,health 
authorities, and ethics committees and as appropriate based on available data/local standard -
of-care guidelines) (Sections 8.1.1.4 and 8.11. 6).
There are no clinical data currently available to support breastfeeding by participants who are 
receiving DOR/ISL.
4.3 Justification for Dose
Inhibitory quotient ( Ctrough/IC50) is the ratio of drug exposure to viral susceptibility. In a 
Phase 1b proof of concept study (MK -8591 P003), single doses as low as 0.5 mg ISLshowed 
robust anti retro viral activity at 7 days postdose ; this low single -dose provided an IQ 
threshold of 5 for wild- type HIV -1 virus. Simulations suggest theISL-TPconcentrations 
achieved after a single -dose of 0.75 mg ISLprovide IQs of 21 and 4 for wild- type and 
M184V virus, respectively. After 7 daily doses of 0.75 mg ISL, IQs increase to 1 13for wild -
type virus and 23 for M184V/I virus. Antiretro viral activity a gainst the exceedingly rare 
69ins + M184I/V mutant virus (the NRTI mutant with the highest potency reduction for ISL) 
is expected to be achieved after 7daily doses, with an IQ of 5. Steady -state concentrations at 
later timepoints will produce even higher IQs,as there is additional accumulation of ISL-TP. 
These simulations support the selection of 0.75 mg ISLin combination with 100 mg DOR to 
maintain virologic suppress ion in participants who switch from a stable ART regimen, 
BIC/FTC/TAF, at baseline.
In the Phase 2 clinical study (MK-8591 P011) , 3 daily doses of ISL(0.25, 0.75, and 
2.25 mg)were evaluated in combination with DOR (100 mg) +3TC for 24 weeks and 
subsequently with DOR alone through W eek 48. All 3 doses of ISLwith DOR ±3TC
demonstrated potent antiretroviral activity comparable with the comparator, DOR/3TC/TDF ,
as demonstrated by the primary efficacy endpoint :the percentage of participants with HIV -1 
RNA < 50copies/mL at both Weeks 24 and 48 . Overall, no ISLdose-response for efficacy 
was observed. Graphical analysis of steady- state ISL-TP trough concentrations and response
at Week 48 from MK -8591 P011 showed no trends in exposure -response. The totality of 
these efficacy data supports the conclusion that the dose range studied (0.25 to 2.25 mg 
daily) is on the plateau of the dose -response curve. P011 also demonstrated that all doses of 
ISLstudied, when administered with DOR +3TC or DOR alone , hada favorable safety and 
tolerability profile through Week 48, c ompar able with that of DOR/3TC/TDF.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 018-06 
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
DOR will be administered at the approved dose of 100 mg. This dose has been studied in 
Phase 1 to3 clinical studies in treatment- naïve and virologically suppressed participants with 
HIV-1 and was selected based upon favorable efficacy, safety, tolerability ,and metabolic 
profiles, as confirmed in Phase 3 clinical studies [Orkin, C., et al 2018] [Molina, J. M., et al 
2018] [CSR P024MK1439A ] . Of note, among 32 participants in MK -1439 AProtocols 024 
and 030 infected with HIV -1 harboring theNNRTI resistance mutations K103N, Y181C, 
and/or G190A at study entry , allachieved virologic suppression following 48 weeks of 
treatment with DOR/3TC/TDF (24 of 32 partic ipants had been virologically suppressed on PI  
or InSTI regimens and 8 had been treatment -naïve) .
In summary, a 0.75- mg dose of ISLin combination with 100 mg DOR is predicted to provide
concentrations that will demonstrate potent antiretroviral activity against both wild- type virus 
and most common NRTI -and NNRTI -resistant variants.
4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition
The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally acceptable rep resentative) 
provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant 
completes the last study -related contact, withdraws consent, or is lost to follow- up (ie, the 
participant is unable to be contacted by the investigator).
4.4.1 Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination
The clinical study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of 
emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population 
as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a)particular 
study site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical 
Practice ( GCP ), and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure -related problems 
or the number of discontinuations for administrative reasons is too high .
Early study termination will also be considered if futility criteria are met at the Week 24 
interim analysis (Section 9.7).

All supplies indicated in Table 2 will be provided per the “ Sourcing ”column depending upon 
local country operational requirements. If local sourcing, e very attempt should be made to 
source the se supplies from a single lot/batch number .
Refer to Section 8.1.8 for details regarding administration of the study intervention.
All placebos were created by the Sponsor to match the active product.
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability
6.2.1 Dose Prepar ation
There are no specific calculations or evaluations required to be performed in order to 
administer the proper dose to each participant. T he rationale for selection of doses to be used 
in this study is provided in Section 4.3.
6.2.2 Handling, Storage , and Ac countability
The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention received, and any discrepancies are 
reported and resolved before use of the study intervention .
Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study intervention, and only authorized 
site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study i nterventions must be stored 
in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in 
accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized site staff.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).
For all study sites, the local country Sp onsor personnel or designee will provide appropriate 
documentation that must be completed for drug accountability and return, or local discard 
and destruction if appropriate. Where local discard and destruction is appropriate, the 
investigator is responsible for ensuring that a local discard/destruction procedure is 
documented.
The study site is responsible for recording the lot number, manufacturer, and expiry date for 
any locally purchased product (if applicable) as per local guidelines unless otherwise 
instructed by the Sponsor.
The investigator shall take responsibility for and shall take all steps to maintain appropriate 
records and ensure appropriate supply, storage, handling, distribution, and usage of study 
interventions in accordance with the protoc ol and any applicable laws and regulations.

6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding
6.3.1 Intervention Assignment
Intervention randomization will occur centrally using an interactive response technology 
(IRT) system. There are 2study intervention arms. Participants will be assigned randomly in 
a 1:1ratio to Group 1 orGroup 2 , respectively.
6.3.2 Stratification
No stratification based on age, sex, or other characteristics will be used in this study.
6.3.3 Blinding
A double -blinding technique with in- house blinding will be used. DOR /ISLand 
BIC/FTC/TAF will be packaged identically relative to their matching placebos so that blind 
is maintained. The pa rticipant, the investigator, and Sponsor personnel or delegate(s) who are 
involved in the study intervention administration or clinical evaluation of the parti cipants are 
unaware of the intervention assignments.
Clinical site personnel and participants wil l remain blinded through Week 96while all 
Sponsor personnel will remain blinded through Week 48. Sponsor personnel involved in 
performing and reviewing results of the Week 48 analysis will be unblinded after the 
Week48 database lock .
As described in Sect ion 4, at Week 96 all clinical site personnel and participants will be 
unblinded and will continue to receive their assigned study intervention open -label through 
Week 144. A t Week 144, p articipants in Group 1 will be offered the option of receiving 
open -label DOR/ISL in the rollover study. Participants in Group 2 will be offered to switch 
to open -label DOR/ISL for an additional 12 weeks (through Week 156) prior to entering the 
rollover.
To allow timely completion of population PK modeling, restricted early (before database 
lock)unblinding of PK data may be requested. No personnel directly associated with study 
conduct will be unblinded before the database lock at Week 48 . Before granting select 
personnel access to unblinded PK data, an official memo detailing unblinding procedures 
will be generated per Sponsor SOP. This memo will list the names of the personnel who will 
have access to unblinded PK data before database lock .
6.4 Study Intervention Compliance
Participants should be instructed to b ring the study intervention bottles to their visits. At each 
visit, the number of tablets remaining in the study packaging will be counted, reviewed and 
recorded. The results will be used to assess participant compliance. If a discrepancy is noted, 
the investigator/study coordinator must discuss the discrepancy with the participant and the 
explanation must be documented. Participants should be reminded of the importance of 
taking their study interven tion as instructed for the entire duration of the study.

Decisions to temporarily withhold study intervention because of an AE or other reason(s)
will be reviewed on a case -by-case basis by the investigator. Interruptions from the protocol -
specified treatment plan that are expected to be 7 consecutive days or longer require 
consultation between the investigator and the Sponsor and written documentat ion of the 
collaborative decision on participant management.
6.5 Concomitant Therapy
Medications specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during time 
periods specified by this protocol for that medication or vaccination . If there is a clinical 
indication for any medications specifically prohibited, discontinuation from study 
intervention may be required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this 
with the Sponsor Clinical Director . The final decision on any supportive therapy rests with 
the investigator and/or the participant ’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue 
the participant on study intervention requires the mutual agreement of the investigator, the 
Sponsor, and the participant.
Prior and concomita nt therapies listed in Table 3 are not permitted from 45 days prior to 
Day 1 through thestudy treatment period. Table 3 is not comprehensive, and the investigator 
should use his/her medical judgement when assessing a participant’s prior and concomitant 
therapy(ies). The Sponsor Clinical Director or designee shou ld be contacted if there are any 
questions about a therapy not on the list below or regarding potential DDI interactions with a 
specific treatment that the participant may plan to receive.
In instances where the local product circular for DOR or BIC/FTC/TA F is more restrictive 
with regard to prohibited (ie, contraindicated or not recommended) therapy(ies), the local 
product circular supersedes this section .
For participants taking metformin, close monitoring is recommended (BIC/FTC/TAF may 
increase metformi n levels). S ucralfate and inhibitors of P -gpand/or BCRP should be used 
with caution. Refer to the local product circular for BIC/FTC/TAF for additional information.
For participants taking medications or oral supplements containing polyvalent cations (eg,
Mg, Al, Ca, Fe), study intervention should be taken either 2 hours before or 6 hours after 
taking any polyvalent cation containing medicine.

6.7 Intervention After the End of the Study
Provided development of DOR/ISL continues, there will be a rollover study for all eligible 
participants to continue receiving DOR/ISL without interruption until it becomes locally 
available . Eligible participants are those who have completed the last sched uled study visit
andare considered by the investigator to derive clinical benefit from administration of 
DOR/ISL.
At Week 144, eligible participants inGroup 1 will be given the option to continue treatment 
with DOR/ISL (as open- label) in the rollover study. Eligible participants in Group 2 will be 
given the option to switch to open -label DOR/ISL at Week 144 and continue in th isstudy 
through Week 156. At Week 156, Group 2 participants willbe given the option to move into 
the rollover study to continue to receive DOR/ISL .Participants who complete this study but 
who decline to participate in the rollover study should have an End of Treatment Follow Up 
visit (Section 1.3.3).
Participants who choose to participate in the rollover study andhave decreases in CD4+ T-
cell and/or total lymphocyte counts that meet ECI criteria (Section 8.4.7) at their Week 144 
(Group 1) or Week 156 (Group 2) visit should have a confirmation visit in this study (per 
Section 8.11.5 and Section 1.3.5). The confirmatory CD4+ T- cell count and total lymphocyte 
count will be followed in this study and the participant will be concurrent ly enrolled in the 
rollover study.
Upon repeat testing, i f discontinuation criteria are confirmed (Section 7.1) 
participation in the rollover s tudy will be stopped. The participant will be followed
monthly in this study until 2 values (12 weeks apart) for the CD4+ T -cell count and 
total lymphocyte count are not decreased by > 10% of the average baseline values 
(Section 8.11.5). Participants discontinuing study medication due to confirmed CD4+ 
T-cell count <200 cells/mm3willbe followed monthly in this study until the CD4+ T-
cell count is ≥ 200 cells/mm3on 2 visits 12 weeks apart (Section 8.11.5.3).
Upon repeat testing, i f discontinuation cri teria ( Section 7.1 )are not confirmed the 
participant will continue to participate in the rollover study only.
Participants receiving DOR/ISL who decline participation in the rollover study and show 
decreases in CD4+ T -cell count and/or lymphocyte count a t the Week 144 (Group 1) or 
Week 156 (Group 2) should be managed per Section 8.11.5.3.
6.8 Clinical Supplies Disclosure
The emergency unblinding call center will use the intervention/randomization schedule for 
the study to unblind participants and to unmask st udy intervention identity. The emergency 
unblinding call center should only be used in cases of emergency (see Section 8.1.10). In the 
event that the emergency unblinding call center is not available for a given site in this study, 
the central electronic intervention randomization system (IRT) should be used to unblind 
participants and to unmask study intervention identity. The Sponsor will not provide random 
code/disclosure envelopes or lists with the clinical supplies.

personnel will remain blinded through Week 48 . 
6.9 Standard Policies
At the close of the study after unblinding, a letter is to be sent by the investigator to those 
participants who received placebos in the image of the comparator to provide the following 
advice:
“You have participated in a study conducted by the Sponsor. This letter is to advise you that 
you were among those who received a look -alike tablet created by the Sponsor to resemble 
the drug/vac cine BIKTARVY 50/200/25 mg(BICTEGRAVIR/
EMTRICITABINE/TENOFOVIR ALAFENAMIDE) as much as possible. You did not 
receive the active drug/vaccine BIKTARVY 50/200/25 mg

Gilead Sciences, Inc .”
7 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT 
WITHDRAWAL
7.1 Discontinuation of Study Intervention
Discontinuation of study intervention does not represent immediate withdrawal from the 
study.
As certain data on clinical events beyond study intervention discontinuation may be 
important to the study, they must be collected through the participant’s last scheduled follow -
up, even if the participant has discontinued study intervention. Therefore, a ll participants 
who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the protocol -specified treatment 
period will still continue to participate in the study as specified in Section 8.11.3.
Participants may discontinue study intervention at any time fo r any reason or be d iscontinued 
from the study intervention at the discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect 
occur. In addition, a participant may be discontinued from study intervention by the 
investigator or the Sponsor if study intervent ion is inappropriate, the study plan is violated, or 
for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding procedures to be 
performed at study intervention discontinuation are provided in Section 8.11.3.
A participant must be discontinued from study intervention but continue to be monitored per 
Section 8.11.3 for any of the following reasons:
The participant requests to discontinue study intervention.
The participant has a medical condition or personal circumstance ( for pregnancy, see
Section 8.11.6) , which in the opinion of the investigator and/or Sponsor, place sthe 
participant at unnecessary risk from continued administration of study intervention.

count on 2 consecutive measurements taken 3 to 4 weeks apart .
* Average baseline is defined as the average value between s creening (within 45 days 
prior to the first dose of study medication) and Day 1. For participants switching from 
BIC/FTC/TAF to DOR/ISL at Week 144 (Group 2), the baseline CD4+ T-cell count
and tota l lymphocyte count is defined as the value from the Week 144 visit (or if not 
available, the last result prior to Week 144). If there are ≥2 values at Week 144, then 
use the most recent value.
7.2 Participant Withdrawal From the Study
A participant must be wit hdrawn from the study if the participant withdraws consent from the 
study.
If a participant withdraws from the study, they will no longer receive study intervention or be 
followed at scheduled protocol visits.
Specific details regarding procedures to be p erformed at the time of withdrawal from the 
study, as well as specific det ails regarding withdrawal from future biomedical r esearch, are 
outlined in Section 8.1.9. The procedures to be performed should a participant repeatedly fail 
to return for scheduled visits and/or if the study site is unable to contact the participant are 
outlined in Section 7.3.
7.3 Lost t o Follow -up
If a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit and/or if the site is unable 
to contact the participant, the following procedures are to be performed:
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit. If the 
participant is contacted, the participant should be counseled on the importance of 
maintaining the protocol- specified visit schedule.
The investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant 
at each missed visit (eg, telephone calls and/or a certified letter to the participant’s last 
known mailing address or locally equival ent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.

8.1.6 Assignment of Screening Numb er
All consented participants will be given a unique screening number that will be used to 
identify the participant for all procedures that occur prior to randomization . Each participant 
will be assigned only 1 screening number. Screening numbers must not be re -used for 
different participants.
Any participant who is screened multiple times will retain the original screening number 
assigned at the initial screening visit. Specific details on the screening/rescreening visit 
requirements are provided in Section 8.11.1.
8.1.7 Assignment of Treatment/Randomization Numb er
All eligible participants will be randomly allocated and will receive a 
treatment /randomization number. The treatment/randomization number identifies the 
participant for all procedures occurring after treatme ntrandomization. Once a 
treatment /randomization number is assigned to a participant, it can never be re -assigned to 
another participant.
A single participant cannot be assigned more than 1 treatment /randomization number.
8.1.8 Study Intervention Administrati on
Study intervention will be provided as per Table 2and dispensed through the IRT system at 
visits indicated in the SoA ( Section 1.3.1).
Study interventi onshould begin within 24 hours of randomization.
8.1.8.1 Timing of Dose Administration
From Day 1 to Week 96, p articipants will take (unsupervised at their home) 2 tablets of 
blinded study intervention QD at the same time each day ( 1tablet from each of 2 containers
taken together ; (1) Bottle A: DOR/ISL or matching placebo, and (2) Bottle B: BIC/FTC/TAF 
or matching placebo). Study intervention will be taken without regard to food. If more than 1
bottle A is dispensed, the participant is instructed to use all of the medication in 1Bottle A 
before opening another Bottle A. From Week 96 through the end of study, participants will 
take 1 tablet of open- label study intervention QD at the same time ea ch day.
If a participant misses a dose of any of the study interventions, the following guidance should 
be followed:
If ≤12 hours from the missed dose , the missed dose should be taken, and the normal 
dosing schedule resumed.
If >12 hours from the missed dose, the missed dose should be skipped, and the 
normal dosing schedule resumed. The participant should not double the next dose to 
compensate for what has been missed.

8.1.9 Discontinuation and Withdrawal
Participants who discontinue study intervention prior to completion of the treatment period
should have an Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit performed per SoA (Section 1.3) 
and be encouraged to continue to be followed as outlined in Section 8.11 .3.
Participants who discontinue study intervention due to decreases in CD4+ T -cell counts 
and/or total lymphocyte counts or who discontinue for any other reason and are found to 
have decreases in CD4+ T -cell count and/or total lymphocyte count of >10% oftheaverage 
baseline value or that meet ECI criteria at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit 
should be unblinded (if applicable) , and those treated with DOR/ISL should be managed per
Section 8.11.5 until their counts recover.
When a participant withdr aws from participation in the study, all applicable activities 
scheduled for the Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit should be performed (at the time 
of withdrawal). Any AEs that are present at the time of withdrawal should be followed in 
accordance w ith the safety requirements outlined in Section 8.4.
8.1.9.1 Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Resear ch
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical research. Participants may 
withdraw consent at any time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical 
records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contac t the Sponsor using 
the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the 
participant's consent for future biomedical r esearch will be withdrawn. A letter will be sent 
from the Sponsor to the investigator confirming the withdra wal. It is the responsibility of the 
investigator to inform the participant of completion of withdrawal. Any analyses in progress 
at the time of request for withdrawal or already performed prior to the request being received 
by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research study data and results. 
No new analyses would be generated after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer requir ed by regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) 
or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between 
the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for 
specimen withdrawal cannot be processed.
8.1.10 Participant Blinding/Unblindi ng
STUDY INTERVENTION IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION IS TO BE UNMASKED 
ONLY IF NECESSARY FOR THE WELFARE OF THE PARTICIPANT. EVERY 
EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE NOT TO UNBLIND.
For emergency situations where the investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent 
with local requirements) needs to identify the intervention used by a participant and/or the 
dosage administered , he/she will contact the emergency unblinding call center by telephone 
and make a request for emergency unblinding. As requested by the investigator or medically

qualified designee, the emergency unblinding call center will provide the information to 
him/her promptly and report unblinding to the Sponsor. P rior to contacting the emergency 
unblinding call center to request unblinding of a participant’s intervention assignment, the 
investigator who is a qualified physician should make reasonable attempts to enter the 
intensity of the AEs observed, the relation to study intervention, the reason thereof , etc., in 
the medical chart. If it is not possible to record this assessment in the chart prior to the 
unblinding, the unblinding should not be delayed.
In the event that unblinding has occurred, the circumstances around the unblinding (eg, date, 
reason, and person performing the unblinding) must be documented promptly, and the 
Sponsor Clinical Director notified as soon as possible.
Once an emergency unblinding has taken place, the principal investigator, site personnel, and 
Sponsor personnel may be unblinded so that appropriate follow- up medical care can be 
provided to the participant.
Participants whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by the investigator or medically 
qualified designee and/or nonstudy trea ting physician should continue to be monitored in the 
study.
Additionally, the investigator or medically qualified designee must go into the IRT system 
and perform the unblind in the IRT system to update drug disposition. In the event that the 
emergency un blinding call center is not available for a given site in this study, the IRT 
system should be used for emergency unblinding in the event that this is required for 
participant safety.
8.1.11 Calibration of Equipme nt
The investigator or qualified designee has the responsibility to ensure that any device or 
instrument used for a clinical evaluation/test during a clinica l study that provides information 
about inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or safety or efficacy parameters shall be suitably 
calibrated and/or maintained to ensure that the data obtained are reliable and/or reproducible. 
Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the 
study site .
8.1.12 Administration of Patient Que stionnaires
Participants will complete 3 PRO question naires at Day 1, Week 4, Week 12, Week 48, and 
Week 96 and/or at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit (if at or before Week 96) .
Participants are to complete the questionnaires on their own at the site on paper during the 
appropriate study visit (s ee SoA)prior to being seen by the investigator, discussing any 
medical conditions with the study personnel, or receiving any medical results. The 
questionnaires will not be administered to participants if native language translations are not 
available for all questionnaires.
The participant responses to questionnaires will be entered into the appropriate eCRF by site 
staff according to data entry guidelines.

8.2 Efficacy Assessmen ts
8.2.1 HIV -1 RNA
Plasma HIV -1 RNA quantification will be performed at the central laboratory using a real 
time PCR assay with a lower limit of detection of 40 copies/mL.
8.2.2 Management of Study Participants With Viremia
When viremia (HIV -1 RNA ≥ 50 copies/mL) is detected (Section 4.2.1.1.2) , the investigator 
should query the particip ant regarding adherence to study intervention, intercurrent illness, or 
recent immunization. All cases of viremia must be confirmed, and the participant should 
continue to take the full assigned dosage of study interventi on while awaiting 
confirmation .
8.2.2.1 Viremia Confirmation
Confirmation of viremia requires 2 consecutive plasma HIV -1 RNA results of ≥ 50 copies/mL 
(Section 4.2.1.1.2) with the second sample collected at a “Viremia Confirmation” visit at 
least 2 week s, but not more than 4 weeks from the date of the initial sample. This timeframe 
may be extended if study intervention is interrupted for 1 of the following circumstances:
Intercurrent illness : redraw 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of the illness, during 
which time the participant should continue to receive the assigned dosage of study 
intervention(s) without interruption ;
Immunization : redraw at least 4 weeks following any immunization, during which 
time the participant should continue to receive the assigned dosage of study 
intervention(s) without interruption ;
Toxicity management, noncompliance, or other reason : redraw 2 to 4 weeks 
following resuming the assigned dosage of study interven tion(s).
8.2.2.2 Participants With Clinically significant Viremia ( ≥200 copies/mL)
Study participants with confirmed HIV -1 RNA of ≥200 copies/mL will be assessed for 
development of viral drug resistance (Section 8.2.2.4) and discontinuation from study 
intervention (Section 7.1). Once it is determined that study intervention discontinuati on is 
appropriate, Early Discontinuation of Treatment and End of Treatment Follow -up visit 
procedures should be complete d(Section s1.3.3 and 8.11.3) and the participant managed by 
the investigator per local standard -of-care.
8.2.2.3 Participants W ith Low -level Vi remia ( ≥50 and <200 copies/mL)
Study participants with confirmed HIV -1 RNA of ≥50 and <200 copies/mL should continue 
study intervent ion and all regularly scheduled study visits during which HIV -1 RNA levels 
will be monitored per SoA (approximately every 3 months). Additional visits may be 
conducted to monitor HIV -1 RNA levels more frequently than every 3 months, if

appropriate, after discussion with the Sponsor. Participants with confirmed low -level viremia 
at Week 48 will not be automatically discontinued from study intervention butwill be 
included in the virologic failure rate calculated for the purposes of the primary analyses 
(Section 9.6.1).
Investigators should use their clinical judgment regarding the most appropriate clinical 
management of participants, if more stringent local guidelines apply, and may contact the 
Sponsor’s Clinical Director to discuss questions on clinical management of individual 
participants.
8.2.2.4 Viral Drug Resistance Testing
Participants with confi rmed HIV-1 RN A ≥200 copies/mL at any time during the study will 
be assessed for development of viral drug resistance.
Samples will be collected for genotypic and phenotypic HIV-1 drug resistance testing per 
SoA (Section 1.3 )and used to assess resistance -associated substitutions as applicable during 
the study.
8.2.3 T-and B -Lymphocyte and Natural Killer Cell Profile (TBNK)
A TBNK panel, including CD4+ T -cell count ,will be performed at the central laboratory (see 
Table 16 in Appendix 2). Refer to Section 8.11.5 for guidance on management of participants 
with decreased CD4+ T -cell counts and/or decreased total lymphocyte counts.
8.3 Safety Assessments
Details regarding specific safety procedures/assessments to be performed in this study are 
provided. The total amount of blood/tissue to be drawn/collected over the course of the study, 
including approximate blood volumes drawn/collected by visit and by sample type per 
participant, can be found in Table 17 inAppendix 2.
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA.
8.3.1 Physical Examinations
A complet e physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) as per institutional standard . The full physical 
examination will include examination of body systems including, but not limite d to, general 
appearance, skin, neck, eyes, ears, nose, throat, breast, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph 
nodes, extremities, and nervous system.
Height will also be measured and recorded at the visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3.1).
Height measurem ents should be taken using a stadiometer (recommended, but not required).
Participants should remove their shoes and stand as tall and straight as possible .
A brief directed physical examination will be conducted by an investigator or medically 
qualified designee (consistent with local requirements) per institutional standard. This

examination will be sign-and symptom -directed and based on the participant’s c ondition and 
circumstances. The investigator should note any changes in the participant’s condition (body 
systems) since the last examination, not precluding examination of any body system(s) as 
clinically indicated.
Investigators should pay special attent ion to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.
8.3.1.1 Weight
Weight will be measured and recorded at the visits specified in the SoA (Section 1.3.1). 
Participants should remove their shoes and wear a single layer of clothing at each 
measurement.
8.3.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be measured after approximately 5to10minutes of rest and will include 
temperature, pulse, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Note: Oral temperatures are preferred but not required.
8.3.3 Electrocardiogram s
A local 12-lead ECG will be obtained and reviewed by an investigator or medically qualified 
designee (consistent with local requirements) within 7 days prior to the Day 1 visit and prior 
to the first dose of study intervention as indicated in the SoA. Results must be available prior 
to randomization. Sites are to usean ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart 
rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. Clinically significant findings must be 
documented in the source documents and captured in the appropriate eCRF.
If an ECG is performed for any medical reason while the participant is on study intervention 
or during the follow -up period, any clinically significant changes compared with the baseline
ECG must be captured as AEs.
8.3.4 Confir mation of Contraception and Pregnancy Testing
WOCBP arerequired to use contraception to prevent pregnancy during the study and will be 
tested for pregnancy at each visit as outlined in Section 1.3, Section 5.1, and Appendix 5.
Participants should be asked at study visits per SoA to verbally confirm their use of 
contraception since the prior visit, according to the Contraceptive Guidance in Appendix 5. 
Confirmation should be noted in the source documents for each visit.
Urine pregnancy test kits will be pro vided by the central laboratory, and routine testing will 
be performed by the local laboratory. In the event of a positive urine pregnancy test result, 
serum pregnancy testing must be performed by the central laboratory. If a participant 
becomes pregnant, refer to Section 8.11.6.

8.3.5 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments
Refer to Appendix 2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for 
the timing and frequency.
The investigator or medically qualified designee (consistent wit h local requirements) 
must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically 
relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the case report form 
(CRF). The laboratory reports must be filed with the source docum ents. Clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the 
underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for 
the participant's condition.
All protocol -required laborat ory assessments, as defined in Table 16in Appendix 2 , must 
be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA .
If laboratory values from nonprotocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’ s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SLAB).
For any labora tory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within 42days after the last dose of study intervention, every 
attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or 
baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator .
Management of decreases in CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte counts is described in
Section 8.11.5.
8.3.6 HBV Assessments
Participants coinfected with HIV -1 and HBV who discontinue an antiretroviral medication 
that also has activity against HBV (3TC, FTC, TAF, or TDF )may experience an acute 
exacerbation of HBV . Therefore ,participants who have evidence of past HBV exposure 
(anti-HBc positive) and who meet enrollment criteria will be closely monitored during the 
study.
All eligible participants must be HBsAg negative at screening. Participants who are anti -HBc
positive and HBV DNA positive at screening are excluded. Participants who are anti -HBc 
positive , but HBV DNA n egative at screening are eligible to enroll . For the duration of the 
study, participants positive for anti -HBc should be monitored for possible HBV reactivation. 
Samples will be taken to monitor HBsAg and HBV DNA per the SoA (Section 1.3) .
Investigators sh ould also pay close attention to changes from baseline in ALT, AST, 
bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (included in chemistry laboratory assessments). At Week 
132, participants in Group 2 will be tested for HBsAg, HBV DNA, HBsAb and anti -HBc 
prior to swit ching to DOR/ISL at Week 144. Participants who do not meet the criteria above 
07YG7P

PRODUCT:   MK-8591A  86
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   018 -06  
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
will not be offered the option to switch to DOR/ISL due to the potential for HBV 
reactivation.
Participants who are confirmed to be HBsAg or HBV DNA positive after randomization will 
be unblinded and be managed by the investigator per local standard -of-care and /orreferred 
for management of their HBV infection. Participants may be allowed to continue study 
intervention if deemed medically appropriate upon consultation with the Sponsor.
8.3.7 Tobacco and Alcohol Assessments
Participants’ use of tobacco and alcohol will be obtained and recorded at Weeks48,96and 
144.
8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Reporta ble 
Safety Events
The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and 
assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, 
SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in A ppendix 3.
Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant 
(or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative).
The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. 
Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs , SAEs, and other reportable safety 
events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.
The investigator, who is a qualified physician, will assess events that meet the definition of 
an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events with respect to seriousness, 
intensity/toxicity and causality .
8.4.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 
Safety Event Information
All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the participant provides 
documented informed consent but before intervention randomization must be reported b y the 
investigator if the participant is receiving placebo run- in or other run -in treatment, if the 
event causes the participant to be excluded from the study, or is the result of a protocol -
specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or d iscontinuation of usual 
therapy, diet, or a procedure.
From the time of intervention randomization through study duration, all AEs, SAEs, and 
other reportable safety events must be reported by the investigator.

Additionally, any SAE brought to the attentio n of an investigator at any time outside of the 
time period specified in the previous paragraph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor 
if the event is considered related to study intervention.
For infants born to participants who become pregnant and consent to infant safety data 
collection, SAEs (including perinatal HIV -1 infection) occurring through 1 year of age must 
be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event .
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE sor SAEs or other reportable safety events 
in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, 
the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.
All initial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and 
reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 4 .
For participants who continue in a rollover study, the collection requirements of AEs, SAEs 
and other reportable safety events in this protocol are amended as follows:
AEs, SAEs and other reportable safety events will be collected and recorded through the 
last study visit in this protocol.
Pregnancy outcome and infant SAEs will be captured in this protocol, if pregnancy 
exposure is reported in this protocol.
The last collection of non -serious AEs (including cancer that does not meet serious 
criteria) will be at the last study visit in this protocol.
Note: All new SAEs (including those considered related to study intervention) and other new 
reportable safety events (including pregnancy exposure) that occur after the last study visit 
will be collected in the rollover study.

8.4.2 Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE sand/or SAEs and other 
reportable safety events. Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is 
the preferred method to inquire about AE occu rrence.
8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE s, SAE s, and other reportable safety events,
including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), 
cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow-up (as de fined in Section 7.3). In 
addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in
randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given 
in Appendix 3.
8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requiremen ts for SAE
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the 
safety of a study intervention under clinical investig ation are met.
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulator y requirements and global laws and 
regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators.
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and 
forwarded to investigators as necessary.
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other 
specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it 
along with the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements .
8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding
Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any 
pregnancy or infant e xposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to 
the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor.
All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnanc y. 
Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, 
blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as 
serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome 
(health of infant) must also be reported.

For infants born to participants who become pregnant and consent to infant safety data 
collection, SAEs (including perinatal HIV -1 infection) occurring through 1 year of age must 
be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event .
8.4.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs
This section is not applicable to the study.
8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s)
Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor.
Events of clinical interest for this study include:
1.An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the 
upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less 
than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory 
testing or unsche duled laboratory testing.*
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The 
purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require 
an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. T he study site guidance for 
assessment and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File 
Binder (or equivalent).
2.A ≥30% reduction from average baseline **in CD4+ T -cell count or total lymphocyte 
count while on study interventio n.
3.A CD4+ T -cell count of <200 cells/mm3  while on study intervention from either (a) 
participants whose average baseline **CD4+ T -cell count was ≥200 cells/mm3or (b) 
participants whose CD4+ T- cell count increased to ≥200 cells/mm3for 3 consecutive 
months while on study intervention.
**Note: The average baseline value for CD4+ T -cell count and total lymphocyte count is 
defined as the average value between screening (within 45 days prior to the first dose of 
study medication) and 
Day 1. For participants switching from BIC/FTC/TAF to DOR/ISL 
at Week 144 (Group 2), the baseline is defined as the value from the Week 144 visit (or if 
not available, the last result prior to Week 144). If there are ≥2 values at Week 144, then 
use the mos t recent value.  The first on -treatment value that reaches the above CD4+ T-
cell or total lymphocyte criteria should be reported as an ECI . See Section 8. 11.5 for 
further guidance on the management of participants meeting CD4+ T -cell and total
lymphocyte c riteria.

8.5 Treatment of Overdose
In this study, an overdose is any dose higher than the prescribed dose of study intervention.
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose.
Decisions regarding dose interruptions will be made by the investigator in consultation with 
the Sponsor Clinical Director based on the clinical evaluation of the participant.
8.6 Pharmacokinetics
8.6.1 Blood Collection for Plasma ISL
Venous blood samples will be collected for measurement of ISL. Sample collection, storage,
and shipment instructions for plasma samples will be provided in the laboratory manual .
Investigational PK samples will be collected from all participants as outlined in the SoA 
(Section 1.3). Analysis of these samples will be triggered by the Sponsor as needed.
Population PK samples will be collected from all participants as outlined in Table 5 . The 
time of the doses of study interventions taken prior to the sample colle ction will be verbally 
reported to study staff by the participant and recorded in the appropriate source 
documentation.
For participants who routinely take their study intervention during the day, a predose and 
postdose sample will be taken at the Week 4 visit ( Table 5 ). Participants who routinely take 
their s tudy intervention in the evening should continue to do so, and only 1 sample will be

8.8.1 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection
The p lanned genetic analysis sample should be drawn for planned analysis of the association 
between genetic variants in DNA and drug response. This sample will not be collected at the 
site if there is either a local law or regulation prohibiting collection, or if the IRB/IEC d oes 
not approve the collection of the sample for these purposes. If the sample is collected, 
leftover extracted DNA will be stored for future biomedical research if the participant 
provides documented informed consent for future biomedical research . If the planned genetic
analysis is not approved, but future biomedical r esearch is approved and consent is given, 
this sample will be collected for the purpose of future biomedical r esearch.
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instruct ion for planned genetic analysis samples 
will be provided in the operations/laboratory manual.
8.8.2 Inflam mation
Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the inflammatory and thrombotic response as 
measured by the following laboratory markers as indicated in the SoA (Sectio n 1.3):
IL-6
D-dimer
sCD-163
hs-CRP
8.8.3 Renal Function

Participants with diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) or insulin resistance are not required to 
have the blood draw for insulin testing.
8.8.5 Waist and Hip Measurements
Participants should be asked to stand erect, relaxed and should not hold in their stomach 
during measurements. Waist circumference will be measured midway between the iliac crest 
and the lower rib margin. Hip circumference will be measured at the intertroc hanteric level. 
Measurements should be taken with a stretch -resistant measuring tape held parallel to the 
floor. Waist -to-hip ratios will be calculated as waist (cm)/hip (cm) circumferences.
BMI will be calculated using weight and height measurements taken as specified in the SoA
(Section 1.3).
8.8.6 DEXA Assessments
DEXA images to monitor fat distribution and BMD should be collected from all 
participants/sites willing and able to have the test performed and according to country law
(Section 1.3). These participants will undergo total body DEXA scans for BMD of the spine 
and hip as well as peripheral and trunk fat . Participants will not be excluded from 
participation in the study if unwilling/unable to have DEXA images performed.
Only those participants who are confirmed eligible to be randomized will undergo DEXA 
images for BMD of the spine and hip as well as peripheral and trunk fat. For Day 1 
(baseline), DEXA images should be performed after eligibility is confirmed and may be 
performed up to 14 days after rando mization. The DEXA images at subsequent visits should 
be performed ± 14 days of the scheduled visit. Only participants with valid baseline DEXA 
images should have DEXA images performed at subsequent visits as indicated in the SoA 
(Section 1.3).
DEXA images will be evaluated by a central imaging reader ; these analyses are not 
performed in real time and will not be provided to the site/participant. For clinical 
management of the participant, the DEXA images should be reviewed and interpreted locally 
by a qual ified individual . Clinically significant findings noted in the local interpretation of 
the baseline DEXA images should be recorded in the participant’s medical history. Clinically
significant findings noted in the local interpretation of the DEXA images du ring the 
treatment period should be recorded appropriately. Refer to the Site Imaging Manual for 
additional details regarding DEXA procedures including participant preparation instructions 
to be considered before DEXA imaging .
DEXA should not be performed on pregnant participants.

8.11 Visit Requirements
Visit requirements are outlined in Section 1.3. Specific procedure -related details are provided 
inSection 8.
8.11.1 Screening /Rescreening
Screening
Prior to randomization, potential participants will be evaluated to determine that they fulfill 
the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5 . Participants are expected to enroll as soon as 
possible after eligibility is confirmed. In cases of unexpected delays in receiving repeat 
screening laboratory results, a screening period of up to 45 days is allowed.
Rescreening
If the screening window has been exceeded, participants are allowed to rescreen one time 
after approval from the Sponsor. Once a participant has s tarted the rescreening process, a 
new screening period (ie, an additional ≤45-day window) will begin, during which time 
screening procedures willbe repeated.
The following assessments must be repeated for participants who are rescreened:
Vital signs, weig ht,and directed physical examination
Review medical history and prior/concomitant medications for new information

MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
All laboratory assessments (includ esserum β-hCG pregnancy testing for WOCBP)
Review of AEs
If the informed consent form has been updated, participants should be reconsented before
rescreening. If no updates have been made, documented informed consent during the original 
screening period should be reviewed with the participant and a verbal recons ent to continue
in the study should be documented.
If a participant had a Day 1 ECG during the original screening period, it should be repeated
(at the Day 1 visit or within 7 days prior) .
If a participant had a baseline Day 1 DEXA scan during the original screening period, and 
>30 days have elapsed, the Day 1 DEXA should be repeated. If <30 days have elapsed since 
the DEXA it is not necessary to repeat the Day 1 DEXA scan during rescreening .
Participants who were previously considered screen failures because the duration of baseline 
ART was <3 months are allowed to rescreen if they have continued to receive BIC/FTC/TAF 
therapy with documented viral suppression (HIV- 1 RNA <50 copies/mL) for ≥3 months 
before the rescreening visit and have no history of prior virologic treatment failure on any 
past or current regimen.
8.11.2 Treatment Period
All procedures and their timing should be completed as per SoA (Section 1.3) .
8.11.2.1 Fasting
Visits at Day 1, Week 24, Week 48, Week 96 , Week 120 and Week 144 require that 
participants fast (ie, do not consume any food or beverages except water) for at least 8 hours 
prior to the visit. The investigator/study coordinator are responsible to remind participants to 
fast prior to these visits and to confirm with participants their fasting status in the appropriate 
source documentation .
8.11.2.2 Optional Nurse Visits and Telephone Visits
A visiting nurse service may be utilized (if locally available and approved for use) at any 
visit after a participant is randomized. If a visiting nurse service is utilized for any visit, the 
investigator should contact the participant by phone on the same day as the nurse visit, or as 
soon as possible to perform an investigator AE assessment . Refer to the nursing manual for 
additional details.
For visits conducted by the visiting nurse, whole blood for FBR samples will not be collected 
by the visiting nurs e.Participants should be instructed to return to the site within 2- 4 weeks 
from the scheduled visit for collection of whole blood for FBR , when possible. If an 
unscheduled visit for collection of whole blood for FBR is not possible, the sample should be 
drawn at the next scheduled visit at the site.

8.11.2.3 End of Study Week 144 Visit
Week 144 represents the end of th is study.
Participants who were randomized to Group 1 will be given 2 options at the Week 144 visit :
1.End participation in thisstudy and resume local ly available treatment of their choice. 
These participants should have an End of Treatment Follow -up visit 42 days ( +7 
days) after the last dose of study medication.
2.Provide documented consent to participate in therollover study. The rollover study 
will p rovide open- label DOR/ISL to participants.
Participants who were randomized to Group 2 will be given 2 options at the Week 144 visit :
1.End participation in thisstudy and resume locally available treatment of their choice. 
These participants should have an End of Treatment Follow -up visit 42 days ( +7 
days) after the last dose of study medication.
2.Continue participation in this study ,which will entail switching to open -label 
DOR/ISL , which they wi ll receive for 12 weeks to allow monitoring of safety and 
tolerability . Participants who choose this option will receive DOR/ISL through 
Week 156, at which time they would be given the option to continue in the rollover 
study. Documented consent to partici pate in the rollover study would be obtained at 
Week 156.
Participants who are pregnant at Week 144 will be managed per Section 8.11. 6.Any 
participant in Group 2 who is pregnant at Week 144 will not be given the option to switch.
Management of participant s with decreased CD4+ T -cell counts and/or total lymphocyte 
counts is as follows:
See Section 6.7 for management of participants entering the rollover study who have 
CD4+ T- cell and/or total lymphocyte count decreases that meet ECI criteria at their 
last study visit in this study (ie, rollover enrollment visit).
Participants who received DOR/ISL not participating in the rollover study who have 
decreases in CD4+ T -cell and/or total lymphocyte counts at their Week 144 (Group 1) 
or Week 156 (Group 2) visit that meet ECI criteria or aredecreased by >10% of their
average baseline value require additional follow -up monitoring of CD4+ T -cell and 
lymphocyte counts per Section 6.7 and Section 8.11. 5.

When it is determined that discontinuation from study intervention is appropriate, the 
participant should have both an Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit (Section 8.11.3.1 ) 
and an End of Treatment Follow -up visit (Sec tion 8.11.3.2 ) conducted. After the visit 
procedures are completed, the participant will be withdrawn from the study and managed for 
the treatment of HIV -1 per local standard -of-care.
Guidance for management of participants who discontinue studyintervention due to 
confirmed decreased CD4+ T -cell count s and/or decreased total lymphocyte counts is 
provided in Section 8.11.5.
If participants receiving DOR/ISL discontinue study intervention forother reasons 
and the CD4+ T- cell count and/or total lymphocyte count at the Early Discontinuation 
of Treatment visit is decreased by >10% of their average baseline value or meets ECI 
criteria, additional monitoring is required per Section 8.11.5.
8.11.3.1 Early Discontinuation of T reatment
Participants who discontinue treatment early for any reason should have an Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit as outlined in Section 1.3. 3. If early discontinuation 
occurs during the timeframe of a scheduled study visit, the assessments for the Early 
Discontinuation of Treatment visit should be conducted.
8.11.3.2 End of Treatment Follow-up Visit
Participants who discontinue study intervention at any time for any reason(s) will have a 
safety follow -up visit in -clinic 42days (+7 days) after the last dose of study intervention.
Assessments for thisEnd of Treatment Follow -upvisit are outlined in Section 1.3.3.
Participants (in Group 1 who complete the Week 144 visit or in Group 2 who complete the 
Week 156 visit) who do not consent to participate in the rollover study or do not agree to 
participate in the optional 12-week switch to open -label DOR/ISL (Group 2) at the Week 144 
visit should also have an End of Treatment Follow -up visit.   
Participants discontinuing DOR/ISL with speci fied decreases in CD4+ T -cell and/or total 
lymphocyte counts will be followed monthly for monitoring of CD4+ T- cell and total 
lymphocyte counts recovery as per Section 8.11.5.
8.11.4 Viremia Confirmation
If a participant has a viral load of ≥50 copies/mL at any time during the study, a Viremia 
Confirmation visit must be conducted within 2to 4 weeks of the initial HIV -1 viremia
(Section s1.3.2 and 4.2.1.1) . If a scheduled visit is to occur within the timeframe that a 
participant would return for a viremia confirmation visit, the as sessments for the scheduled 
visit should be conducted, and the HIV viral drug resistance sample must be collected .

Section 1.3.3.
8.11.5.3 Participants Discontinued from Study Intervention for Other Reasons And
Have Decreases in CD4+ T -cell and/or Total Lymphocyte Counts
Participants who discontinue study intervention for any other reason including participants 
who decline par ticipation in the rollover study andare found to have decreases in CD4+ T -
cell and/or total lympho cyte counts of >10% of the average baseline values or that meet ECI 
criteria at the Early Discontinuation of Treatment Visit should be unblinded (if applicable) to 
determine their follow -up as noted below :
Participants who were receiving DOR/ISL should undergo assessments specified at
the End of Treatment Follow -up visit at Day 42 (Section 1.3.5).   
oIf the decrease (s)of >10 % of average baseline or a decrease in CD4+ T -cell 
counts to <200 cells/mm3is confirmed at this visit , participants should continue to 
be monitored monthly until 2 values 12 weeks apart of CD4+ T -cell counts and 
total lymphocyte counts are not decreased by > 10% of the average basel ine value
or the CD4+ T- cell count is ≥200 cells/mm3, respectively . 
oIf the decrease (s)of >10% of average baseline or a decrease in CD4+ T- cell 
counts to <200 cells/mm3is not confirmed at this visit , then no further follow -up 
for CD4+ T cell or total lymphocyte counts is required.
Participants who were receiving BIC/FTC/TAF should have an End of T reatment 
Follow -up visit per Section 8.11.3.2 ( and Section 1.3.3) and no further monitoring is 
needed .
8.11.6 Clinical Management of Participants Who Become Pr egnant
If a participant becomes pregnant (confirmed by a positive serum pregnancy test), the 
investigator should refer her to a local provider for appropriate obstetric (prenatal) care per 
local standard of care. All pregnancies must be followed to complet ion or termination of the 
pregnancy by the investigator per Section 8.4.5. Severity assessment of AEs that are 
pregnancy -related complications should follow guidance provided as part of the DAIDS table 
version 2.1 “Addendum 1: Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies ,” 
particularly the section “Complications of Pregnancy .”
If a participant’s study intervention is blinded, the study intervention assignment must be 
unblinded by the investigator (Section 8.1.10).
The site will discuss with the participant:
Joining a pregnancy registry (the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry), which collects 
information about the outcome of the pregnancy

Consenting to infant safety data collection per Sections 8.1.1.3 and 8.11. 6.4
Her intended breastfeedi ng status (Section 8.11. 6.3)
Appropriateness of continuing study intervention based on available data and local 
standard- of care guidelines (where allowed by local regulations, health authorities, 
and ethics committees)
8.11.6.1 Continuing Study Intervention
Participants who become pregnant and consent to continue their assigned study intervention 
(Section 8.1.1.4) should complete all remaining protocol -specified visits and procedures 
(with the exception of DEXA scans) per the regular schedule in the SoA (Section 1.3 .1and
1.3.2). As the SoA specifies study visits at least every 12 weeks, participants will have a 
study visit approximately during each trimester and postpartum (ie, the first visit after 
delivery [~12 weeks after the 3rd trimester vis it and ≤8 weeks after delivery]).
For participants receiving BIC/FTC/TAF, the investigator should refer to local product 
circular and local guidelines to determine if treatment may be continued. Those participants 
in Group 2 who consent to continue BIC/FTC /TAF and are pregnant atWeek 144 will not be 
eligible to switch to DOR/ ISL. The participant will continue with the protocol -specified 
visits per the SoA ( with the exception of DEXA and PK collection) per the schedules in the 
SoA ( Section 1.3) for the dura tion of their pregnancy .
The participant’s prenatal care should be coordinated between the investigator and the local 
obstetric care provider. The investigator (or designee) is responsible for obtaining relevant 
clinical and laboratory data from the obstet ric care provider to monitor the safety and well -
being of the mother and fetus. Relevant data obtained by the site should be entered into the 
appropriate CRF and source documentation. The participant’s medical records will be 
collected and reviewed by the study site for:
Clinical safety laboratory assessments
Plasma HIV -1 RNA level
Results of Week 20 to 22 or second trimester ultrasound(s) providing gestational age 
and anatomic survey
Any complications associated with the pregnancy
Outcome of pregnancy
Information that could indicate congenital abnormalities
For participant swho are pregnant at the last regularly scheduled study visit, their visit 
schedule will be extended through the duration of the pregnancy to allow assessments 
through each trimester and postpartum (Section 1.3.4). For participants on DOR/ISL, at the

completion of the pregnancy, continued access to DOR/ISL will be offered per Section 6.7. 
For participants on BIC/FTC/TAF, at the completion of the pregnancy and postpartum visit, 
the participant will have completed the study.
For participants who continue DOR/ISL, PKsamples will be collected at their scheduled visit 
during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rdtrimesters and postpartum to evaluate DOR and ISL concentration 
levels per Table 6. These samples will be used to characterize the PK profile of DOR/ISL 
during pregnancy. Participants who do not learn of their pregnancy until the 2ndtrimester will 
not have a 1sttrimester PK sample.

8.11.6.2 Discontinuing Study Intervention for Pregnancy
Participants who become pregn ant and discontinue their assigned study intervention should 
have an Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit per the SoA (Section 1.3.3). If the decision 
to discontinue study intervention occurs during the timeframe of a scheduled study visit, the 
assessm ents for the Early Discontinuation of Treatment visit should be conducted at that 
time. In addition, these participants will have an End of Treatment Follow -up visit in -clinic 
42 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study intervention (Section 1.3. 3). 
The investigator (or local HIV care provider, if not the study site) should develop a new 
treatment plan per local standard- of-care before discontinuing study intervention to minimize 
the risk of a gap in combination ART.
8.11.6.3 Participants Who Choose to Breastfee d
If a participant chooses to breastfeed, they should discontinue study intervention before 
initiating breastfeeding (Section 7.1) and be followed in the study per Section 8.11.6 .2. The 
investigator (or local HIV care provider, if not the study site) shoul d make every effort to 
develop a new treatment plan (per local guidance) withinsufficient time prior to delivery to 
minimize the likelihood of a gap in ART.

For participants who become pregnant while receiving study intervention, or within 42 days 
after the last dose of study intervention, the data in Section 8.11. 6.4.1 should be obtained by 
the site and entered into the appropriate CRF and source documentation. In addition, study 
staff should obtain results from any ultrasound sperformed per local standard- of-care.
Infant SAEs, including perinatal HIV-1 infection, will be collected as per Section 8.4.1 and 
should be reviewed at the participant’s scheduled study visits that occur during this time.

Pharmacokinetic 
AnalysesThe primary objective and hypothesis will be assessed using a 2-sided multiplicity -
adjusted 95% CI for the difference between treatment groups (Group 1 minus Group 2) 
in the percentage of participants with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 48. The CI 
will be based on the unstratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and 
Nurminen, M. 1985] , an unconditional, asymptotic method .
The FAS, which is defined as all randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of 
study intervention ,will serve as the primary analysis population for this study . The 
FDA ‘snapshot’ algorithm will be used as the primary approach to analy sis; missing 
data at the primary timepoint will be imputed as an HIV -1 RNA result ≥50 copies/mL 
for those who discontinu e study intervention prior to the Week 48 analysis window 
due to lack of efficacy, or who discontinue study intervention prior to the Week 48 
analysis window due to a reason other than lack of efficacy and have the last available 
on-treatment HIV -1 RNA result ≥50 copies/mL .
Statistical 
Methods for Key 
Safety AnalysesPoint estimates and 2-sided nominal 95% CIs will be provided using the Miettinen and 
Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] for the difference between 
treatment groups (Group 1 minus Group 2) for the following:
Thepercentage of participants in the broad AE categories (ie, Tier -2 events) 
consisting of the percentage of participants with any AE, with a drug -related AE, 
with an SAE, with a Grade 3 to 4 AE, with an AE that is both drug -related and 
serious, with an AE that is both Grade 3 to 4 and drug -related, who discontinued 
study intervention due to a drug-related and non -drug-related AE, and with AE(s) 
leading to death .
Specific AEs (preferred terms), SOCs, or PDLC soccurring with an incidence 
≥4participants in either treatment group .
The percentage of participants with a cardiac SAE.
Point estimates and 2-sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CIs will be provided using 
ANC OVA model sfor the difference between treatment groups (Group 1 minus Group 
2) for the c hange from baseline in weight at Weeks 48and 96 .
Interim Analyses The following interim analyses and data summaries are planned. Details are provided 
in Section 9 .7.
Week 24 interim analysis: An interim analysis to assess futility will be performed 
by an external unblinded statistician when 40% of participants have compl eted 
Week 24 assessments . All available efficacy and safety data for all participants 
enrolled by that time will be reviewed. Treatment level results will be provided by 
an external unblinded statistician to the eDMC. If the upper bound of the 2-sided
multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference (Group 1 minus Group 2) 
in the percentage of participants with Week 24 HIV-1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL is 
greater than 8 percentage points and exclude s 0, consideration may be given to stop 
the study .
Week 48 efficacy and safety analyses (to be conducted by the Sponsor and results 
shared with the eDMC) .
Periodic efficacy and safety reviews (eDMC reviews) to be performed every 4 to 
6months or as specified in the eDMC charter .

Multiplicity For statistical rigor, a small amount of alpha ( α =0.000 01) will be set aside for the 
futility assessment and each additional eDMC evaluation. An allowance will be made 
such that a total of up to 5 of the unblinded eDMC reports (including the Week 24 
interim analysis ) may be presented prior to the evaluation of the primary efficacy 
hypotheses at Week 48. If further eDMC reviews occur between the evaluation of the 
primary efficacy hypothesis at Week 48 and the evaluation of the secondary 
hypotheses at W eek 96, further reduction in the alpha of 0.000 01 for each eDMC 
review will be made for the Week 96 hypotheses .
The following efficacy hypotheses will be test edsequentially at a 1 -sided 2.5% Type 1
error rate adjusted for the number of eDMC reports in the following order:
1)Primary efficacy hypothesis (H1) testing non -inferiority of HIV- 1 RNA 
≥50copies/mL between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 48
2)Secondary efficacy hypothesis (H4) testing superiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 96
3)Secondary efficacy hypothesis (H2) testing superiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 48
Testing will stop with the first of these tests failing to reach statistical significance and 
all subsequent tests would not be considered for statistical significance. In this way, the 
overall 1- sided 2.5% Type 1 error rate in testing these hypotheses is strongly 
controlled.
The secondary safety hypotheses, (H5) testing superiority of having lower mean 
increase from baseline in body weight for Group 1 vs. Group 2 at Week 48 and (H6) 
testing superiority of having lower mean increase from baseline in body we ight for 
Group 1 vs. Group 2 at Week 96, will be tested independently of all efficacy 
hypotheses. The approach for testing these safety hypotheses at a strongly controlled 1 -
sided 2.5% Type 1 error rate adjusted for the number of eDMC reports is described in 
Section 9.8. 
Sample Size and 
Power The planned sample size is 578 participants to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
Group 1 or Group 2 . The primary hypothesis will be assessed based on the percentage
of participants with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50copies/mL at Week 48. The non -inferiority will 
be concluded if the upper bound of the 2- sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the 
difference in the percentage of participants with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50copies/mL (Group 1
minus G roup 2 ) is less than 4 percentage points. If the true rate of participants with 
HIV-1 RNA ≥50copies/mL at Week 48 is 2% in both groups, this study with 
289participants per group has 85% power to demonstrate non -inferiority.
9.2 Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding
The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the 
Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor .
Day 1 through Week 48 will be conducted as a double -blind study under in -house bli nding 
procedures. The official, final database for Day 1 through Week 48 will not be unblinded 
until medical/scientific review has been performed, protocol deviations have been identified, 
and data have been declared final and complete. The clinical databa se and Sponsor personnel 
directly involved in the analysis and reporting associated with the Week 48 CSR will become 
unblinded at the time of the Week 48 analysis, although study participants and site personnel 
will remain blinded until Week 96.

9.3 Hypotheses/Estimation
Objectives and hypotheses of the study are stated in Section 3.
9.4 Analysis Endpoints
Efficacy and safety endpoints for the study, which will be evaluated for within - and/or 
between treatment differences, are listed below, followed by the descriptions of the 
derivations of selected endpoints.
9.4.1 Efficacy/Pharmacokinetics Endpoints
9.4.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints
An ini tial description of efficacy measures is provided in Section 4.
Percentage of Participants W ith HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL
The Abbott RealTime PCR assay with a reliable lower limit of quantification of 
40copies/mL will be used to measure the HIV- 1 RNA level in blood samples obtained at 
each visit. The primary objective will be assessed based upon the percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA ≥ 50copies/mL at Week 48. Asecondary objective will assess the 
percentage of participan ts with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Week 96and Week 144.
Percentage of Participants W ith HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL and Percentage of 
Participants W ith HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL
Secondary objectives addressing the antiretroviral activity following a switch to DOR/ISL
will be assessed on the basis of the percentage of participants achieving HIV -1 RNA 
<40copies/mL at W eek 48, Week 96and Week 144 , as well as the percentage of participants
achieving HIV -1 RNA < 50copies/mL at Week 48 , Week 96and Week 144.
Change From Baseline in CD4+ T -cell Count
Change from baseline in CD4+ T- cell count will be estimated at each timepoint at which 
CD4+ T- cell count is collected. A secondary objective will assess the change from baseline 
in CD4+ T -cell count at Week 4 8,Week 96, and Week 144.

For the analysi s ofchange from baseline in CD4+ T -cell count , baseline measurements are 
defined as the Day 1 value for each participant. In the rare event when data for this visit are 
missing, the value obtained at the most recent screening visit will be used as baseline , when 
available .For assessments of change from baseline in Group 2 at Week 156, baseline will be 
the Week 144 measurement (or , if the Week 144 measurement is not available, the last 
measurement prior to the switch to DOR/ISL).
Clinically significant Confirmed Viremia
Participants with confirmed virologic rebound as defined in Section 4.2.1.1 .2will be 
identified.
Viral Resistance -associated Substitutions
Participants who mee t the definition of confirmed virologic rebound ( Section 4.2.1.1 .2), or 
who discontinue study intervention for another reason and have HIV- 1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL 
at the time of discontinuation, will be assessed for development of viral drug resistance .
Among such participants , those with HIV- 1 RNA ≥400 copies/mL will be included in
resistance analyses . In addition, anyone for whom available genotypic or phenotypic data 
show evidence of resistanc e,irrespective of viral load, will also be included inresistance 
analyses. The resistance analysis will count the number of participants who have evidence of 
resistance -associated with each study intervention and will be summarized with primary 
interest at Week 48, Week 96and Week 144.
Time to Loss of Virologic Response
TLOVR will be assessed at Week 48, Week 96 and Week 144.
For participants who have 2 consecutive HIV -1 RNA values (measured at least 2 week s
apart) ≥50 copies/mL during the study, TLOVR is the time between Day 1 and the date of the 
first of the 2 consecutive HIV -1 RNA values ≥ 50copies/mL.
For participants who sustain HIV- 1 RNA <50 copies/mL, TLOVR is censored at the time of 
the last available measurement.
9.4.1.2 Pharmac okinetic Endpoint
PKsamples collected from all participants as described in the SoA and Section 8.6 will be 
used to evaluate PK concentrations of ISL, and as appropriate , PK-efficacy , PK-
pharmacodynamic, and PK -AE relationships of ISL.

9.4.2 Safety Endpoints
An initial description of safety measures is provided in Section 4.
Adverse Events
The following clinical and laboratory AEs will be summarized: 1) participants with at least 
1AE; 2) participants with at least 1 drug- related AE; 3) participants with at least 1 SAE; 
4)participants with at least 1 Grade 3 to 4 AE; 5 ) participants with at least 1 serious and 
drug-related AE; 6) participants with at least 1 AE, which is both Grade 3 to 4 and drug -
related; 7) participants who discontinued study intervention due to a drug-related and non-
drug-related AE; and 8 ) participants with AE(s) leading to death .
Predefined Limits of Change in Laboratory Parameters
For the summari es of laboratory tests, participants must have both a baseline and post-
randomiz ation on-treatment measurement to be included. Participants’ laboratory values 
(based on their most abnormal laboratory test values, in the direction of interest, while on 
study intervention) will be classified as to whether or not they fall outside of the PDLC and 
are worse in grade (ie, more abnormal in the direction of interest) than at baseline. The 
criteria are adapted from theDAIDS table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric 
Adverse Events, July 2017, v ersion 2.1 (Appendix 3).A listing of the participants who meet 
the criteria will also be provided.
Weight, Laboratory, and Radiological Markers
The mean change from baseline to Week 48 , Week 96and Week 144 in select weight, 
laboratory, and radiological markers of fasting lipid and metabolic profiles, renal function, 
inflammation, and body composition will be summarized.
Change from baseline in weight will be summarized at each timepoint at which weight is 
colle cted. A secondary objective will assess the change from baseline in weight at Week 48 , 
Week 96,and Week 144.
For analyses of change from baseline in weight , laboratory, and radiological parameters , 
baseline measurements are defined as the Day 1 value for each participant. In the rare event 
when data for this visit are missing, the value obtained at the most recent screening visit will 
be used as baseline , when available .For assessments of change from baseline in Group 2 at
Week s148 and 156, baseline will be the Week 144measurement (or, if the Week 144 
measurement is not available, the last measurement prior to the switch to DOR/ISL ).
Thebaseline measurement for analyses of DEXA will be defined in the sSAP.

each treatment group .
9.5 Analysis Populations
9.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Population s
9.5.1.1 Full Analysis Set
The FAS will serve as the primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. 
The FAS population consists of all randomized participants who:
Receive at least 1 dose of study intervention
Have baseline data for those analyses that require baseline data
Participants will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized for the 
analyses of efficacy data using the FAS population.
9.5.1.2 Per-Protocol Analysis Set
The secondary analysis set for the efficacy analyses is defined as the PP analysis set, which 
will include all participants in the FAS who have not committed any major protocol 
violations that could impact the assessment of efficacy , including violation of key entry 
criteria. Participants will be grouped according to the treatment to which they are 
randomized.
Participants meeting any of the following criteria will be excluded from the PP analysis set:
Participants who meet the exclusion criteria for receiving any ongoing prohibited 
therapies listed in Table 3.
Nonadherence to study intervention : participants with <95% d rug compliance rate.
Participants who become pregnant.
Any additional criteria resulting in exclusion from the PP analysis set will be provided in the 
sSAP and/or CSR and will be identified prior to unblinding of the Sponsor at Week 48 .
The composition of the PP analysis set will vary by the analysis timepoint, based on the 
number of participants who satisfy the PP criteria at that timepoint .
9.5.1.3 Resistance Analysis Subset
The resistance analysis subset will include all participants in the FAS with confirmed HIV -1 
RNA ≥400 copies/mL and any participant sfor whom available genotypic or phenotypic data 
show evidence of resistance ,irrespective of viral load.

9.5.2 Safety Analysis Population
The APaT population wi ll be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The APaT 
population consists of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study 
intervention. Participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study 
intervention they actually received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT population. 
For most participants, this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. 
Participants who take incorrect study intervention for the entire treatment period will be 
included in the treatment group corresponding to the study intervention actually received.
Participants in Group 2 who receive at least 1 dose of open -label DOR/ISL will be included 
in summaries and analyses from Week 144 through Week 156.
At lea st 1 laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1 dose of 
study intervention is required for inclusion in the analysis of each specific parameter. To 
assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
9.6 Statistica l Methods
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary 
objectives. Methods related to PK analysis and modeling will be described in a separate 
modeling and simulation plan authored by the department of Quantitative Pharmacology and 
Pharmacometrics. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP.
9.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses
Time Window s
Table 7lists the definition of time windows that will be used for the purposes of the 
statistical analyses and the target relative day for the scheduled visits in the study , which will 
be used for a ll analyses by timepoint (with the exception of DEXA assessments) . The last
available on-treatment measurement within a window will be used for analyses at a specific 
timepoint, unless otherwise specified. Results from additional timepoints beyond Week 156
may be summarized, and day -range rules for determining the analysis time windows will 
follow the same pattern where the ranges start and end at the midpoints between target days.
Analysis windows for DEXA measurements will be provided in the sSAP.

FDA Snapshot Algorithm and Missing Data Approaches
There are 3 types of missing values:
Intermittent missing values due to a missed or skipped visit or due to an inadequate
sample;
Non-intermittent missing values due to premature study intervention discontinuations 
because of treatment -related reasons such as, “clinical adverse experience ” 
(regardless of relationship to study intervention), “laboratory adverse experience ”
(regardless of relationship to study intervention), and “withdrew based on HIV -1 
RNA results ”;
Non-intermittent missing values due to premature study intervention discontinuations 
because of other reasons which are not related to treatment such as “ loss to follow -
up”, “protocol violation” , “participant withdrew consent ”, etc.
Three approaches will be used to handle missing value s.The primary approach for analysis 
of the percentage of participants w ith HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL is the FDA “snapshot” 
algorithm [Food and Drug Administration (CBER) 2015] . Virologic outcome will be defined 
according to the following categories:
HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL : participa nts who have the last available on -treatment 
HIV-1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL within the time point of interest analysis 
window specified in Table 7.
HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL : this includes participants
1)Who have the last available on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement 
≥50copies/mL within the time point of interest analysis window specified in 
Table 7.
2)Who do not have on -treatment HIV -1 RNA data in the time point of interest 
analysis window and
a)Who discontinue study intervention prior to or in the time point of 
interest analysis window due to lack of efficacy, or
b)Who discontinue s tudy intervention prior to or in the time point of 
interest analysis window due to reasons other than lack of efficacy and 
have the last available on -treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement ≥50 
copies/mL .
No Virologic Data in Specified Analysis Time Window : this includes participants 
who do not have on -treatment HIV -1 RNA data in the time point of interest analysis 
window because of the following:

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   018 -06  
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
1)Discontinued study intervention due to AE or death: this includes participants 
who discontinued study intervent ion because of an AE or death at any time
point from Day 1 through the analysis window if this resulted in no on-
treatment HIV -1 RNA measurements during the specified window and have 
the last available on -treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL .In 
addition, this category will include participants who discontinued study 
intervention because of an AE or death and had no on -treatment HIV -1 RNA 
measurements during the entirety of the study.
2)Discontinued study intervention for other r easons : this includes participants 
who discontinued study intervention prior to or in the time point of interest 
analysis window due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or AE/death (ie,
lost to follow -up, non- compliance with study intervention, physician decision, 
protocol deviation, withdrawal by participan t, etc. )and have the last available 
on-treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL .In addition, this 
category will include participants who discontinued study intervention due to 
reasons other than lack of efficacy or AE/death and had no on -treatment HIV -
1 RNA measurements during the entirety of the study.
3) On study intervention but missing data in window : only data in the predefined 
analysis window can be used for the statistical analysis at a given time point 
for participants remaining on study intervention. Participants with HIV- 1 
RNA results outside this window will be classified as “onstudy intervention , 
butmissing data in window ”regardless of the out of window HI V-1 RNA 
results.
For the primary evaluation of non -inferiority based on those with HIV- 1 RNA 
≥50copies/mL, the parameter for evaluation is the number of participants clas sified as “HIV -
1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL” according to the FDA snapshot algorithm defined above, divided by 
the number of participants in the FAS. For the secondary endpoint involving those with HIV -
1 RNA <50 copies/mL, the parameter for evaluation is the number of participants classified 
as “HIV -1 RNA <50 copies/mL” according to the snapshot algorithm, divided by the number 
of participants in the FAS. Similar logic will also be used to define the percentage of 
participants with HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL in accorda nce with the relevant secondary 
endpoints .
A second approach, the missing data treated as treatment failure (M=F) approach, will be 
performed as a sensitivity analysis for the percentage of participants achieving HIV-1 RNA 
<50copies/mL. Under this approac h, participan ts who 1) have at least 1 on-treatment HIV -1 
RNA measurement within the timepoint of interest analysis window specified in Table 7and 
have the last available on -treatment measurement within the window <50 copies/mL, OR 2) 
are on study intervention and have no HIV -1 RNA measurements within the time point of 
interest analysis window specified in Table 7and have both the immediately preced ingand 
immediately subsequent on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurements < 50copies/mL, will be 
classifie d as a virologic “success ”at the timepoint of interest. Participants with other reasons 
for missing data will be classified as a virologic failure at the timepoint of interest.

MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
A third approach, the OF approach will also be performed as a sensitivity analysis forthe 
HIV-1 RNA measurement <50 copies/mL endpoint . Under this approach, participants with 
non-intermittent missing data who prematurely discontinue study intervention due to lack of 
efficacy or who discontinue intervention for other reasons and are failures (HIV-1 RNA 
≥50copies/mL ) at the time of study intervention discontinuation are considered as failures at 
timepoints thereafter. Participants who discontinue study intervention for reasons other than 
lack of efficacy and who are not failures at the time of study intervention discontinuation will 
be exc luded from the analyses at subsequent timepoints. Participants with intermittent 
missing data will be considered as successes (HIV -1 RNA < 50copies/mL ) if both the 
immediately preceding and immediately subsequent on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurements 
are <50copies/mL ; all other intermittent missing results will be imputed as failures.
The same supportive approaches as described above will similarly be used for the analysis of 
the percentage of participants achieving HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL.
Percentage of Par ticipants With HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL
The snapshot approach will be used as the primary approach to analysis with respect to the 
percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL. The full categorization of 
virologic outcome at a timepoint by the snapshot approach includes 1) HIV -1 RNA 
<50copies/mL, 2) HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL, and 3) no virologic data in window for

Non- inferiority of G roup 1 compared to G roup 2 with respect to the percentage of 
participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Weeks 48 and 96 will be calculated using
the unstratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] .
For the evaluation of the primary hypothesis at Week 48 and the secondary hypothesis at 
Week 96 , a margin of 4 percentage points is used to define the non -inferiority of a switch to 
DOR/ISL at Day 1 compared to the continuation of baseline BIC/FTC/TAF for 48 weeks and 
96 weeks , as appropriate ; non-i nferiority will be concluded if the upper bound of the 2-sided 
multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the difference in the percentage of participants with HIV -1 
RNA ≥50 copies/mL (G roup 1 minus G roup 2) is less than 4 percentage points. The choice 
of non -inferi ority margin is driven by the amount of virologic failure that is clinically 
acceptable; with an anticipated virologic failure rate of approximately 2%, a stringent margin 
of 4percentage points is clinically acceptable.
Superiority of Group 1 compared to Group 2 with respect to the percentage of participants 
with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL at Weeks 48 and 96 will also be calculated using the 
unstratified method of Miettinen and Nurminen [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] . For 
the evaluation of the efficacy superiority hypotheses, superiority will be concluded if the 
upper bound of the 2 -sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the difference in the percentage
of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL (Group 1 mi nus Group 2) is less than 0 
percentage points.

For the summary of virologic response over time, the difference in percentage s between 
treatment groups at each timepoint th rough Week 144 will also be estimated and the 
associated 2-sided nominal 95% CI will be derived in a similar fashion to that described for 
the primary efficacy analysis.
Percentage of Participants W ith HIV -1 RNA <40 copies/mL and Percentage of 
Participants With HIV -1 RNA < 50copies/mL
The percentage of participants achieving H IV-1 RNA <40 copies/mL and the percentage of 
participants with HIV- 1 RNA <50 copies/mL will be summarized by treatment group at each 
timepoint, with primary interest at Week 48,Week 96,andWeek 144 by comparing G roup 1
and Group 2. For each timepoint of interest, the difference in percentage s between treatment 
groups and the associated 2- sided nominal 95% CIwill be calculated using the unstratified 
Miettinen and Nieminen method [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] . The supportive 
analys es using the M=F and OF approaches (as defined above) will also be presented.
Change From Baseline in CD4 + T-cell C ount
Change from baseline in CD4 + T-cell count will be summarized by treatment group at e ach 
timepoint at which CD4 + T-cell count is collected, with primary interest at Week 48, Week 
96, and Week 144. The treatment difference in changes from baseline in CD4+ T -cell count 
at each timepoint will be estimated using the ANC OVA model adjusted by baseline CD4+ T-
cell count and treatment group through Week 144 . However, these estimates will not be 
subject to an absolute criterion for similarity. The clinical interpretation of treatment 
difference is dependent upon the absolute value at baseline and the magnitude and direction 
of the CD4 + T-cell count changes observed in each treatment arm. The DAO approach will 
be used to handle missing data for these analyses. Under the DAO approach, participants 
must have both a baseline measurement an d at least 1post-baseline measurement within the 
timepoint of interest analysis window specified in Table 7to be included in the analyses of 
the mea n change from baseline in CD4+ T -cell count. Supportive analyses will also be 
provided using the LOCF and BOCF methods to account for missing data.
Clinically significant Confirmed Viremia
The number of participants with confirmed virologic rebound, as def ined in Section 4.2.1.1.2, 
will be summarized for each treatment group.
Viral Resistance -associated Substitutions
The number of participants in the resistance analysis subset with genotypic and/or phenotypic 
resistance to each study intervention will be summarized for each treatment group with 
primary interest at Weeks 48, 96and 144 .

Unblinding of Participants During the Study
Given the objective nature of the efficacy endpo int HIV -1 RNA, if a participant become s
unblinded during the study for any reason (eg, due to a safety event, acute 
infection/reactivation of HBV or pregnancy that requires unblinding, or accidental
unblinding), s uch participants will not be treated as tre atment failures in the primary efficacy 
analys es on the FAS population due to the unblinding alone.
If the unblinding is due to HBV acute infection/reactivation that requires discontinuation of 
study intervention or if the clinical management of the HBV re quires the addition of a 
concomitant therapy that is also active against HIV -1, efficacy assessments in these 
participants will be censored from that point forward and will be handled in the primary 
efficacy analyses following the FDA snapshot algorithm classification rules.
In the event of a pregnancy that necessitates unblinding of the treatment regimen to allow 
appropriate clinical management, such participants will not be treated as treatment failures in 
the primary efficacy analyses on the FAS population due to the unblinding alone. Efficacy 
assessments in participa nts who become pregnant and require discontinuation of study 
intervention or choose to breastfeed will be censored from that point forward and will be 
handle din the primary efficacy analyses following the FDA snapshot algorithm classification 
rules. Resul ts for participants whose pregnancy extends beyond Week 144 (for participants in 
Group 2 who become pregnant prior to Week 144 and are thus not eligible to switch to 
DOR/ISL or participants in Group 1 who do not consent to continue treatment beyond Week 
144) or beyond Week 156 (for participants in Group 1 who consent to continue treatment 
beyond Week 144) will be reported separately. Additional details will be provided in the 
sSAP and/or CSR.

9.6.2 Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs.
The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 9)at Weeks 48 , 96and 
144. Thetiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. AE s(specific terms 
as well as system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in

laboratory and vital signs are either prespecified as “Tier 1” endpoint or will be clas sified as 
belonging to “Tier 2” or “Tier 3”, based on the number of events observed.
Safety parameters or adverse events of special interest that are identified a priori constitute 
“Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance. 
There are no Tier 1 events for this protocol as t here are no a priori clinical events of concern 
that have been identified for this study.
Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates and 2- sided nominal 95% CIs provided
for between treatment differences (Group 1 minus Group 2) in the percentage of participants 
with Tier 2 events ; these analyses will be performed using the Miettinen and Nurminen 
method [Miettinen, O. and Nurmin en, M. 1985] , an unconditional, asymptotic method.
Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 4 participants in any treatment group exhibit the 
event. The threshold of at least 4 events was chosen because the 95% CI for the between
group difference in per cent incidence will always include zero when treatment groups of 
equal size each have less than 4 events and thu s, would add little to the interpretation of 
potentially meaningful difference s. Because many 95% CIs for Tier 2 events may be 
provided without adjustment for multiplicity , the CIs should be regarded as a helpful 
descriptive measure to be used in review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical 
significance of the between group differences in AEs and safety parameters that meet 
predefined limits of change .
In addition to individual events that occur in 4 or more participants in any treatment group, 
the broad categories consisting of the percentage of participants with any AE, with a drug -
related AE, with an SAE, with a Grade 3 to 4 AE, with an AE that is both drug- related and 
serious, with an AE that is both Grade 3 to 4 and drug- related, who discontinued study 
intervention due to a drug- related and non- drug-related AE, and with AE(s) leading to death
will be considered Tier 2 endpoi nts.The percentage of participants with a c ardiac SAE will 
also be considered a Tier 2 endpoint.
The mean change from baseline to Weeks 48, 96 and 144 in body weight will be considered 
Tier 2 events. For the evaluation of the secondary hypothes es of the effect on weight of a 
switch to DOR/ISL at Day 1 compared to the continuation of baseline BIC/FTC/TAF at 
Weeks 48 and 96, the treatment difference in the change from baseline will be estimated 
between treatment groups using ANCOVA models adjusted by baselin e weight , sex at birth, 
race,and treatment group. Superiority of having lower mean increase from baseline will be 
concluded if the upper bound of the 2-sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the estimate of 
the treatment group difference (Group 1 minus Group 2) is less than 0. P-value sfor the 
comparisons at Week 48 and Week 96 willalsobe provide d.For participants who become 
pregnant during the study, weight measured after the estimated date of conception will be 
excluded from the analyses. The APaT population will be used for this analysis, and the 
DAO approach will be used to handle missing data. The same statistical model will be used 
to evaluate the between group difference in the change from baseline to Week 144 in body 
weight.

Safety endpoints that are not Tier 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. Only point estimates 
by treatment group will be provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.
For c ontinuous measures such as change from baseline in laboratory andvital signs 
parameters that are not prespecified as Tier 2 endpoints, summary statistics for baseline, on-
treatment, and change fr om baseline values will be provided by treatment group in table 
format.
For the lipid profile analyses, participants who receive lipid -lowering therapy at baseline will 
be excluded from all lipid- related analyses. Missing lipid data will be handled using the DAO
appro ach, that is, any participant with a missing value will be excluded from the analysis. For 
participants who initiate lipid -lowering therapy during the study, the last lipid measurement 
before initiating the lipid -lowering therapy will be carried forward. For participants who 
become pregnant, lipid data collected after the estimated date of conception will be 
excluded. The percentages of participants who initiate or modify lipid-lowering therapy prior 
to Week 48, Week 96, and Week 144 will be summarized by t reatment group.
Missing safety parameters, unless otherwise specified, will be handled using the DAO 
approach, that is, any participant with a missing value will be excluded from the analysis. 
Change from baseline summaries require a baseline value. In the rare event when Day 1 data
are missing, the value obtained at the most recent screening visit will be used as baseline, 
when available. If no baseline result is available, that participant will not be included in the 
summary.
Safety data for participants in Group 2 who consent to switch to DOR/ISL at Week 144 will 
be summarized from Week 144 to Week 156. For the assessment of change from baseline in 
Group 2 at Week 156, baseline will be the Week 144 measurement (or, if the Week 144 
measurement is not available, the last measurement prior to the switch to DOR/ISL).
For participants who become pregnant during the study, safety parameters ass essed during 
the pregnancy period (estimated date of conception to -date of conclusion of the pregnancy) 
may be summarized separately from the primary and secondary safety analyses. For 
continuous measures that are considered to be Tier 2 events, data colle cted after the 
estimated date of conception will be excluded from the analyses. Data collected for 
participants whose pregnancy or postpartum visit(s) extend beyond Week 144or 156 will be 
reported separately. Infant safety data will be reported separately . Additional details on how 
pregnancy and infant data will be handled in safety analyses will be provided in the sSAP 
and/or CSR.

9.6.3 Summaries of Baseline Characteristics , Demographic, and Other Analyses
9.6.3.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
The comparability of the treatment groups for each relevant demographic and baseline 
characteristic will be assessed by the use of tables and/or graphs . No statistical hypothesis 
tests will be performed on these characteristics. The number and percentage o f participants 
screened and randomized andthe primary reasons for screening failure, and the primary 
reason for discontinuation will be displayed. Demographic variables (eg, age, gender, race, 
region, etc.), baseline characteristics, primary and secondary diagnoses, and prior and 
concomitant therapies will be summarized by treatment either by descriptive statistics or 
categorical tables.

An eDMC will serve as the primary reviewer of the results of the interim efficacy and safety 
reviews and may make recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol 
modificat ions to an executive committee of the Sponsor. If the eDMC recommends 
modifications to the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study, this executive 
committee (and potentially other limited Sponsor personnel) may be unblinded to results at 
thetreatment level in order to act on these recommendations. The extent to which individuals 
are unblinded with respect to results of efficacy and safety review will be documented by the 
external unblinded statistician. Additional logistical details will be provided in the eDMC 
charter.
Treatment level results from allinterim analyses will be provided to the eDMC by the 
external unblinded statistician. The external unblinded statistician will not be involved in any 
discussions regarding modifications to t he protocol, statistical methods, identification of 
protocol violators, or data validation efforts.
Once 40% of target enrollment (n =232 participants) have completed Week 24 ,including
visit assessments, the Week 24 interim analysis will be conducted by an external unblinded 
statistician to assess futility. This analysis will be reviewed by the eDMC.
Futility Criteria: If the upper bound of the 2 -sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the 
difference in the percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL (Group 1 
minus Group 2) is greater than 8 percentage points and the 95% CI excludes 0, consideration 
may be given to stop the study.
The futility analysis will include all participants in the first 40% of target enrollment. For the 
purpose of the W eek 24 interim analysis, those classified as HIV -1 RNA ≥200 copies/mL 
includes participants:
1)Who have the last available on- treatment HIV -1 RNA measurement ≥200 copies/mL 
at the Week 24 visit window specified in Table 7.
If participants do not have confirmed viremia (Section 4.2.1.1.2) at the subsequent 
visit, their virologic outcome will be reassessed for the primary analyses 
(Section 9.6.1) .
2)Who do not have on -treatme nt HIV -1 RNA data at Week 24
oWho discontinue study intervention prior to the Week 24 visit due to lack of 
efficacy or confirmed viremia (Section 4.2.1.1.2), or
oWho discontinued study intervention prior to the Week 24 visit due to reasons 
other than lack of efficacy and have their last on -treatment HIV -1 RNA 
measurement ≥50 copies/mL
Those participants will be included in the virologic failure rate calculated for the 
purposes of the primary analyses (Section 9.6.1).

A possibility exists that unblinded data from this interim analysis may ultimately be 
submitted to regulatory authorities prior to Week 48, when the Sponsor becomes unblinded. 
In that event, to preserve the blinding integrity of the trial , an unblinded team at the Sponsor 
will be identified and those working with these unblinded data, working on the submission, 
and responding to regulatory questions would be firewalled from those blinded Sponsor 
personnel still working on the study. A sepa rate data integrity/management plan will be 
developed to further define the roles and access for those on the unblinded and blinded teams 
at the Sponsor.
In addition, the eDMC will review accumulating safety and efficacy data at regular intervals 
throughou t the study duration, or modified intervals based on the recommendation of the 
eDMC. The eDMC will recommend steps to ensure the safety of study participants and the 
integrity of the trial.
An analysis will be conducted to test the primary non-inferiority efficacy hypothesis once all 
participants have completed the Week 48 visit assessments. This will be the formal 
evaluation of the primary non- inferiority efficacy hypothesi s,and the Sponsor will become 
unblinded at that time. The analysis of the data will be performed by the unblinded team of 
the Sponsor. All available efficacy and safety data will be reviewed at this interim time point. 
Treatment level results from this analysis will also be provided to the eDMC.
If the study is stopped early, the CSR wil l include all available data up to and including the 
close -out visits. This approach to include all available information is in line with the ICH -E9 
guideline .
9.8 Multiplicity
As noted in Section 9.7, an eDMC will convene at routine intervals to monitor efficacy and 
safety . There is no intention of stopping the study due to positive efficacy at any of these 
reviews. Nevertheless, since unblinded summaries o fHIV-1 RNA values may be included in 
these reviews, a small amount of alpha (α=0.000 01) will be allocated for each of these looks, 
purely for statistical rigor. An allowance will be made such that a total of up to 5 of these 
unblinded eDMC reports (including the futility assessment once 40% of participants have 
reached Week 24) may be presented prior to the evaluation of the primary non-inferiority
efficacy hypothes is at Week 48. If further eDMC reviews occur between the evaluation of 
the primary non- inferiority efficacy hypothesis at Week 48 and the evaluation of the efficacy
hypothes es tested at Week 96 (ie, (H4) and (H2)) , further reduction in the alpha of 0.000 01
for each eDMC review will be made for the hypotheses tested atWeek 96.
The following efficacy hypotheses will be test edsequentially at a 1 -sided 2.5% Type 1 error 
rate adjusted for the number of eDMC reports in the following order:
1)Primary efficacy hypo thesis (H1) testing non -inferiority of HIV- 1 RNA 
≥50copies/mL between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 48 .
2)Secondary efficacy hypothesis (H4)testing superiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL 
between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 96.

3)Primary efficacy hypothesis (H2)testing superiority of HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL 
between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 48.
Testing will stop with the first of these tests failing to reach statistical significance ,and all 
subsequent tests would not be considered for statistic al significance. In this way, the overall 
1-sided 2.5% Type 1 error rate in testing these hypotheses is strongly controlled .
It is noted that the last sequential hypothesis to be evaluated concerns efficacy at Week 48 
although it would not be evaluated unt il the Week 96 analyses are conducted as the second
sequential hypothes is involve s aWeek 96 endpoint.
The s econdary efficacy hypothesis (H3) testing non- inferiority of HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL between Group 1 and Group 2 at Week 96 will be tested independe ntly of the 
efficacy hierarchy described above. This hypothesis will be tested at a 1 -sided 2.5% Type 1 
error rate adjusted for the number of eDMC reports from Day 1 to Week 96.
The secondary safety hypotheses, (H5) testing superiority of having lower mean increase 
from baseline in body weight for Group 1 vs. Group 2 at Week 48 and (H6) testing 
superiority of having lower mean increase from baseline in body weight for Group 1 vs. 
Group 2 at Week 96, will be tested independently of all aforementioned efficac y hypotheses. 
These hypotheses will be tested using the following rules:
(1) (H5) will be tested at a 1 -sided 0.25% Type 1 error rate adjusted for the number of eDMC 
reports from Day 1 to Week 48, denoted by α 1*.
(2a) If (H5) is retained (ie ,the null hypothesis is not rejected) at Week 48, (H6) will be tested 
at Week 96 at a 1- sided 2.25% Type 1 error rate adjusted for the number of eDMC reports 
from Week 48 to Week 96, denoted by α2*.
(2b) If (H5) is rejected at Week 48, (H6) will be tested at Week 96 at a 1-sided Type 1 error 
rate of α 1*+ α 2*.
(3) If (H5) is retained at Week 48 and (H6) is rejected at Week 96, (H5) will be retested at 
Week 96 at a 1- sided Type 1 error rate of α2*.
This approach strongly controls the overall 1- sided Type 1 error rate for the safety 
hypotheses (H5) and (H6) to be less than or equal to α 1*+ α 2*≤ 0.25% + 2.25% = 2.5%

The power calculations shown in Table 10 incorporate the Week 24 interim analysis stopping 
rules . The inte rim analysis for futility will be conducted when 40% of the study enrollment 
(approximately 116 participants per arm) have reached Week 24. The study may stop if the
upper bound of the 2 -sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the difference in the percenta ge
of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥ 200 copies/mL (Group 1 minus Group 2) is greater than 8 
percentage points and the 95% CI excludes 0. Of interest is the likelihood that the study 
would meet the stopping criteria at Week 24 for a variety ofassumed Week 2 4 response rates 
and also whether the non -inferiority criteria at Week 48 would be met.

≥50copies/mL is 2% in both groups, there is a 9 9.0% chance of not meeting the futility 
criteria at Week 24. The overall study power for that scenario is 82. 8%.
9.9.1.2 Evaluation of Non- inferiority and Superiority Hypotheses
This section presents a fuller description of the power calculations for the primary analysis of 
non-inferiority at Week 48. In contrast to the power shown in Table 10, the power 
calculations shown here do not account for the futility analysis and instead assume the futility 
criteria are not met and the study continues through Week 48.
As described in Section 9.8, t he alpha level used in the final analysis (corresponding to the 
multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI) will account for the actual number of eDMC evaluations 
conducted in the study. For the purposes of the power calculations, 5 eDMC evaluations are

assumed, leaving α=0.024 95 (1- sided) available for the final analysis. Non- inferiority will be 
concluded if the upper bound of the 2-sided multiplicity -adjusted 95% CI for the difference 
in the percentage of participants with HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL (G roup 1 minus G roup 2 ) 
is less than 4 percentage points. The choice of non -inferiority margin is driven by the amount 
of virologic failure that is clinically acceptable; with an anticipated virologic failure rate of 
approximately 1.5% to 2%, a stringent margin of 4perce ntage points is clinically acceptable. 
The power calculation saresimulated based on an asymptotic method proposed by Miettinen 
andNurminen [Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] and were carried out using SAS 
version 9.4.
Table 11 summari zes the power for the primary comparison under various assumptions for 
the control response rate and underlying difference in response rat e(the percentage of 
participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) . For example, if the true rates are 1.5% in both 
groups , this study has approximately 91% power to demonstrate non -inferiority. If the true 
rates are 2.0% in both groups, this study has approx imately 85% power to demonstrate the 
primary hypothesis that G roup 1is non- inferior to G roup 2 at Week 48.
Note that Table 11 can also be used to approximate the power to declare Group 1 non -
inferior to Group 2 with respect to the percentage of participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥50 
copies/mL at Week 96. The estimated powe r values at Week 96 would differ slightly from 
the Week 48 values presented in Table 11 due to the additional adjustment to the 1- sided 
Type 1 error that would be made for the number of eDMC reports that occur between Week 
48 and Week 96.

eDMC reports between Day 1 and Week 48. If additional eDMC repo rts occur between Week 48 and Week 
96, the 1 -sided Type 1 error rate would be further adjusted for the assessment of superiority at Week 96.
Power was estimated via 10,000 simulations for each scenario.
9.9.2 Sample Size and Power for Safety Analyses
9.9.2.1 Evaluatio n of Adverse Event s
The probability of observing at least 1 of a particular type of AE in this study depends on the 
number of participants treated and the underlying percentage of participants with that AE in 
the study population.
If the underlying inciden ce of a particular AE is 1%, there is a 94.5% chance of observing at 
least 1 AE among 289 participants in a treatment group. If no AE of that type is observed 
among the 289 participants in a treatment group, this study will provide 97.5% confidence 
that the underlying percentage of participants with that particular AE is <1.27% (1 out of 
every 78 participants).
The estimate of, and the upper bound of the 2-sided nominal 95% CI for, the underlying 
percentage ofparticipants with an AE given various hypothetical observed number of 
participants with the AE within each treatment group are provided in Table 13.These 
calculations are based on the exact binomia l method proposed by Clopper and Pearson 
[Clopper, C. J. and Pearson, E. S. 1934] .

Table 14 gives the difference in the incidence of an AE (Group 1 minus G roup 2 ) that can be 
ruled out with different power levels and 95% confidence when there are 289 participants in 
each group. The underlying incidence of the AE is assumed to be the same for the 
2treatment groups. For example, for a reasonably common AE, which occurs in 20% of 
participants in both group s, the study has 80% power to declare with 95% confidence that the 
true difference between the treatment groups is no more than 10.1 percentage points. The 
calculations are based on an asymptotic method proposed by Miettinen andNurminen
[Miettinen, O. and Nurminen, M. 1985] .

9.9.2.2 Evaluation of Change in Weight
Table 15 gives the hypothetical minimal treatment difference sin the change from baseline in 
weight that can be detected between Group 1 and Group 2 with given power at Weeks 48 and 
96 assuming varying values of the underlying standard deviation and accounting for potential 
participant dropout .The calculations incorporate the testing strategy specified in Section 9 .8,
which allows for the transfer of alpha back and fo rth between the Week 48 and Week 96 
hypotheses based on whether hypotheses (H5) and (H6) are retained (ie, the null hypothesis 
is not rejected) or rejected. Calculations are performed conditionally, that is, the probability 
that the Week 48 and Week 96 hypotheses are retained or rejected are not estimated or 
accounted for in the power calculations. For example, if the standard deviation of change in 
weight from baseline in both treatment groups at Week 96 is 8kgand the number of 
participants in each treat ment group at Week 96 is 243, then this study will provide 90% 
power to detect a difference at least as large as 2.39 kgat Week 96 assuming that the Week 
48 hypothesis (H5) was retained .

dropout rate of 10% at Week 48 and 16% at Week 96 was a ssumed in the calculations based on data from 
MK-1439A- 024. As such, the number of participants per group is assumed to be 260 at Week 48 and 243 at 
Week 96.
bValues of the standard deviation of change in weight from baseline are based on experience with MK-8591
P011. In this study, the standard deviation of change in weight from Day 1 through Week 48 ranged from 
approximately 4.1 kg (DOR/3TC/TDF treatment group) to 5.9 kg (ISL[0.75 mg]+DOR+3TC treatment 
group). Assuming the change in weight from Week 48 t hrough Week 96 would be consistent with the 
observed change in weight from Day 1 through Week 48, the 96 -week weight change standard deviations 
range from approximately 8 kg to 12 kg.

To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the 
estimate of the between group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% Miettinen andNurminen
CI) for the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint s (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL 
and HI V-1 RNA <40 copies/mL endpoint to aid in the EU review) will be calculated for the 
following classification variables:
Age category ( <50 years of age ,≥50years of age )
Sex at birth
Gender identity
Region (North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, etc.)
Race ( White, Black, Asian, Other)
Ethnicity (Hispanic/Latino, not Hispanic/Latino)
Chronic h epatitis C status (HCV -infected, HCV -uninfected)
Duration of BI C/FTC/TAF therapy prior to enrollment ( ≥1 year, <1 year)
The snapshot approach will be used to handle missing values in these subgroup analyses.
9.11 Compliance (Medication Adherence)
In this study, as part of the routine recording of the amount of study intervention taken by 
each participan t in the study intervent ion CRF page, the number of tablets remaining in study 
packaging will be counted and reviewed at regular intervals. These results will be used to 
calculate participan t compliance.
For the main analysis of compliance in this study, a day within the study will be considered 
an“OnTherapy ”day if the participant takes at least 1 tablet from any bottle provided for this 
study.
For participants in Group 1 and Group 2 (prior to the potential switch to DOR/ISL at Week 
144), t he “Number of Days Should be on Therapy” is the total number of days from Day 1 to 
the date of the last dose of study intervention for each participant. As such, the “Number of 
Days Should be on Therapy” will be the number of days from Day 1 to the timepoint of 
interest (ie. Week 48, Wee k 96, or Week 144) for those participants who are on study 
intervention for the entire study period of interest . For participants who discontinue study 
intervention prior to or within the study period of interest , the “Number of Days Should be 
on Therapy” will be the number of days from Day 1 to the date of discontinuation of study 
intervention.

10 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION AND OPERATIONAL 
CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 Appendix 1: Regulatory, Ethical, and Study Oversight Considerations
10.1.1 Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. (MSD)
Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials
I. Introduction
A.Purpose
MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. A s such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing ,and reporting these trials 
in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the 
overriding concern in the design and conduct of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted 
in compliance with local and/or national regulations , and International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical 
Practice ( ICH-GCP) ,and also in accordance with the ethical pr inciples that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.
B.Scope
Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by 
MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e .g., contract research organizations, 
collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or 
which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the 
full control of M SD.
II.Scientific Issues
A.Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodyn amic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SD
may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to 
determine patient preferences, etc.
The design (i.e. , participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific
purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertis e, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD) to assess the ability 
to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice
(GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus 
source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, 
07YG7P

PRODUCT:   MK-8591A  133
PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.:   018 -06  
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
scientific/research misc onduct or serious GCP -non-compliance is suspected, the issues are investigated. 
When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review 
committees notified .
B. Publication and Authorship
Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish theprimary and secondary results of its registered trials of 
marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the pre -specified plans for data analysis. To the 
extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other analyse s it conducts that are important 
to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather 
than hypothesis testing ;in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be 
underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity.
MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and 
conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named 
authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in 
publications.
III.Participant Protection
A. Regulatory Authority and Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [I RB]/Independent Ethics 
Committee [IEC])
All protocols and protocol amendments will be submitted by MSD for regulatory authority 
acceptance/authorization prior to implementation of the trial or amendment, in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations.
The protocol, protocol amendment(s), informed consent form, investigator’s brochure, and other re levant trial 
documents must be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being implemented at each site, in compliance 
with local and/or national regulations. Changes to the protocol that are required urgently to eliminate an 
immediate hazard and to prote ct participant safety may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval.  
MSD will inform regulatory authorities of such new measures to protect participant safety, in compliance with 
local and/or national regulations.
B. Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. 
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At 
a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care.
All participation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is 
obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or 
receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C. Confidentiality
MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by 
law, only the investigator, Sponso r (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD), ethics committee, and/or regulatory 
authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name.
D. Genomic Research
Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an 
ethics c ommittee.

MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
IV. Financial Considerations
A. Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may b e 
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
MSD does not pay for participant referrals. However, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent 
on chart review and medical evaluation to identify potentially eligible partici pants.
B.Clinical Research Funding
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SD,and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may 
wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As 
noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding.
C. Funding for Travel and Other R equests
Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g. , to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices .
V. Investigator Commitment
Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the 
protocol, agree to support these et hical and scientific standards .
10.1.2 Financial Disclosure
Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration 
Regulatio ns, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the 
Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for 
Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's
responsibility to comply with any such request.
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to 
allow for the submi ssion of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. 
The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a 
Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by 
the Sponsor . The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this 
information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the 
transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data.
10.1.3 Data Protection
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or 
datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names 
or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.

The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be 
explained to the part icipant.

10.3 Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
10.3.1 Definition of AE
AE definition
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention.
NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of a study intervention.
NOTE: For pu rposes of AE definition, study intervention (also referred to as Sponsor’s 
product) includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, vaccine, diagnostic 
agent, or protocol specified procedure whether investigational or marketed (including 
placebo, active comparator product, or run -in intervention) , manufactured by, licensed 
by, provided by, or distributed by the Sponsor for human use in this study.
Events meeting the AE definition
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline ,considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the investigator.
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.
New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even 
though it may have been pr esent before the start of the study.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.
For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the 
AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose 
without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is repor ted using 
the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.”
Any new cancer or progression of existing cancer.

PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT NO.: 018-06 
MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
Events NOT meeting the AE d efinition
Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.
Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) pr esent or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.
Refe r to Section 8.4.6 for protocol -specific exceptions.
10.3.2 Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met.
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
The term “life- threatening ” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an 
event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. 
c.Requires inpatient hospit alization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even 
if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: 
Hospitalization for an e lective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is 
diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s 
medical history. 
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza,

and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) that may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect
In offspring of participant taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis. 
f.Other important medical events
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize t he participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious. 
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intens ive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse.
10.3.3 Additional Events Reported
Additional events that require r eporting
In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not 
serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor.
Is a cancer
Is associated with an overdose

When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to 
the event.
The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE inf ormation on the AE 
CRFs /worksheets at each examination.
It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page.
There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
the Sponsor. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant

number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submi ssion to the 
Sponsor.
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity
An event is defined as “serious ”when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe.
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity f or each AE and SAE (and other 
reportable safety event) by recording the grade according to the NIH DAIDS Table for 
Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, version 2.1. Any AE which 
changes DAIDS grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade 
recorded on the AE CRFs/worksheets.
-Grade 1 Mild event: Mild symptoms causing no or minimal interference with usual 
social and functional activities with intervention not indicated. 
-Grade 2 Moderate event: Moderat e symptoms causing greater than minimal 
interference with usual social and functional activities with intervention indicated. 
-Grade 3 Severe event: Severe symptoms causing inability to perform usual social and 
functional activities with intervention or hospitalization indicated. 
-Grade 4 Potentially life -threatening event: Potentially life -threatening symptoms 
causing inability to perform basic self -care funtions with intervention indicated to 
prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death. 
-Grade 5 Death: Deaths related to an AE.
Assessment of c ausality
Did the Sponsor’s product cause the AE? 
The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the AE will be 
provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated 
initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE 
form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed 
document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assess ing the likelihood of a 
relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available information. 
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the 
Sponsor’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation wi th the components and

their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s 
product caused the AE: 
-Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the Sponsor’s 
product such as: reliable histor y, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, 
etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily 
specimen? 
-Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the Sponsor’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible 
with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)? 
-Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as 
underlying disease, other drug(s)/ vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors. 
-Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequency 
reduced? 
If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? 
If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. 
If no, this is a negative dechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent 
disability; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of the Sponsor’s 
produc t; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor’s product(s) is/are 
only used 1 time.)
-Rechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor’s product in this study? 
If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? 
If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. 
If no, this is a negative rechallenge. 
(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the initial AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability, or (2) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (3) Sponsor’s 
product(s) is/are used only 1 time.)
NOTE: IF A RECHALLENGE IS PLANNED FOR AN AE THAT WAS SERIOUS AND 
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT, OR IF RE -EXPOSURE 
TO THE SPONSOR’S PRODUCT POSES ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT 
RISK TO THE PARTICIPANT THEN THE RECHALLENGE MUS T BE APPROVED IN 
ADVANCE BY THE SPONSOR CLINICAL DIRECTOR, AND IF REQUIRED, THE 
IRB/IEC.

Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presentation of 
the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor’s produc t or drug class 
pharmacology or toxicology? 
The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by an 
investigator who is a qualified physician according to his/her best clinical judgment, 
including consideration of th e above elements. 
Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a Sponsor’s product relationship). 
-Yes, there is a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
There is e vidence of exposure to the Sponsor’s product. The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor’s product is reasonable. 
The AE is more likely explained by the Sponsor’s product than by another cause. 
-No, there is no t a reasonable possibility of Sponsor’s product relationship: 
Participant did not receive the Sponsor’s product OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the Sponsor’s product is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely explai ned by another cause than the Sponsor’s product. (Also 
entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.) 
For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an ass essment of causality. 
There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important 
that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor. 
The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. 
The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reportin g 
requirements.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.
New or updated information will be recorded in the C RF.

The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.
10.3.5 Reporting of AE s, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor
AE, SAE, and o ther reportable safety event reporting to Sponsor via e lectronic d ata 
collection t ool
The primary mechanism for reporting to the Sponsor will be the electronic data collection 
(EDC) tool. 
-Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or 
equivalent). 
-If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will use 
the paper AE Reporting form. 
Reference Section 8.4.1 for reporting time requirements. 
The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available. 
After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data. 
If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data 
on a previously reported SAE after the EDC tool has been taken off -line, then the site can 
report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section). 
Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or 
equivalent).
SAE reporting to the Sponsor via paper CRF
If the EDC tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail of the SAE 
paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the Sponsor. 
In rare circumstances and in the a bsence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight 
mail or courier service. 
Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complet e 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames. 
Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found 
in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent).

10.5 Appendix 5: Contraceptiv e Guidance
10.5.1 Definitions
Women of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman (including a transgender man who is assi gned female gender at birth and is 
transitioning toward maleness) is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming 
postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below):
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a m enstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be 
considered.
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
Transgender women (assigned male gender at birth and transitioning towa rd femaleness). 
Premenarchal
Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: 
-Documented hysterectomy
-Documented bilateral salpingectomy
-Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Postmenopausal female
-A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. 
A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH 
measurements in the postmenopausal range is required.
-Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the nonhormonal highly effectiv e contraception methods if they wish to continue

their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Women of Nonchildbearing Potential (WONCBP)
Women in the following ca tegories are considered WONCBP:
Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
Documented hysterectomy
Documented bilateral salpingectomy
Documented bilateral oophorectomy
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be 
applied to determining study entry.
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
Postmenopausal female
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause. 
◦A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not u sing hormonal contraception or HRT. 
However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two 
FSH measurements in the postmenopausal range is required. 
Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt must discontinue HRT to 
allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

10.5.2 Contraception Requirements
Contraceptives allowed during the study includea:
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Have Low User Dependencyb
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progestogen -only contraceptive implantc
·IUSd
Non-hormonal IUD
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or secondary to medical cause)
This is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the sole male sexual partner of 
the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of 
contraception should be used. A spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.
Note: Documentation of azoospermia can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. 
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependentb
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraceptionc
Oral
Intravaginal
Transdermal
Injectable
Progestogen -only hormonal contraceptionc
Oral
Injectable
Sexual Abstinence
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in rel ation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant. 
Acceptable Contraceptive Methods
Failure rate of >1% per year when used consistently and correctly.
Progesterone- only hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action
Male or female condom with or without spermicide
Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide
A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double 
barrier methods)e
a.Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive methods for participants of clinical studies.
b.Typical use failure rates are higher than perfe ct-use failure rates (ie, when used consistently and correctly).
c.If locally required, in accordance with CTFG guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to 
those which inhibit ovulation.
d.IUS is a progestin releasing IUD.
e. Acombination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide are considered 
acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.
Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception:
-Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and LAM.
-Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction).

Research
1.Definitions
a.Biomarker: A biological molecule found in blood, other body fluids, or tissues that is a 
sign of a normal or abnormal process or of a condition or disease. A biomarker may be 
used to see how well the body res ponds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1
b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as 
related to drug/vaccine response.2
c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the infl uence of 
variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2
d.DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid.
e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid.
2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research
The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.9 will be 
used in various experiments to understand:
The biology of how drugs/vaccines work
Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed by the body
Other pathways with which drugs/vaccines may interact
The biology of disease
The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine 
development.
It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical 
specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals 
respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately 
improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations 
with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or 
with the Sponsor.

3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research.
a.Participants for Enrollment
All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enrollment in 
future biomedical res earch .
b.Informed Consent
Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained 
during screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a 
study visit by the investigator or his or her designate. Informed consent for future 
biomedical research should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in 
the SoA. If delayed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms 
signed by the participant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for 
regulatory reasons.
A template of each study site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the 
Sponsor’s clinical document repository.
c.eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens
Documentation of participant consent for future biomedical research will be captured 
in the eCRFs. Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified 
will be destroyed.
d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s)
Collection of specimens for future biomedical research will be performed as outlined 
in the SoA. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future 
biomedical research, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is 
having blood drawn for othe r study purposes.
4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research
In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with future biomedical research 
specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with futur e test results. In 
fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to 
the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing 
participant characteristics like gender, age, medical history and intervention outcomes are 
critical to understanding clinical context of analytical results.
To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for future 
biomedical research, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedures. All 
specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below.
At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical research 
specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally 
07YG7P

identifying inf ormation embedded within it. The link (or key) between participant 
identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will 
appear on the specimen tube.
5.Biorepository Specimen Usage
Specimens obtained for the Sponso r will be used for analyses using good scientific 
practices. Analyses utilizing the future biomedical research specimens may be performed 
by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by 
the Sponsor. The investigat or conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy 
and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the 
specific scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research protocol and consent. 
Future biomedical research specimens remaining with the third party after specific 
analysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor.
6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research
Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical research and ask that thei r 
biospecimens not be used for future biomedical research. Participants may withdraw 
consent at any time by contacting the investigator for the main study. If medical records 
for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the 
designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently, the 
participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study 
use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specifically f or future 
biomedical research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and 
destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or 
destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inf orm the 
participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any 
analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already 
performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be us ed as 
part of the overall research study data and results. No new analyses would be generated 
after the request is received.
In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the 
investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main study 
records) or the specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a 
link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, 
the request for withdrawal of c onsent and/or destruction cannot be processed.
7.Retention of Specimens
Future biomedical research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential 
analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for 
longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being 
answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions 
have been adequately addressed.

MK-8591A -018-06FINAL PROTOCOL 20-JAN-2022
Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to 
the Sponsor -designated biorepository. If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular 
study, the study site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository. The 
specimens will be stored under strict supervi sion in a limited access facility which 
operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according 
to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the 
biorepository database.
8.Data Security
Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the 
authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated study administrator research 
personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is 
accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international 
standards to protect against unauthorized access.
9.Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Participants
No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies wil l be reported to the 
participant, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the 
participant include: Lack of relevance to participant health, limitations of predictive 
capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation.
If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present 
results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to 
rapidly report this information to doctors and participants. Participants will not be 
identified by name in any published reports about this study or in any other scientific 
publication or presentation.
10. Future Biomedical Research Study Population
Every effort will be made to recruit all participants diagnosed and treated on Sponsor 
clinical studies for future biomedical research.
11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research
For future biomedical research, risks to the participant have been minimized and are 
described in the future biomedical research informed conse nt.
The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies, and procedures to address participant 
data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving 
possible breach of confidentiality. In this highly unlikely situation, there is risk that the 
information, like all medical information, may be misused.
12.Questions
Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be emailed directly to 
clinical.specimen.management@merck.com.

therapy (ALA -PDT) compared with conventional ALA -PDT for 
treatment of actinic keratosis on the face or scalp

NUMBER OF SITES  1 
  RATIONALE  Actinic keratoses (AK) are common precancerous skin lesions that 
arise on sun- damaged skin. Treatment is aimed at preventing 
progression to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). First -line 
therapy for clinically apparent lesions includes cryotherapy and 
curettage; and field therapy options are topical 5- fluorouracil, 
imiquimod, ing enol mebutate, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT 
involves the topical application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), or one 
of its derivatives, as a photosensitizing agent. In response, rapidly 
proliferating, dysplastic cells preferentially accumulate 
protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is activated by blue or red 
light, singlet oxygen species are produced, resulting in cell death. 
PDT is beneficial due to its brief treatment course and efficacy in 
clearing AK. However, its main drawbacks are the adverse effects of 
pain, burning, pruritus, erythema, crusting, and inflammation 
associated with treatment. While conventional PDT uses red or blue 
artificial light to activate a high concentration of accumulated 
protoporphyrins, daylight PDT uses natural daylight to a ctivate lower 
levels of protoporphyrins in a continuous manner. Daylight PDT, 
when compared with conventional PDT, has been associated with 
significantly less pain while achieving comparable effiacy for the 
treatment of AK. Daylight PDT is also more cost- effective and 
reduces the amount of time spent in clinic. Previous  randomized 
studies comparing daylight PDT with conventional PDT have largely 
used methyl -aminolevulinate as the photosensitizer, have been intra -
individual comparative studies, and have been performed in Nordic 
countries. Because the effective light dose from natural daylight 
depends on geographic location and seasonal and weather changes, 
randomized trials in different geographic and environmental 
conditions are of interest . The proposed randomized clinical trial 
investigates the tolerability and efficacy of daylight ALA -PDT for the 
treatment of AK in San Francisco for the first time; subjects will be 
randomized to various treatment arms, as opposed to previous split -
face and intra- individual  studies.

  EVALUATIONS   
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  Primary objective is to determine whether daylight PDT affords a  
reduction in treatment symptoms of pain, stinging/burning, and 
itching/pruritus.   
Primary endpoints will be : 
 1) peak symptom level and composite score  during the treatment 
period  
 2) symptom level and composite score at the end of treatment 
exposure.  
SECONDARY 
ENDPOINTS  1) To determine  efficacy in cl earance of AK at 12 weeks:  
A. percent reduction in number of AK s from baseline to 12 weeks  
B. proportion of subjects with complete and partial clearance of 
AKs as described above  
2) To determine whether daylight PDT affords , at end of treatment, a 
reduction in composite loc al skin reaction  
3) To determine whether daylight PDT has a faster resolution of 
composite treatment symptoms and local skin response during  
days 8, 29, and 84.  
 
    STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  Symptom level over time during the treatment period will be graphed 
for visualization along the three axes of pain, stinging/burning, and 
itching/pruritus as well as a composite symptom score. Peak symptom 
level during the treatment period and pain at the  end of treatment 
exposure will be compared between the conventional treatment arm 
(A), the combination treatment arm B), and the daylight treatment arm 
(C), with unpaired t -tests.  
 
Percent reduction in the number of actinic keratoses and proportions 
of pa tients with partial and complete clearance of actinic keratoses 
will be presented descriptively and visualized as histograms.  We will 
compare the percent reduction in the number of AKs and the 
proportions of patients with clearance between the conventiona l 
treatment arm (A) and the combination treatment arm B), and between 
the conventional treatment arm (A) and the daylight treatment arm 
(C), using unpaired t -tests.

the ITT population, patients will be counted in the treatment group 
upon randomization, regardless of receiving any dose of study 
medication. For efficacy analysis, all missing values due to patient 
early termination from the study will be imputed using last 
observation car ried forward (LOCF) method, as appropriate. For each 
patient, the Baseline values will be defined as those values recorded at 
Day 1 prior to dosing. Patients who are lost -to-follow -up after 
Baseline will be included to the ITT population carrying forward t heir 
Baseline values.  
 
Rationale for Number 
of Subjects  This is a small descriptive study. With ten subjects in each group, we 
will be powered to detect a 1.25- point difference in pain (pain scale 1-
10) with a two- sided alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  1 BACKGROUND  
Photodynamic therapy (PDT)  is one field therapy option for the treatment of actinic 
keratosis (AK) . PDT involves the topical application of aminolevulinic acid (ALA), or 
one of its derivatives, as a photosensitizing agent. In response, rapidly proliferating, 
dysplastic cells preferentially accumulate protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). When PpIX is 
activated by blue or red light, singlet oxygen species are produced, resulting in cell death. 
PDT is beneficial d ue to its brief treatment course, ease of p atient compliance, and 
efficacy in clearing AK. However, its main drawbacks are the adverse effects of pain, 
burning, pruritus, erythema, crusting, and inflammation associated with treatment. 
Daylight PDT, when compared with conventional PDT, has been associated with 
significantly less pain while achieving comparable effic acy for the treatment of AK  in 
randomized trials  from Nordic countries  and Australia.1-2 
1.1   Overview of Clinical and Non -Clinical Studies  
Randomized trials, mostly from Nordic countries  (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland) 1, 
3-10 and one from Australia,2 have supported the use of daylight PDT for the treatment of 
AK. One case series from the United States documented  the Southern California 
experience with daylight PDT.11 PDT has been asso ciated with significantly less pain 
compared with c onventional PDT , while maintaining efficacy comparable to that of 
conventional PDT  for treatment of AK .1,2,11 Post-treatment cosmesis  with daylight PDT  
has been excellent.11 The effective dose of sunlight required for AK clearance by daylight 
PDT  is unclear. E ffective light dose from na tural sunlight has been shown to be  high ly 
variable based on geographic location, weather, and time of year.12-13 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Actinic keratoses (AK) are common precancero us skin lesions that arise on sun- damaged

geographic location and seasonal and weather changes, randomized trials in different 
geographic and environmental conditi ons are of interest. The proposed randomized 
clinical trial investigates the tolerability and efficacy of daylight ALA -PDT for the 
treatment of AK in San Francisco for the first time; subjects will be randomized to various 
treatment arms, as opposed to pre vious split -face and intra- individual studies.  
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
The risks of aminolevulinic acid HCl are primarily local site reactions such as pain, 
erythema, burning, pruritus, and crusting. These typical ly begin on day 1 of treatment. 
Adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients treated with aminolevulinic acid were 
erythema, crusted skin, desquamation, burning, sting ing, hyperpigmentation, 
hypopigmentation, pruritus, skin erosi on. In 1 -10% of treated patients , edema, 
dysesthesia, local flare, urticaria, localized vesiculation, drug eruption, dermal ulcer, 
scabbing, excoriation, oozing , hemorrhage, localized tenderness, or local pain  were 
reported . As muc ous membrane irritation and ocular injury are risks of treatment, the eyes 
and mucous membranes will be avoided. During artificial light treatment, the subject, 
health care personnel, and all present will wear appropriate eye protection; all will be 
counseled to avoid looking directly at the light source. Due to photosensitization 
associated wi th treatment, patients will be advised to avoid sunlight and prolonged or 
intense light that is not part of the treatment regimen for 40 hours.  
Photodynamic therapy with ALA has accepted benefits for the treatment of AK which 
outweigh the risks. Other fiel d treatments require a longer duration of therapy and require 
patient compliance at home. Participants in this study will benefit from ALA -PDT, either 
illuminated by daylight or artificial blue light via  BLU -U blue light phototherapy 
illuminator .

8 STUDY TREATMENTS  
8.1 Method of Assigning Su bjects to Treatment Groups  
Thirty eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms 
(Conventional Arm, Combination Arm, Daylight Arm) in a 1:1:1  ratio using a SAS -based 
computer -generated randomization scheme developed by the study  data management 
provider.  The investigator or designee will complete a randomization worksheet prior to 
Visit 1 .  
8.2    Blinding  
This is a single -blinded study, as the subject cannot be blinded to treatment.  AK counts, 
local skin reaction, and ALA appl ication will be performed by the blinded investigator. 
History, concomitant medications, randomization, light exposure, symptom assessment, 
and Skindex -16 will be administered by the unblinded study coordinator.  
8.3 Formulation of Test and Control Products  
8.3.1 Formulation of Test Product  
The active study product is Aminolevulinic acid HCl topical solution 20% (Levulan 
Kerastick) , developed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  for topical administration in 
the management of minimally to moderately -thick AK of the fa ce or scalp. Levulan 
Kerastick consists of a plastic tube containing two sealed glass ampules and a dry 
applicator tip. One ampule contains 354 mg ALA HCl as a dry solid, and the other ampule 
holds 1.5 mL of solution vehicle containing alcohol USP (ethanol  content = 48% v/v), 
water, laureth -4, isopropyl alcohol, and polyethylene glycol. Levulan Kerastick 20% 
topical solution is obtained by breaking both ampules and shaking the plastic tube to mix

Aminolevulinic acid HCl topical solution 20% (Levulan Kerastick) is supplied in 
packages of six single -use plastic tubes with applicator tips. Each plastic tube contains one 
ampule of 354 mg ALA HCl as a dry solid and one ampule of 1.5 m L of solution vehicle. 
Each carton (kit) of ALA HCl topical solution 20% will be labeled with the required FDA 
warning statement, the protocol number, the name of the investigator,  patient number, 
name of sponsor, and directions for use and storage. Each tube will be labeled with the 
expiration date.  
8.4 Supply of Study Drug at the Site  
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd  will ship ALA HCl topical solution 20% (Levulan 
Kerastick) to the investigational site. The initial Levulan Kerastick shipment will be 
shipped after site activation (i.e., all required regulatory documentation has been received 
by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and a contract has been executed.) Subsequent 
Levulan Kerastick shipments will be made after site request for resupply.  
8.4.1 Dosage/Dosage  Regimen  
Aminolevulinic acid HCl topical solution 20% (Levulan Kerastick) will be applied 
topically once by a healthcare provider on the day of treatment. One Levulan Kerastick 
will be applied to the  treatment area on the face or scalp.  Care will be taken to avoid the 
eyes and mouth.  
Treatment arms are as follows:  
A. Conventional arm:  Acetone preparation, ALA topical application, 1 hour 
incubation, 16:40 BLU -U exposure, application of sunscreen.  
B. Combination arm:  Acetone preparation, ALA topical applica tion, 15 minute 
incubation, 16:40 BLU -U exposure, application of sunscreen, 45 minute daylight 
exposure. 
C. Daylight arm:  Acetone preparation, ALA topical application, 15 minute 
incubation, application of sunscreen, 1 hour daylight exposure.  
Due to photose nsitivity, subjects should avoid sunlight, tanning beds, and any prolonged 
or intense light exposure for 40 hours after application of ALA HCl, outside of the 
assigned treatment regimen. Subjects should not wash or clean their faces until all steps of 
treatment have been completed.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Levulan Kerastick will be applied to the subject’s affected areas with in the treatment area. 
The treatment area will be either the face or scalp ; the site w ill be determined at 
Screening.  Prior to Levulan treatment, any hypertrophic AKs in the treatment area will be 
scraped with a curette by the study provider to remove thic k scale.  
The study provider will prepare and administer Levulan Kerastick in the following 
manner:  
1. Hold Levulan Kerastick so the applicator cap is pointing up. 
2. Crush bottom ampule containing solution vehicle by applying finger pressure to 
marked location on the cardboard sleeve.  
3. Crush the top ampule containing the ALA HCl powder by applying finger pressure 
to marked location on the cardboard sleeve. To ensure both ampules are crushed, 
continue crushing the applicator downward  
4. Holding the Levulan Kerastick between the thumb and forefinger, pointing the 
applicator cap away from the face, shake the Levulan Kerastick gently for at least 
30 seconds to mix ALA HCl and solution vehicle. Do not press on end cap while 
shaking.  
5. Apply contents of one Levulan Kerastick using applicator tip to all affected areas 
within treatment area. Mouth, periorbital area, and all mucosal surfaces will be 
avoided.  
 
Depending on the assigned treatment arm, patients will receive 16 minutes, 40 seconds of 
artificial blue light on the tr eatment area via BLU -U blue light phototherapy illuminator  
and/or daylight exposure for the assigned duration. Light exposure will be provided by the 
unblinded study provider.  
8.4.4 Storage  
Study drug should be stored by the study site at  controlled room temper ature, 15 to 30ºC (59 -
86ºF). If the temperature of study drug storage in the clinic/pharmacy exceeds or falls below 
this range, this should be reported to the designee and captured as a deviation.  
8.5 Study Drug Accountability  
An accurate and current accounti ng of the dispensing of study drug for each subject will 
be maintained on an ongoing basis by a member of the study site staff.

11 ADVERSE EVENTS  REPORTING AND DOCUM ENTATION  
11.1 Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clin ical investigation of a 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment.  An AE is therefore any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated 
with the administration of an investigational product, whether or not related to that 
investigational product.  An unexpected AE is one of a type not identified in nature, 
severity, or frequency in the current Investigator’s  Brochure or of greater severity or 
frequency than expected based on the information in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
Protocol Version 1.0  Arron  Confidential  
 
Version #:  1.0 
 Version Date:  March 13 2017 
  Page 23 of 37 
Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  The Investigator will probe, via discussion with the subject, for the occurrence of AEs 
during each subject visit and record the information in the site’s source documents.  
Adverse events will be recorded in the patient CRF.  Adverse events will be described by 
duration (start and stop dates and times), severity, outcome, treatment and relation to 
study drug, or if unrelated, the cause.  
 
AE Severity  
The National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4 .0 should be used to assess and grade AE severity, including 
laboratory abnormalities judged to be clinically significant. The modified criteria can be  
found in the study manual.  If the event  is not covered in the modified criteria, the 
guidelines shown in Table 1 below should be used to grade severity.  It should be pointed 
out that the term “severe” is a measure of intensity and that a severe AE is not necessarily 
serious. 
Table 1.  AE Severity Grading  
Severity (Toxicity Grade)  Description  
Mild (1)  Transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention or therapy required. The  subject may be aware of the sign 
or symptom but tolerates it reasonably well.  
Moderate (2)  Mild to moderate limitation in activity, no or minimal medical 
intervention/therapy required.  
Severe (3)  Marked limitation in activity, medical intervention/thera py required, 
hospitalizations possible.  
Life-threaten ing (4)  The subject is at risk of death due to the adverse event  as it occurred. 
This does not refer to an event  that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.  
 
AE Relationship to Study Drug  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be assessed using the following the 
guidelines in Table 2.  
Table 2.  AE Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  
to Drug Comment 
Definitely  Previously known toxicity of agent; or an event that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the drug; that follows a known or expected response 
pattern to the suspected drug; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of 
the dr ug; and that is not explained by any other reasonable hypothesis.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  Probably  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; that is 
confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug; and that is unlikely to be 
explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state or by other 
interventions.  
Possibly  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to that suspected drug; but 
that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.  
Unrelated  An event that can be determined with certainty to have no relationship to the study 
drug. 
11.2 Serious Adverse Events  (SAE) 
An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse event  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or sig nificant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Other important medical events may also be considered an SAE when, based on 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject or require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes l isted.  
 
11.2.1 Serious Adverse Event  Reporting  
Study sites will document all SAEs that occur (whether or not related to study drug)  per 
UCSF IRB Guidelines .  The collecti on period for a ll SAEs  will begin  after informed 
consent is obtained and end after procedures for the final study visit have been completed.  
In accordance with the standard operating  procedures and policies  of the local Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB) , the site investigator will r eport  SAEs to  the IRB .   
   
12 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJE CTS  
12.1 Early Discontinuation of Study Drug  
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject or the 
investigator, or the Sponsor feels t hat it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation:  
Subject withdrawal of consent (or assent)  
Subject is not compliant with study procedures

subject to discontinue study treatment  
Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
Lost to follow -up 
Sponsor request for early termination of study  
Positive pregnancy test  (females)  
If a subject is withdrawn from treatment due to an adverse event, the subject will be 
followed and treated by the Investigator until the abnormal parameter or symptom has 
resolved or stabilized.   
All subjects who discontinue study treatment should come in for an early discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible and then should be encourag ed to complete all remaining 
scheduled visits and procedures.  
All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspe cified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in 
the subject’s source documents Refer to Section 10  for early termination procedures.  
12.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject or the investigator  , 
or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.   
All subjec ts are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, specified 
or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.   The reason for the subject’s withdra wal from the study will be specified in 
the subject’s source documents.  As noted above, subjects who discontinue study 
treatment early (i.e ., they withdraw prior to Visit 7) should have an early discontin uation 
visit. Refer to Section 10 for early termina tion procedures.  Subjects who withdraw should 
be encouraged to come in for a final visit (and the procedures to be followed would 
include those for their next scheduled visit).   
12.3 Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study treatment will not  be replaced .   
Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced .

The following demogr aphic variables at screening will be summarized by dose level: race, 
gender, age, height and weight.   
15.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
This is a small descriptive study, with the primary tolerability endpoints:  1) peak 
symptom level and composite score durin g the treatment period and 2) symptom level and 
composite score at the end of treatment exposure.  
Symptom level over time during the treatment period will be graphed for visualization 
along the three axes of pain, stinging/burning, and itching/pruritus as well as a composite 
symptom score. Peak symptom level during the treatment period and pain at the end of 
treatment exposure will be compared between the conventional treatment arm (A), the 
combination treatment arm B), and the daylight treatment arm (C), w ith unpaired t -tests.

Protocol Template Effective: 07 JAN 2015  15.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Efficacy and tolerability data will be summarized by each secondary endpoint. 
Symptom level over time during the treatment period will be graphed for visualization 
along the three axes of pain, stinging /burning, and itching/pruritus as well as a composite 
symptom score. Peak symptom level during the treatment period and pain at the end of 
treatment exposure will be compared between the conventional treatment arm (A), the 
combination treatment arm B), and  the daylight treatment arm (C), with unpaired t- tests.  
Percent reduction in the number of actinic keratoses and proportions of patients with 
partial and complete clearance of actinic keratoses will be presented descriptively and 
visualized as histograms.  We will compare the percent reduction in the number of AKs 
and the proportions of patients with clearance between the conventional treatment arm (A) 
and the combination treatment arm B), and between the conventional treatment arm (A) 
and the daylight trea tment arm (C), using unpaired t- tests.  
All analyses will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. In the ITT population, 
patients will be counted in the treatment group upon randomization, regardless of 
receiving any dose of study medication. For  efficacy analysis, all missing values due to 
patient early termination from the study will be imputed using last observation carried 
forward (LOCF) method, as appropriate. For each patient, the Baseline values will be 
defined as those values recorded at D ay 1 prior to dosing. Patients who are lost -to-follow -
up after Baseline will be included to the ITT population carrying forward their Baseline 
values.  
15.5 Interim Analysis  
Not applicable.  
15.6 Sample Size and Randomization 
This is a small descriptive study. With te n subjects in each group, we will be powered to 
detect a 1.25 -point difference in pain (pain scale 1 -10) with a two- sided alpha of 0.05 and 
a power of 0.8.  
16 DATA COLLECTION, RET ENTION AND MONITORING  
16.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject  treated with 
the study drug.   
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a 
subject’s  visit into the protocol -specific Case Report Form (eCRF) when the information 
corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be identified by name in the 
study database or on any study documents to be collected, but will be identified by a s ite 
number, subject number and initials.

16.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting 
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. 
Query reports (Data Clarification Requests) pertaining to data omissions and 
discrepancies will be for warded to the Investigators and study monitors for resolution.  
The study database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes 
to the study database will be documented.  
16.4 Archival of Data 
The database is safeguarded against unauthor ized access by established security 
procedures; appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be 
maintained.   Databases  are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with 
any updates or changes to the database.    
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
16.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data acc essible to the monitor , other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) 
inspectors upon request.  A file for each subject must be maintained that includes the 
signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authori zatio n and copies of all source documentation 
related to that subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of 
source documents from which the information on the CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed cons ent forms, copies of CRFs, Study 
File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years following marketing of 
the investigational product or for two  years after centers have been notified that the IND 
has been discontinued.

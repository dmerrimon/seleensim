Page 6PROTOCOL SUMMARY
This prospective, open -label , non- comparative studywill assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y 
and efficacy  of Intravenous (IV) anidulafungin when used to treat children aged 1 month to 
<18 y ears with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
The primary  study  objective is to assess the safet y andtolerability  of anidulafungin when 
used to treat children with I CC.  Additional assessments will include global response at the 
end of IV therap y (EOIVT) and subsequent time points, exposure -response relationship, the 
rates of relapse (recurrence) and new infection at follow up (FU) visits, and anal ysis of time 
to death during study  therapy  and follow -up visits. 
A sub -study  to explore the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters in children aged 1 month to 
<2years will be performed on a limited number of subject s prior to complete enrollment of 
this age group in this study .
Indication:
Primary  therapy  of invasive candidiasis, including candidemia , in children between the ages 
of 1 month and <18 years.
Background and Rationale:
The incidence of s ystemic invasive f ungal infections has risen significantl y in the past 
decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all sy stemic fungal 
infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
United States.1  The impact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is 
large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing 
numbers of at -
risk subject s due to advances in transpl antation technology  and oncology  
treatment, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration o f broad -spectrum antibiotics.
In the United States, mortality  rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depending 
on the specific subject population and clinical setting.2, 3Current approved treatments for 
infections due to Candida spp. include poly enes, azoles a nd echinocandin antifungal agents.  
Of these, amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most commonly  utilized in the paediatric
population. Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been 
extrapolated from adult studies.  
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of 
candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdomin al abscess and 
peritonitis) in adults .  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is 
approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non -neutropenic 
patients.  To date, there are no clinical studies evaluat ing anidulafungin in paediatric patient
s 
with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y and 
efficacy  of anidulafungin in patient s 1 month to <18 y ears of age with ICC .

Final Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016
Page 7Exposure -response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic (PK-PD)analy sis.
Anidulafungin is a semi -synthetic lipopeptide s ynthesized from a fermentation product of 
Aspergillus nidulans.  It  acts as a non -competitive inhibitor of (1, 3)-β-D-gl ucan s ynthase, an 
enzy me required for s ynthesis of the cell wall in many pathogenic fungi.  Suppression of cell 
wall glucan s ynthesis leads to osmotic instab ility and eventual cell death.
Anidulafungin is active in vitro against a number of important patho genic organisms, 
including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  P. carinii ).
Itis at least as potent as and often more potent than amphotericin B and fluconazole against 
Candida and Aspergillus spp. Activity  of anidulafung in against Candida spp. is fungicidal 
and has been demonstrated under a variet y of growth conditions.
In animal models, anidulafungin has cleared Candida from internal organs and mucosa and 
led to prolonged survival in lethal infections.  Anidulafungin dem onstrated efficacy  in studies 
in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice sy stemically  infected with C. albicans or 
C. glabrata (including fluconazole -and amphotericin B -resistant isolates), 
immunosuppressed rabbits with fluconazole -resistant esophageal and orophary ngeal 
candidiasis, and persistently  neutropenic rabbits with disseminated C . 
albicans candidiasis. 
Study Design
This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study will assess the safet y and efficacy  of 
anidulafungin when used to treat childre n between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subject s must have either a confirmed 
diagnosis of I CC(based on the growth of Candida sp. from a cult ure obtained from a 
normally  sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or mycological evidence highl y 
suggestive of 
Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic 
visualization of y east, h yphae or pseudoh yphae from a sample obtained from a normally  
sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment ).Subjects may  enroll and initiate study  
treatment prior to cu lture confirmation of Candida sp.  If culture confirmation is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study  and receive study  treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator.  Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study  
treatment, the subject will discontinue study  treatment but will remain in the study  for 
continued safet y monito ringfor up t o 6 weeks after the last dose of stud y treatment .  
In order to accelerate the availability of PK and safety data in the lowest age group (1 month 
to < 2 years),the study  population is broadened only  in this age group to include children at 
risk for invas ive candidiasis. Thus, 
eligibility criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to 
additionally  allow enrollment of infants ( aged 1 month -< 2 y ears)who do not have 
microbiologically  confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of c andidiasis, and for whom
the investigator considers antifun gal therap y with at least 5 day s of IV anidulafungin to be 
appropriate.

Page 8All subject s meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day 1, subject is to 
receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a 
daily  maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards.  Subject s
will be stratified by  age (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  
Subject s with microbiologically  confirmed ICC may be switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 
mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 days of anidulafungin IV treatment, 
provided that the pre -specified criteria are met
.  Subjects will receive treatment (either solel y 
IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed b y oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 
14days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive 
negative cultures, separated by  at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and 
improvement of clinical signs and sy mptom sof candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  
Subjects without microbiologically  confirmed Candida infection will be treated with IV 
anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 day s.  Subjects may  be 
switc hed to oral fluconazole (6 -12mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 5 days of 
IV anidulafungin treatment .  
The maximum total treatment duration for all subjects in this study  is 49 days, and the 
maximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungi n is 35 day s.  Th e last day  of study  
treatment will be considered the End of Treatment (EOT). It is expected that the majority  of 
subjects will receive study drug in the hospital; subjects will be permitted to complete study  
medication on an outpatient ba sis if deemed appropriate by  the investigator.
(This paragraph, as well as all text herein related to subjects with Candida endocarditis and 
Candida osteomyelitis, is n ot applicable to Korean
and Portuguese investigator sites.)   In 
subject s with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomy elitis who require continued 
treatment bey ond the maximum total treatment duration (4 9days), this treatment will be 
considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study  drug will not be supplied by  the 
Sponsor.  Fo r the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day  35(for subjects who require
continued IV treatment) or Day  49(for subjects who required continued oral therapy ) will be 
considered the last day  of study  drug treatment.  These subjects are also required to return for 
the 2- week and 6- week follow -up visit following the last dose of study  drug.
All subject s will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearin g potential), fundo scopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated), and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  If a positive culture is returned, repeat cultures are required at least every  
3 day s until 2 consecutive cultures separated b y 24 hours or more are confirmed to be 
negative.  For 
subjects without microbiologically  confirmed ICC, further cultures will be 
drawn at the discretion of the inves tigator .
At selected investigator sites , anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 
6subjects between 1 month to <2 y ears of age to confirm whether or not the recommended 
dosing regimen contained within the protocol for this age group i s appropriate.  These

Page 9subjects may  be administered anidulafugin in one of two way s: either as monotherap y or in 
combination with a second sy stemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B).  
In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin as monotherap y for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, treatment will be administered for a minimum 
duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two 
consecutive negative cultures, separated b y at least 24 hours, following the last positive 
culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptoms of candidemia or invasive 
candidiasis.  In the event the i nvestigator cho oses to administer anidulafungin in combination 
with a second antifungal agent, anidulaf ugin will be discontinued following the obtainment 
of required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis as specified by  the protocol; the data 
from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary  efficacy  endpoint analy ses but will be 
assessed for safe ty.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by  the Sponsor, enrollment will 
be opened to additional subjects within this age group at all investigator sites.  Subsequent to 
this time point, the use of a second s ystemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be 
permitted in any  subject.
A population PK -PDanaly sis will also be performed in all other subject s enrolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinet ic samples will be collected.
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT , 2-week FUand 6-
week 
FU visits. Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events 
and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subject s will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is approximatel y 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have 
received at least one dose of anidulafungin and have 
confirmed Candida infection) .
Objectives:
Primary
To assess the safet y and tolerability of anidulafungin when used to treat children with 
invasive candidiasis, including candidemia.
Secondary 
To assess the efficacy  of anidulafungin, as measured by  global response, at the 
following time points: EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU visit and 6 -week FUvisit;

1.Screening procedures/assessments are to be completed before the first dose of study medication.
2.Follow -up visit (EOT + 2 w eeks) is only required in subjects w ithmicrobiologically confirmed invasive candidiasis/candidemia (ICC).
3.May occur within 72 hours before the first dose of study medication.
4.Subjects undergoing treatment in the outpatient setting may have less frequent assessme nts, but not less than once every 7 days.  Close monitoring of 
subjects in the outpatient setting is required.
5.A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening (prior to treatment initiation), at the end of therapy or at the end of IV therapy, 
whichever is later, and at the 6-week follow -up visit.  Additional testingmay also be performed as per request of the IRB/EC or as required by local 
regulations.
6.Fundoscopic exams should b e performed with pupils dilated if possible.   In addition, when required by the protocol, the exam should be performed by 
an ophthalmologist unless it is not possi ble for practical reasons, in which case i tmay be performed by the princip al investigator or subinvestigator.  
7.If it is not possible to perform a baseline fundoscopic examination prior to the first dose of study drug, it may be performed up to 48hours a fter the 
first dose .  Under extenuating circumstances, if the fundoscopic examination cannot be performed prior to first dose or within 48 hours , every effort 
should be made to perform the examination as soon as possible thereafter.  Please note, if the baseline fundoscopic examination is positive for 
findings consistent with Candida endophthalmitis, then a repeat fundoscopic examination is required at the end of treatment and at the 2 -and 6 -week 
follow -up visits.  Additional fundoscopic assessments, other than those required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicated and 
according to local practice standards.  In the event additional fundoscopic examinations are performed, the results should be recorded on the case 
report form.
8.To be completed only if the baseline fundoscopic examination was abnormal.
9.Blood cultures will be obtained on Day 1, prior to the administration of study drug, for all subjects.  If a positive culture is returned, repeat cultures 
are required at least every 3 d ays until 2 consecutive cultures separated by 24 hours or more are confirmed to be negative. For subjects w ho are 
prematurely discontinued from treatment for any reason, a blood sample for culture should be obtained only if it is clinicall y indicated. For subjects 
without microbiologically confirmed ICC, further cultures will be drawn at the discretion of the investigator.  Pathogen isol ated w ill be documented

10.The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies the subject with definitive diagnosis of ICC for study entry (along with other inclusion 
criteria) and is from a blood or tissue sample that was obtained w ithin 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positi ve for Candida sp.  The result 
of this culture will be re corded on the ‘screening visit” case report form.  In the event the culture result from this sample is pending, plan to record the 
culture result on the screening visit case report form once the organism has been identified and the information is available .  Please note: if the day of 
the screening visit is also Day 1 of treatment, a sample of blood for culture will be obtained; otherwise a sample of blood f or culture is not required 
until the first day of treatment (Day 1), just prior to administration of study drug.
11.A blood culture at the 2 -week and 6 -week follow -up visit is required only if clinically indicated. 
12.Cultures of other sterile sites will be collected as clinically indicated.  Pathogen isolated will be documented.
13.CBC with differential (includi ng RBC count , reticulocytes, white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphoctyes, monocytes, basophils, and platelet count), 
and serum chemistry tests (AST, ALT, Alk -Phos, total Bilirubin, Albumin, BUN or Urea , Cr, Bicarbonate, Glucose, Na, K, Ca, Cl, Mg) are to b e 
repeated on Day 3, 7 and every seven days during treatment phase, and repeated at both follow -up visits.
14.Hem atology and chemistry tests should be repeated at both follow -up visits.
15.An echocardiogram at the time of screening is not required if the test wa s already performed w ithin the previous 96 hours (of the screening visit) .  
The results of the echocardiogram, however, must be recorded in the case report form. (Not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
16.For subjects w ith Candida endoca rditis, either a transesophogeal (prefer red) or transthoracic echocardiogram must be performed at the end of study 
treatment ( ie, at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects who are switc hed t o oral 
therapy).  Additional echocardiogram assessments, other than those required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indi cated and 
according to local practice standards.  In the event additional echocardiogram assessments are performe d, the results should be recorded on the case

17.A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study at the time of screening is not required if the test was already performed within th e previous 96 hours (of 
the screening visit) .  The results of the MRI, however, must be recorded in the case report form.   (Not applicable to Korean and Portuguese 
investigator sites.)
18.For subjects w ith Candida osteomyelitis, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the affected area must be performed at the end of study 
treatment (ie, at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects wh o are switched to oral 
therapy). Additional MRI studies, other than tho se required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicated and according to local 
practice standards.  In the event additional MRI studies are performed, the results should be recorded on the case report for m.  (Not applicable to
Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
19.Prior to the administration of the first dose of study drug, a plasma sample (0.1 –0.2 mL) should be obtained.  Excess blood collected for safety 
laboratory testing may be used for this sample; otherwise it should be co llected directly from the subject.  Follow ing the initiation of study drug 
treatment s ix blood samples (0.3 –0.5mL each) will be collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following time points in the first 6 subjects: 
on Day 1 (receiving 3.0 mg/kg I V infusion); 2 minutes before the end of infusion; on Day 2 (receiving 1.5 m g/kg IV infusion): just prior to the start 
of the infusion, 2 minutes before the end of infusion, and 6, 12 and 24 hours after the start of infusion.  Exact sampling times may be m odified to 
accommodate subject schedules provided the actual time of collection is documented in the Case Report Form (CRF). For the first 6 subjects aged 1 
month to <2 years, use of a second systemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted (these subjects will be enrolled at selected 
centers).
20.Two aliquots of blood samples (one: approximately 0.3 - 0.5 mL for anidulafungin measurement; the other: approximately 1 mL for polysorbate 80 
[the excipient in the formulation] measurement) will be c ollected at 3-5 of the following occasions during the study: Day 1: Post -dose (betw een 
0-2hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion); Day 3: Pre- dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion); Day 5: Post -dose (betw een

Day 9: Pre -dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion).  Exact sampling times may be modified to accommodate subje ct schedules as long 
as the samples are collected during the IV treatment period.   If only 3 samples can be collected, preference is for the two post -dose and one delayed 
post-dose time points. The delayed post -dose sample may be collected prior to Day 7, for example on Day 3, to facilitate the preferred sample 
collection.
21.Only antifungal medications the subject has received within the p ast 30 days prior to enrolment are required to be recorded.
22.Only antifungal medications and their indication for use (eg, for prophylaxis or treatment) are required to be reported during the follow -up period 
unless the subject experiences an adverse effect during this time, in which case all concomitant medications the subject was receiving at the time of 
the adverse event m ust be recorded.
23.These efficacy assessments will be completed only in subjects with microbiologically confirmed ICC.

Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016
Page 211.INTRODUCTION
On 17 February  2006, the US FDA approved intravenous ( IV)anidulafungin in adults for 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis) at a dose of 100 mg daily  (an initial loading dose of 200 mg), and for the 
treatment of esophageal candidiasis, at a dose of 50 mg daily  (an initial loading dose of
100mg).
On 26 September 2007, the European Union ( EU)European Medicines Agency  (EMEA )
approved IV anidulafungin in adult, non-
neutropenic patients for the treatment of invasi ve 
candidiasis, with a recommended dose of 100 mg (an initial loading dose of 200 mg).
On 14 November 2007, Health Canada approved IV anidulafungin for the treatment of 
invasi ve candidiasis/candidemia in adult non-neutropenic patients.
1.1.Indication
In this protocol, anidulafungin is being studied for treatment of invasive candidiasis, 
including candidemia , in children between the ages of 1 month and <18years.
1.2.Background and Rationale
The incidence of s ystemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantl y in the past 
decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all sy stemic fungal 
infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
United States.1Theimpact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is 
large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing 
numbers of at -risk patients due to advances in transplantation technology  and onco logy 
treatme nt, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency  Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration of broad -spectrum antibiotics.  
In the United States, mortality  rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depending 
on the specific patient population and clinical setting.2, 3  Current approved treatments for 
infections due to Candida spp
.include poly enes, azoles and echinocandin antifungal agents.  
Ofthese, amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most commonly  utilized in the paediatric
population.  Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been 
extrapolated from adult studies. 
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinoca ndin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis).  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication and is 
approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia in adult non -neutropenic 
patients.
To date, there are no clinical studie s evaluating anidulafungin in 
paediatric subjects with 
invasive Candida infection.  This study  will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y and efficacy 
of anidulafungin in subjects 1 month to <18 years of age with ICC.  Exposure -response 
relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a population 
pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic (PK-PD) analy sis.

Protocol Amendment 9, 16 September 2016
Page 22Additionally , due to the lack of excipient exposure/response data of pol ysorbate 80 in very  
young children (eg, < 2 years of age), the P aediatric Committee (PDCO) at the European 
Medicines Agency  requested to measur e plasma levels of the excipient poly sorbate 80, a 
solubilizing agent contained in the intravenous (IV) formulation of anidulafungin.  Thus, 
pharmacokinetic s of polysorbate 80 will also be explored.
1.3.Overview of Anidulafungin
Anidulafungin is a semi -synthet ic lipopeptide s ynthesized from a fermentation product of 
Aspergillus nidulans.  It  acts as a non -competitive inhibitor of (1,3) -β
-D-glucan s ynthase, an 
enzy me required for s ynthesis of the cell wall in many pathogenic fungi.  Suppression of cell 
wall gluc an synthesis leads to osmotic instability
 and eventual cell death.  
1.3.1. Pre-Clinical Data
Anidulafungin is active in vitro against a number of important pathogenic organisms, 
including Candida spp., Aspergillus spp., and Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly  P. carinii).  I t 
is at least as potent as and often more potent than amphotericin B and fluconazole against 
Candida and Aspergillus spp.  Activity  of anidulafungin against Candida spp is fungicidal 
and has been demonstrated under a variet y of growth conditions. 
In animal models, anidulafungin has cleared Candida from internal organs and mucosa and 
led to prolonged survival in lethal infections.  Anidulafungin demonstrated efficacy  in studies 
in immunosuppressed and immunocompetent mice sy stemically  infected with C. albicans or 
C. glabrata (including fluconazole -and amphotericin B -resistant isolates), 
immunosuppressed rabbits with fluconazole -resistant esophageal and orophary ngeal 
candidiasis, and persistently  neutropenic rabbits with disseminated C. albicans candidiasis.  
1.3.2. Clinical D ata
Clinical Pharmacology
Anidulafungin exhibits linear and predictable pharmacokinetics.  The pharmacokinetic 
profile of anidulafungin following I V administration is characterized by
 a short distribution 
half-life (t1/2,α) of 0.5- 1 hour, a predominant elimination half- life (t1/2,β) of approximatel y 
24hours that characterizes the majority  of the concentration- time profile, and a terminal 
elimination half -life (t1/2,γ) of 40 -50 hours.  Steady  state is achieved on the first day  after a 
loading dose (twice the daily  maintenance dose).  Anidulafungin is extensively  bound to 
human plasma proteins (>99%).
Anidulafungin undergoes slow chemical degradation to produce a ring -opened peptide that 
lacks antifungal activity , which is subsequently  converted to peptidic degradants and 
eliminated in feces.  Anidulafungin has negligible renal clearance (<1%).  It is not a 
clinically  relevant substrate, inducer, or inhibitor of cy tochrome P450 enzy mes.  No 
clinically  relevant drug -drug interactions were observed when anidulafungin was 
co-administered with cy closporine, voriconazole, tacrolimus, amphotericin B or rifampin.  
Dose adjustments are not required for subject s with any  degree of hepatic or renal 
insufficiency , nor are they  required on the basis of age, gender, weight, ethnicity , disease 
status, or concomitant medications.

Page 23In the paediatric population, pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed in a Phase 1/2
multicenter, open -label, sequential dose -escalation study  (from 0.75 mg/kg/day  
to1.5mg/kg/d ay) of IV anidulafungin administered as earl y empirical therapy  to 
24immunocompromised children ages 2 to 17 years with neutropenia.  Children were 
stratified by  age, from 2 to 11 years and from 12 to 17 y ears.  There was no relationship 
between subject age and the peak concentration (C max), area under curve over dosing interval 
(AUC 24), weight -normalized clearance ( CL), or weight -normalized stead y-state volume of 
distribution ( VSS).  The pharmacokinetic profiles on a weight- adjusted basis of 0.75 and 
1.5mg/kg/day  were similar to the profiles of anidulafungin administered to adults at dosages 
of 50 and 100 mg/day , respectively . 
The pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin have not yet been characterized in subject s less than 
2years of age.  Based upon prior studies and the pharmacokinetic properties of anidulafungin 
(eg, linear pharmacokinetics, minimal renal elimination and no hepatic metabolism), it is 
anticipated that the dose to be used in this age group will be the same as that of subject s aged 
2-
17years. In this study , the pharmacokinetics of anidulafungin will be studied in the first 
6subject s between 1 month to <2 y ears of age to confirm the dosing regimen in this age 
group.  For all other subject s, sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected to e xplore the 
relationship between anidulafungin exposure and response using a population PK-PD
analysis approach , including exploring the association between PK
-PD index (eg, 
AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MI C)) and efficacy  endpoints.  
Efficacy in Invasive Candidiasis, including Candidemia (Adults) 
Anidulafungin was compared to fluconazole in a pivotal Phase 3, double -blind, randomized 
study  ofsubject saged 16 y ears and above with candidemia and other forms of invasive 
candidiasis.  Subject s receiv ed either IV anidulafungin (200 -mg on Day 1 and 100 mg daily  
thereafter) or IV fluconazole (800 mg on Day  1 and 400 mg daily  thereafter, with dosage 
adjustment as necessary  for renal insufficiency ) for 14 to 42 day s.  Subject sin either arm 
could be switch ed to oral fluconazole (400 mg) after at least 10 day s of IV treatment if 
protocol -specified criteria were met.  There were 256 subject s in the Intent to Treat(ITT)
population, of whom 131 received IV anidulafungin and 125 received IV fluconazole.  In the
primary  efficacy  anal ysis of global response ( ie, microbiologic and clinical r esponse) at the 
End of IV T herap y (EOIVT) 
in the Modified- ITT population, 75.6% of 
subject s randomized 
to anidulafungin had a successful response, compared to 60.2% for subject srandomized to 
fluconazole (95% CI 3.85, 26.99). 
Fewer anidulafungin -treated subject s (30 [22.9%]) than fluconazole -treated subject s 
(39[31.2%]) died during and shortly  after the study .  At almost all time points throughout the 
study , the probability  of survival for anidulafungin- treated subject s was higher than for 
fluconazole-treated subject s.  For subject s who died, the median time to death was 14 days 
for fluconazole and 21 day s for anidulafungin.  In subject s with forms of invasive candidiasis 
other than lone candidemia , 8 of 11 (72.7%) who received anidulafungin were considered 
global successes at the EOIVT compared with 8 of 15 (53.3%) subject s in the fluconazole 
group.

3.STUDY DESIGN
This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y 
and efficacy  of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the age s of 1 month and 
<18years with invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed 
diagnosis of I CC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained fr om a 
normally  sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or my cological evidence highl y 
suggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic 
visualization of y east, h yphae or pseudoh yphae from a sample obtaine d from a normally  
sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  Subjects may  enroll and initiate study  
treatment prior to cu lture confirmation of Candida sp.  If culture confirmation is not 
obtained, subjects may remain in the study  and receive study  treatment at the discretion of 
the investigator.  Should the investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study  
treatment, the subject will discontinue study  treatment but will remain in the study  for 
continued safet y monitoring for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of stud y treatment .  
In order to accelerate the availability  of PK and safe ty data in the lowest age group (1month 
to < 2 years),the study  population is broadened only  in this age group to include children at 
risk for invasive candidiasis . Thus, eligibility  criteria have been modified in Amendment 9 to 
additionally  allow enrollment of infants (aged 1 month -< 2 y ears) who do not have

Page 26microbiologically  confirmed Candida but who are at high risk of candidiasis, and for whom 
the investigator considers antifungal therap y with at least 5 day s of IV anidulafungin to be 
appropriate.
All subject s meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  Enrollment will be 
stratified by  age (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 years), allowing 20 2 in 
each stratum .  
Subject s with microbiologically  confirmed ICC may be switched to oral fluconazole 
(6-12mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin 
treatment, provided that all of the following criteria are me t:
The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;
The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;
Documentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by at least 
24hours;
Eradication or presumed eradication of Candida sp. from an y othe r sites of infection 
identified at enrollment;
The specific 
Candida isolate identified at study  entry  is susceptible (or presumed to 
be susceptible based on the species identified and local Candida sp. resistance 
patterns) to fluconazole; 
Signs and sy mpto ms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator 
feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.
Subjects will receive treatment (either solel y IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed by  
oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration o f 14days from the time of the last of negative 
culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by  at least 
24hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and 
symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  
Subjects without microbiologically  confirmed Candida infection will be treated with IV 
anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 day s.  Subjects may  be 
switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 5 days of 
IV anidulafungin treatment . 
The maximum total treatment duration for all subjects in this study  is 49 days, and the 
maximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 day s. Th e last day  of study  
treatment will be considered the End of Treatment (EOT). It is expected that the majority  of 
subjects will receive study drug in the hospital; subjects will be permitted to complete study  
medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate b y the investigator.

Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomy elitis who require continued treatment bey ond the 
maximum total treatment duration (4 9days), this treatment will be considered outside the 
context of this clinical trial and study  drug will not be supplied by  the Sponsor.  For the 
purpose of stud y treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for subjects who requir e continued IV 
treatment) or Day  49(for subjects who required continued oral therapy ) will be considered 
the last day  of study  drug treatment.   These subjects are also required to return for the 
2-week and 6- week follow -up visit following the last dose o f study  drug.
All subject s enrolled in the study  who receive at least one dose of study  drug treatment, 
including those subjects who are discontinued from treatment (regardless of the reason), will 
be followed for a total of 6 weeks after EOT (ie, the last dose of stud y drug treatment) and 
are required to return for the 2- week and 6
-week follow -up visit.
All subject s will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examinat ion, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated) , and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  If a positive culture is returned, repeat blood cultures are required at least 
every  3 day s until 2 cultures separated by  24 hours or more are confirmed to be negative.
For subjects without microbiologically  confirmed ICC, further cultures will be drawn at the 
discretion of the investigator .
At selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 
6subjects between 1 month to <2 y ears of age to confirm whether or not the recommended 
dosing regimen contained within the protocol for this age g roup is appropriate.  These 
subjects may  be administered anidulafu ngin in one of two way s: either as monotherapy  or in 
combination with a second sy stemic antifungal agent (eg , amphotericin B).  
Ifthe investigator cho oses to administer anidulafungin as mo notherap yfor the treatment of 
invasive candidiasis/candidemia, then treatment will be administered for a minimum duration 
of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two 
consecutive negative cultures, separated b y at least 24 hours, following the last positive 
culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive 
candidiasis.  
In the event the i nvestigator choses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a second 
antifungal agent, anidul afungin will be discontinued following the obtainment of required 
blood samples for pharmacokinetic analy sis as specified by  the protocol; the data from these 
subjects will not be utilized for secondary  efficacy endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for 
safety.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed b y the Sponsor, enrollment will be opened to 
additional subjects within this age group at all investigator sites.  Subsequent to this time 
point, the use of a second sy stemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be 
permitted in any  subject.

It is expected that the majority  of subject s will receive study  drug in the hospital; subject s
will be per mitted to complete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate 
by the investigator.
All male subjects who are able to father children and female subjects who are of childbearing 
potential and are sexually  active and at risk for pregnancy ,must agree to use a highly  
effective method of contraception consistentl y and correctly for the duration of the active 
treatment period and up to the 6 week follow- up visit.  The investigator or his orher 
designee , in consultation with the subject, will select the most appropriate method of 
contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see 
below) , and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  Subjects need to affirm that 
they meet the criteria fo r correct use of at least 1of the selected methods of contraception.  
The investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly  
effective contraception consistently  and correctly  according to the schedule of activities and 
document such conversation in the subject’s chart.   The investigator or his or her designee , at 
each stud y visit, will confirm and document consistent and correct use.  In addition, the 
investigator or his or her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately  if the selected 
birth control method is discontinued or if pregnancy  is known or suspected in the subject or 
the subject’s partner .  
Highly  effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a 
failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently  and correctly  (ie,perfect use) and 
include:
1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected ,implanted or transdermal hormonal 
methods of contraception is allowed provided the subject plans to remain on the same 
treatment throughout the entire study  and has been using that hormonal contraceptive 
for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.
2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD) .
3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a spermicide (i e,foam, gel, film, cream, 
suppository ).For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly effective contraception, this option is not 
appropriate .
4.Male sterilization with appropriatel y confirmed absence of sperm in the post -
vasectom y ejaculate .
5.Bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral salpingectom yor bilateral tubal occlusive 
procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the 
device’s label) .

Page 356.Female partner who meets the criteria for non-childbearing potential, as described 
below:
Female subjects of non -childbearing potential must meet at least one of the following 
criteria:
Have undergone a documented hy sterectomy  and/or bilateral oophorectomy ;
Have medically  confirmed ovarian failur e; or 
Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation of regular    
menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or 
physiological cause; status may  be confirmed b y having a serum follicle 
stimulating hormone (FS H) level confirming the post- menopausal state.
All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered 
to be of childbearing potential.
Complete abstinence may be considered an acceptable method of contraception on a 
case-by-c
ase basis with Pfizer’s concurrence prior to performing an y screening tests or 
procedures for the study .  This decision and Pfizer’s concurrence should be document edin 
the subject’s source record.
4.5.Central Venous Catheter Management
Because Candida species adhere avidly  to materials used in vascular catheters, catheter 
removal is strongly  recommended in the management of candidemia.  The date the suspected 
infected intravascular catheter was inserted and removed will be recorded in the Case Report 
Form ( CRF ).  The insertion of an y new intravascular catheters, including changing catheters 
over a guide -wire will also be documented on the non -pharmacological treatment procedure 
record.  An y cultures that were done on the tip of the catheter or site of the cathe ter insertion 
will be recorded in the CRF.
4.6. Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel
The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately
 qualified medical personnel for the 
study  is documented in the study  contact list located in the investigator site file.
To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical 
questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, sub ject study  numbers, 
contact information for the investigational site, and contact details for a contact center in the 
event that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical 
question or problem originating from another he althcare professional not involved in the 
subject’s participation in the study .The contact number can also be used by  investigational 
staff if they  are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used

5.STUDY TREATMENTS
5.1.Allocation to Treatment
This study is open- label and all subject s will receive anidulafungin.  The investigator’s 
knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a particular subject or 
affect the order in which subject s are enrolle d.  
Eligible subject s will be considered enrolled into the study  provided they  have satisfied all 
entry  criteria and a legal representative hasprovided consent.  Subject
s will be assigned a 
subject number at the time of screening.  This identify ing numbe r will be retained for the 
subject throughout the duration of study  participation and must be used on all 
correspondence and documentation. 
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that the subject is eligible for the study .  
All subject s will receive IV anidulafungin . For dosing purposes y ounger subjects must be 
weighed frequentl y (such as daily), but less frequently for older children as determined b y 
the investigator.  On Day 1, subject is to receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to e xceed 
200mg).  Subject is then to recei ve a dail y maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 
100mg) from Day  2 onwards.    
After a minimum of 10 day s of treatment with IV anidulafungin, subject s with 
microbiologically  confirmed I CC may be switched to oral fluconazole (6 –12 mg/kg/day , 
maximum 800 mg/day ) provided that all of the following criteria are met:
The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hour;
The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;
Documentation of two blood cultures negative for Candida spp separated by at least 
24 hours;
Eradication or presumed eradication of Candida sp. 
from an y other sites of infection 
if identified at enrollment;
The specific 
Candida isolate identified at study  entry  is susceptible (or presumed to 
be susceptible based on the species identified and local Candida sp. resistance 
patter ns)to fluconazole ;
Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator 
feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.

Page 37Treatment will continue for a minimum duration of 14 day s from the time of the last negative 
culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by  at least 
24hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and 
symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  
Subjects without microbiologically  confirmed Candida infection will be treated with IV 
anidulafungin at the discretion of the investigator to a maximum of 35 day s.  Subjects may  be 
switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12mg/k g/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 5 days of 
IV anidulafungin treatment .
The maximum total treatment duration for all subjects in this study  is 49 day s, and the 
maximum allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 day s. Th e last day  of study  
treatment will be considered the EOT.  Subject swill be followed in the study  for a total of 6 
weeks after EOT .  It is expected that the majorit y of subjects will receive study  drug in the 
hospital; subjects will be permitted to complete study  medication o
n an outpatient basis if 
deemed appropriate by the investigator.
(The following two paragraphs are not applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator 
sites.)
** Important Note for Subjects with 
Candida Endocarditis and Candida 
Osteomyelitis **  
The maxi mum total treatment duration in this study is 49 day s, and the maximum allowed 
treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 day s.  After at least 10 day s of treatment with 
anidulafungin, subjects may  be switched to oral fluconazole (provided switch criteria are 
met) to complete treatment.
In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomy elitis who require continued 
treatment bey ond the maximum total treatment duration (49 day s), this treatment will be 
considered outside the context of this clinical t rial and study  drug will not be supplied by  the 
Sponsor.  For the purpose of study  treatment evaluation, Day  35 (for subjects who require 
continued IV treatment) or Day  49(for subjects who required continued oral therapy ) will be 
considered the last day  of study  drug treatment.  These subjects are also required to return for 
the 2- week and 6

Page 395.2.3. Administration
Anidulafungin will be administered intravenousl y at an infusion rate not exceeding 
1.1 mg/minute.  Anidulafungin loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on the first 
day of treatment should be administered intravenously  at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or less, 
however the actual duration of infusion time should not exceed the calculated duration of 
infusion time (based on 1.1 mg/min) plus an additional 30 minutes. For example, for a child 
weighing 25 kg, the calculated duration of infusion time (based on a rate of 1.1 mg/min) 
would be 68 minutes, and maximum duration of infusion would be 98 minutes (68 minutes 
plus 30 minutes). 
Anidulafungin maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 1 00mg) on subsequent 
days should be administered intravenousl y at a rate of 1.1 mg/min or less, however the actual 
duration of infusion time should not exceed the calculated duration of infusion time (based 
on 1.1 mg/min) plus an additional 30 minutes. For example, for a child weighing 25 kg, the 
calculated duration of infusion time (based on a rate of 1.1 mg/min) would be 34 minutes, 
and maximum duration of infusion would be 64 minutes (34 minutes plus 30 minutes). 
** Important Note **  In subjects who a lready initiated on IV anidulafungin prior to 
study entry, a repeat loading dose is not required.  Instead, these subjects may be 
initiated on maintenance doses of IV anidulafungin.
5.2.4. Medication Errors 
Medication errors may  result, in this study , from the administration or consumption of the 
wrong drug, b y the wrong subject, at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength.  Such 
medication errors occurring to a study  participant are to be captured on the adverse event 
(AE) page of the CRFs and on the Seri ousAdver se Event ( SAE )form when appropriate.  In 
the event of medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately .
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including:
Medication errors involving patient exposure to the product. 
Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do 
or do not involve the participating subject.
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by  an AE, as determined by  the 
investigator, the medication error and, if applicable, an y associated adverse event(s) is 
captured on an adverse event (AE) CRF page (refer to ADVERSE EVENT REPORTI NG

Page 405.2.5. Compliance
It is expected that the majority  of the subjects will receive study  drug in the hospital setting.  
In this case, compliance with I V and oral therapy  administered during hospitalization will be 
assessed b y the Study Monitor during site visits, and by  the s ponsor upon review of the study  
data at the end of the study .
Subjects who are switched to oral treatment and discharged from the hospital will be 
provided with a known quantity  of oral study  medication for continued therapy  in the 
outpatient setting.  Appropriate drug accountabil ity measures should be implemented to 
appropriatel y evaluate compliance.  Subjects should also be interviewed regarding adherence 
to treatment.
5.3. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability 
Investigational product should be stored in its original container and in accordance with the 
label.  Detailed information regarding Drug Storage will be provided b y the sponsor to each 
investigative site with the Written Dosing Administration I nstructions.  Refer to the Dosing 
Administration I nstructions for detailed instructions regarding dose storage. Storage 
conditions stated in the single reference safet y document (SRSD ) (eg, investigator’s brochure 
[IB], will be superseded by  the storage conditions stated in the labeling.
The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all 
investigational products are stored in a secured area, under re quired storage conditions and in 
accordance with applicable regulatory  requirements. 
Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a 
minimum, daily  minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as 
applicable, including frozen, refrigerated and/or room temperature products).  This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throu ghout thestudy .  Even for 
continuous monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure thatensures active daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be available.  The operation of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported upon discovery . 
The site should activel y pursue options for returning the product to the st orage conditions as 
described in the labeling, as soon as possible.  Deviations from the storage requirements, 
including any  actions taken, must be documented and reported to the sponsor.  Once an 
excursion is identified, the investigational product must b e quarantined and not used until the 
sponsor provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product.  It will not 
be considered a protocol deviation if the sponsor approves the use of the investigational 
product after the temperature excur sion. Use of the investigational product prior to sponsor 
approval will be considered a protocol deviation.
Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursio n will be 
provided to the site.

Page 41The investigator, or approved representative ( eg, pharmacist) must maintain adequate records 
documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product(s). 
When investigational product is taken home b y the subject, all unused products must be 
returned to the in vestigator by  the subject at the follow -up visit.  Pfizer may supply  drug 
accountability  forms that must be used or may  approve use of standard institution forms. In 
either case, the forms must identify  the investigational product, including batch or code
numbers, and account for its disposition on a subject -by-subject basis, including specific 
dates and quantities.  The forms must be signed by the individual who dispensed the drug, 
and copies must be provided to Pfizer. 
Pfizer or designee will provide in structions as to destruction of an y unused investigational
product.  If Pfizer authorizes destruction at the study site, the investigator must ensure that 
the materials are destro yed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, 
institutional po licy, and any  special instructions provided by  Pfizer.  Destruction must be 
adequatel y documented.  
5.4. Concomitant Medication(s)
Any medication that the subject takes other than the study  drug specified in the protocol is 
considered concomitant medication.  Information about concomitant medic ations will be 
recorded in the Case Report F orm (CRF) from the screening visit through the EOT.  
At the 2- week and 6
-week FU Visits, only  antifungal therap y the subject receives and the 
indication for use (eg, prophy laxis, treatment) will be recorded in the CRF.  The use of 
non-absorbable antifungal drugs (eg, clotrimazole troches) is not required to be reported.
The recording of concomitant medications other than antifungal agents at these time points is 
not required unl ess the subject experiences an adverse event during the follow- up period, in 
which case all concomitant medications that the subject was receiving at the time of the 
adverse event must be recorded.  
Treatment with another sy stemic antifungal agent [aside from oral nonabsorable azoles (eg, 
clotrimazole troches) in not permitted, with the following exception: for the PK sub- study  
only (first 6 subject s aged 1 month to <2 y ears) administration of a second medication 
classified as an azole, polyene, or echinoc andin will be allowed during the study  treatment 
phase , at the Investigator’s discretion
.  
6.STUDY PROCEDURES
It is expected that all subject s will be hospitalized at the time study  treatment is initiated, and 
will therefore be under continuous medical surv eillance during the earl y period (if not all) of 
therap y.
Witnessed written parental or legal guardian consent and assent from the child or adolescent 
must be obtained prior to performing an y screening procedures.  Subject identification 
numbers will be as signed sequentially  as subject s are screened into the study and these 
numbers will be retained throughout the study .

by an ophthalmologist unless it is not possible for practical reaso ns, in which c ase it 
may be performed by  the principa l investigator or subinvestigator. If it is not possible 
to perform a fundoscopic examination prior to the first dose of study  drug, 
it may  be 
performed within 48 hours of the first dose.  Under extenua ting circumstances, if a 
fundoscopic examination cannot be performed at baseline or within 48 hours, every  
effort should be made to perform the examination as soon as possible thereafter. 
Record screening b lood and/or tissue (as clinicall y indicated) cultureresults ( Note: I f 
organism identity  is pending, plan to record results on the case report form at a later 
time when the organism identity  is determined and the results are available );
Obtain blood sample for blood culture if the day  of the screening vi sit is also Day  1 of 
treatment.  Otherwise, a blood sample for blood culture is not required until the first 
day of treatment ( Day 1), just prior to the administration of study drug;

6.2.Study Period
6.2.1. Daily, T hrough End of Treatment
Study  drug administration
: a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) on 
Day 1, and a maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg)subsequently ;
Record temperature (Note: Subjects receiving treatment in the outpatient setting may  
have less frequent as sessments, but not less than at least once every  7 day s.  Close 
monitoring of subjects treated in the outpatient setting is required); 
Record Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications ;
Cultures of other normally  sterile sites as clinically  indicated.
6.2.2. Days 1 and 2 ONLY for Sub-study Subject s (first 6 subject s aged 1 month to 
<2years at selected sites)
Prior to the administration of the first dose of study  drug, a plasma sample (0.1 – 0.2 mL) 
should be obtained and sent to the reference laboratory  to test for assay  interference.  Excess 
blood collected for safet y laboratory  testing may  be used for this sample, otherwise it should 
be collected directl y from the subject.
Pharmacokinetic sampling :Six (6) blood samples ( 0.3-0.5 ml each to provide 
0.1 – 0.2 mL plasma ) will be collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following time 
points: 
On Day 1: 2 minutes before the end of infusion ;

Page 44On Day 2: Just prior to the start of infusion ;2 minutes before the end of infusion, 
6hours after start of infusion, 12 hours after start of infusion, and 24 hours after start 
of infusion.
In the event that the sam ple required 2 minutes before the end of infusion was not 
taken at the specified time, every  effort must be made to acquire a sample within 
5minutes of the end of infusion with proper and specific time documentation.
Note: In case the subject s are not ready  for serial pharmacokinetic sampling on this specific 
day, this can be re -arranged at a later date when they continue to receive 1.5 mg/kg daily  
maintenance d ose of anidulafungin.  The flexibility  of the sampling time is also allowed as 
long as the actual time of collection is recorded in the CRF.
Ideally, the pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling would be taken from a different site/line than the 
one used for stud y drug infusion. However, at the discretion of the investigator and with 
appropriate flushing of the line to clear all drug residues, samples may be collected using the 
same line.
** Important Note **  For subjects in whom the investigator has chosen to administer 
anidulafungin in combination with a second antifungal agent, these subjects will be 
discontinued from treatment following completion of pharmacokinetic sampling but 
will remain in the study for continued safety assessments and are required to return for 
the 2 -week and 6 -week follow -up visits.
For subjects in whom the investigator has chosen to administer anidulafungin as 
monotherapy , following completion of pharmacokinetic sampling these subjects will 
continued to be treated with anidulafungin for a minimum duration of 14 days from the 
time of the last negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative 
cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following the last positive culture) and 
improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candid emia or invasive candidiasis.

6.7.Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw from the study  treatment at any  time at their own request, or they  
may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safet y, 
behavioral reasons or the inability  of the subject to comply  with the protocol required 
schedule of stud y visits or procedures at a given study site .  If a subject is withdrawn from 
the study treatment , on the last day  of study  
drug administration the investigator will perform 
all EOT procedures and complete the EOT CRF.
In addition, these subjects will continue to be monitored for the occurrence of adverse effects 
(serious and non -serious) for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of stud y treatment . Refer to 
Section 6.5 and Section 6.6 for follow -up visit requirements. 
Ifa subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every  effort should be made to contact the 
subject.  In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome .
If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for di sclosure of future 
information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be 
collected.  The sponsor may  retain and continue to use any  data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent.
6.8.Subject Withdrawal Due to Lack of Conf irmation of Candida Infection
Subjects who were enrolled on the basis of suspected Candida infection may remain in the 
study  and receive study  treatment at the discretion of the investigator, 
if culture results are 
either negative for Candida sp. or not obtained after treatment initiation.  Should the 
investigator choose to withdraw the subject from study treatment , on the last day  of study  
drug administration the investigator will perform all EOT procedures and complete the EOT 
CRF .  In addition, these subjects will continue to be monitored for the occurrence of adverse 
effects (serious and non -serious) for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of study  treatment . 
Refer to Section 6.5 and Section 6.6 for follow -up visit requirements.

AST and/or ALT >10x the upper limit of normal, regardless of causalit y.
Note: These subjects will be discontinued from study  treatment but will remain in the study  
for safety  monitoring according to the procedures described in Section 6.7.  These subjects 
are required to return for the 2 -and 6 -week follow -up visits.
6.10. Discontinuation Criteria for Persistent Candidemia
Subjects who were either candidemic at baseline or become candidemic during the course of 
the study  will be considered treatment failures and discontinued from study treatment if 
candidemia persists for more than 7 day s.
Note: These subjects will be disco ntinued from study  treatment but will remain in the study  
for safety  monitoring according to the procedures described in Section 6.7. These subjects 
are required to return for the 2 -and 6 -week follow -up visits.
7.ASSESSMENTS
All subjects will undergo safet y, clinical ,laboratory and PK assessments 
during this trial. 
Every  effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are 
completed as described. However it is an ticipated that from time to time there may  be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator, that may  make it unfeasible to 
perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safet y and well being of the subject. When a protocol required test can not be performed the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions 
which he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. 
The st udy team will be informed of these incidents in a timely  fashion.
7.1.Pregnancy Testing
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine or serum pregnancy  test, with 
sensitivity  of at least 25 mI U/mL, will be performed at screening, end of IV therap y, end of 
oral therap y, and long term follow up visit.  
A negative pregnancy  result is required before 
the subject may  receive the investigational product.   Pregnancy  tests will also be done 
whenever one menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment pe riod to confirm the 
subject has not become pregnant during the stud y.  Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as 
per request of an Institutional Review Board (IRB)
/Independent E thics Committee (IEC)or if 
required b y local regulations.

Page 517.2.Clinical Assessments
All clinical assessments are to be performed b y the Investigator and recorded in the subject’s 
chart and the Case Report Form (CRF).  I t will be particularl y important for I nvestigators to 
carefully monitor subjects for any  Adverse Events that could be related to the study  drug.  
Clinical assessments will include:
a.Complete phy sical examination: height, weight, general appearance and vital signs 
(systolic and diastolic blood pressure, temperature, pulse and respiratory  rates); 
cardiovascular s ystem; abdomen and gastrointestinal sy stem; urinary  system; 
respiratory  system; and central nervous s ystem.  Other examinations may also be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator.
b.Targeted ph ysical examination: this is a simplified abbreviated and focused phy sical 
exam relevant to the patient’s condition and progress as determined b y the 
Investigator and includes the vital signs.
c.Medical History : including (as appropriate) age, gender, medical history , surgical 
history , prior medications (only  antifungal agents w ithin 30 day s prior to enrolment) , 
adverse reactions to medications, and history  of hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular 
systems .
d.Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection: The signs and sy mptoms of Candida
infection are diverse and dependent on disease severi ty, the site of infection and status 
of the host immune sy stem. Constitutional sy mptoms suggestive of sy stemic 
infection include fever and sepsis (eg, tach ycardia, hy potension). Infection of 
visceral organ(s) t ypically manifest as organ d ysfunction and m ay include radiologic 
findings demonstrative of singular or multiple microabscesses. The most frequently  
observed signs and s ymptoms of commonly  encountered forms of candidiasis are 
listed in the Case Report Form. However, the investigator is referred to the most 
recent clinical practice guidelines (published in March 2009), from the Infectious 
Diseases Societ y of America on the management of Candidiasis for comprehensive 
review of signs and s ymptoms associated with this disease .8
7.3.Global Response Determination
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT and FU visits.  Rates of 
relapse (recurrence) and /or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  These efficacy  
parameters will be derived in the anal ysis from the investigator’s assessment of clinical and 
microbiologic response, and are defined below.  
Global response, which will be derived from both investigator assessed clinical and 
microbiologic responses, will be defined as follows:
Success : Asubject will be categorized as a success if there is both a clinical success
(cure or improvement) and microbiological success (eradication or presumed 
eradication) ;

In addition, subject s will be contacted ( eg, in person, by telephone, mail ,or e-mail) to 
determine survival status at 2- Week and 6- Week after EOT.  If a subject cannot be contacted, 
survival status may  be obtained through a family  member, hospital/clinic records or 
information that is in the public domain.
7.5.Electrocardiogram (ECG)
After the ini tiation of the first dose of anidulafungin, if a ventricular arrh ythmia occurs and is
assessed b y the investigator as clinicall y significant, the investigator should collect a standard
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at that time.
The investigator or a des ignated person will determine the appropriateness of the ECG
recordings for interpretation. It may  be necessary  to repeat the ECG to obtain a readable
tracing, calibrate the machine, or rule out improper lead placement. A printout of the ECG
will be sent out to a central laboratory .
7.6.Fundoscopic Examinations
Fundoscopic exams should be performed with pupils dilated if possible .  In addition, when 
required b y the protocol, the exam should be performed by  an ophthalmologist unless it is not 
possible for prac tical reasons, in which case i tmay be performed by  the Princip al 
investigator or subinvestigator(s) .
If it is not possible to perform a fundoscopic examination prior to the first dose of study  drug, 
it may  be performed up to 48 hours af ter the first dose.
  Under extenuating circumstances, if 
a fundoscopic examination cannot be performed prior to the first dose or within 48 hours, 
every  effort should be made to perform the examination as soon as possible thereafter.

and according to local practice standards.  In the event additional fundoscopic examinations 
are performed, the results should be recorded on the case report form.
7.7.Safety Assessmen ts
All subjects who receive at least one dose of stud y medication will be evaluated for safet y.  
Safety  will be assessed at each visit through phy sical examination, assessment of laboratory  
parameters and assessment of adverse events.  It will be particula rly important for 
investigators to carefully  monitor subjects for any  adverse events, including elevations in 
liver function tests,thatcould be related to anidulafungin.
7.8.Laboratory Assessments
7.8.1. Hematology and Blood Chemistry
The study  sites will process r outine hematolog y and blood chemistry specimens locally.

alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, albumin, glucose, calcium, magnesium. 
7.8.2. Echocardiogram (For Subjects with Candida Endocarditis) (This section is not 
applicable to Korean and Portuguese investigator sites.)
For subjects with Candida endocarditis, either a transesophogeal (prefer red) or transthoracic 
echocardiogram will be performed at the time of screening.  If, however, the test was already  
performed within the previous 96 hours (of the screening visit) , then an echocardiogram at 
the time of screening i s not required.  In this case, results of the echocardiogram used to 
support the initial diagnosis will be recorded in the case report form.
An echocardiogram will also be performed at the end of study  treatment (ie, at the end of 
treatment with IV anidula fungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects 
who are switched to oral therap y).  Results of the echocardiogram will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.
Additional echocardiogram assessments, other than those required b ythe protocol, should

Page 587.8.5. Microbiol ogical Determinations
1.Screening Culture(s) :The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies 
the subject with definitive diagnosis of ICC for study  entry  (along with other 
inclusion criteria) and is from a blood or tissue sample (obtained from a normally  
sterile) that was obtained within 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positive 
for Candida sp.  The result of this culture will be recorded on the ‘screening visit’ 
case report form.
In the event the subject is enrolled on the b asis of my cologic evidence suggestive of 
Candida infection (see Section 4.1, Inclusion Criteria) and the organism has not y et 
been identified, once the final identification has been determined the result will be 
recorded on the ‘screening visit’ case report form.
2.On-Study Blood Cultures: Blood cultures will be obtained on Day  1 (prior to the 
administration of the first dose) in all subjects .
a.If a positive culture is returned, repeat cultures ar e required at least every  3 
days until 2 consecutive cultures, separated b y at least 24 hours, are confirmed 
to be negative while on study  medication .  Blood cultures will be obtained at 
the end of IV therap y (EOIVT), and at the end of oral therap y (in subjects 
switched to oral fluconazole).  For subjects who are prematurel y discontinued 
from treatment for an y reason, a blood sample for culture should be obtained 
only if it is clinically  indicated. A blood culture at the 2- week and 6-
week 
follow -up visit is required only  if clinicall y indicated.  
b.
For subjects without microbiologically confirmed ICC , further cultures will be 
obtained at the discretion of the investigator.  The results of the cultures 
should be recorded on the case report form.
c.Additional cu ltures bey ond those required b y the protocol may be obtained at 
any time at the investigator’s discretion, as clinically  indicated.  The results of 
the cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
3.Tissue Cultures : For subjects with microbiologicall y confirmed ICC whose 
screening cultures were obtained from sterile site samples (other than blood), follow -
up cultures from the same anatomical site should be repeated onl y as clinically 
indicated, otherwise they are not required.   For subjects without mi crobiologically 
confirmed ICC , cultures will be obtained as clinically  indicated at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The results of the cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
Investigators will send specimens (blood or other) to their lo cal certified laboratory  for 
culture (incubation should be a minimum of five day s if not positive before then).  Each 
laboratory  will follow its usual procedures for identification of the species and susceptibility  
testing to marketed agents.

isolated from a single culture, all isolates must be sent to the reference laboratory .  The 
susceptibility  testing will be conduc ted using the current Clinical and Laboratory  Standards 
Institute (CL SI) approved standard method.
7.9.Pharmacokinetic Assessments
7.9.1. Blood Sampling for Subjects in the PK Sub -Study (1 M onth to <2 Years of A ge)
The first 6 children aged <2 y earsenrolled in the PK substudy  (at selected c enters ) will 
undergo the PK sampling as described below.
Prior to the administration of the first dose of study  drug, a plasma sample (0.1 – 0.2 mL) 
should be obtained and sent to the reference laboratory  to test for assay  interference.  Excess 
blood coll ected for safet y laboratory  testing may  be used for this sample, otherwise it should 
be collected directl y from the subject.
Following initiation of treatment, blood samples (approximatel y 0.3 - 0.5 mL each) will be 
collected for anidulafungin measurement at the following 6 time points. 
On Day  1(receiving 3 mg/kg I V infusion): 2 minutes before the end of infusion;
On Day 2 (receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV infusion): Just prior to the start of infusion ;
2minutes before the end of infusion, 6, 12 and 24 hours af ter the start of infusion.  
Due to the special conditions of the study  population, the sampling time and day  can be 
flexible in order to fit the subject ’s schedule.  For instance, if serial pharmacokinetic 
sampling cannot be scheduled on Day  2, subject s will continue to remain on IV treatment to 
allow sample collection at a later date.  The actual sampling time and date will be recorded in 
the CRF.
7.9.2. Blood Sampling for All Subjects (Except for the First Six Subjects Age 1 Month 
to <2 Yrs Enrolled in the PK S ub-Study)
Two aliquots of b lood samples ( one: approximately  
0.3 - 0.5 mL for anidulafungin 
measurement; the other: approximatel y 1 mL for polysorbate 80 [ a formulation exc ipient ] 
measurement ) will be collected at 3 - 5of the following occasions during the study  for all 
subject s (except for the first 6 subject s enrolled in the 1 month -<2 year age group):
Day 1: Post-dose (between 0 -2 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion ); 
Day 3: Pre-dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion);
Day 5: Post-dose (between 0 -3 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion);

Day 9: Pre-dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion). 
The above sam pling day s are flexible and could be modified at the discretion of each study  
center as long as samples are collected during the treatment period with anidulafungin.   If 
only 3 samples can be collected, preference is for the two post- dose and one delay ed post-
dose time points. The delayed post -dose sample may  be collected prior to Day  7, for 
example on Day  3, to facilitate the preferred sample collection.
Blood samples for anidulafungin and pol ysorbate 80 measurement swill be centrifuged at 
approximatel y 1700 g for about 10 minutes at 4°C.  The plasma will be stored in 
appropriatel y labeled screw -capped pol yprop ylene tubes at approximately  -20°C within 1 
hour of for anidulafungin and at approximatel y -70°C within 30 minutes of collection for 
polysorbate 80.  Detailed information on sample collection and/or processing information for 
anidulafungin and pol ysorbate 80 measurement swill be provided in the central laboratory  
manual .
Plasma samples will be analy zed for anidulafungin and poly sorbate 80 using valid ated 
analytical methods in compliance with Pfizer standard operation procedures.  
8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
8.1.Adverse Events
All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal 
relationship to the investigational produ ct(s) will be reported as described in the following 
sections. 
For all adverse events, the investigator must pursue and obtain information adequate both to 
determine the outcome of the adverse event and to assess whether it meets the criteria for 
classifi cation as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to Pfizer or its 
designated representative.  For all adverse events, sufficient information should be obtained 
by the investigator to determine the causality  of the adverse event.  The inve stigator is 
required to assess causality Follow -up by  the investigator may  be required until the event or 
its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs 
with that assessment.
As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any  non- serious adverse event 
that is determined b y the Sponsor to be serious will be reported b y the Sponsor as an SAE.   
To assist in the determination of case seriousness further information may  be requested from 
the investigator to provide clarit y and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical 
trial.

Page 618.2.Reporting Period
For serious adverse events, the active reporting period to Pfizer or its designated 
representative begins from the time that the subject provide s informed consent, which is 
obtained prior to the subject’s participation in the study , ie, prior to undergoing any  
study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product, through and including the 
6week follow -up visit.  
SAEs occurring to a s ubject after the active reporting period has ended should be reported to 
the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the 
investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility  of being related to investigational
product are to be reported to the sponsor.
Adverse events (serious and non -serious) should be recorded on the CRF from the 
time the subject has taken at least one dose of study  treatment through last subject 
visit.
Reported SAEs occurring after the active report period will be reported in the safet y 
database but will not be recorded in the CRF (ie, clinical database).
8.3.Definition of an Adverse Event
An adverse event is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a produc t or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal 
relationship with the treatment or usage.  Examples of adverse events include but are not 
limited to:  
Abnormal test findings;
Clinically  significant symptoms and signs;
Changes in phy sical examination findings;
Hypersensitivity ;
Progression/worsening of underl ying disease ;
Drug abuse;
Drug dependency .
Additionally , they  may  include the signs or s ymptoms resulting from:
Drug overdose;
Drug withdrawal;
Drug misuse;

Page 62Drug interactions;
Extrava sation;
Exposure during pregnancy (EDP) ;
Exposure via breast feeding ;
Medication error ;
Occupational exposure
8.4.Abnormal Test Findings
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as 
an adverse event are as follo ws: 
Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or
Test result requires additional diagnostic testing o r medical/surgical intervention;
and/or
Test result leads to a change in study  dosing (outside of protocol- stipulated dose 
adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant 
drug treatment, or other therap y;and/or
Test result is considered to be an adverse event b y the investigator or sponsor.
Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the ab ove conditions, does not 
constitute an adverse event.  Any  abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does 
not require reporting as an adverse event.
8.5.Serious Adverse Events
A serious adverse event is any  untoward medical occurrence at any  dose that:
Results in death;
Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death);
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the 
ability  to cond uct normal life function);
Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect;

Page 63Lack of efficacy  in an approved indication should be reported as a serious adverse 
event;
Lack of efficacy  should be reported as an adverse event when it is associated with a 
serious adverse event.
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may  not be immediately  life-threatening and/or 
result in death or hospitalization.  However, if it is deter mined that the event may  jeopardize 
the subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, 
the important medical event should be reported as serious.
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; 
or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
8.5.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events 
The following expected, SAEs will be reported b y the in vestigator as described in previous 
sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safety database (see Section 8.13.1 SAE 
Reporting Requirements) but will not be reported individually  in an exp edited manner 
because they  are anticipated to occur in the stud y population:  
Progression of underl ying malignancy  (eg, leukemia, ly mphoma);
Aspergillosis ;
Bacterial infection .
Should an aggregate analysis indicate that these prespecified events occur mor e frequently  
than expected based on the expectation of frequency  of the event(s) in question in the 
population for comparison, eg, based on epidemiological data, literature, or other data, then 
this will be submitted and reported in accordance with Pfizer’ s safet y reporting requirements.  
Aggregate anal ysis of safety  data will be performed on a regular basis per internal standard 
operating procedures.  
8.5.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury
Abnormal values in aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alani ne transaminase (ALT) levels 
concurrent with abnormal elevations in total bilirubin level that meet the criteria outlined 
below in the absence of other causes of liver injury are considered potential cases of drug -
induced liver injury  (potential Hy ’s Law c ases) and should alway s be considered important 
medical events.  
The threshold of laboratory  abnormalities for a potential case of drug- induced liver injury  
depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who 
prese nt with the following laboratory  abnormalities should be evaluated further to 
definitively  determine the etiology  of the abnormal laboratory values:

Page 64Subjects with AST or ALT and total bilirubin baseline values within the normal range 
who subsequently  present with AST or AL T 3 times the upper limit of normal (X ULN) 
concurrent with a total bilirubin 2 X UL N with no evidence of hemol ysis and an 
alkaline phosphatase 2X ULN or not available.
For subjects with preexisting AL T OR AST OR total bilirubin valu es above the upper 
limit of normal, the following threshold values should be used in the definition mentioned 
above:
For subjects with pre -existing AST or AL T baseline values above the normal range:
AST or ALT  2times the baseline values and 3 XULN, or 8 XULN (whichever 
is smaller).
Concurrent with
For subjects with pre -existing values of total bilirubin above the normal range: Total 
bilirubin increased b y one time the upper limit of normal or3 times the upper limit 
of normal (whichever is smaller).
The subject should return to the investigational site and be evaluated as soon as possible, 
preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results.  This evaluation should 
include laboratory  tests, detailed history  and phy sical assessment. In addition to repeating 
measurements of AST and ALT, laboratory  tests should include albumin, creatine kinase, 
total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma- glutamy l transferase (GGT), prothrombin 
time (PT)/ international normalized ratio ( INR),  and a lkaline phosphatase.  A detailed 
history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen, 
recreational drug and supplement consumption, family  history , sexual history , travel history , 
history  of contact with a jaundiced person , surgery, blood transfusion, history  of liver or 
allergic disease, and work exposure, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis 
A, B, or C infection and liver imaging (eg ,biliary  tract) may  be warranted. All cases 
confirmed on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory
 criteria defined above , with no other 
cause for LFT abnormalities identified at the time should be considered potential Hy ’s Law 
cases irrespective of availability  of all the results of the investigations performed to 
determine e tiology  of the abnormal L FTs. Such potential Hy ’s Law cases should be reported 
as serious adverse events.
8.6.Hospitalization
Hospitalization is defined as a ny initial admission (even if less than 24 hours) in a hospital or 
equlivalent healthcare facility  
or any prolongation of an existing admission .  Admission also 
includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg , from the psy chiatric 
wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary  care unit, neurological floor to a 
tuberculosis unit).   An emergency  room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; 
however, the event leading to the emergency  room visit should be assessed for medical 
importance.

Page 65Hospitalization does not include the following:
Rehabilitation facilities;
Hospice facilities;
Respite care (eg , caregiver relief);
Skilled nursing facilities;
Nursing homes;
Same day  surgeries (as outpatient/same day /ambulatory  procedures).
Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating, cli nical 
adverse event is not in itself a serious adverse event.  Examples include: 
Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the 
development of a new adverse event or with a worsening of the preexisting condition 
(eg, for work-up of persistent pre -treatment lab abnormality );
Social admission (e g, subject has no place to sleep);
Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical exam);
Protocol -specified admission during a study  (eg, for a procedure required by  the study  
protocol);
Optional admission not associated with a precipit ating clinical adverse event (e g, for 
elective cosmetic surgery);
Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;
Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures .  These should be noted in the baseline 
documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject.
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was
performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an 
acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as 
the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy  should be record ed as treatment of the 
adverse event.

Page 668.7.Severity Assessment
If required on the adverse event case report forms, the investigator will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity  of the adverse event.  
For purposes of consistency , these intensity  grades are defined as follows:
MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function.
MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function.
SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function.
Note the dist inction between the severit y and the seriousness of an adverse event.  A severe 
event is not necessarily  a serious event.  For example, a headache may  be severe (interferes 
significantly  with subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met 
one of the criteria for serious adverse events, listed above.
8.8.Causality Assessment
The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all adverse events (serious 
and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relation ship in the CRF, as 
appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse reporting 
requirements if applicable.  An investigator’s causality  assessment is the determination of 
whether there exists a reasonable possibility  that t he investigational product caused or 
contributed to an adverse event ; generally  the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a 
causal relationship should be provided .  If the investigator does not know whether or not the 
investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to 
investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the Sponsor ( See Section on
Reporting Requirements .  If the investigator's causality  assessment is "unknown but not 
related to investigational product", this should be clearl y documented on study records.  
In addition, if the investigator determines a serious adverse event is associated with study  
procedures, the investigator must record this causal r elationship in the source documents and 
CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse 
event reporting requirements, if applicable.
8.9.Exposure During Pregnancy
For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for markete d products, an exposure during 
pregnancy  (EDP) occurs if:
1.A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been
exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational 
product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/ or 
being exposed to the investigational product;

Page 67An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with 
a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregn ant and has 
been exposed to chemotherapeutic products).
2. A male has been exposed (eg, due to treatment or environmental exposure)  to the 
investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed 
during his partner’s pregnancy  
If a stud y subject or study subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the 
study  subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must submit this 
information to the Pfizer drug safet y unit on an SAE report form and an EDP supplemental 
form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred.  In addition, the investigator must submit 
information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a 
subject reports that she is pregnant and has been expose d to a cy totoxic product by  inhalation 
or spillage) using the EDP supplemental form .  This must be done irrespective of whether an 
AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure.   The information 
submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery  (see below for information related 
to termination of pregnancy ).
Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy  and its outcome for 
all EDP reports with an unknown outcome.  The investigator will follow the pregnancy until 
completion or until pregnancy  termination) and notify  Pfizer of the outcome as a follow up to 
the initial EDP supplemental form .  In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity  of the 
neonate can be assessed at the time of birth.  In the even t of a termination, the reason(s) for 
termination should be specified and, if clinicall y possible, the structural integrity  of the 
terminated fetus should be assessed b y gross visual inspection (unless pre -procedure test 
findings are conclusive for a conge nital anomal y and the findings are reported).
If the outcome of the pregnancy  meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , 
spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fet aldemise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a 
live born baby, a terminated fe tus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the 
investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs.
Additional information about pregnancy  outcomes that are reported as SAEs follows: 
Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and mi ssed abortion;
Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality , as SAEs.  In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as 
serious adverse events when  the investigator assesses the infant death as related or 
possibly  related to exposure to the investigational product 
Additional information regarding the exposure during pregnancy  may  be requested by  the 
investigator.  Further follow -
up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis
(eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify  developmental delay s).  In the case of paternal 
exposure, the investigator will provide the study  subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of 
Information Form to deliver to his partner.  The Investigator must document in the source

provide to his partner.
8.10. Occupational Exposure
An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person 
(whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the 
product, which may  or may  not lead to the occurrence of an AE .
An occupational exposure is reported to the drug safet y unit within 24 hours of the 
investigator’s awareness, using the SAE report form, regardless of whether there is an 
associated AE/SAE.  Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , 
the information is not reported on a CRF; however, a copy  of the completed SAE report form 
is maintained in the investigator site file.
8.11. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events (See Also Section on Subject Withdrawal )
Withdrawal due to adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient 
response, accord ing to the definition of adverse event noted earlier, and recorded on the 
appropriate adverse event CRF page.  
When a subject withdraws due to a serious adverse event, the serious adverse event must be 
reported in accordance with the reporting requirement s defined below.
8.12. Eliciting Adverse Event Information
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events 
spontaneously  reported by  the study  subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable 
representative .  In addit ion, each stud y subject /parent(s)/legal guardian/legally  acceptable 
representative will be questioned about adverse events.
8.13. Reporting Requirements
Each adverse event is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for serious adverse 
events.  If a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and 
international regulations, as appropriate.
8.13.1.
Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
If a serious adverse event occurs, Pfizer is to be notified within 24 hours of investigator 
awar eness of the event.  In particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal or life -threatening, 
notification to Pfizer must be made immediatel y, irrespective of the extent of available 
adverse event information.  This timeframe also applies to additional ne w information 
(follow -up) on previously  forwarded serious adverse event reports as well as to the initial and 
follow -up reporting of exposure during pregnancy ,exposure viabreastfeeding , and 
occupational exposure cases.

Page 69In the rare event that the invest igator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious 
adverse event immediately  (eg, if an outpatient study  subject initially  seeks treatment 
elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and 
document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse event.
For all serious adverse events, the investigator is obligated to pursue and provide information 
to Pfizer in accordance with the timeframes for reporting specified above.  In addition, an 
investigator may be requested by  Pfizer to obtain specific additional follow -up information in 
an expedited fashion.  Th einformation collected for serious adverse events is more detailed 
than that captured on the adverse event case report form.  In general, this will inc lude a 
description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical 
assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality.  I nformation on 
other possible causes of the event, such as concomitant medications , vaccines, and/or
illnesses must be provided.  I n the case of a subject death, a summary  of available autops y 
findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer or its designated representative. 
8.13.2. Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
All adve rse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF.  I t should be 
noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the 
adverse event CRF.  Where the same data are collected, the forms must be compl eted in a 
consistent manner.  For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms.  
Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology on the CRFs as well as 
on the form for collection of serious adverse event information .
8.13.3. Sponsor ’sReporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities
Adverse events reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations.
9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS
Detailed methodology  for summary  and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in a Statistical Analy sis Plan, which will be dated and maintained by  the 
sponsor. This document may  modify  the plans outlined in the protocol; howeve r, any  major 
modifications of the primary  endpoint definition and/or its analy sis will also be reflected in a 
protocol amendment.
9.1.Analysis of Primary Endpoint
The primary  anal ysis will be the evaluation of adverse events throughout the trial, laboratory  
tests, and physical examination.  
The set of subjects for this evaluation will be the Safety population, defined as all subjects 
with at least 1 dose of study medication. 
The following parameters will be summarized: rates of discontinuation, adverse events , ECG 
findings (if applicable) , and laboratory  abnormalities.

Page 70The Sponsor has standard algorithms for reporting adverse events and clinical laboratory test 
results, and these will be employ ed in the anal ysis of the data from this trial. Safety  data will 
be subject to clinical review and summarized b y appropriate descriptive statistics. 
Descriptive statistics for categorical data will include frequencies and/or percentages.
9.2.Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
The efficacy anal ysis will be an assessment of glob al response at EOIVT, EOT , 2week and 
6 week FU visits. Global response will be derived from the investigator’s assessment of 
clinical and microbiological response as defined in Section 7.4. Theanalysis will be 
conducted b y frequencies and percentages of global response b y determination (success, 
failure).  These efficacy  anal yses will be assessed in the Modified I ntent- to-Treat (MITT) 
population, which will be defined as all subjects who have received at least one dose of study  
drug and who have microbiological confirmation of Candida infection.  
Rates of relapse (recurrence) and new infection at FU visits will also be derived from the 
investigator’s assessment of clinical a nd microbiologic response as defined in 
Section 7.4,
and anal yzed.  Time to death will be anal yzed and all- cause mortality  rates determined.
9.3.Pharmacokinetic Analyses
9.3.1. Non-compartmental Pharmaco
kinetic Analysis
Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be performed on individual plasma 
anidulafungin concentration -time data from children <2 years to obtain the following 
pharmacokinetic parameters of anidulafungin: AUC 24and C max.  Data listi ngs and summary  
statistics will be generated for each pharmacokinetic parameter and presented in graphical 
and/or tabular format.  
9.3.2. Population Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic (PK- PD) Analysis
Measures of efficacy  or safet y versus stead y-state anidulafungin exposure (AUC 24) will be 
modeled using a nonlinear mixed effects approach as appropriate.
Firstly , population pharmacokinetic analy sis on the plasma concentration data of 
anidulafungin will be performed to derive the conditional estimation of individual A UC 24.  
Population PK -PD models will be developed using an iterative process, adapting the model 
to improve the goodness of fit.  I n the case that only  one record on the PD data (efficacy  or 
safet y endpoints) will be obtained from each subject , a Naïve Pooled D ata (NPD) anal ysis 
will be considered for PK -PD anal ysis.  In the case that multiple measurements are available, 
the time to event anal ysis may  be explored as appropriate.
If a sufficient number of MI C values are available, the association between the PK-PD index,

Page 719.4.Sample Size Determination
Since this is a descriptive study , sample size calculations were not performed.  A sample size 
of 60 evaluable subject s for this study  was chosen based on the number of subject s estimate d 
to be necessary  to provide adequate information for assessing efficacy , safety  and tolerability  
in children with ICC.  Evaluable subjects are those that have received at least one dose of 
study  medication and have a confirmed Candida infection.
9.5.Safety An alysis
All subject s who have received at least 1 dose of study  medication will be included in the 
safet y analyses.  Adverse events and other safet y data, including ECG 
(if applicable) and
laboratory  data will be reviewed and summarized on an ongoing basis during the study .  The 
Sponsor has standard algorithms for reporting adverse events and clinical laboratory  test 
results, and these will be employ ed in the anal ysis of the data from this study .  Safety  and 
tolerability  data will be presented in tabular and /or graphical format and summarized 
descriptivel y, where appropriate.  
9.6.
Interim Analysis 
Subjects will be stratified by age (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 y ears), 
allowing 20 ± 2 subjects in each stratum. Aninterim analy sis to assess safe ty, PK and 
efficacy  will be conducted when approximatel y 20 ± 2 subjects for age cohorts 2 to <5 years
and 5 to < 18 years have completed the study. 
9.7.Data Monitoring Committee
This study  will use an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (I DMC).
The IDMC w ill be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the efficacy  and safet y of subjects 
in the study  according to the Charter.  An y recommendations made b y the IDMC to alter the 
conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision.  Pfizer will for ward such 
decisions, which may  include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of 
safet y data which are not endpoints, to regulatory  authorities, as appropriate.  In this instance, 
such disease -related efficacy  endpoints are not reported ind ividually  as SAEs. 
10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
During study  conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol and GCPs are being followed.  The monitors may  review source documents 
to confirm that t he data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will 
allow Pfizer monitors or its agents and appropriate regulatory  authorities direct access to 
source documents to perform this verification.   This verification may  also occur after study  
completion.
During study  conduct and/or after study  completion, the study  site m ay be subject to review 
by the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics C ommittee (I EC), and/or to 
quality  assurance audits performed b y Pfizer, or companies w orking with or on behalf of 
Pfizer, and/or to inspection by  appropriate regulatory  authorities.

Page 72The investigator(s) will notify  Pfizer or its agents immediately  of any  regulatory  inspection 
notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigat or will cooperate with Pfizer 
or its agents to prepare the study  site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, 
whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator will promptly  
provide copies of the inspection findings t o Pfizer or its agent.  Before response submission 
to the regulatory  authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an 
opportunity  to review and comment on responses to any  such findings.
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.
11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING
11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record
As used in this protocol, the term C ase Report F orm (CRF) should be understood to refer to 
either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection 
method used in this study .
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject.  The c ompleted 
original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory  
authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.
The investi gator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all clinical, 
safet y, laboratory  data entered on the CRFs and any  other data collection forms (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, 
consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required .The 
CRFs must be signed by  the investigator or by  an authorized staff member to attest that the 
data contained on the CRFs is true. Any corrections to entries ma de in the CRFs, source 
documents must be dated, initialed and explained (if necessary ) and should not obscure the 
original entry . 
In most cases, the source documents are the hospital's or the ph ysician's subject chart.  In 
these cases data collected on th e CRFs must match the data in those charts. 
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may  also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Pfizer and clearl y 
identify  those data tha t will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document.
11.2. Record Retention
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory  authorities or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity  of all parti cipating subjects (sufficient
information to link records, e g, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed 
consent forms, copies of all CRFs, serious adverse event forms, source documents, and

Page 73detailed records of treatment disposition, and ade quate documentation of relevant 
correspondence ( eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be 
retained b y the investigator according to I CH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study  Agreement, whichever is l onger.
If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period ( eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified.  The 
study  records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to P fizer, such as another 
investigator, another institution, or to an independent third part y arranged by Pfizer.  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 y ears after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by  applicable local regulations.
The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
12.ETHICS
12.1. Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)
It is the respons ibility  of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, eg, 
recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC.  All correspondence with the 
IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File.  Copies of IRB/I EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.
The only  circumstance in which an amendment may  be initiated prior to IRB/I EC approval is 
where the change is necessary  to eliminate apparent immediat e hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify  the IRB/IEC and Pfizer in writing immediately  after 
the implementation.
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with legal and regulatory  requirements, a s well as 
the general principles set forth in the I nternational E thical Guidelines for Biomedical 
Research Involving Human S ubjects (Counsel for International Organization of Medical 
Science 2002), Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (International Confe rence on 
Harmonization 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 & 
2008).
In addition, the study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the I nternational 
Conference on Harmonisation guideline on Good Clinical Practi ce, and applicable local 
regulatory  requirements and laws.
12.3. Subject Information and Consent
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any  sponsor forms, reports, publications, or in any  other disclosur es, except where 
required b y law. When study  data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized 
parties, s ubject name s, addresses , and other identifiable data will be replaced by  a numerical

subject.  The study  site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the 
study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity .  In case of data 
transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality  and protection of subject s’
personal data consistent with applicable privacy  laws .
The informed consent /assent document smust be in compliance with ICH GCP, local 
regulatory  requirements, and legal requirements.
The infor med consent /assent document sused during the informed consent process , and any  
changes made during the course of the stud y, must be prospectivel y approved by  both the 
IRB/IEC and Pfizer before use , and available for inspection .
The investigator must ensur e that each study  subject, and/or his/her legal representative or 
parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor , is fully  informed about the nature and objectives of the 
study  and possible risks associated with participation.  
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally  acceptable representative/parent(s) or 
legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently  be obtained 
when the subject has the capacity  to provide assent, as determined by  the IRB/EC.  If the 
investigator dete rmines that a subject’s decisional capacity  is so limited he/she cannot 
reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted b y the IRB/EC and consistent with local 
regulatory  and legal requirements, the subject’s assent may  be waived with source 
documentation of t he reason assent was not obtained.  If the study  subject does not provide 
hisorher own consent, the source documents must record wh y the subject did not provide 
consent (eg, minor, decisionally  impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the 
person signing the consent was the subject’s legally  acceptable representative, the consent 
signer’s relationship to the study  subject (eg, parent, spouse) ,and that the subject’s assent 
was obtained, or waived.  If assent is obtained verbally  it must be doc umented in the source 
documents.
If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as 
recognized under local law, they  must re -consent as adults to remain in the study .  If the 
enrollment of ‘emancipated minors’ is permit ted by the stud y age criteria, the I RB/EC, and 
local law, they  must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the 
permission of a parent or legal guardian.
The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain writte n informed 
consent from each subject or the subject 's legal lyacceptable representative , parent(s) or legal 
guardian and assent from each subject (if applicable) before an y stud y-specific activity  is 
performed.   The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent
document .

Change From
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin clas s of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis) in adults .  To date, there are no clinical studies evaluating anidulafungin in 
paediatric patients with invasive Candida infection.  This study will assess the 
pharmacokinetics, safet y and efficacy  of anidulafungin in patients 1 month to <18 y ears of 
age with ICC.  Exposure -response relationships of anidulafungin will also be assessed in a 
population pharmacokinetic -pharmacod ynamic (PK -PD) anal ysis.

All subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day 1, subject is 
to receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).   Subject is then to receive 
a daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day 2 onwards .  
Subjects will be stratified by age (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 y ears).  
Subjects may  be sw itched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after 
at least 10 day s of IV treatment, provided that the pre -specified criteria are met.
All subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessm ent of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine pregnancy  test (for females of 
childbearing potential), chest X -ray, fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated) , and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated on Day s 3 and 7 and every  third day  
thereafter until two cultures separated b y at least 24 hours are confirmed to be negative .  Any 
negative blood culture after Day 1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) must be 
repeated after 24 hours.
Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphotericin B) wil l be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subjects in this 
cohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel .  Data from these 6 subjects will not be 
utilize d for secondary efficacy endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safet y.  The 
exposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing 
regimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing 
regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 y ears of age will be permitted to be 
enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second s ystemic antifungal agent 
(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. 
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 4 5sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected. 
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  The main efficacy assessment will be determined at EOTEOIVT.  Rates of relapse 
and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through 
assessment of adverse events and monitoring of clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and 
serum chemistry ), temperature, and ph ysical examination results.  All subjects will be 
followed for safet y through the 6 -week FU visit.

assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine pregnancy  test (for femal es of 
childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen culture or 
histopathology  of other normally  sterile sites (as clinically  indicated), and safet y laboratory 
testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated on Day s 3 and 7 and every  third day  thereafter until 
two cultures separated b y at least 24 hours are confirmed to be negative.  Any  negative blood 
culture after Day  1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) must be repeated after 24 hours.
Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assess ed in the first 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subjects in this 
cohort will be between 1 a nd <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel.  Data from these 6 subjects will not be 
utilized for secondary  efficacy  endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safet y.  The 
exposure da ta from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing 
regimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing 
regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 y ears of age will be permitted to be
enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a second s ystemic antifungal agent 
(eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted. 
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected. 
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of s uccess or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2- week FU and 6-
week 
FU visits.  Rates of relapse and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU visits.  Safety  will 
be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of clinical laboratory  tests 
(hemat ology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical examination results.  All 
subjects will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.

references added, 3rd paragraph
Change From
The incidence of s ystemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantl y in the past 
decade.  Infections due to Candida spp. account for about 80% of all sy stemic fungal 
infections and are the fourth leading c ause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
United States.1  The impact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is 
large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing 
numbers of at -risk s ubjects due to advances in transplantation technology  and oncology  
treatment, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration of broad -spectrum antibiotics.  
In the United States, mortality  rates i n children with candidemia approach 30%, depending 
on the specific subject population and clinical setting .2, 3  Current approved treatments for 
infections due to Candida spp. include poly enes, azoles and echinocandin antifungal agents.  
Of these, amphoter icin B and fluconazole are the most commonly  utilized in the paediatric 
population.  Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been 
extrapolated from adult studies.  
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of a ntifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  against Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the 
treatment of candidemia and other forms of Candida 
infections (intra -abdominal abscess and 
peritonitis) in adults.  In Canada and Europe, anidulafungin carries a similar indication

invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC )ICC.  The planned enrollment is 60 
subjects over 16 months at approximatel y 20-40 sites.  
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a 
confirmed diagnosi s of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture

mycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in 
culture and/or the direct microsc opic visualization of  yeast, hyphae or pseudohyphae 
from a sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to 
enrolment).  In the latter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained 
within 96 hours post treatment initiation.  If culture confirmation is not obtained within 
this time period, subjects will be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in 
the study for continued safety monitoring.  These subjects will be required to return for 
the 2 -week and 6 -week follo w-up visits.
All subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day  1, subject is to 
receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a 
daily  maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg ) from Day  2 onwards.  Subjects 
will be stratified by  age (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  Subjects may  
be switched to oral fluconazole (6- 12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 10 
days of IV treatment, provided that the pr e-specified criteria are met.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospital; subjects 
will be permitted to complete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate

anidulafungin followed by  oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 day s from the 
time of the last of negative culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative 
cultures, separated by at lea st 24 hours, following the last positive culture ) and 
improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will 
be considered the End of Treatment (EOT). Total treatment duration with anidulafungin is 
not to exceed 35 day s.  Subjects will be followed in the study  for a total of 6 weeks after 
EOT.  
All subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical examination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated), and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated every three da ys (i.e., on Day s 3 and 7) 
and every  third day  thereafter until two cultures separated b y at least 24 hours are confirmed 
to be negative.  An ynegative blood culture after Day  1 (per protocol schedule or otherwise) 
must be repeated after 24 hours. 
Anidula fungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subje cts in this 
cohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age, which will be enrolled in parallel.  Data from these 6 subjects will not be 
utilized for secondary  efficacy  endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safet y.  The 
exposure data from these subjects will be used to confirm if the recommended dosing 
regimen is appropriate for subjects aged <2 years.  After the PK data is evaluated and dosing 
regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to < 2 years of age will be permitted to be

A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects en rolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.  
Efficacy  will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clin ical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU 
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse event s and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those su bjects who have received at 
least one dose of anidulafungin and have confirmed Candida infection).
We plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from 
0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are a vailable for this patient

This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study  will assess the safet y and efficacy  of 
anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and <18 years with 
invasive candidiasis, includ ing candidemia (ICC).  
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a confirmed 
diagnosis of I CC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture obtained from a 
normally  sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollme nt), or my cological evidence highl y 
suggestive of Candida sp. (e.g., the growth of yeast in culture and/or the direct microscopic 
visualization of  y east, hy phae or pseudohy phae from a sample obtained from a normally  
sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  In the latter case, culture confirmation of 
Candida sp. must be obtained within 96 hours post treatment initiation.  I f culture 
confirmation is not obtained within this time period, subjects will be discontinued from study  
treatment but will re main in the study  for continued safet y monitoring.  These subjects will 
be required to return for the 2- week and 6- week follow -up visits.
All subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  On Day  1, subject is to 
receive a loading dose of 3.0 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg).  Subject is then to receive a 
daily  maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) from Day  2 onwards.  Subjects 
will be stratified by  age (1 month -<2 years, 2 - <5 years, and 5 -<18 years).  Subjects may  
be switched to oral fluconazole (6- 12 mg/kg/day , maximum 800 mg/day ) after at least 
10days of IV treatment, provided that the pre -specified criteria are met.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospital; subjects 
will b e permitted to complete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate

Theincidence of s ystemic invasive fungal infections has risen significantl y in the past

infections and are the fourth leading cause of all nosocomial bloodstream infections in the 
United States.1  The impact of fungal infections on health care and economic expenditures is 
large and of growing concern.  Increases in infection rates are a consequence of growing 
numbers of at -risk patients due to advances in transplantation tech
nology  and oncology  
treatment, spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), use of vascular catheters, 
and extensive administration of broad -spectrum antibiotics.  
In the United States, mortality  rates in children with candidemia approach 30%, depend ing 
on the specific patient population and clinical setting.2, 3  Current approved treatments for 
infections due to Candida spp. include poly enes, azoles and echinocandin antifungal agents.  
Of these, amphotericin B and fluconazole are the most commonly  utilized in the paediatric 
population.  Guidelines for use of these agents in the paediatric population have often been 
extrapolated from adult studies. 
Anidulafungin is a member of the echinocandin class of antifungals and exhibits fungicidal 
activity  agai nst Candida species.  In the United States, anidulafungin is approved for the

This prospective, open -label, non -comparative study  will assess the pharmacokinetics, safet y 
and efficacy  of anidulafungin when used to treat children between the ages of 1 month and 
<18years w ith invasive candidiasis, including candidemia (ICC).   The planned enrollment is 
60subjects over 16 months at approximatel y 20-40 sites.  
To participate in this study, at the time of enrolment subjects must have either a 
confirmed diagnosis of ICC (based on the growth of Candida sp. from a culture 
obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrollment), or 
mycological evidence highly suggestive of Candida sp. (eg, the growth of yeast in culture

sample obtained from a normally sterile site within 96 hours prior to enrolment).  In the 
latter case, culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained within 96 hours post 
treatment initiation.  If culture con firmation is not obtained within this time period, 
subjects will be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in the study for 
continued safety monitoring.  These subjects will be required to return for the 2 -week 
and 6 -week follow -up visits.
All subjects meeting screening criteria will receive IV anidulafungin.  Enrollment will be 
stratified by  age (1 month -<2 years, 2 -<5 years, and 5 - <18 years), allowing 20 + 2 in 
each stratum.  Subjects may  be switched to oral fluconazole (6 -12 mg/kg/day , maximum 
800mg/day ) after at least 10 days of IV anidulafungin treatment, provided that all of the 
following criteria are met:
The subject is afebrile for at least 24 hours;
The subject is able to tolerate oral medication;
Documentation of two blood culture s negative for Candida spp separated by  at least 
24hours;
Documentation of a negative culture for Candida spp from an y other sites of infection 
identified at enrollment;
The specific Candida isolate identified at study entry is susceptible to fluconazole;
Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator 
feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospital; subjects 
will be permitted to co mplete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate 
by the investigator.
All subjects will receive treatment (either solel y IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed 
by oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last of negative 
culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 
24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and 
symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will be considered the EOT.  Total 
treatment duration with anidulafungin is not to exceed 35 day s.  Subjects will be followed in 
the study  for a total of 6 weeks after EOT.  
All subjects will have the following assessments at the screening visit: phy sical exa mination, 
assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, urine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinical ly indicated), and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated every three days (ie, on Day s 3 and 7)
and every  third day  thereafter until two cultures separated b y at least 24 hours are confirmed

Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at se lected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphotericin B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subjects in this 
cohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age. Data from these 6 subjects will not be utilized for secondary  efficacy  
endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safety .  The exposure data from these subjects will 
be used to confirm if the recommended dosing regimen is appropriate for subjects aged 
<2years.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2 years of 
age will be permitted to be enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a 
second s ystemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted.
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects enrolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.
Efficacy will be based on a determination of global response (combination of clinical and 
microbiological response) of success or failure at the EOIVT, EOT, 2 -week FU and 6-week 
FU visits.  Rates of relapse (recurrence) and/or new infection will be assessed at the FU 
visits.  Safety  will be evaluated through assessment of adverse events and monitoring of 
clinical laboratory  tests (hematology  and serum chemistry ), temperature, and phy sical 
examination results.  All subjects will be followed for safety  through the 6-week FU visit.  
The planned enrolment is 60 evaluable subjects (those subjects who have received at 
least one dose and confirmed Candida infection).
We plan to amend this protocol at a future time to allow for the enrollment of neonates (from 
0 to 1 month of age) when additional pharmacokinetic data are available for this patient 
population.

Any medication that the subject takes other than the study  drug specified in the protocol is 
considered concomitant medication.  Information about concomitant medications will be 
recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF) from the screening visit through the EOT.  In 
addition, any  antifungal treatments used between EOT and 6 -week FU visit will be 
documented.
At the 2 -week and 6 -week FU Visits, only antifungal therapy the subject receives and 
the indication for use (eg, prophylaxis, treatment) will be recorded in the CRF.  The use 
of non -absorbable antifungal drugs (eg, clotrimazole troches) is not required to be 
reported.
The recording of concomitant medications other than antifungal agents at these time 
points is not required unless the subject experiences an adverse event during the 
follow -up period, in which case all concomitant medications that the subject was 
receiving at the time of the adverse event must be recorded.

SUMMARY
Reason(s) for Amendment
The primary  reasons for creation of this protocol amendment are as follows :
To remove the exclusion criteria and allow for the enrollment of subjects with 
Candida endocarditis on the basis of at least one postive blood culture for Candida sp. 
and evidence of endocarditis on echocardiogram;
To remove the exclusion criteria and allow for the enrollment of subejcts with 
Candida osteomy elitis on the basis of at least one positive culture for Candida sp. 
from a bone biops y or aspirate and evidence of osteomy elitis on a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI ) study ;
The Sponsor has also taken the opportunity  to make additions, changes, and clarifications to
the protocol, as appropriate. Following is a summary  of additional clarifications/ 
modifications made:
Clarified that subjects in the pharmacokinetics subgroup (ie, the first 6 subjects 
between 1 month and <2 y ears of age enrolled at selected centers) may  be given 
anidulafugin as either monotherapy or in combination with a second antifungal 
therap y, at the investigator’s discretion.  In the event the investigator choses to treat 
with combin ation therapy , then, following completion of PK sampling, these subjects 
will be discontined from study  treatment but will continue to be followed for safet y 
assessments and are required to return for the 2- and 6 -week follow -up visit.

Modified oral fluconazole switch criteria:  In addition to other criteria currently  listed 
in the protocol, allow sw itch to occur if microbiologic eradication is presumed based 
on clinical signs and sy mptoms, and if susceptibility  to fluconazole is presumed based 
on the Candida species identified and based on local Candida sp. resistance patter ns;  
Clarified that subje cts may  now have at least one clinical criteria present either at the 
time of study  entry  or within 96 hours prior to study  entry .

The maxi mum total treatment duration in this study is 49 days, and the maximum 
allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 days.  After at least 10 days of 
treatment with anidulafungin, subjects may be switched to oral fluconazole (provided 
switch criteria are met) to complete treatment.
In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require 
continued treatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this 
treatment will be considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will 
not be supplied by the Sponsor.  For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 
(for subjects who require continued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required 
continued oral therapy) will be considered the last day o f study drug treatment.  These 
subjects are also required to return for the 2 -week and 6 -week follow -up visit following 
the last dose of study drug.
Total treatment duration with anidulafungin is not to exceed 35 days.  Subjects will be 
followed in the stu dy for a total of 6 weeks after EOT.
At selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the 
first 6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the 
recommended dosing regimen contained within the pr otocol for this age group is 
appropriate.  These subjects may be administered anidulafugin in one of two ways: 
either as monotherapy or in combination with a second systemic antifungal agent (e.g., 
amphotericin B).  
In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin as monotherapy for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, treatment will be administered for a 
minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the 
second of two consecutive negative cu ltures, separated by at least 24 hours, following 
the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia 
or invasive candidiasis.  
In the event the investigator chooses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a 
second antifungal agent, anidulafugin will be discontinued following the obtainment of 
required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis as specified by the protocol; the 
data from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
but will be assessed for safety.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by the Sponsor, 
enrollment will be opened to additional subjects within this age group at all investigator 
sites.  Subsequent to this time point, the use of a second systemic antifunga l agent (e.g., 
amphotericin B) will not be permitted in any subject.

3. Subjects undergoing treat ment in the outpatient setting may have less frequent assessments, but not less than once every 7 days.  Close monitoring of 
subjects in the outpatient setting is required.
4. A urine or serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening (prior to treatment initiation), at the end of therapy or at t he end of IV therapy, whichever is later, 
and at the 6-week follow -up visit.  Additional testing may also be performed as per request of the IRB/EC or as required by local regulations.
5. Fundoscopic exams should be performed with pupils dilated if possible.  In addition, when required by the protocol, the exam should be performed by an 
ophthalmologist unless it is not possible for practical reasons, in which case in may be performed by the principle investigator or subinvestigator.  a 
non-ophthalmologist.
6. If it is not possible to perform a baseline fundo scopic examination prior to the first dose of study drug, it may be performed up to 48 hours after the first dose.  of 
study drug Under extenuating circumstances, if the fundoscopic examination cannot be performed prior to first dose or within 48 hours, ev ery effort should

with Candida endophthal mitis, then a repeat fundoscopic examination is required a t the end of treatment and at the 2- and 6 -week follow -up visits.  
Additional fundoscopic assessments, other than those required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicat ed and according to local 
practice standards.  In the event addi tional fundoscopic exam inations are performed, the results should be recorded on the case report form.

8. Blood cultures will be obtained on Day 1 at screening and every three (3) days thereafter (ie, on Day 3 and 7) until two (2) consecutive cultures, separated by at 
least 24 hours, are confirmed to be negative while on study medication.  Pathogen isolated will be documented.
9. The ‘screening visit culture’ is the culture result that qualifies the subject for study entry (along with other inclusion criteria) and is from a blood or 
tissue sample that was obtained within 96 hours prior to the screening visit, that is positive for Candida sp.  The result of this culture will be reco rded on the 
‘screening visit” case report form.  In the event the culture result from this sample is pending, plan to record the culture result on the screening visit case 
report form once the organism has been identified and the information is available. Please note, if the day of the screening visit is also Day 1 of treatment, a 
sample of blood for culture will be obtained; otherwise a sample of blood for culture is not required until the first day of treatment (Day 1), just prior to 
administration of st udy drug. Screening blood culture is to be obtained within 96 hours before the first dose of Study Drug (Day 1).  For the screening blo od 
culture, it is preferable for two (2) aerobic blood cultures to be obtained from two (2) separate sites, however, if th is is not practical for clinical reasons, the required 
screening blood cultures may be collected according to local practice standards and as the clinical circumstances dictate.
10. For subjects who are prematurely discontinued from treatment for any reaso n, a blood sample for culture should be obtained only if it is clinically indicated.
11. Cultures of other sterile sites as clinically indicated.  Pathogen isolated will be documented.
12. CBC with differential (including RBC count , reticulocytes, white bl ood cells, neutrophils, lymphoctyes, monocytes, basophils, and platelets count), and serum 
chemistry tests (AST, ALT, Alk-Phos, total Bilirubin, Albumin, BUN or Urea , Cr, Bicarbonate, Glucose, Na, K, Ca, Cl, Mg) are to be repeated on Day 3, 7 and 
every sev en days during treatment phase, and repeated at both follow-up visits.
13. Hematology and chemistry tests should be repeated at both follow -up visits.
14. An echocardiogram at the time of screening is not required if the test was already performed within t he previous 96 hours (of the screening visit).  The 
results of the echocardiogram, however, must be recorded in the case report form.
15. For subjects with Candida endocarditis, either a transesophogeal (prefered) or transthoracic echocardiogram must be pe rformed at the end of study 
treat ment (ie, at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treatment with oral fluconazole in subjects wh o are sw itched to oral therapy).  
Additional echocardiogram assessments, other than those required by t he protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicated and according to local practice 
standards.  In the event additional echocardiogram assessments are performed, the results should be recorded on the case repo rt form.
16. A magnetic resonance ima ging (MRI) study at the time of screening is not required if the test was already performed within the previous 96 hours (of 
the screening visit).  The results of the MRI, however, must be recorded in the case report form.
17. For subjects with Candida ost eomyelitis, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the affected area must be performed at the end of study 
treat ment (i.e., at the end of treatment with IV anidulafungin, or at the end of treat ment with oral fluconazole in subjects wh o are sw itched to oral therapy). 
Additional MRI studies, other than those required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicated and accor ding to local practice standards.  In the 
event additional MRI studies are performed, the results should be recorde d on the case report form.

2 minutes before the end of infusion; on Day 2 (receiving 1.5 mg/kg IV infusion): just prior to the start of the infusion, 2 mi nutes before the end of infusion, and 6, 12 
and 24 hours after the start of infusion.  Exact sampling times may be modifi ed to accommodate subject schedules provided the actual time of collection is 
documented in the Case Report Form (CRF).
19. For the first 6 subjects aged 1 month to <2 years, use of a second systemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will be per mitted (these subjects will be enrolled 
at selected centers).
20. Samples (0.3 – 0.5 mL) will be collected for anidulafungin measurement at 3-5 of the following occasions during the study: Day 1: Post- dose (between 0 -2hours 
following the end of anidulafungin inf usion); Day 3: Pre -dose (just prior to the start of anidulafungin infusion); Day 5: Post -dose (between 0 -3 hours following the 
end of anidulafungin infusion); Day 7: Delayed post-dose (between 6 -12 hours following the end of anidulafungin infusion); Day 9: Pre-dose (just prior to the start of

period.
21. Only antifungal medications the subject has recei ved within the past 30 days prior to enrolment are required to be recorded.
22. Only antifungal medications and their indication for use (eg, for prophylaxis or treatment) are required to be reported durin g the follow -up period unless the 
subject experienc es an adverse effect during this time, in which case all concomitant medications the subject was receiving at the time of the adverse event must be

3. Subjects undergoing treatment in the outpatient setting may have less frequent assessments, but not less than once every 7 da ys.  Close monitoring of subjects in 
the outpatient setting is required.
4. A urine or serum preg nancy test will be performed at screening (prior to treatment initiation), at the end of therapy or at the end of IV therapy, whichever is later, 
and at the 6 -week follow -up visit.  Additional testing may also be performed as per request of the IRB/EC or a s required by local regulations.
5. Fundoscopic exams should be performed with pupils dilated if possible.  In addition, when required by the protocol, the exam should be performed by an 
ophthalmologist unless it is not possible for practical reasons, in w hich case in may be performed by the principle investigator or subinvestigator.  
6. If it is not possible to perform a baseline fundoscopic examination prior to the first dose of study drug, it may be performe d up to 48 hours after the first dose.  
Under extenuating circumstances, if the fundoscopic examination cannot be performed prior to first dose or within 48 hours, every e ffort should be made to perform 
the examination as soon as possible thereafter.  Please note, if the baseline fundoscopic examinati on is positive for findings consistent with Candida 
endophthalmitis, then a repeat fundoscopic examination is required at the end of treatment and at the 2 -and 6 -week follow -up visits.  Additional fundoscopic 
assessments, other than those required by the protocol, should also be performed as clinically indicated and according to local practice standards.  In the event 
additional fundoscopic examinations are performed, the results should be recorded on the case report form .

The specific Candida isolate identified at study  entry  is susceptible (or presumed to 
be susceptible based on the species identified and local Candida sp. resistance 
patterns) to flucona zole; 
Signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection have improved such that the Investigator 
feels it is appropriate to switch to oral fluconazole.
It is expected that the majority  of subjects will receive study  drug in the hospital; subjects 
will be permitted to complete study  medication on an outpatient basis if deemed appropriate 
by the investigator.
All subjects will receive treatment (either solel y IV anidulafungin, or anidulafungin followed 
by oral fluconazole) for a minimum duration of 14 days from the ti me of the last of negative 
culture (defined as the second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by  at least 
24 hours, following the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and 
symptoms of candidemia or invasive candidiasis.  This will be considered the EOT.  
The maximum total treatment duration in this study is 49 days, and the maximum 
allowed treatment duration with anidulafungin is 35 days.  After at least 10 days of 
treatment with anidulafungin, subjects may be switched to ora l fluconazole (provided 
switch criteria are met) to complete treatment.
In subjects with Candida endocarditis and Candida osteomyelitis who require continued 
treatment beyond the maximum total treatment duration (49 days), this treatment will 
be considered outside the context of this clinical trial and study drug will not be 
supplied by the Sponsor.  For the purpose of study treatment evaluation, Day 35 (for 
subjects who require continued IV treatment) or Day 49 (for subjects who required 
continued oral the rapy) will be considered the last day of study drug treatment.   These 
subjects are also required to return for the 2 -week and 6 -week follow -up visit following 
the last dose of study drug.
Total treatment duration with anidulafungin is not to exceed 35 day s.  All Ssubjects enrolled 
in the study who receive at least one dose of study drug treatment, including those 
subjects who are discontinued from treatment (regardless of the reason), will be 
followed in the study for a total of 6 weeks after EOT (ie, the last dose of study drug

assessment of signs and sy mptoms of Candida infection, u rine or serum pregnancy  test (for 
females of childbearing potential), fundoscopic examination, blood cultures, specimen 
culture or histopathology of other normall y sterile sites (as clinicall y indicated), and safet y 
laboratory  testing.  Blood cultures will be repeated every  three day s (ie, on Day s 3 and 7) 
until two cultures separated by at least 24 hours are confirmed to be negative.  If blood 
cultures are performed more frequentl y than required b y the protocol; a second blood culture 
after 24 hours of an ynegative culture is required. 
At selected investigator sites, anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the 
first 6 subjects between 1 month to <2 years of age to confirm whether or not the 
recommended dosing regimen contained within the protoco l for this age group is 
appropriate.  These subjects may be administered anidulafugin in one of two ways: 
either as monotherapy or in combination with a second systemic antifungal agent (eg, 
amphotericin B).  
If the investigator chooses to administer anid ulafungin as monotherapy for the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis/candidemia, then treatment will be administered for a 
minimum duration of 14 days from the time of the last negative culture (defined as the 
second of two consecutive negative cultures, separated by at least 24 hours, following 
the last positive culture) and improvement of clinical signs and symptom of candidemia 
or invasive candidiasis.  
In the event the investigator choses to administer anidulafungin in combination with a 
second antifunga l agent, anidulafugin will be discontinued following the obtainment of 
required blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis as specified by the protocol; the 
data from these subjects will not be utilized for secondary efficacy endpoint analyses 
but will be assessed for safety.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed by the Sponsor, 
enrollment will be opened to additional subjects within this age group at all investigator 
sites.  Subsequent to this time point, the use of a second systemic antifungal agent (eg,
amphotericin B) will not be permitted in any subject.
Anidulafungin pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the first 6 subjects aged between 
1month to <2 y ears, to be enrolled at selected centers.  Use of a second s ystemic antifungal 
agent (eg, amphoterici n B) will be permitted for these 6 subjects onl y.  Three subjects in this 
cohort will be between 1 and <6 months of age and 3 subjects will be between 6 months and 
<2years of age.  Data from these 6 subjects will not be utilized for secondary  efficacy  
endpoint anal yses but will be assessed for safety .  The exposure data from these subjects will 
be used to confirm if the recommended dosing regimen is appropriate for subjects aged 
<2years.  After the dosing regimen is confirmed, subjects between 1 month to <2years of 
age will be permitted to be enrolled at all sites.  Subsequent to this time point, use of a 
second s ystemic antifungal agent (eg, amphotericin B) will not be permitted.
A population PK -PD analy sis will also be performed in all other subjects en rolled and will 
include subjects <2 years of age who are not part of the 6 subject cohort described above, in 
which 3 to 5 sparse pharmacokinetic samples will be collected.

microscopic visualization of yeast, hyphae, or pseudohyphae) from a sample obtained 
from a normally sterile site (eg, blood and/or tissue).  However, in these subjects, 
culture confirmation of Candida sp. must be obtained within 9 6 hours post treatment 
initiation.   If culture confirmation is not obtained within this time period, subjects will 
be discontinued from study treatment but will remain in the study for continued safety 
monitoring.  These subject will be required to return for the 2- week and 6 -week 
follow -up visits.
Positive cultures for Candida sp. from urine (in the absence of clinical signs and

baseline isolates (or histological evidence of infection) were obtained from sterile 
site samples ( other than blood ), follow -up cultures culture or histolog y from the 
same anatomical site should be repeated only as clinically  indicated , otherwise they 
are not required.
Investigators will send specimens (blood or other) to their local certified l aboratory  for

laboratory  will follow its usual procedures for identification of the species and susceptibility  
testing to marketed agents.  
Additionally , all Candida isolates must be preserved for shipment to the reference laboratory  
for further identification, including speciation, and susceptibility  testing.  This includes the

b. Blood cultures will also be obtained at the end of IV therapy  (EOIVT), and at 
the end of oral therap y (in subjects switched to or al fluconazole).  A blood culture 
at the 2 -week and 6- week follow -up visit is required only  if clinically  indicated.  
c. Additional cultures beyond those required b y the protocol may  be obtained at 
any time at the investigator’s discretion, as clinically  indicated.  The results of the 
cultures should be recorded on the case report form.
4. Tissue Cultures : For subjects whose screening cultures were obtained from sterile 
site samples (other than blood), follow- up cultures from the same anatomical site 
shoul d be repeated onl y as clinically indicated, otherwise they are not required.
Investigators will send specimens (blood or other) to their local certified laboratory  for 
culture (incubation should be a minimum of five day s if not positive before then).  Each
laboratory  will follow its usual procedures for identification of the species and susceptibility  
testing to marketed agents.  
Additionally , all Candida isolates must be preserved for shipment to the reference laboratory  
for further identification, including speciation, and susceptibility  testing.  This includes the 
original isolate that the diagnosis for inclusion into the study  was made, as well as all 
subsequently  recovered Candida isolates from any site.  If more than one species of Candida
is isolated from a single culture, all isolates must be sent to the reference laboratory.  The

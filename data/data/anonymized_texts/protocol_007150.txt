REV. 9/26/18 Page 4 of 581.0) INTRODUCTION :
1.1) Conventional allogeneic stem cell transplantation is a valuable approach to therapy 
for many hematologic malignancies.  However, high dose conditioning regimens are associated with a high incidence of acute and long-term side effects.  This has precluded the use of allografting for older patients and those patients with pre-existing organ damage.  Thus, an important goal is the development of safer allografting procedures that can be extended to those patients who would otherwise suffer from a high morbidity and mortality during allogeneic transplant.
Considerable data support the presence of a graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect after 
allogeneic transplants, including the reduced risk of leukemic relapse in patients with acute and chronic graft versus host disease (1,2,3).  There is a higher risk of leukemia relapse after syngeneic (identical twin) bone marrow transplantation (4,5,6) and after T-cell depleted allotransplants due to lack of a graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect (1,7).  The most striking and direct evidence supporting the existence of the GvL effect is the observation that certain patients who relapse after allogeneic transplantation can be re-induced into complete remission by infusing additional donor lymphocytes (8,9,10,11,12). The data discussed above indicate that the graft versus leukemia/lymphoma (GvL) effect alone may cure susceptible diseases.  An alternative strategy is to utilize a less intense, non-myeloablative conditioning regimen designed not to eradicate the malignancy but to provide sufficient immunosuppression to achieve donor engraftment.  This strategy allows subsequent development of a graft versus malignancy effect. 
Recent preclinical studies in a canine model have shown that the conditioning 
regimen for allografting can be reduced in intensity yet still achieve the goal of engraftment (13).  Other investigators have performed pilot trials to determine whether this strategy of non- myeloablative chemotherapy with allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation could induce  durable engraftment and remission in patients with hematologic malignancies.  This approach was studied in patients who were ineligible for standard myeloablative conditioning regimen because of advanced age or co-morbid illness.
Childs et al at NIH investigated lineage specific chimerism in fifteen patients 
receiving an allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant from an HLA-identical (n=14) or a 5/6 HLA antigen matched sibling donor after a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (14).  Eight patients had hematologic malignancies, MDS (n=3), CML chronic phase (n=2), CML second chronic phase (n=1)), refractory extramedullary plasmacytoma (n=1), relapsed diffuse large cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n=1).  Seven patients had solid tumors, metastatic APPROVED RP CI IRB

(donor range; 40% to 90%) T-cell chimerism on day +30.  After cyclosporine A (CSA) withdrawal, three additional patients  became 100% donor T-cell chimeric.  The four remaining patients with mixed T-cell chimerism, 2-4 weeks after CSA withdrawal received 1-3 doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) given at 30 day intervals.  Three achieved 100% donor T-cell chimerism.  One patient, who only reached a maximum of 40% donor T-cell chimerism, showed a progressive decrease in percentage of donor T-cells despite three doses of donor lymphocyte infusions (2, 10 and 150 x 10
6 CD3+ cells/kg) and completely rejected the transplant by day +72.  
Overall, 13 out of 14 patients established 100% donor T-cell chimerism. At day +30 posttransplant, all 14 surviving patients had  evidence of residual disease.  Subsequently, ten patients (71.4%) had disease regression, five of whom remain in complete remission (CR).  One patient with extensive renal cell cancer and two patients with CML remain disease free 13, 12, and 5 months, respectively, post transplant. 
Indolent lymphoid malignancies are also affected by graft versus malignancy effects 
(15). Fifteen patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or lymphoma have been treated using a non-myeloablative regimen of fludarabine or cyclophosphamide or fludarabine, cytarabine, and cisplatin (16).  All patients had failed to respond or had disease after primary chemotherapy.  Nine patients had CLL in relapse after a prior fludarabine response, and 6 patients had lymphoma.  All patients had active disease at the time of transplantation.  Three had an ECOG performance status of 3, two patients had elevated liver function tests, and all had received extensive prior therapy.  Eleven of 15 patients had evidence of engraftment.  The percentage of donor cells in marrow ranged between 50% and 100% at one month after transplantation.  One patient had 75% donor cells in his marrow at 6 weeks post-transplant and converted to 100% donor cells following donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI).  All eleven patients with engraftment had a response, and 8 patients achieved complete remission.  Maximal responses are slow to develop and occur gradually over a period of several months to a year.
High dose therapy with allogeneic marrow transplantation in multiple myeloma 
carries a high risk of treatment related mortality, up to 70% in some series (17,18,19).  The existence of a graft versus myeloma effect is also well established, as indicated by the success of DLI in re-inducing remission in selected patients relapsing after allogeneic transplant (20,21).  The strategy of a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen is of major interest as a potential means of harnessing this graft-versus-myeloma effect while reducing regimen related toxicities.APPROVED RP CI IRB

REV. 9/26/18 Page 6 of 58Fanconi anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by chromosomal 
fragility, congenital abnormalities, progressive  bone marrow failure and a marked propensity to develop malignancies. FA is only cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and is a universally accepted indication for HLA-identical sibling allografts (38). FA patients are natural candidates for reduced intensity conditioning because of their cellular hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents such as cyclophosphamide and radiotherapy (39). Fludarabine based regimens are attractive as they are capable of intense T-cell immunosuppression, and have been  used successfully for nonmalignant diseases, including Fanconi anemia, with minimal toxicity and stable, durable engraftment (40, 41).
This transplant approach has advantages over conventional transplant; first, acute 
GVHD is delayed and usually occurs after patients have fully recovered from conditioning-related toxicities.  Second, the ability to modify chimerism by withdrawing anti-GVHD medications or by DLI allows flexibility in selecting the optimum pace of donor immune recovery, with its attendant benefit from graft versus tumor effects and its risk of GVHD induction.  While these low intensity transplants have a decreased immediate procedural mortality, the long-term efficacy must still be determined.  Furthermore, because the preparative regimen does not contribute a significant anti-malignancy effect, the risk of disease progression might be higher.

REV. 9/26/18 Page 10 of 585.0) DONOR ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA/ STEM CELL SOURCE CRITERIA:
5.1) HLA matching is important in determining the risk for transplant related 
complications, in particular GVHD.   The HLA loci: A, B, DR and to lesser extent C have been identified as regions that are important in determining HLA matching.   Full HLA identity is associated with the least risk of GVHD.   Initially matching was determined at the A, B, DR loci with a total of 6 possible alleles (3 inherited from each parent).   A single antigen mismatch at A, B, or the DR transplant from a family member is associated with a higher risk of GVHD but similar survival when compared to full identity at these 3 regions.  When evaluating patients for unrelated donor transplant, a higher degree of matching is preferred due to the higher risk of GVHD.  However, recent data from the National Marrow Donor Program has demonstrated that single antigen mismatching with a reduced-intensity transplant results in acceptable levels of GVHD.
Molecular testing has allowed for more detailed analysis of the HLA locus 
(34).  Multiple alleles have been described in the A, B, DR and C loci.  The DR region has been further defined by molecular typing into 2 major regions: DRB1 and DQB1. However the clinically relevant antigen for matching is DRB1.  In addition, molecular testing has allowed for more accurate determination of the C region.  Thus, matching can take place at a more stringent level for unrelated donor transplants.
Related donor/recipient pairs must be matched at  6 or 5 HLA antigens (A, B, 
DR).  Volunteer unrelated donor/recipient pairs must be  matched at the antigen level by molecular analysis at the DRB1 loci for blood and marrow transplants.  An antigen mismatch may be considered in patients otherwise matched at the other loci.  Patients who do not have an appropriate unrelated donor will be considered for cord blood transplant on this protocol.
5.2) Single antigen mismatch at A, B, or C may participate in this protocol for 
voluntary unrelated donors.  The priority would be C mismatching followed by A then B.
5.3) If a patient has no suitable family donor matched for 5 or 6 HLA antigens (A, 
B, DR) and no suitable unrelated donor is identified, patient can be considered a candidate for cord blood transplant, provided a cord blood donor is identified either a 4,5 or 6 match with the patient for HLA antigens (A, B, DR).   The cord blood product must provide a minimum of 2 x 10

negative for HIV and Hepatitis A, B and C, and sterility assays have no growth APPROVED RP CI IRB

8.1) Stem cell Collection:
Donors will receive 10 micrograms/ kg GCSF daily sub-cutaneously, starting 
on day -5. Mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) will be collected by apheresis on day “-1” and again on day “0” if necessary, to achieve a minimum target dose of 2 x 10
6 CD34+ cells/kg of recipient weight (maximum 8 x 106 
CD34+ cells /kg for related donors, no maximum for unrelated donors) (33, 
34).  PBSCs will be unmanipulated. CD3+ and CD34+ cells as fractions of the 
peripheral mononuclear cells (PMN) will be determined from the established PMN cell collection according to institutional flow cytometry.
The preferred method of collection is peripheral blood collection, but if 
peripheral blood collection either cannot  be obtained or this method is declined, a bone marrow harvest will be performed.  The target dose for bone marrow harvest will be 3 x 10
8 nucleated cells per kilogram of patient body 
weight.  Bone marrow will be unmanipulated.
The peripheral mononuclear cells will be separated and collected, while all the 
other separated blood components will be returned to the donor.
If donor lives outside of the area or is unable to come back after 
transplantation, donor lymphocytes will be collected by apheresis before the GCSF mobilization, aliquotted into CD3
+ cell doses as per section 8.6 and 
cryopreserved for subsequent thawing and infusion.  If donor will be accessible after transplant, donor lymphocytes will be collected by apheresis after transplant.  If the stem cell collection is ≤ 1x10
6 per kg of body weight 
then bone marrow harvest will be done.

8.6) Followup;
8.6.1) Immunosuppression: 
After transplant, serial samples of blood and marrow will be analyzed 
for chimerism analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Chimerism will be analyzed in blood on day 30 - 40, day 60 - 70  and then as  indicated in section 8.6.3.  Chimerism will be analyzed in bone marrow (for leukemia and patients with other malignancies if bone marrow was involved previously) on day 30- 40 and day 100 -120 and then as indicated in section 8.6.3.
For peripheral blood and bone marrow transplant patients, those  
showing 100% donor T-lymphocyte chimerism by minisatellite analysis on day +30 continue FK506 and MMF until day +60; thereafter MMF will be stopped.  Cord blood patients will be continued on FK506 until day + 180.  All patients will be tapered off FK506 by 25% every 10 days and discontinued if no GVHD develops.  Patients not converting to 100% donor T-cell chimerism by day + 120 and showing signs of progression of disease after FK506 and MMF withdrawal, will be evaluated for DLI (section 8.6.5).  Pts who receive cord blood will not receive DLI.  For Fanconi Anemia, taper FK506 at day 100 (for related donor) or day 180 (for unrelated donor).10/19/2018

9.0) POTENTIAL TOXICITIES, THEIR MANAGEMENT AND DOSE 
MODIFICATION:
9.1) REGIMEN RELATED TOXICITY (Bearman Criteria, Appendix 1).
9.1.1) Cardiac:  
The risk of fatal cardiac toxicity with the study regimens is <5%.  
Patients who develop signs of congestive heart failure not attributable  to fluid overload should be evaluated for signs of carditis before additional 10/19/2018
Protocol Number: RP 01-05
REV. 9/26/18 Page 23 of 58cytoxan is given.  Studies should include ECG (to compare voltage to 
pretreatment ECG), radionuclide ventriculogram, and/or echocardiography.  If evidence of pericarditis, pericardial effusion or impaired myocardial function (decreased ejection fraction) is found, no further chemotherapy will be administered.  In this situation patients must be watched carefully for signs of pericardial tamponade; pericardiectomy may be required.
9.1.2 Bladder:  
Urinary metabolites of cyclophosphamide can produce hemorrhagic 
cystitis. Microscopic hematuria is common following high dose cyclophosphamide regimens and up to 20% of patients may have gross hematuria.  Vigorous hydration of patients (3,000 ml/m
2/day) prior to 
beginning cyclophosphamide and continuing until 24 hours after the final cyclophosphamide dose, produces a dilute urine and reduces the likelihood of severe cystitis.  The risk of life-threatening cystitis is estimated to be <1%.  For patients with a history of previous cyclophosphamide induced hemorrhagic cystitis, MESNA may be used.
9.1.3 Renal:  
All these agents in high doses can produce renal toxicity which can be 
minimized by vigorous hydration and avoidance of concomitant exposure to other nephrotoxic agents.  Kidney damage is usually reversible, but severe cases may require dialysis.
9.1.4 Pulmonary:   
With the study regimens the risk of fatal idiopathic interstitial 
pneumonitis is felt to be <10%.  Patients with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates often present a difficult diagnostic and management problem.   Whenever possible, histologic confirmation of the diagnosis should be  attempted by bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial or open-lung biopsy to exclude infectious causes, including cytomegalovirus.
9.1.5 Hepatic:   
Moderate toxicity is common.   More severe, possibly fatal, liver 
toxicity can occur, usually in the form of veno-occlusive disease.  With the study regimens the incidence of fatal liver toxicity should be < 10%.   Management of liver toxicity is with standard supportive and symptomatic measures.  Avoid exposure of patients to other hepatotoxic agents whenever possible.APPROVED RP CI IRB
10/19/2018
Protocol Number: RP 01-05
REV. 9/26/18 Page 24 of 589.1.6 CNS:
Fludarabine can cause weakness, paresthesias or peripheral 
neuropathies, visual or auditory impairment, and/or mental status changes such as confusion, agitation, depression, or coma.  Some antibiotics, which may be needed to treat infections during the period of low white blood cell counts, can cause VIIIth cranial nerve damage resulting in hearing loss (especially high-frequency tones) and dizziness which may be permanent.  To minimize this possibility, antibiotic levels will be monitored.
9.1.7) Stomatitis/Dysphagia:   
Many patients will experience moderate to severe stomatitis and 
dysphagia.  Adequate pain relief often requires parenteral narcotics.
9.1.8) Gastrointestinal:  
9.1.8.A) Nausea/Vomiting: Many patients will experience moderate to 
severe nausea and vomiting.  All patients should receive vigorous antiemetic treatment. 
9.1.8.B) Diarrhea:  Most patients will experience moderate-severe 
diarrhea, which responds to standard symptomatic therapy.  Appropriate studies are needed to exclude infectious causes of diarrhea, especially C. difficile.
9.2) OTHER TOXICITIES:
9.2.1) Hematologic:  
All blood products will be irradiated (2500 cGy) to prevent graft 
vs host disease. Infection prophylaxis and treatment will be given according to standard accepted medical practice.  With prophylactic platelet transfusions, the risk of death from hemorrhage is <5%. 
9.2.2) Skin:
Generalized erythroderma can occur with painful palms and soles 
and superficial desquamation at sites of mechanical trauma.  Topical steroid creams may provide symptomatic relief. Severe cases may require a brief course (3-5 days) of systemic corticosteroids. Long lasting hyperpigmentation may follow resolution of the erythroderma.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Protocol Number: RP 01-05
REV. 9/26/18 Page 25 of 589.2.3) Hair:   
Most patients will experience total  (reversible) alopecia.
9.2.4) Allergy:   
ATG may be associated with a serum sickness like reaction with 
rash, hives, pruritis, joint aches.  More severe anaphylactic like reactions with bronchospasm and shock are uncommon but reported.  Prior to administration of ATG, patients will be pretreated with Tylenol, Benadryl and Solumedrol.  Epinephrine and resuscitation equipment will be available at the bedside during administration.
9.2.5) Graft-vs-Host Disease:   
Approximately 80% of patients will exhibit some manifestation of  
GvHD.  Severe acute GvHD (grade II-III) may occur in up to 40% of patients with an overall mortality of 20% due to GvHD and its complications.  The risk of severe or fatal GvHD is increased for older patients and for patients receiving stem cells from partially-matched donors.  A chronic form of GvHD is expected to occur in up to 40% of patients who survive beyond 3 months; 10% of patients may experience significant disability due to chronic GvHD that persist for months to years post-transplant.  Standard measures for prevention and treatment of GvHD will be followed.
9.2.6) Secondary malignancy:   
Exposure to alkylating agents increases the risk of developing 
leukemia or a second cancer. The incidence of leukemia is probably approximately 5%. (Vincent T. Devita; Cancer. Principles and Practice of Oncology. 6th edition, 2000).
9.2.7) Toxicities of G-CSF:  
Include bone pain, headache and muscle aches.  These can be 
treated with non-narcotic and narcotic analgesics.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Tingling around mouth or in fingers, feeling cold or feeling a 
pressure sensation in  chest due to the blood thinner (citrate) used only in the machine method.  Feeling light-headed or fainting any time during or at the end of the procedure.  Pain, bruising or infection at the point of the needle entry into the skin. Reaction (such as a rash) if a drug is given to which the patient is allergic.Blood loss (seldom more than one pint) because of equipment problems which make it impossible to return the blood.  Air entering the blood stream causing air to go to body organs (rare risk because of safety measures used).

10.5) Tacrolimus (Prograf
®);
10.5.1) AVAILABILITY :
Tacrolimus is a commercially available macrolide compound with 
potent immunosuppressant properties. Tacrolimus is available for oral administration as capsules, containing the equivalent of 0.5 mg, 1 mg, or 5 mg of anhydrous tacrolimus.  For IV use, tacrolimus is available as a sterile solution in 1mL ampules containing the equivalent of 5 mg of anhydrous tacrolimus per ml.
The oral absorption of tacrolimus is erratic and incomplete; 
absolute bio-availability is approximately 25%.  Peak serum levels are seen 1 to 3 hours after an oral dose.  Therapeutic trough blood concentrations have ranged  from 5 to 20 ng/ml.  Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized in the liver, with only small amounts of unchanged drug (2% or less) being recovered in the urine.  The elimination half-life of tacrolimus is approximately 10 hours. 
Tacrolimus suppresses both humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated 
immune responses.  The compound is chemically distinct from cyclosporine but both agents elicit similar immunosuppressant effects.  The immunosuppressive activity of tacrolimus is, however, more marked than that of cyclosporine.

 PREPARATION : FOR IV USE:
Tacrolimus concentrate for injection must be diluted prior to IV 
infusion.  For IV infusion, the concentrate will be prepared as per pharmacy standards.  Preparation of the solution in polyethylene or glass containers allows storage for 24 hours beyond which unused solution should be discarded.  A plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) container should not be used because stability of the solution is decreased and polyoxyl 60 hydrogenated castor oil contained in the formulation may leach phthalates from PVC containers.

 TOXICITY :
In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experienced anemia, 
8% to 32% experienced leukocytosis, and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia.  Rare cases of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia have been reported.  Mild to moderate hypertension was reported in 38% to 50% of patients receiving tacrolimus.  Mild to moderate hypertension is a common adverse effect associated with tacrolimus therapy.  Chest pain was reported in 19%.  Antihypertensive therapy may be required.  The most common adverse effects of tacrolimus have involved the central nervous system, and include headache (37% to 64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%), paresthesia (17% to 40%); and dizziness (19%).  Tremor and headache may respond to a dosage reduction. Agitation, anxiety, confusion, seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus, neuropathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal dreams have been reported in 3% to 15% of tacrolimus-treated patients.  Hyperkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to 29%), hypophosphatemia (49%), and hypomagnesemia (16% to 48%) have been associated with tacrolimus therapy.  In addition, hirsutism occurs only rarely with tacrolimus.  Hyperuricemia has been reported in greater than 3% of tacrolimus-treated patients. Gastrointestinal adverse  effects of APPROVED RP CI IRB

The incidence of hyperglycemia is 17% and may require therapy with insulin. Other less frequently occurring effects (greater than 3%) include abscess, chills, peritonitis, and photosensitivity reactions. Anaphylaxis has been reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus.  Tacrolimus contains castor oil which has been associated with anaphylaxis in other drugs containing castor oil derivatives. 
10.6) Mycophenolate (CellCept®):
CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil) is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester 
of mycophenolic acid (MPA), inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) inhibitor. 
10.6.1) Availability and administration:
CellCept is available for oral administration as capsules 
containing 250 mg of mycophenolate mofetil, tablets containing 500 mg of mycophenolate mofetil, and as a powder for oral suspension, which when constituted contains 200 mg/mL mycophenolate mofetil.  Each vial of CellCept Intravenous contains the equivalent of 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil as the hydrochloride salt.  Reconstitution and dilution with 5% Dextrose APPROVED RP CI IRB

Protocol Number: RP 01-05
REV. 9/26/18 Page 33 of 58Injection USP yields a solution of mycophenolate mofetil, 6 
mg/mL.
10.6.2) Clinical Pharmacology: 
Mechanism of Action:  Mycophenolate mofetil is rapidly 
absorbed following oral administration and hydrolyzed to form MPA, which is the active metabolite.  MPA is a selective and uncompetitive, inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), andtherefore inhibits the de-novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into DNA.  Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for their proliferation on de- novo synthesis of purines, whereas other cell types can utilize salvage pathways, MPA has potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes.  MPA inhibits proliferative responses of T- and B-lymphocytes to both mitogenic and allospecific stimulation. 
10.6.3) Pharmacokinetics:  
Oral absorption of the drug is rapid and essentially complete.  MPA is metabolized to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active. 
10.6.4) Metabolism:  
Following oral and intravenous dosing, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes complete metabolism to MPA, the active metabolite. MPA is metabolized principally by glucuronyl transferase to form the phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG) which is not pharmacologically active.  In vivo, MPAG is converted to MPA via enterohepatic recirculation.  Increased plasma concentrations of mycophenolate mofetil metabolites (MPA 50% increase and MPAG about a 3-fold to 6-fold increase) are observed in patients with renal insufficiency. 
10.6.5) Excretion:  
Orally administered radiolabeled mycophenolate mofetil resulted in complete recovery of the administered dose, with 93% of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6% recovered in feces.  Most (about 87%) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. APPROVED RP CI IRB

REV. 9/26/18 Page 34 of 5810.6.6) Contraindications:
Allergic reactions to CellCept have been observed; therefore, 
CellCept is contraindicated in patients with a hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any component of the drug product. CellCept Intravenous is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to Polysorbate 80 (TWEEN). 
10.6.7) Adverse effects:
The principal adverse reactions associated with the administration 
of CellCept include diarrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, vomiting, and there is evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections.  Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of drugs, including CellCept, as part of an immunosuppressive regimen are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, particularly of the skin.  The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent.  Oversuppression of the immune system can also increase susceptibility to infection, including opportunistic infections, fatal infections, and sepsis. 
As usual for patients with increased risk for skin cancer, exposure 
to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen.  Lymphoproliferative disease or lymphoma developed in 0.4% to 1% of patients receiving CellCept (2 g or 3 g) with other immunosuppressive agents in controlled clinical trials of renal, cardiac, and hepatic transplant patients. 
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant 
women.  However, as CellCept has been shown to have teratogenic effects in animals, it may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman.  Therefore, CellCept should not be used in pregnant women unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.  It is recommended that CellCept therapy should not be initiated by the physician until a report of a negative pregnancy test has been obtained. APPROVED RP CI IRB

with CellCept should be interrupted or the dose reduced, appropriate diagnostic tests performed, and the patient managed appropriately.  Gastrointestinal bleeding (requiring hospitalization) has been observed in approximately 3% of renal transplant patients treated with CellCept 3g daily. Gastrointestinal perforations have rarely been observed.

13.0) STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
13.1) Power Computations
Sample size calculation is based on the primary endpoint: 
toxicity, defined as day 100 treatment related mortality (TRM).  The null hypothesis is that the TRM is < 25% vs. the alternative hypothesis that the TRM is > 40%.A two-stage study design will be used in which a total of 60 patients with hematologic malignancies and disorders will be accrued.  If more than 20 patients experience TRM, the null hypothesis will be rejected and the treatment is not considered worthy of further study.   
13.2) Early Stopping Rules  
Assessment of the day 100 TRM rate is significantly higher than 
40%. At stage 1 with accrual of 30 patients, if 13 or more patients die of TRM, the study will be closed.  Otherwise accrual will continue until the target of 60 patients or if 20 or more patients die of TRM.
The decision rules of this study design yield a type I error rate = 
0.0933 and power = 0.8709.
13.3) Secondary End points
The secondary endpoint is disease response rate.  Although 
response rate will be assessed, no statistical comparisons will be APPROVED RP CI IRB
10/19/2018
Protocol Number: RP 01-05
REV. 9/26/18 Page 45 of 58performed because we expect too heterogeneous a population of  
diseases to compare.
13.4) October 2003 Amendment
Due to slow accrual, the study design has been changed as follows.  
The null and research hypotheses, denoted   and , respectively, 0H1H
continue to be that the day 100 treatment related mortality (TRM) = 25% versus TRM > 25%.  Let  and  be the numbers of 
1S2S
evaluable patients accrued at stages 1 and 2 who die due to treatment.  Then, the following new two-stage design replaces the original two-stage design described in Section 13.2.  
At stage 1, accrue 17 evaluable patients.  If , the study will be 
110S≥
closed to accrual and it will concluded that the day 100 TRM 
exceeds 25%.  That is, if 10 or more patients among the first 17 evaluable patients experience treatment related death on or before day 100, it will be concluded that the day 100 TRM exceeds 25%.  If  continue to stage 2.
19S≤
At stage 2, accrue 16 more evaluable patients.  If  12, 12SS+≥
conclude that the day 100 TRM exceeds 25%.  Otherwise, there is 
insufficient evidence to draw this conclusion.
With this design, the probability is 0.099 of erroneously concluding 
 and the probability is 0.880 that  will be correctly concluded if 1H1H
the true rate is 45%.  That is, the significance level of  the test is 0.099 and 0.880 is the power of the test when 45% the true rate.
This design is optimal in the following sense.  The stage 1 sample 
size, 17, is as small as possible.  The stage 2 sample size, 16, is as small as possible subject to the constraint that it is bounded above by the stage 1 sample size.  The significance level of the test is bounded above by 0.10, and the power of the test when the day 100 TRM is 45% is bounded below by 0.88.
Observing disease response rate continues to be a secondary 
objective.  No statistical comparisons among disease-type response rates will be made because of the heterogeneity of diseases.APPROVED RP CI IRB

Stem Cell Infusion:   
Day 0  is the day on which the stem cells are infused. The procedure of infusing stem cell 
products may be performed by the physician or the BMT Coordinator. Stem cells are to remain sterile throughout the infusion process.  All patients require continuous pulse oximetry monitoring during the procedure, with oxygen equipment available in the patient's room.  All patients will have vital signs recorded before the procedure and at timed intervals during and after stem cell infusion.  Emergency drugs, such as benadryl, epinephrine and corticosteroids will be available for use in appropriate doses.  No other blood products should be given on the day of transplant, especially within 8 hours of planned infusion time. Stem cells must be infused without the use of a blood filter.  No more than 480 ml of stem cells may be infused at one time.  Patients will be pre-medicated according to RPCI Standard Operating Procedure for Stem Cell reinfusion.
Cord Blood Stem Cell Preparation and Reinfusion (37).
Cryopreserved units of cord blood stem cells will be shipped to Roswell Park in liquid 
nitrogen in vapor phase and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to patients receiving their preparative regimen. Subsequently the unit will be thawed in the laboratory and washed with 10 % Dextran 40 and 5% human albumin before infusion. A nucleated cell count, CD34
+ count, ABO and Rh typing, test of cell viability, bacterial and fungal cultures and 
assay forhematopoietic progenitors will be performed on a sample from each thawed unit if there are more than adequate cells for transplant. If there is a limited amount of cord blood, then samples will be sent for bacterial and fungal cultures and cell viability only.  The cord blood product is then infused intravenously into the patient. Cord blood units will not be T-cell depleted, volume reduced or depleted of red cells.

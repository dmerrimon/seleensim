 1.1 Primary Objective: To establish the progression free survival rate at 2 years, 
using RECIST criteria, to TPF  followed by chemoradiotherapy of locoregionally 
advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma  
 1.2 Secondary Objectives : To e valuate  complete response rates, safety and 
feasibility of TFP=> chemoxrt in patients with NPC  
 
2. BACKGROUND  
Backgro und for the rationale of TPF=> chemoradiation  
2.1 Nasopharyngeal cancer   
Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC)  is a significant problem worldwide. The  annual incidence 
rate worldwide is  1.8/100,000  and the rate climbs to as high as 50/100,000 in Southern  
China .1 
2.2 CHEMORADIATION VERSUS RADIATION  
Historically, nonmetastatic NPC  has been treated with radiation alone. Because of the 
known chemosensitivity of NPC, a series of randomized controlled trials of 
chemoradiotherapy versus radiotherapy conducted in the 1990’s and early 2000’s 
demonstrated that in patients with advanced loc al or regional disease, the addition of 
chemotherapy to radiation was associated with a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful survival advantage. 5 6, 7  A smal ler subsequent trial suggested that even in the 
case of patients with advanced local disease but minimal nodal disease (T3 -4, N0 -1), 
patients  had increased local control with the use of combined chemotherapy and 
accelerated fractionation radiation versus conventional radiation alone.  8  The table below 
is a summary of the RCT data supporting either an OS or LRC advantage of 
chemoradiation versus radiation:  
From IJROBP Volume 66, Number 1, 2006 p 150 8: 
 
 
IRB-15411  Page 2 of 56 5 December  2016  The advantage to chemoradiation over radiation in the RCTs was distributed between 
both local and systemic effects. In the large RCT cited above, there was a substantial 
reduction in both locoregional recurrence and metastatic  disease in the combined 
treatment arms versus radiation alone.  
In all of the RCT, the chemotherapy combined cisplatin – based chemotherapy with 
XRT, with cisplatin dosing plans including 40 mg/m2 weekly to 100 mg/m2  every 3 
weeks to 20mg/m2/d x 4 with co ncurrent 5FU infusion every 3 weeks. In the US 
intergroup study, an additional 3 cycles of cisplatin 80  mg/m2 plus 5FU 1000mg/m2/d x 
4 days was planned, to be administered after radiation had been completed.  
A common theme to all of these recipes is that i n all cases cumulative dose of concurrent 
cisplatin exceeded 180mg/m2. However, in the US intergroup trial, where 300 mg/m2 ( 
three 100 mg/m2 doses) was the intent, only 63% of the patients received three cycles of 
CDDP. In the Chan et al. trial in which C DDP was administered weekly to an anticipated 
total of 240 mg/m2, 95% of the patients were compliant with the plan.  9 Therefore, while 
the optimal c oncurrent CDDP dosing schedule has yet to be defined, it appears that 
weekly dosing is more tolerable and in many cases dosing beyond a cumulative dose of 
200-240 mg/m2 is not feasible.  Additionally, of the 3 RCT discussed here, only one, the 
US intergrou p study, administered adjuvant PF. Only about half of the patients 
randomized to the adjuvant PF were able to receive 3 cycles, and a third of the patients 
randomized to that arm received no adjuvant treatment. Therefore, since all 3 RCTs 
showed an overall  survival advantage for patients with advanced disease, it is not clear 
that adjuvant PF has benefit beyond concurrent chemoradiation, nor is it clear that 
administration of PF after chemoradiation is feasible.   
2.3 Adjuvant versus neoadjuvant  (or inducti on) chemotherapy  
The rationale behind administration of adjuvant PF in the intergroup trial was that the 
additional chemotherapy might reduce the number of distant relapses and therefore offer 
benefit beyond the concurrent treatment. However, a comparison of the outcome of the 
US intergroup versus the Chan and Lin trials suggests that the reduction in the 
development of distant metastasis was approximately 30 to 50% in patients with 
advanced disease on all of these trials. Therefore the benefit of adjuvant PF on this basis 
is also questionable. Again, this may be because so few patients in the US intergroup 
study were able to receive meaningful doses of PF after chemoradiation.  
Initial studies of induction chemotherapy added to radiation alone in NPC patient s failed 
to show disease control or survival benefit.  10  Recent  pooled analysis of cisplatin - based 
induction chemotherapy versus radiation alone in NPC patients demonstrated  
improvement in relapse free and disease specific survival, but did not show an overall 
survival advantage.11  Subset analysis of these trials demonstrated a survival advantage of 
induction chemotherapy for patients with early stage, but not advanced stage disease. 
This subse t analysis suggested that in all groups there was a numerical advantage to 
induction in terms of distant metastasis free survival in all groups, but because 
locoregional disease was the major contributor to relapse, it overshadowed any potential 
benefit to  systemic control of disease. Therefore, with the development of better radiation 
techniques to control locoregional disease, we hypothesize that a more effective treatment 
of distant disease may translate into an OS advantage now that locoregional control  rates 
have improved.  
 
IRB-15411  Page 3 of 56 5 December  2016  There are ongoing RCT designed to definitively answer the question concerning the 
possible benefit of the addition of PF induction chemotherapy to concurrent 
chemoradiation in patients with NPC. Lee et al. of the Hong Kong Nasopharyng eal 
Cancer Study Group  are conducting a trial whose primary endpoint is a comparison of 
induction chemotherapy with Cisplatin + 5 -Fluorouracil versus adjuvant chemotherapy 
with Cisplatin + 5 -Fluororacil (PF -P vs P -PF) in the setting of concurrent chemorad iation 
as a backbone. This trial opened in September 2006 and is planning to enroll 798 patients 
with an estimated completion date of September 2013. See web site ClinicalTrials.gov, 
Identifier:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  Feng et al. of the Taiwan National Health Resea rch Institutes 
opened in 2003 a multicenter Phase III Trial Comparing Induction Mitomycin, 
Epirubicin, Cisplatin, Fluorouracil, and Leucovorin Chemotherapy Followed by 
Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Versus Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Alone in Stage 
IV Nasop haryngeal Carcinoma (NPC), based on 5 year OS of 70% and 5 year distant 
metastasis rate of 81% in a phase 2 trial. 12 See ClinicalTrials.gov identifier   
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. This 480 patient trial is expected to be complete d in 2013.  
Therefore, the question of induction plus concurrent chemoradiation using CDDP based 
chemotherapy in patients with NPC, while still open, should be answered in the next 5 
years with 2 large RCT, at least for the specific chemotherapy recipes dis cussed above  
2.4 Carboplatin versus Cisplatin  
Carboplatin is probably as efficacious as cisplatin in the treatment of NPC in the curative 
setting. Evidence for equivalence can be drawn be inference from other diseases and from 
one recently published robust  direct comparison of CDDP and carboplatin in NPC, 
discussed below.  
Multiple studies in NSCLC and ovarian cancer have demonstrated that despite the fact 
that cisplatin containing regimens often have been associated with higher response rates, 
carboplatin i n almost every study is associated with the same survival and better 
tolerability.  13 14-18 
A randomized controlled trial of patients with SCCHN compared weekly carboplatin 
(100 mg/m2/dose x 4) with daily low dose cisplatin (4mg/m2/dose, cumulative dose 64 
mg/m2) , both concurrently administered with definitive radiation ( 65Gy). Both local 
control and overall survival were numerically superior in the carboplatin arm, but OS d id 
not reach statistical significance because of the size of the trial, 119 patients.  19 Because 
many experts regard the dose of CDDP in this trial as inadequate, one can conclude that 
there is evidence that carboplatin XRT is associated with a better outcome than XRT and 
suboptimal CDDP dosing, but is silent on the question of standard CDDP dosing in this 
setting.  
A recent study directly compared CDDP versus carboplatin in the curative setting in 
patients with NPC who were receiving concurrent definitive radiation. In this 206 patient 
study, the standard US intergroup concurrent plus adjuvant chemoradiation was 
compared to an identical radiation plan with carboplatin 100mg/m2 weekly instead of 
concurrent cisplatin, and carboplatin AUC5 instead of cisplatin in the adjuva nt setting.  20 
There was no difference in overall survival or disease free survival. Toxicity was 
markedly less in the carboplatin arm, and over twice as many p atients in the carboplatin 
arm (62 versus 26%) completed all intended chemotherapy treatment.  
2.5 TAXANES  
 
IRB-15411  Page 4 of 56 5 December  2016  Taxanes are among the most active anti - cancer agents available for squamous cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, with single agent response rates of 40% or higher 
reported in patients with prior platinum exposure.  21, 22 Three recently reported RCT of 
the addition of a taxane to the “ backbone” PF induction regimen as part of a curative 
chemoradiation plan have demonstrated that overall survival with TPF is superior to PF 
when used as induction chemotherapy followed by either radiation alone or 
chemoradiation in patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.  23 24, 25 
Paradoxically, the three drug combination (taxane, platinum, 5 -FU) has been associated 
with a superior QOL than the two drug combination (platinum, 5 -FU).  This is probably 
because the dose of infusional 5 -FU, which induces severe gastro intestinal toxicity, was 
reduced in all versions of the three drug regimen tested. These results let the FDA to 
recently (9/28/07) approve the use of docetaxel explicitly in combination with cisplatin 
and 5 -fluorouracil for induction therapy of locally adv anced squamous cell carcinoma of 
the head and neck (SCCHN) before patients undergo chemoradiotherapy and surgery. 26 
Additionally, a recent meta - analysis of 5 RCT suggests that TPF was associated with a 
robust 20% two year survival improvement over PF in this setting. 27 
This strategy of using a taxane and cisplatin combination is beginning to be tested in 
NPC. The combination of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 achieved a 
response rate of 63% in patients with metastatic NPC 28and when docetaxel has been 
combined with PF as induction chemotherapy for NPC patients in early phase 1 and 2 
trials, response rates approaching 100% have been seen . 29-32 
2.6 Radiation and NPC  
For many years, two -dimensional radiation therapy (2DRT) was considered the standard 
of care for patients with locally advanced NPC. Because 2DRT delivers substantial 
radiation doses to the parotid glands, permanent sev ere xerostomia is a common side 
effect.  Radiation doses as low as 15 Gy can result in permanent dysfunction of the major 
salivary glands. 46, 47 The permanent xerostomia or oral dryness often results in dysphasia 
and poor speech function as well as predisposes the patients to fissures, ulcers, dental 
caries, infection, and in worst cases, osteoradionecrosis. 48 49. 
In addition to the parotid glands, there are multiple critical normal tissues surrounding the 
nasopharynx, such as the optic structures, the tempo ral lobes and the brain stem, all of 
which are highly sensitive to radiation injury. The location of such structures precludes 
dose escalation with 2DRT.  Therefore, despite the addition of chemotherapy, the local 
control rates for the more advanced T3/T4 tumors were typically in the range of 40 -60% 
for 2DRT. 50, 51 52 38, 53 With the introduction of three - dimensional radiation therapy 
(3DRT) and more recently intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), superior tumor 
coverage was a chieved without exceeding the radiation tolerance to surrounding critical 
structures.54-56  Several studies have also compared IMRT to 3DRT plans and 
demonstrated that IMRT consistently improves tumor target volume coverage while 
simultaneously significantly reducing radiation exposure to normal structures, in 
particular the parotid glands, in  patients with locally advanced. 57-59 Since then, several 
centers have reported dec reased rates of xerostomia in nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) 
patients treated with IMRT60, 61, 62  There are emerging randomized trial data which 
confirm the advantage of IMRT in improving salivary gland flow when comp ared to 
conventional RT in early stage NPC patients. 63, 64 Besides the dosimetric advantages, 
 
IRB-15411  Page 5 of 56 5 December  2016  several centers also reported excellent early clinical outcomes in NPC for IMRT.  65 The 
most mature IMRT clinical data came from UCSF60 The 4 -year local progression -free 
and regional progression -free rates for 67 loco -regional advanced NPC patients were 
97% and 98%, respectively. An update with more patients (n=118), continued to show 
excellent locoregional control. 60  Several centers from Hong Kong also have shown 
similar findings. 61, 65 A recent exper ience from MSKCC reported a 91% locoregional 
control rate for IMRT treated NPC with a median follow -up of 35 months. 62 The RTOG 
completed a phase II trial of IMRT with or without chemotherapy for non -stage IVC 
NPC. Preliminary data showed decreased xerostomia when compared to historical RTOG 
trials where conventional RT was used. (Lee N, ASTRO procee dings 2007). Based on 
these results, we propose to use IMRT using the dose and fractionation schedule (70.2 Gy 
over 6.5 weeks) that has been pioneered at UCSF and validated in the Phase II RTOG 
study for the radiation treatment of these patients.   
2.7 Rationale  
Please see the background section for the scientific and clinical basis for this trial. 
Briefly, this trial is intended to ask several questions concerning a new treatment 
paradigm for patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. While many of the que stions 
posed will only be definitively answerable in larger controlled trials, there is a need to 
generate preliminary data supporting the below hypotheses before there will be adequate 
enthusiasm for dedicating the resources of a multi -institutional, mult i-national effort to 
ask the questions which would definitively address these questions.  
Hypothesis which this trial will address:  
Primary:  
 Sequential TPF=> chemoradiation will be associated with a higher complete response 
rate than the present US standar d of care for this group of patients with NPC, 
chemoradiation=> PF.  
Secondary:  
Sequential TPF=> chemoradiation for patients with NPC is more feasible than 
chemoradiation=> PF as administered by the US intergroup 0099 study as measured by 
the percentage of patients who are able to complete the planned total course of treatment.  
Induction TPF is more active than PF and better tolerated, as assessed by complete 
response rate after chemotherapy and incidence and severity of adverse events during 
chemotherapy.

4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
A protocol subject number will be assigned to every patient at the time of signing the 
informed consent. This number will be used to identify specific study information 
 
IRB-15411  Page 8 of 56 5 December  2016  throughout the trial. To meet the study cr iteria for enrollment, all patients will have their 
eligibility criteria confirmed (prior to the start of Cycle 1) and scanned into OnCore as a 
means for registration.  
 
5. TREATMENT PLAN  
5.1 Prophylactic Gastrostomy Feeding Tubes.  
Investigators  are STRONGLY E NCOURAGED  to have prophylactic gastrostomy 
feeding tubes placed  in patient  prior to initiation of treatment .  Chemoradiation for 
NPC patients is known to be associated with a high rate of severe locoregional  toxicity 
including severe oropharyngeal mucositi s, skin breakdown,  nausea, and presence of thick 
copious tenacious secretions, often complicated by oropharyngeal candidiasis and 
superficial ulceration and superficial bleeding  oral alimentation and hydration extremely 
difficult.   
5.2 Agent Administratio n 
Treatment will usually be administered on an outpatient basis.  Reported adverse events 
and potential risks for the chemotherapeutic agents are described in the Agent Adverse

5.3  Radiation therapy treatment plan:  
 
5.3.1 Concurrent cisplatin, and radiation:  
 
IRB-15411  Page 13 of 56 5 December  2016  Radiation Therapy : 70 Gy at 2.0 -2.12 Gy/fraction in 6.5 -7 weeks delivered with either 3 -
dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity modu lated radiotherapy 
(IMRT).  
 
5.3.2   Radiation Therapy  (See also Appendix B– Radiation  Quality Assurance form)  
Allowable treatment approaches include a 3DCRT approach or an IMRT.  
Dose specification:  
 Two different RT dose prescriptions are allowed:  
5.3.2.1.  Integrated dose prescription  
PTV 70 (planning target volume 70): [GTV (gross target volume) + margin]: will receive 
70 Gy at 2.12 Gy/fraction for 33 fractions.  
PTV high risk  [CTV high risk  (clinical target volume high risk) + margin]: the areas of high risk,  
sub-clinical disease will receive between 56 -59.4 Gy (at the discretion of the treating 
physician) at 1.7 -1.8 Gy/fraction for 33 fractions.  
PTV low risk  (CTV low risk  + margin): The area of low risk, subclinical disease, which is 
predominantly the uninvolve d low necks, will receive 5 2 Gy at 1. 57 Gy/fraction.  
Alternatively, the uninvolved low neck can be treated with a conventional AP or APPA 
supraclavicular field to a total dose of 4 4-50 Gy at 2Gy fraction for 2 2-25 fractions.  The 
dose is prescribed to a d epth of 3 cm from the anterior surface for the AP field and to the 
midplane for the APPA field. The junction between the IMRT or 3DCRT fields and the 
low-neck fields will be dependent on the institutional IMRT techniques; however, each 
institution is requi red to record the dosimetric details at the match -line to ensure dose 
homogeneity and to prevent overdosing of the spinal cord.  
5.3.2.2. Sequential dose prescription : 
PTV 70 (planning target volume 70): [GTV (gross target volume) + margin]: will receive 
70 Gy at 2.0 Gy/fraction for 35 fractions.  
PTV high risk  [CTV high risk  (clinical target volume high risk) + margin] ( optional ): the areas 
of high risk, sub -clinical disease will receive 60 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction for 30 fractions.  
PTV low risk  (CTV low risk  + margin ): The area of low risk, subclinical disease, which is 
predominantly the uninvolved low necks, will receive 50 Gy at 2 Gy/fraction in 25 
fractions.  Alternatively, the uninvolved low neck can be treated with a conventional AP 
or APPA supraclavicular field to a total dose of 46 -50 Gy at 2Gy fraction for 23 -25 
fractions.  The dose is prescribed to a depth of 3 cm from the anterior surface for the AP 
field and to the midplane for the APPA field. The junction between the IMRT or 3DCRT 
fields and the low -neck fi elds will be dependent on the institutional IMRT techniques; 
however, each institution is required to record the dosimetric details at the match -line to 
ensure dose homogeneity and to prevent overdosing of the spinal cord.  
5.3.2.3 Dose Compliance  
The repor ted dose for each PTV should include the prescribed dose, maximal point dose, 
mean dose, the % of PTV that receive > 110%, > 115% and < 93% of the prescribed 
dose.  
 
IRB-15411  Page 14 of 56 5 December  2016  All plans should be normalized so that > 95% of the PTV 70 receives the prescribed dose.  
In addition, no more than 20% of the PTV 70 will receive > 110 % and no more than 5% 
will receive > 115%  
RT will be given as once daily fraction. The first RT treatment should begin on Monday, 
Tuesday or Wednesday.   
5.3.2.4 Technical factors  
External beam equ ipment and beam delivery methods  
Megavoltage equipments capable of delivering 3DCRT or IMRT (either static or 
dynamic) are required.  
Treatment planning, imaging and localization requirement  
The immobilization device should include at least the head and ne ck.  It is strongly 
encouraged that the participation centers also utilize shoulder immobilization especially 
when comprehensive nodal IMRT is utilized.  
Treatment planning CT scan will be required to delineate the GTV, CTV and PTV.  
Other imaging studies such as MRI and PET -CT scans can aid in volume delineation.  
The treatment planning CT scan should be acquired with the patient immobilized in the 
same treatment position.  All tissue irradiated should be included in the treatment 
planning CT scan, which s hould be < 3 mm slice thickness through the regions 
containing the GTV.  Thicker slices (up to 5 mm) may be used for region above or below 
the GTV; however, thicker slices may compromise the image quality of the digitally 
reconstructed radiographs (DRR)  
Treatment planning/target volumes  
The definition of the target volumes should conform to the 1993 ICRU report #50;  
Gross target volume (GTV):  All known gross disease determined from clinical (including 
endoscopic) and imaging findings.  Grossly involved node s are defined as any lymph 
node > 1 cm on CT or MRI in the minimal cross -sectional diameter, any nodes with 
increased metabolic uptake on FDG PET scan, any node with central necrosis and/or 
radiographic evidence of extracapsular extension regardless of siz e. 
Clinical target volume (CTV):  
CTV 70: For grossly positive node, a margin of 5 mm should be added circumferentially to 
account for microscopic extracapsular extension  
CTV high risk : should include all regions deemed to be at high risk for microscopic dis ease, 
all potential routes of spread, and the high risk nodal regions.  
CTV low risk : nodal regions at low risk for microscopic involvement.  This usually 
constitutes the clinically and radiographically low -neck nodes.  
Planning target volume : A margin shoul d be used to account for intrafraction and 
interfraction set up variability.  The average recommended PTV margin is 5 mm; 
however, it will depend on the accuracy of treatment set up and immobilization at each 
individual treatment site.  
5.3.2.5  Treatment Pl an 
 
IRB-15411  Page 15 of 56 5 December  2016  Treatment plan will be based on the analysis of the volumetric dose, including dose -
volume histogram (DVH) analyses of the PTVs and critical normal structures.  A 3D or 
an “inverse” planning using computerized optimization should be used.  The treatment  
aim will be the delivery of radiation to the PTVs and the exclusion of non -involved 
tissues. HETEROGENEITY CORRECTION SHOULD BE USED . 
5.3.2.6 Critical structures  
Surrounding critical normal structures, including the brainstem, temporal lobes (if the 
tumor  is near the skull base), spinal cords, optic nerves, eyes, optic chiasm, parotid 
glands, the inner and middle ears (if the targets are near by), oral cavity, mandible and 
glottic larynx should be outlined.  If there is grossly involved tumor in the low ne ck, then 
the brachial plexus should also be delineated.  
Unspecified tissues, defined as the tissues within the skin, subtracted all target volumes 
and delineated normal tissues, should also be taken into account of the treatment planning 
and evaluation.  N o more than 5% of the unspecified tissue can receive > 70 Gy and no 
more than 1% or 1 cc of this tissue can receive >= 77 Gy.  Participants are strongly 
encouraged to remain within these limits.  
Dose constraints for certain normal tissues are shown in the following table.  
Table 1: Required critical structure dose constraints  
Structure  Maximal dose 
(Gy)  
Brainstem  54 
Spinal cord  45 
Optic nerves  54 
Optic chiasms  54 
Eyes  50 
Mandible  70 
Brachial plexus  66 
Table  2: Suggested normal structure dose constrai nts 
Structure  Mean dose (Gy)  
Parotid  < 26 for 1 gland or < 30 for 50% of 1 gland or < 20 
for 20 cc volume of both glands  
Oral cavity  < 40 if tumors outside the oral cavity  
Inner/middle ear  < 45 or < 5% volume receives > 55 Gy  
Glottic larynx  < 50 for tu mor outside the larynx and hypopharynx  
Esophagus/post cricoid 
pharynx  < 50 for tumor outside the larynx and hypopharynx  
 
5.3.2.7 Documentation requirements : 
 
IRB-15411  Page 16 of 56 5 December  2016  Weekly verification of orthogonal films through the treatment isocenter is required.  If 
the IMRT  or 3DCRT fields are matched to an AP supraclavicular field, then the 
supraclavicular field should also be included during weekly portal verification. Appendix 
B is the radiation quality assurance form that should be submitted at the completion 
of radiatio n therapy . 
5.3.2.8 Radiation adverse events and allowed interruption  
Radiation adverse events will be graded as per CTCAE v4.0.  RT interruption may be 
necessary due to severe acute RT - related reactions such as severe skin or mucosal 
reaction or any othe r acute complications.  Interruptions will be left at the discretion of 
the treating physicians but strongly discouraged.  The cause of interruption should be 
recorded.   
Placement of feeding gastrostomy tube may be necessary for nutritional support in thi s 
frail population. The date and reason for placement of a feeding gastrostomy tube (either 
prophylactic in preparation for RT or for active nutritional support due to significant 
weight loss before or during RT) should also be recorded.  The duration of f eeding tube 
dependence after completion of RT should also be recorded.  
5.4 Duration of Follow Up  
Patients will be followed for a minimum of 1 year after removal from study or until 
death, whichever occurs first.  Patients removed from study for unacceptabl e adverse 
events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  
Patients will be seen quarterly in follow - up the first year after completion of radiation, 
and subsequently per local standards of care.  
 
 
6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFIC ATIONS  
Doses will be modified in case of severe hematological and/or non -hematological 
toxicities. Dose adjustments are to be made according to the CTCAE v 4  system showing 
the greatest degree of toxicity. Toxicities will be graded using the CTCAE v 4 criteria.  
 6.1 DOCETAXEL dose modifications  
 
Febrile Neutropenia or Documented Neutropenic Infection  
Adverse event  Action to be taken for subsequent cycles  
• Febrile 
neutropenia  
• Documented 
infection   The first episode of febrile neutropenia or document ed grade 3 /4 
neutropenia with documented infection will result in the addition of 
GM-CSF or G -CSF to all subsequent cycles .  
If there is a second episode, the patient will remain on  
Ciprofloxacin and GM -CSF or G -CSF and additionally, during the  
subseque nt cycles, Docetaxel dose will be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m²

3. If ANC < 1.5 x 109/L, then consider addition of G -CSF or GM -
CSF for 7 days  
• On day 35, perform complete blood count with differenti al  
• Proceed with full dose chemotherapy if ANC > 1.5  
• And consider use of GM -CSF or G -CSF in remaining cycles  
4. If there is no recovery by day 35, (ANC < 1.5 x 109/L), the 
patient will go off TPF chemotherapy

3. If plt  75,000 -<100,000, dose reduction  of docetaxel  from 75 to 
60 mg/m2 for all subsequent cycles of TPF. 
4. if  plt < 75,000, patient will go off TPF chemotherapy  
 
If patient has recurrent thrombocytopenia after docetaxel 
reduction to 60 mg/m2 without recovery to 75,000 by day 28 of 
subsequent cycles, patient  will go off TPF therapy  
 
Action Taken for other Docetaxel AEs  
Mucositis oral   
 If mucositis oral  is present on day 1 of any cycle, treatment should be withheld until 
resolved.  
 If Grade 3/4 mucositis oral  occurs at any time, the dose of Docetaxel should  be reduced 
for subsequent cycles, Docetaxel dose will be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m²  
 
Peripheral  motor Neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy  
Docetaxel dose will be reduced from 75 to 60 mg/m² for Grade 2 neuropathies without 
treatment delay.  
 
IRB-15411  Page 18 of 56 5 December  2016  Treatment should be discontinued for Grade 3/4 neuropathies.  
 
Dermatological/ Skin  
Grade 0,  1, and 2 : no change  
Grade 3: Delay until < grade 1 and retreat with a dose reduction of Docetaxel from 75 to 
60 mg/m². If no recovery to < grade 1 within 2 weeks del ay, patient will go off protocol 
therapy.  
Grade 4 : The patient will go off chemotherapy.  
 
Nausea and/or vomiting  
Prophylactic antiemetic regimen with 5 -HT3 antagonist should be administered from the 
first cycle. In addition, the corticosteroids used duri ng 3 days for the prophylaxis of fluid 
retention should also reduce the incidence and severity of emesis.  
Patients with nausea and vomiting despite these measures may be treated with another 
antiemetic regimen (i.e. high dose metochlopramide) as appropria te. 
 
Bilirubin and Impaired liver function:  
In the event that bilirubin levels are abnormal during study, the next cycle will be delayed 
by a maximum of 2 weeks. If no recovery, the patient should be taken off chemotherapy.  
In the event that AST and/or A LT and/or alkaline phosphatase levels are abnormal in the 
absence of progressive disease, the following dose modifications will apply:

Bilirubin : Docetaxel should not be administered to patients with serum total bilirubin 
>ULN.  If serum total bilirubin is >ULN on treatment day, hold Docetaxel until serum 
total bilirubin is ≤ ULN (maximum 2 weeks), then re -treat at a reduced dose.  
**Reduced doses of Docetaxel will be at 60mg/m2. After Docetaxel is dose is reduced, 
there will be no re -escalation. There will be only one dose reduction.  
#  If alkaline phosphatase is clinically related to local bone erosion, for purposes of 
docetaxel dose reductions, consider alk phos < ULN, i.e. dose adjust based on other 
clinical and lab parameters . 
 
6.2 CISPLATIN  and CARBOPLATIN dose modifications:  
Cisplatin dose reductions during TPF  for hematologic adverse events:  
There will be no planned CDDP dose reductions for ANC or platelet AEs. See Docetaxel 
section for dose reduction and TPF delay and dis continuance parameters for ANC and 
platelet AEs.  Note that after one reduction in docetaxel for hematological AEs, high 
grade persistent or recurrent AEs will result in discontinuance of TPF per the algorithm 
outlined for docetaxel dose modification.  
Cisplatin dose reductions during TPF  for non -hematologic adverse events:  
 
CDDP dose levels during TPF

IRB-15411  Page 20 of 56 5 December  2016  60 mg/m2  75 mg/m2  
 
Peripheral motor Neuropathy  and peripheral sensory neuropathy   
Grade 0,  1: no change  
Grade > 2: Carboplatin may be subs tituted for Cisplatin  
Ototoxicity  
Cisplatin is known to cause high frequency hearing loss. If grade 1 or 2 hearing loss 
occurs, the risk of additional hearing loss versus the potential benefit of continuing 
Cisplatin chemotherapy should be made. Grade 3 and 4 hearing loss is an indication to 
discontinue the drug.  In case of grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity, Carboplatin may be used to 
replace Cisplatin .  
Creatinine  
Grade 1 ( creatinine <1.5): no CDDP dose change  
Grade 2 ( creatinine > 1.5 -3):   
first incidence d ecrease one dose level, consider change to carboplatin.  
second incidence: switch to carboplatin.  
Grade 3 -4 ( creatinine >3): discontinue CDDP, switch to carboplatin.  
 
All other non - hematological  AEs attributable to CDDP:  
Grade 1 -2 : no dose change of CD DP 
Grade 3 -4:Hold TPF up to one week for resolution of AEs to grade 2 or less, then re - 
treat with one level dose reduction of CDDP.  If AEs not resolved to grade 2 after 1 
week, discontinue TPF treatment  
 
Carboplatin dose reductions during TPF   
Hematologi cal AEs during TPF  : 
There will be no planned Carboplatin dose reductions for  ANC or platelet AEs. See 
Docetaxel section for dose reduction and TPF delay and discontinuance parameters for 
ANC and platelet AEs.   Note that after one reduction in docetaxel f or hematological AEs, 
high grade persistent or recurrent AEs will result in discontinuance of  TPF per the 
algorithm outlined for docetaxel dose modification.  
 
All other non - hematological  AEs attributable to carboplatin : 
Grade 1 -2 : No dose change of car boplatin or TPF delay.  
Grade 3 -4: Hold TPF up to one week for resolution of AEs to grade 2 or less, then re - 
treat with one level dose reduction.  If AEs not resolved  to grade 2 after 1 week, 
discontinue TPF treatment.

Maximum GFR value is 125 mL/min AND maximum Carboplatin AUC 1.5 = 225 mg.  
 
CDDP  or Carboplatin  must not be administered  concurrently with radiation until the ANC ≥ 
1,000 and platelets are ≥ 100,000. If not, delay one week. If the pa tient still has not recovered,  
continue to hold on a week by week basis until the above criteria are met, then resume dosing 
according to the below table .

There will  be no reduction below dose level -2. If a patient is already at dose level -2 and 
experiences AEs as defined above, discontinue CDDP or carboplatin.  
 
Cisplatin  or carboplatin dose reductions during concurrent radiation for non - 
hematological toxicities:  
Concurrent platinum  and radiation for patients with nasopharyngeal cancer is known to 
be associated with a high rate of severe locoregional toxicity including severe mucositis  
oral, skin breakdown,  nausea, and presence of thick copious tenacious secretions , often 
complicated by oropharyngeal candidiasis and superficial ulceration and  superficial 
bleeding.  Patients commonly are not able to adequately aliment or hydrate themselves 
orally during chemoradiation and for several weeks afterwards.  Every effort should be 
made to manage patient symptomatically using IV hydration, and clinicians are 
STRONGLY ENCOURAGED to have prophylactic gastrostomy feeding tubes placed 
prior to initiation of treatment.   Severe mucositis oral and skin breakdown in the radiation 
field  based on ulceration and superficial bleeding should not be considered inherently 
dose limiting.  
Radiation associated mucositis  oral  or dermatitis:  
Grade 4: hold CDDP or carboplatin until resolution to grade 3 then dose reduce by one 
dose level. Ther e will be no dose reductions below dose level minus 2.  In  the case that a 
 
IRB-15411  Page 22 of 56 5 December  2016  patient is being treated at dose level minus 2, once AEs are grade 3 or less, the patient 
should be treated again at dose level minus 2.  
Peripheral motor Neuropathy and peripheral sensory neuropathy  
Grade 0,  1: no change  
Grade > 2: Carboplatin may be substituted for Cisplatin  Should a new grade > 2 
peripheral motor/sensory neuropathy develop on carboplatin, hold carboplatin until 
resolution to grade 2 then dose reduce 1 level.  
Ototoxicity  
Cisplatin is known to cause high frequency hearing loss. If grade 1 or 2 hearing loss 
occurs, the risk of additional hearing loss versus the p otential benefit of continuing 
cisplatin chemotherapy should be made. Grade 3 and 4 hearing loss is an i ndication to 
discontinue the drug.  In case of grade 3 or 4 ototoxicity, c arboplatin may be used to 
replace cisplatin . Should  new grade > 2 ototoxicity develop on carboplatin, hold 
carboplatin until resolution to grade 2 then dose reduce 1 level.  
Creatini ne 
Grade 1 (creatinine <1.5): no CDDP dose change  
Grade 2 (creatinine > 1.5 -3):   
First incidence decrease one dose level, consider change to carboplatin.  
Second incidence: switch to carboplatin.  
Grade 3 -4 (creatinine >3): discontinue CDDP, switch to carb oplatin.  Should a new grade 
> 2 creatinine develop on carboplatin, hold carboplatin until resolution to grade 2 then 
dose reduce 1 level.  
Non- hematological  AEs attributable to CDDP  or carboplatin excluding AEs 
discussed above : 
Grade 1 -2 : No dose change of CDDP or carboplatin.  
Grade 3 -4: Hold  CDDP or carboplatin until resolution of AEs to grade 2 or less, then 
dose reduce by one dose level. There will be no dose reductions below dose level minus 
2.  In  the case that a patient is being treated at dose le vel minus 2, once AEs resolve to 
grade 2 or less, the patient should be treated again at dose level minus 2.

Hematological AEs during TPF : 
There will be no planned  5-FU dose reductions for  ANC or platelet AEs. See Docetaxel 
section for dose reduction and TPF delay and discontinuance parameters for ANC and 
platelet AEs.   Note tha t after one reduction in docetaxel for hematological AEs, high 
 
IRB-15411  Page 23 of 56 5 December  2016  grade persistent or recurrent AEs will result in discontinuance of  TPF per the algorithm 
outlined for docetaxel dose modification.  
Non- Hematological AEs during TPF : 
Mucositis  oral  or dermati tis 
Grade 3 lasting more than 96 hours or grade 4 : Dose reduce one level.  
Diarrhea  
In the case of severe diarrhea, octreotide is recommended. If the patient has a significant 
diarrhea occurrence again (> 3 loose stools/24 hr), the patient should be trea ted 
prophylactically in the subsequent cycles with 2 tablets of loperamide or diphenoxylate in 
addition to 1 or 2 tablets after each loose stool. The maximum daily dose of Loperamide 
is 16mg and Diphenoxylate is 20mg/day.  
Grade 4 diarrhea, or grade 3 diar rhea lasting > 7 days despite the prophylactic treatment : 
dose reduce one level.   
All other non - hematological  AEs attributable to 5-FU: 
Grade 1 -2 : No dose change of 5 -FU or TPF delay.  
Grade 3 -4: Hold TPF up to one week for resolution of AEs to grade 2 o r less, then re - 
treat with one dose level reduction .  If AEs not resolved to grade 2 after 1 week, 
discontinue TPF treatment.

8. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
A list of the adverse events and potential risks associated with the commercial agents 
administered in this study can be found in Section 7.1.  
8.1 Commercial Agent(s)  
8.1.1 Docetaxel - (Commercially available. Please  refer to the package insert for further 
information)  
Other Names Taxotere, RP 56976, NSC #628503. Classification: Antimicrotubule agent.  
 
IRB-15411  Page 26 of 56 5 December  2016  Mode of Action: Docetaxel, a semisynthetic analog of paclitaxel, pro motes the assembly 
of tubulin and inhibits microtubule depolymerization. Bundles of microtubules 
accumulate and  interfere with cell division.  
 
Storage and Stability:  
Docetaxel infusion solution, if stored between 2 and 25ºC (36 and 77ºF) is stable  
for 4 ho urs. Fully prepared docetaxel infusion solution (in either 0.9% Sodium  
Chloride solution or 5% Dextrose solution) should be used within 4 hours  (including the 
administration time).  Store between 2 and 25°C (36 and 77ºF). Retain in the original package 
toprotect from bright light. Freezing does not adversely affect the product.  
 
Preparation:  
Docetaxel is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and, as with other potentially toxic  compounds, caution 
should be exercised when handling and preparing docetaxel  solutions. The  use of gloves is 
recommended. If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion 
should come into contact with the skin, immediately and thoroughly wash with soap and water. 
If docetaxel concentrate, initial diluted solutio n, or final dilution for infusion should come into 
contact with mucosa, immed iately and thoroughly wash with water. Docetaxel for Injection 
Concentrate requires two dilutions prior to administration.  
Please follow the preparation instructions provided belo w. Note: Both the docetaxel for Injection 
Concentrate and the diluent vials contain an overfill.  
A. Preparation of the Initial Diluted Solution  
1. Gather the appropriate number of vials of docetaxel for Injection  
Concentrate and diluent (13% Ethanol in Wat er for Injection). If the vials were refrigerated, 
allow them to stand at room temperature for approximately 5 minutes.  
2. Aseptically withdraw the contents of the appropriate diluent vial into a  syringe and transfer it 
to the appropriate vial of docetaxel  for Injection Concentrate. If the procedure is followed as 
described, an initial diluted solution of 10mg docetaxel/mL will result.  
3. Mix the initial diluted solution by repeated inversions for at least 45  seconds to assure full 
mixture of the concentrat e and diluent. Do not shake.  
4. The initial diluted docetaxel solution (10 mg docetaxel/mL) should be  clear; however, there 
may be some foam on top of the solution due to the polysorbate 80. Allow the solution to stand 
for a few minutes to allow any foam t o dissipate. It is not required that all foam dissipate prior to 
continuing the preparation process. The initial diluted solution may be used immediately or 
stored either in the refrigerator or at room temperature for a maximum of 8 hours.  
B. Preparation o f the Final Dilution for Infusion  
1. Aseptically withdraw the required amount of initial diluted docetaxel  solution (10mg 
docetaxel/mL) with a calibrated syringe and inject into an infusion bag or bottle of either 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride solution or 5% Dextro se solution to produce a final concentration of 0.3 to 
0.74mg/mL. Thoroughly mix the infusion by manual rotation.  
 
IRB-15411  Page 27 of 56 5 December  2016  2. As with all parenteral products, docetaxel should be inspected visually  for particulate matter or 
discoloration prior to administration whe never the solution and container permit. If the docetaxel 
for Injection, initial diluted solution, or final dilution for infusion is not clear or appears to have 
precipitation, these should be discarded. The final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be 
administered intravenously as per protocol under ambient room temperature and lighting 
conditions. Contact of the docetaxel concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or  
devices used to prepare solutions for infusion is not recommended. In order to minimiz e patient 
exposure to the plasticizer DEHP (di -2-ethylhexyl phthalate), which may be leached from PVC 
infusion bags or sets, the final docetaxel dilution for infusion should be stored in bottles (glass,  
polypropylene) or plastic bags (polypropylene, polyol efin) and administered through 
polyethylene -lined administration sets.  
Route of Administration:  
Docetaxel will be administered as a 60 minute infusion in saline or D5W through  an 
administration set that does not contain phthalate plasticizers along the flu id pathway that is 
connected to the patient’s vascular access catheter.  
Incompatibilities:  
Contact of the undiluted concentrate with plasticized PVC equipment or devices  used to prepare 
solutions for infusion should be avoided. Diluted docetaxel  solution s hould be stored in bottles 
(glass, polypropylene) or plastic bags  (polypropylene, polyolefin) and administered through 
polyethylene -lined  administration sets.  The metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the 
concomitant administration  of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome 
P450 3A4,  such as cyclosporine, terfenadine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, and  troleandomycin. 
Caution should be exercised with these drugs when treating  patients receiving docetaxel as there 
is a potential f or a significant interaction.  
Availability:  
Docetaxel (Taxotere®) is a commercial drug. The combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5 -FU

mechanisms include chelation of DNA and binding to cell membranes there by 
stimulating immune mechanisms.  
 
Storage and Stability:  
Intact vials of cisplatin are stored at room temperature. Solutions diluted with  sodium 
chloride or dextrose are stable for up to 72 hours at room temperature. Due  to the risk of 
precipitation, cisp latin solutions should not be refrigerated.  
Preparation:  
The desired dose of cisplatin is diluted with 250 - 1000 ml of saline and/or dextrose  
solution. Varying concentrations of 0.225 - 5% sodium chloride and 5% dextrose  may be 
used. To maintain stability  of cisplatin, a final sodium chloride  concentration of at least 
0.2% is recommended.  
Route of Administration:  
Cisplatin should be administered as a 1 mg/ml intravenous infusion. Antiemetics should 
be given in conjunction with Cisplatin.  Cisplatin is high ly emetogenic. A suggested

Available in 500 mg/10 mL ampules and vials,  and 1 gm/ 20 ml. For further information, 
see package insert.  
Administration:  5- Fluorouracil will be administered as a continuous IV infusion during 
induction chemotherapy following the completion of bevacizumab and docetaxel 
administration. 5 -Fluoroura cil may be  begin concurrently  with the cisplatin or 
carboplatin infusion.  31 
Drug Interactions  
 
IRB-15411  Page 31 of 56 5 December  2016  Cimetidine: Because cimetidine can decrease the clearance of 5 -FU, patients should not  
enter on this study until the ci metidine is discontinued. Ranitidine or a drug from another  
anti-ulcer class can be substituted for cimetidine, as necessary.   
Allopurinol: Oxypurinol, a metabolite of allopurinol, can potentially interfere with 5 -FU 
anabolism via orotate phosphoribosyltra nsferase. Although this was originally used as a  
strategy to protect normal tissues from 5 -FU-associated toxicity, further laboratory 
studies  suggested possible antagonism of the anticancer activity of 5 -FU in some tumor 
models. If a  patient is receiving a llopurinol, the need for taking this medicine should be 
ascertained. If possible, allopurinol should be discontinued prior to starting on this 
regimen, and another agent substituted for it.  
 
Storage  
Stable for prolonged periods of time at room temperature,  if protected from light. Inspect 
for precipitate; if apparent, agitate vial vigorously or gently heat to not greater than 140°F 
in a water bath. Do not allow to freeze.  
 
 
IRB-15411  Page 32 of 56 5 December  2016  9.  STUDY CALENDAR  
Baseline evaluations are to be conducted within 1 week prior to st art of protocol therapy.  Scans 
and x -rays must be done within 1 month prior to the start of therapy.  In the event that the

IRB-15411  Page 34 of 56 5 December  2016  10. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
10.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, patients should be reevaluated for response after TPF and 
3, 12, and 24 months after the completion of r adiation. The primary endpoint of response 
assessment will be based on  MRI and or CT imaging and physical exam using a 
modification of the RECIST criteria (see below).While other modalities for response 
assessment (e.g. PET scanning, serum tumor markers) will be collected and may be used 
for clinical planning, they will not be used to evaluate the primary endpoint.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
Committee [ JNCI  92(3):205 -216, 2000].  Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
10.1.1 Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity .  All patients will be evaluable  for toxicity from the time of their 
first treatment . 
Evaluable for objective response.   Only those patients who have measurable disease 
present at baseline, have received at least one cycle of TPF, and have had their disease re -
evaluated will be consider ed evaluable for response.   
 
10.1.2 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease .  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm with 
conventional techniques (CT, MRI , x-ray) or as >10 mm with spiral CT scan.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Non-measurable disease .  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <20 mm wit h conventional techniques or <10 mm using spiral CT 
scan), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, 
ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast 
disease, abdominal masses (not  followed by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all non -
measurable.  
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and 10 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target 
lesions  and re corded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the 
basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the longest 
diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum 
LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor response.  
Non-target lesions .  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable 
lesions over and above the 10 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions 
 
IRB-15411  Page 35 of 56 5 December  2016  and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, 
but the presence or absence of each should be noted t hroughout follow -up.  
 
10.1.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or 
calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the 
beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the 
treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have 
been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.  
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpa ble lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, 
documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, 
is recommended.  
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly define d and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or 
less in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction a lgorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis.  Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific protocols.  
Ultrasound (US)   When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions.  It is, however, a possible 
alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules.  US might also be useful to confirm the complete 
disappearance of superficial  lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation has not yet been fully and widely validated.  Their uses in this specific context 
require sophisticated equipment and a high level of expertise that may only be available 
in some centers.  Therefore, the utilization of such techniques for objective tumor 
response should be restricted to validation purposes in reference centers. However, such 
techniques may be useful t o confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are 
obtained.  
Tumor markers   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered 
in complet e clinical response.  Specific additional criteria for standardized usage of 
prostate -specific antigen (PSA) and CA -125 response in support of clinical trials are 
being developed.  
Cytology, Histology   These techniques can be used to differentiate between p artial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor 
types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
 
IRB-15411  Page 36 of 56 5 December  2016  The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that app ears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
10.1.4 Response Criteria  
10.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) 
of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD  
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the 
appearance of one or more new lesions  
Stable Disease (SD) : Neither sufficie nt shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
10.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all non -target lesions and nor malization of 
tumor marker level  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize 
for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Incomplete Response/  
Stable Disease (SD) : Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
Progressive Disease (PD) : Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions  
Although a clear progression of “non -target” les ions only is exceptional, the opinion of 
the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression status 
should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal Investigator).  
 
10.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Respo nse 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  This is a modifi cation of 
RECIST in that confirmatory  imaging is not practical at the 3, 12, and 24 month imaging 
intervals, does not contribute to  the sense of “ best response” achieved, and is not a 
primary endpoint of the study.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as “ symptomatic 
deterioration” .  Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
10.1.5 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response :  The duration of  overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference 
for progressive disease the smalle st measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.  
Duration of stable disease :  Stable  disease is measured from the start of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started.  
10.1.6 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression – free survival will be calcu lated as the interval between date of registration 
and  date of documented cancer progression or death, whichever occurs first . 
10.1.7 Response Review  
 All radiological images used for response assessment must be available to the 
principal investigator for  response assessment review.  For patients imaged at Stanford 
Cancer center/ Stanford Hospital, images available within the Hospital radiology system 
fulfill this criterion.  For images acquired outside of the Stanford system, images must be 
transferred to  a separate  , portable medium (i.e. CD or DVD), labeled with the patient’s 
anonymized Oncore protocol registration number and scan date, and sent to the clinical 
trial coordinator at the address on the first page of this protocol.  
 
11. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
11.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
IRB-15411  Page 38 of 56 5 December  2016  The primary endpoint for this trial will be progression free survival 2 years following  
chemoradiotherapy.  
The US intergroup CR rate to chemoradiotherapy was 49%, using SWOG response 
criteria that did not include PET imag ing. 5  However, many have argued that this CR rate 
was atypically low when compared to  other studies conducted primarily in Asia .  
Because the CR rates reported in many other studies are so high and because PFS r ates at 
one year in many RCTS  of chemoradiaton in NPC are so high, 5-7, 11 we have decided to 
make PFS at 2 years following the end of chemoradiation as the primary endpoint of this 
study. In the 4 studies referenc ed above, the average 2 year PFS for the superior arm was 
0.7 and no single study achieved a PFS greater than 0.85.  Therefore we will evaluate 40 
patients in a single stage design for progression free survival at 2 years post radiation, 
which will give an  alpha of 0.1 and a power of 0.9  to distinguish a 2 year PFS of 0.88 
from 0.7 . 
It is not feasible with the accrual rate planned to introduce an early stopping rule for a 
PFS at 2 years.  Therefore, in order to avoid accruing up to 40 patients to a study that is 
unlikely to be of interest, we will have an early stopping rule based on RECIST 
determined CR rates.  If there are less  than 10 CRs in the first 18 patients, we would stop 
the trial.  If the trial goes to the second stage, the treatment will be co nsidered worthy of 
further study if 33 or more of the 40 patients are progression -free at 2 years.  
 
 
11.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
18-40 evaluable patients. 2 -4 per month. All patients who are not evaluable will be 
replaced. Any patient who starts treatmen t with TPF will be considered evaluable for 
response.  
11.3 Stratification Factors  
No stratification  
11.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:  
 1. Progression free survival and overall survival will be estimated according to the 
methods of Kaplan and Meier.  
      2. Rates of adverse events will be analyzed as follows:  
The acceptable incidence of AEs resulting in protocol treatment discontinuance is 3% or 
less, and the unacceptable rate is 15% or greater. The rates of AEs resulting in protocol 
treatment disconti nuation will be estimated using a binomial distribution along with their 
associated 95% confidence intervals. Only adverse events assessed  definitely, probably, 
or possibly related to protocol treatment will be considered. 40 evaluable patients will be 
able to distinguish between the above null and alternative hypothesis with and  alpha 
error  of .03 and power .87.  
11.5 Reporting  
11.5.1 Evaluation of toxicity.  All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of 
their first treatment . 
 
IRB-15411  Page 39 of 56 5 December  2016  11.5.2 Evaluation of response.  All patients who receive one cycle of TPF will be 
considered evaluable for response.  Response categories will be: 1) complete response, 2) 
partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).

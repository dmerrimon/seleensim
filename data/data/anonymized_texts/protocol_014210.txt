Since our 2018 study, Carrot Inc. (Redwood City, CA, USA)  has made improvements to 
the CO breath sensor (the Pivot Breath Sensor ). The Pivot Breath Sensor consists of a  
stand -alone  handheld breath sensor  to meas ure CO in exhaled breath  with a display screen 
to show results . This breath sensor  can optionally be used with  a smartphone app  (Pivot 
Application ). The Pivot Breath Sensor  is intended to be used as a personal and mobile 
product and to be available ‘over the counter’.  
This study will  assess the performance  of the Pivot Breath Sensor  relative to the Micro+™ 
Smokerlyzer® . 
2.2 STUDY  RATIONALE  
Performance: We aim to non -invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the 
exhaled breath of study subjects using two different types of measurement devices.  We 
will assess the correlation between the measured CO levels (in ppm) of the study CO 
breath sensor (Pivot Breath Sensor; Carrot  Inc.; Redwood City, CA, USA ) completed by a 
lay user with no personal instruction (using labeling only) and the predicate CO breath 
sensor ( Micro+™ Smokerlyzer® ; Bedfont Scientific Ltd; Harrietsham, UK ) administered 
by a person trained to instruct users o n submitting a sample with the device . 
2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS

 Known Potential Benefits  
While we do not anticipate that subjects will receive any benefit from their 
participation in this study, it is possible th at some subjects may experience an 
increased awareness of their smoking behavior.  
 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Given the non -invasive nature of the breath sampling and the data collection, there are 
no anticipated risks to subject safety.  Study  staff will be w ith subjects and monitoring 
their use of the study devices for the duration of the study. S ubjects are not asked to 
change their smoking behavior.  No medical decisions are made based on study data.  
 OBJECTIVES  
We aim to non -invasively measure carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the exhaled breath of 
study subjects using two different types of measurement devices.  We will assess the

 Indications for Use  
The Micro+™ Smokerlyzer® is a Breath Carbon Monoxide Monitor intended for 
multi -patient use by healthcare professionals in smoking cessation programs and as an 
indicat or of Carbon Monoxide poisoning in healthcare environments.  
6.4 GASTROLYZER®,  HYDROGEN MEASURING DEVICE ® 
Gastrolyzer ® is a breath hydrogen monitor intended for multi -patient use by healthcare 
professionals in as an indicator of hydrogen produced gastrointestin al microbe based on 
diet of person and can indicate disorders such as lactose intolerance  and carbohydrate 
breakdown deficiency. While the Gastrolyzer is not a comparator device, hydrogen may 
confound CO readings from CO breath sensors, so a measurement during the study is 
desired.  
6.5 PIVOT BREATH SENSOR  SUBMITTING A BREATH SAMPLE  (SPECIFIC STEPS ) 
Submitting a breath sample involves the following steps . Instructions can be accessed in 
multiple locations including the Pivot Sensor’s display screen, in the User Manual, Quick 
Start Guide , and on the packaging .  
1. User presses any button to turn on the Pivot Breath Sensor.  
2. User presses and holds the center  button on the Pivot Breath Sensor until the sensor  
beeps once . 
3. User takes a deep breath in and holds their breath for 10 seconds.  
4. After about 10 seconds, the device beeps 3 times , and the user then will exhale slowly 
until the sensor vibrates  at 12 second s. 
5. The user’s CO level will display on the sensor’s screen.  
A properly submitted breath sample is defined  as one that initiates after the third beep 
prompt and is of at least 6 seconds duration.  Breath sensor hardware and firmware is 
capable of detecting when a breath sample submission starts and stops.  
The CO Log screen in the Pivot Breath Sensor  provides the CO (ppm) value for properly 
submitted breath sample s, and provides a descriptive error message for improperly 
submitted breath samples (i.e. “Error:  breath sample too late”).   

Carrot Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL  10 The computation of concentration of CO (ppm) is performed within  the Pivot  Breath 
Sensor firmware and the data (CO ppm concentration, time and date) are stored in the 
Pivot  Breath Sensor memory.   
6.6 CO  LOG 
The CO Log  can be accessed from the Pivot Breath Sensor’s display screen and shows  the 
most recent exhaled breath CO value in ppm at the top of the screen.  The user can view 
previous values by scrolling within the log  (Figure 3).   
Values are color coded and can be  interpreted by the user with help from the labeling  
(Figure 4).

7.12 IRB  OVERSIGHT  
This study will be conducted under IRB oversight.  
 STUDY PROCEDURE  
Each study session will have the following format:  
1. Introduction  and informed consent  
2. Device Setup  
3. Breath Sampling and Interpretation  
4. Rating Scales  
At the beginning of the  60-minute  test session, subjects will have ample time to read the 
Informed Consent Form (ICF) and the opportunity to ask questions. The subject will sign the 
ICF before participating in this study.  Once signing the ICF, the subject will be given a 
unique  identifier  to protect subject privacy. Subjects may choose to exit the study at any 
time.  They are not required to complete the study if they choose to stop . 
Study participants will self -train on how to use the study device using only the available 
study Pivot Brea th Sensor device labeling, including product packaging, Quick Start Guide, a 
technical support line (phone number provided in p ackaging/Quick Start Guide ), and User 
Manual.  These labeling materials will be available to study participants at any point duri ng 
the study. Study participants will not be asked to read instructions or use any of the forms of 
training available . Study personnel will refrain from answering questions on how to use the 
study device during the study.  
After completing baseline questio ns (age, gender, ethnicity, pregnancy status, smoking 
history and behavior, use of smoking cessation medications, issues with vision/hearing, 
smartphone type,  attitudes towards smoking, past use of carbon monoxide breath sensors) 
participants will be provi ded the Pivot Breath Sensor package. They will be instructed to start 
using the product. Upon initiating use of the product, participants are automatically taken 
through a self -training that is delivered through the labeling and device. Study staff will 
observe but  not deliver any components of this training. Completing self -training includes 
the successful completion of at least one breath sample.  Participants will be asked how that 
went for them, and allowed to repeat a breath sample until they indicate t hey are satisfied 
with their breath sample Once the study participant has completed the self -training on the 
Pivot Breath Sensor, they will be asked to interpret their own breath sample results as well as 
hypothetical breath sample results. T hey will be as ked if they feel ready to proceed with 
submitting a breath sample.  If a participant indicates they do not feel ready, they will be 
asked to do what they would normally do at home to prepare to use the product and to let the 
test administrator know when th ey are ready to submit a  breath  sample.  
When the participant indicates readiness to provide a breath sample, he/she will be instructed 
to proceed to provide one breath sample using the study device. This is the performance 
breath sample. Participants will be asked how that went for them, and allowed to repeat a 

Carrot Inc.   
 Document No.   
 
CONFIDENTIAL  17 breath sample until they indicate they are satisfied with their breath sample. After providing 
this breath sample, the subject will be asked to interpret his/her breath sample result . This 
will be fo llowed by a breath sample using the predicate device. A test administrator will 
instruct the participant how to give this breath sample before proceeding, and will direct the 
participant through the breath sample in real -time. This will be followed by a br eath sample 
using a breath sensor that measures hydrogen in exhaled breath ( Gastrolyzer ®, Bedfont 
Scientific Ltd; Harrietsham, UK ). This measurement is obtained because hydrogen levels can 
impact carbon monoxide readings on the Micro+™ Smokerlyzer® device. A test 
administrator will instruct the participant how to give this breath sample before proceeding, 
and will direct the participan t through the breath sample in real -time.  
Next, participants may be asked to refer to the Pivot Breath Sensor  labeling to  answer 
questions regarding interpretation of other possible breath sample results (optional). This is 
followed by obtaining participa nt input using  rating scales.  
As needed, photo and video recordings may be implemented during the study to facilitate 
post-study analysis .

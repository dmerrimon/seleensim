Title : A pilot project  to evaluate  the feasibility  of constructing  a concurrent  external  control 
for recifercept  
Version  and Date: v1.1,  November  09, 2023  
Author:  
 
Rationale  and background  
Achondroplasia is a heritable autosomal dominant disorder and is the most common form of 
skeletal dysplasia in humans, with a global birth prevalence of 1 in 25,000 -30,000 or 
approximately 250,000 individuals worldwide (1 –3). Achondroplasia is caused by a single - 
point gain -of-function mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 
(FGFR3)  (2,4).  FGFR  is a key inhibitory  regulator  of endochondrial  ossification  and its over- 
activiation interferes with normal chondrocyte maturation and causes shorter long bones and 
changes in flat bones such as the occipital bone and vertebrae.  
Achondroplasia results in short stature and a range of severe complications due to abnormal 
ossification centers in the cranial base, facial bones, vertebrae, rib cage, and joints. Lordosis, 
kyphosis, small foramen magnum, and spinal stenosis are the most common achondroplasia - 
related orthopaedic complications. Other achondroplasia related complications include sleep - 
disordered  breathing,  otitis  media,  and hydrocephalus.  Medical  complications  associated  with 
achondroplasia greatly impact physical and psychosocial functioning, self -esteem, and  
patient quality of life (3,5).  
Currently, vosoritide is the only treatment approved by European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
(for achondroplasia patients aged 2 years and older with open growth plates) and U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) (for achondroplasia patients aged 5 years and older with 
open growth plates) to increase linear growth. It is an analog of C -type natriuretic peptide 
and works  by binding  to a receptor  called  natriuretic  peptide  receptor  type B (NPR -B), which 
reduces the activity of FGFR3. Other available treatments are either aimed at limb 
lengthening with surgery or are interventions to treat the complications associated with 
achondroplasia. Recifercept is a modified soluble recombinant human FSFR3 under 
development for the treatment of achondroplasia. Recifercept is designed to be a decoy 
protein, competing  for ligands of the  FGFR3 -G380R  receptor responsible for achondroplasia 
and by forming inactive heterodimers with FGFR3 monomers. By binding free FGFR3 - 
activating  ligands  and forming  inactive  dimers,  recifercept  reduces  activation  of the receptor, 
allowing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation to proceed.  
A recifercept phase 2 clinical study (Study C4181005) is ongoing to investigate the safety, 
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and efficacy  of recifercept  in children  aged  3 months  to 
10 years  with achondroplasia.  Fifty -four eligible  participants  aged  2-10 years  and 9 patients 
aged 3 months to 2 years will be enrolled and randomized to receive one of three doses of

 recifercept  subcutaneously  (1mg/kg  once -weekly,  2mg/kg  twice  weekly,  or 1.5mg/kg  once - 
daily, n=21 per dose). Once participants complete the phase 2 trial, they will be offered 
enrollment  into an open -label  extension  study  at the dose previously  received  in the phase  2 
trial or at the therapeutic dose once it is identified. A separate multi -country prospective 
observational natural history study (Study C4181001) is ongoing to examine the 
anthropometric characteristics, achondroplasia -related symptoms, tests, and treatments 
among children with achondroplasia. A total of 300 achondroplasia patients aged 0 to 15 
years of age will be recruited and followed up for a duration of 5 years. All patients 
participating in Study C4181005 were or will be recruited from Study C4181001.  
Objectives  of this project  are to evaluate  the feasibility  of constructing  a concurrent  external 
control for the recifercept phase 2 clinical trial (Study C4181005) using achondroplasia 
patients from the ongoing prospective natural history study (Study C4181001) and to 
compare selected outcomes of interest such as height growth, achondroplasia -related 
complications, patient functional status, and quality of life between achondroplasia patients 
in Study  C4181005  and those  in the concurrent  external  control.  Ultimately,  this project  will 
assess the feasibility of  leveraging the ongoing Study 4181001 to construct a concurrent 
external control for the recifercept pivotal trial.  
Research  question  and objectives  
There  are two research  questions:  
1) Can a concurrent  external  control  for the recifercept  phase  2 clinical  trial be constructed 
using achondroplasia patients from a prospective observational natural history study?  
2) What  are differences  in height  growth,  achondroplasia -related  complications,  patient 
functional  status,  and quality  of life between  patients  enrolled  in the recifercept  phase  2 
clinical trial and those in the concurrent external control?  
Objectives  of this pilot project  will be: 
1. Construct  a concurrent  external  control  arm for recifercept  phase  2 clincial  trial using 
achondroplasia patients from a prospective observal natural history study  
2. If objective  #1 is met, the following  will be compared  to examine  differences  between 
patients enrolled in the recifercept phase 2 clincial trial and those in the concurrent 
external control:  
• Height  growth  
• Selected  anthropometric  measurements,  including  but not limited  to: standing  height, 
sitting height, knee height, arm span, length of the legs, sitting height/standing height 
ratio, arm span to height/length difference, knee height/lower segment ratio

Study  design  
This is a retrospective  cohort  study  using  existing  data from  two ongoing  studies:  C4181001 
and C4181005.  Study  C4181005  includes  63 achondroplasia  patients  in total,  approximately 
54 patients aged 2 to 10 years (inclusive) and 9 patients aged 3 months to 2 years, who are 
enrolled and randomized to receive one of three doses of recifercept (1mg/kg once -weekly, 
2mg/kg twice -weekly, or 1.5mg/kg once -daily, n=21 per dose) subcutaneously for 12 
months. Study C4181001 includes approximately 300 children with achondroplasia aged 0 - 
15 years who are recruited  from global sites. Patient data will be collected at baseline  and at 
every 3 -month interval visit, for a maximum of 5 years.  
Study  population  
Inclusion  Criteria:

Data  sources  
This retrospective cohort study will include achondroplasia patients from Study C4181005 
and those from Study C4181001 who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study 
C4181005. Study C4181005 is a single -arm trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
recifercept doses and dosing regimen, and efficacy to increase height growth in 
achondroplasia patients. Study C4181005 will include approximately 63 children with 
achondroplasia  aged  3 months  to 10 years  (inclusive)  with Tanner  Stage  1, who are enrolled 
and randomized to receive one of three doses of recifercept (1mg/kg once -weekly, 2mg/kg 
twice -weekly, or 1.5mg/kg once -daily) subcutaneously for 12 months. Demographics, 
medical  history,  anthropometric  measurements,  and patient -reported  outcomes  in functional 
status and quality of life are collected approximately every 3 months. Study C4181001 is a 
prospective natural history study to collect longitudinal anthropometric and disease -related 
complication data in children with achondroplasia. It will include approximately 300 
achondroplasia patients aged 0 -15 years with Tanner Stage 1 recruited from global sites.  
Patient  data will be collected  at baseline  and at every  3-month  interval  visits,  for a maximum 
of 5 years. Further details on data sources are presented in Table3.  
Study  size 
The determination of study size of this protocol is exclusively limited to addressing the 
second objective of examining the differences between patients enrolled in the recifercept 
phase 2 clinical trial and those enrolled in the concurrent external control. For the purposeof 
consistency with the analysis of the primary endpoint Study C4181005, consideration of 
study  size for this protocol  is further  limited  to a comparison  of height  growth,  defined  as the

Data  analysis  
Descriptive statistics will be tabulated on patient demographic and baseline clinical 
characteristics between achondroplasia patients from Study C4181005 and patients from 
Study C4181001 who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study C4181005. To 
construct a concurrent external control for Study C4181005, a propensity score (PS) will be 
created to achieve balance across covariates between achondroplasia patients from Study 
C4181005 and patients from Study C4181001 who meet all the eligibility criteria of Study 
C4181005. The PS will be estimated using standard logistic regression approaches with the 
“outcome” variable being the data source (whether patients were included in Study  
C4181005 and exposure to recifercept treatment) and the predictors being the variables 
associated with both the exposure (recifercept treatment) and the outcomes of interest (i.e. 
height growth). This model will provide the predicted probability of being in the trial cohort 
relative to the concurrent external control cohort as a function of the covariates (the 
propensity  score  of being  included  in Study  C4181005).  The potential  covariates  may include 
demographics (e.g. age, gender, race and ethnicity), clinical characteristics (e.g. presence of 
achondraplasia -related complications, Tanner stage, and other non -achondroplasia -related 
conditions of medical significance). The distribution of the PS will be reviewed and patients 
with a PS in the areas of nonoverlap and/or with extreme PS values might be excluded to 
improve validity (PS trimming). Each patient in the PS trimmed receifercept group will be

 matched on a ratio of 1:1 with patients in the PS trimmed concurrent external control using 
optimal  nearest  neighbour  matching  with a maximum  caliper  of 1%. Pre- and post-matching 
balance will be assessed using standardized differences between these two PS -matched 
groups. A negative control outcome may also be identified to evaluate the pre - and post - 
matching balance.  
After  the concurrent  external  control  is constructed  by PS matching,  descriptive  statistics  will 
be tabulated on patient demographic and baseline clinical characteristics between 
achondroplasia patients from PS -matched recifercept phase 2 trial cohort and those from PS - 
matched concurrent external control. Two -sample T -tests will be used for continuous 
variables, and chi -square tests for categorical variables assuming the distribution is normal.  
Frequency of primary, secondary CCI  outcomes  of interest  and 95% confidence 
intervals will be computed.  
Hazard  ratios  and associated  95% confidence  intervals  of dichotomous  outcomes  (including 
height  growth  in the achondroplasia  reference  population  +50%,  and occurrence  of selected 
achondroplasia -related complications) in PS -matched groups will be estimated by 
multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models. The effect of recifercept on  
continuous  outcomes  (including  height  growth,  anthropometric  measures,  CCI  
in PS-matched  groups  will be estimated  by linear  mixed  
models.  
To maximize the number of patients in the trial cohort and the concurrent external control 
cohort included in this pilot project, additional methods will be explored. Coarsened 
weighting and full matching may be explored. Other than matching, inverse probability 
weight (IPW) and/or the fine stratification weighting may also be used to balance the key 
covariates  between  patients  in the concurrent  external  control  cohort  (patients  in C4181001 
who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study C4181005) and patients in Study 
C4181005 (details of these methods will be outlined in the SAP).

7. RATIONALE  AND  BACKGROUND  
Achondroplasia is a heritable autosomal dominant disorder and is the most common form of 
skeletal dysplasia in humans, with a global birth prevalence of 1 in 25 -30,000 or ~250,000 
individuals worldwide (1 –3). Achondroplasia is caused by a single -point gain -of-function 
mutation in the gene encoding the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (2,4). FGFR 
is a key inhibitory regulator of endochondrial ossification and its over -activiation interferes 
with normal  chondrocyte  maturation  and causes  shorter  long bones  and changes  in flat bones 
such as the occipital bone and vertebrae.

 Achondroplasia results in short stature and a range of severe complications due to abnormal 
ossification centers in the cranial base, facial bones, vertebrae, rib cage, and joints. Lordosis, 
kyphosis, small foramen magnum, and spinal stenosis are the most common achondroplasia - 
related orthopaedic complications. Other achondroplasia related complications include sleep - 
disordered  breathing,  otitis  media,  and hydrocephalus.  Medical  complications  associated  with 
achondroplasia greatly impact physical and psychosocial functioning, self -esteem, and  
patient quality of life (3,5).  
Currently, vosoritide is the only treatment approved by EMA (for achondroplasia patients 
aged  2 years  and older  with open  growth  plates)  and FDA  (for achondroplasia  patients  aged  5 
years and older with open growth plates) to increase linear growth. It is an analog of C -type 
natriuretic peptide and works by binding to a receptor called natriuretic peptide receptor type 
B (NPR -B), which reduces the activity of FGFR3. Other available treatments are either  
aimed at limb lengthening with surgery or are interventions to treat the complications 
associated  with achondroplasia.  Recifercept  is a modified  soluble  recombinant  human  FSFR3 
under  development  for the treatment  of achondroplasia.  Recifercept  is designed  to be a decoy 
protein, competing for ligands of the FGFR3 -G380R receptor responsible for achondroplasia 
and by forming inactive heterodimers with FGFR3 monomers. By binding free FGFR3 - 
activating  ligands and forming  inactive dimers, recifercept reduces activation of the receptor, 
allowing chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation to proceed.  
A recifercept phase 2 clinical study (Study C4181005) is ongoing to investigate the safety, 
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics (PK)  and efficacy  of recifercept in children aged 3 months to 
10 years  with achondroplasia.  Fifty -four eligible  participants  aged  2-10 years  and 9 patients 
aged 3 months to 2 years will be enrolled and randomized to receive one of three doses of 
recifercept  subcutaneously  (1mg/kg  once -weekly,  2mg/kg  twice  weekly,  or 1.5mg/kg  once - 
daily, n=21 per dose). Once participants complete the phase 2 trial, they will be offered 
enrollment  into an open -label  extension  study  at the dose previously  received  in the phase  2 
trial or at the therapeutic dose once it is identified. A separate multi -country prospective 
observational natural history study (Study C4181001) is ongoing to examine the 
anthropometric characteristics, and achondroplasia -related symptoms, tests, and treatments 
among children with achondroplasia. A total of 300 achondroplasia patients aged 0 and 15 
years of age will be recruited and followed up for a duration of 5 years. All patients 
participating in Study C4181005 were or will be recruited from Study C4181001.  
Objectives  of this project  are to evaluate  the feasibility  of constructing  a concurrent  external 
control for the recifercept phase 2 clinical trial (Study C4181005) using achondroplasia 
patients from the ongoing prospective natural history study (Study C4181001) and to 
compare selected outcomes of interest such as height growth, achondroplasia -related 
complications, and quality of life between achondroplasia patients in Study C4181005 and 
those  in the concurrent  external  control.  Ultimately,  this project  will assess  the feasibility  of 
leveraging the ongoing Study 4181001 as a concurrent external control arm for the 
recifercept pivotal trial.

 8. RESEARCH  QUESTION  AND  OBJECTIVES  
There  are two research  questions:  
1) Can a concurrent  external  control  for the recifercept  phase  2 clinical  trial be constructed 
using achondroplasia patients from a prospective observational natural history study?  
2) What  are differences  in height  growth,  achondroplasia -related  complications,  patient 
functional  status,  and quality  of life between  patients  enrolled  in the recifercept  phase  2 
clinical trial and those in the concurrent external control?  
Objectives  of this pilot project  include:  
1. Construct  a concurrent  external  control  arm for recifercept  phase  2 clincial  trial using 
achondroplasia patients from a prospective observal natural history study  
2. If objective #1 is met, the following will be compared to examine differences between 
patients  enrolled  in the recifercept  phase  2 clincial  trial and those  in the concurrent  external 
control:  
• Height  growth  
• Selected  anthropometric  measurements,  including  but not limited  to: standing 
height, sitting height, knee height, arm span, length of the legs, sitting 
height/standing height ratio, arm span to height/length difference, knee 
height/lower segment ratio  
• Achondroplasia -related  orthopaedic  complications  (including  lordosis,  kyphosis, 
small foramen magnum, spinal stenosis), and other achondroplasia -related 
complications (including apnea, AOM, and hydrocephalus)  
• Differences  in functional  status  and health -related  quality  of life 
 
 
9. RESEARCH  METHODS  
9.1. Study  design  
This is a retrospective  cohort  study  using  existing  data from  two ongoing  studies:  C4181001 
and C4181005.  The study  population  will include  two independent  study  cohorts:  a) patients 
from Study C4181005 who have completed Visits 1 through 11 (at D183); b) patients from 
Study C4181001 who meet the eligibility criteria for Study C4181005 and have at least 6 
months follow -up data. Eligible patients from Study C4181001 will be included as potential 
external controls for patients in Study C4181005, using propensity score methodology.  
This pilot study has the potential to demonstrate the feasibility of Study C4181001 as 
concurrent  external  controls  and provide  viable  study  design  options  for the recifercept

 pivotal trial. It will also provide information on the efficacy of recifercept compared to 
clinical  practices  in the real world.  Having  an external  control  arm in the trial allows  for 
increased efficiency and decreased product development time.  
9.2. Setting  
This retrospective cohort study will include achondroplasia patients from Study C4181005 
and those from Study C4181001 who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study 
C4181005. Study C4181005 is a single -arm trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
recifercept doses and dosing regimen, and efficacy to increase height growth in 
achondroplasia patients. Study C4181005 will include approximately 63 children with 
achondroplasia  aged  3 months  to 10 years  (inclusive)  with Tanner  Stage  1, who are enrolled 
and randomized to receive one of three doses of recifercept (1mg/kg once -weekly, 2mg/kg 
twice -weekly, or 1.5mg/kg once -daily) subcutaneously for 12 months. Demographics, 
medical  history,  anthropometric  measurements,  and patient -reported  outcomes  in functional 
status and quality of life are collected approximately every 3 months. Study C4181001 is a 
prospective natural history study to collect the longitudinal anthropometric and disease - 
related complication data in children with achondroplais. It will include approximately 300 
achondroplasia patients aged 0 -15 years with Tanner Stage I recruited from global sites.  
Patient  data will be collected  at baseline  and at every  3-month  interval  visits,  for a maximum 
of 5 years. Further details on data sources are presented in Table 1.

9.4. Study  size 
The determination of study size of this protocol is exclusively limited to addressing the 
second objective of examining the differences between patients enrolled in the recifercept 
phase 2 clinical trial and  those enrolled in the  concurrent external  control. For the  purposeof 
consistency with the analysis of the primary endpoint Study C4181005, consideration of 
study  size for this protocol  is further  limited  to a comparison  of height  growth,  defined  as the 
ratio of change  from  baseline  of standing  height  at 6 months  or 12 months  of a patient  taking 
recifercept  to a matched  subject in the concurrent  external control. The null hypothesis is  the 
median value (ie, 50 percentile) of the aforementioned ratio is equal to 1.  
A table  and figure  presented  below  displays  the number  of pairs  required  to detect  the 
median ratio (denoted as ) under the alternative hypothesis (Table 1 ).

9.5. Data  management  
All data for the described analysis will be obtained from Study C4181001 and Study 
C4181005  databases.  Data  management  procedures  including  data collection,  retrieval, 
preparation and retention are described in those protocols.  
In summary, for study C4181001 data management involved the completion of a CRFfor 
each study  participant.  The investigator  was responsible  for the collection  and reporting  of all 
clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms 
(source documents). Additionally, all study data was required to be verifiable by source

 documents.  Study  records  were  retained  by the investigator  in accordance  with International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH), local guidelines, or clinical study agreement (CSA).  
Records  were  required  to be kept for a minimum  of 25 years  after study  completion  or 
discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations.  
For study C4181005, all participant data relating to the study was recorded on printed or 
electronic CRF unless transmitted to the sponsor or designee electronically (eg, laboratory 
data). The investigator was responsible for verifying that data entries were accurate and 
correct, maintaining accurate documentation of source data that supports the CRF, and 
ensuring that CRF were securely stored in electronic form. Sponsors or designees were 
responsible for data management and quality checking the data. Study monitors also 
performed ongoing source data verification to confirm that entered into the CRF were 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Records and documents 
pertaining  to study  conduct  were  required  to be maintained  for at least 15 years,  unless  local 
policies or institutional regulations required a longer retention period.  
9.6. Data  analysis  
A single pooled dataset will be released for analysis. The release will occur when for 
selected, targeted data (in Table 3 ): a) review and documentation of relevant CRF and non - 
CRF data; and b) all open queries are resolved. There will be two releases of data. The first 
release coincides with approximately 30 pairs of patients – that is, a patient from C4181001 
matched to a patient from C4181005 – having 6 months of growth data. The second release 
will take place at the beginning of the interim analysis for C4181005. There may be an 
additional  release  of data from  both studies  that coincides  with the completion  of C4181005.  
Descriptive statistics will be tabulated on patient demographic and baseline clinical 
characteristics between achondroplasia patients from Study C4181005 and patients from 
Study C4181001 who meet all the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study C4181005. To 
construct a concurrent external control for Study C4181005, a propensity score (PS) will be 
created to achieve balance across covariates between achondroplasia patients from Study 
C4181005 and patients from Study C4181001 who meet all the eligibility criteria of Study 
C4181005. The PS will be estimated using standard logistic regression approaches with the 
“outcome” variable being the data source (whether patients were included in Study 
C4181005 and exposure  to recifercept treatment) and the predictors being the variables 
associated with both the exposure (recifercept treatment) and the outcomes of interest (i.e. 
height growth).  This model will provide the predicted  probability of being  in the  trial cohort 
relative to the concurrent external control cohort as a function of the covariates (the 
propensity score of being included in Study C4181005).  The potential covariates may 
include demographics (e.g. age, gender, race and ethnicity), clinical characteristics (e.g. 
presence of achondraplasia -related complications, Tanner stage, and other non - 
achondroplasia -related  conditions  of medical  significance).  The distribution  of the PS will be 
reviewed and patients with a PS in the areas of nonoverlap and/or with extreme PS values 
might be excluded to improve validity (PS trimming). Each patient in the PS trimmed 
receifercept group will be matched on a ratio of 1:1 with patients in the PS trimmed 
concurrent external control using optimal nearest neighbour matching with a maximum

 caliper of 1%.  Pre- and post -matching balance will be assessed using standardized 
differences  between  these  two PS-matched  groups.  A negative  control  outcome  may also be 
identified to evaluate the pre - and post -matching balance.  
After  the concurrent  external  control  is constructed  by PS matching,  descriptive  statistics  will 
be tabulated on patient demographic and baseline clinical characteristics between 
achondroplasia patients from PS -matched recifercept phase 2 trial cohort and those from PS - 
matched concurrent external control. Two -sample T -tests will be used for continuous 
variables, and chi -square tests for categorical variables assuming the distribution is normal.  
Frequency  of primary,  secondary  and exploretary  outcomes  of interest  and 95% confidence 
intervals will be computed.  
Hazard  ratios  and associated  95% confidence  intervals  of dichotomous  outcomes  (including 
height  growth  in the achondroplasia  reference  population  +50%,  and occurrence  of selected 
achondroplasia -related complications) in PS -matched groups will be estimated by 
multivariable cox proportional hazards regression models. The effect of recifercept on  
continuous  outcomes  (including  height  growth,  anthropometric  measures, CCI  
in PS-matched  groups  will be estimated  by linear  mixed  
models.  
To maximize the number of patients in the trial cohort and the concurrent external control 
cohort included in this pilot project, additional methods will be explored. Coarsened 
weighting and full matching may be explored. Other than matching, inverse probability 
weight (IPW) and/or the fine stratification weighting may also be used to balance the key 
covariates  between  patients  in the concurrent  external  control  cohort  (patients  in C4181001 
who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Study C4181005) and patients in Study 
C4181005 (details of these methods will be outlined in the SAP).  
9.7. Data  sources  
For this pilot study,  the data in Table  9.3 from  C4181001  and C4181005  will be pooled  to 
create a single dataset. With respect to patients the component datasets will be mutually 
exclusive – that is, there are no patients common to both studies.  
This retrospective cohort external control arm study will include achondroplasia patients 
from Study C4181005 and those from Study C4181001 who meet the inclusion and  
exclusion criteria of Study C4181005. Study C4181005 is a single -arm trial to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of recifercept doses and dosing regimen, and efficacy to increase 
height growth in achondroplasia patients. Study C4181005 will include approximately 63 
children  with achondroplasia  aged  3 months  to 10 years  (inclusive)  with Tanner  Stage  1, who 
are enrolled and randomized to receive one of three doses of recifercept (1mg/kg once - 
weekly, 2mg/kg twice -weekly, or 1.5mg/kg once -daily) subcutaneously for 12 months.  
Demographics, medical history, anthropometric measurements, and patient -reported 
outcomes  in functional  status  and quality  of life are collected  approximately  every  3 months. 
Study C4181001 is a prospective natural history study to collect the longitudinal 
anthropometric and disease -related complication data in children with achondroplais. It will

 include approximately 300 achondroplasia patients aged 0 -15 years with Tanner Stage I 
recruited  from  global  sites.  Patient  data will be collected  at baseline  and at every  3-month 
interval visits, for a maximum of 5 years. Further details on data sources are presented in 
Table 2 . 
9.8. Quality  control  
Quality  control  procedures  are described  in the protocols  of Study  C4181001  and Study 
C4181005. No additional quality control will be performed in this study.  
9.9. Limitations  of the research  methods  
There are several limitations to this study. Externally controlled studies do not rely on 
randomization, resulting in inherent bias and a potential lack of comparability between 
treated and  untreated groups (Tjiete  & Brouder,  2010)(6). We will apply  the same inclusion 
and exclusion criteria to select patients in the external control arm and use propensity score 
methodology to adjust for the differences between patients  included in  the Study C4181005 
and patients as external controls. However, depending on the extent of data collection in 
Study  C4181001  and Study  C4181005,  the propensity  score  modeling  may not adjust  for all 
potential confounders.  Additionally, even though Study C4181001 is a  multi -country study, 
patients included in Study C4181001 and Study C4181005 may not represent the entire 
achondroplasia patient population, and generalizability of study results may be limited.  
9.10. Other  aspects  
Not applicable.  
 
 
10. PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
10.1. Patient  information  
This study  involves  data that exist  in anonymized  structured  format  and contain  no patient 
personal information.  
10.2. Patient  consent  
As this study involves anonymized structured data, which according to applicable legal 
requirements  do not contain  data subject  to privacy  laws,  obtaining  informed  consent  from 
patients by Pfizer is not required.  
10.3. Institutional  review  board  (IRB)/Independent  ethics  committee  (IEC)  
Not applicable.  
10.4. Ethical  conduct  of the study  
The study  will be conducted  in accordance  with legal  and regulatory  requirements,  as well as 
with scientific purpose, value and rigor and follow generally accepted research practices

 described  in Guidelines  for Good  Pharmacoepidemiology  Practices  (GPP),  The ENCePP 
Code of Conduct for scientific independence and transparency in the conduct  
of pharmacoepidemiological  and pharmacovigilance  studies,  FDA  Guidance  for Industry: 
Good Pharmacovigilance Practices and Pharmacoepidemiologic Assessment (7 –9). 
 
11. MANAGEMENT  AND  REPORTING  OF ADVERSE  EVENTS/ADVERSE 
REACTIONS  
This study involves data that exist as structured data by the time of study start. In these data 
sources, individual patient data are not retrieved or validated, and it is not possible to link 
(i.e., identify a potential  association  between) a particular product and medical  event  for any 
individual.  Thus,  the minimum  criteria  for reporting  an adverse  event  (AE)  (i.e., identifiable 
patient, identifiable reporter, a suspect product, and event) cannot be met.  
 
 
12. PLANS  FOR  DISSEMINATING  AND  COMMUNICATING  STUDY  RESULTS  
In the event  of any prohibition  or restriction  imposed  (e.g.,  clinical  hold)  by an applicable 
competent authority in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of a Pfizer 
product, Pfizer should be informed immediately.

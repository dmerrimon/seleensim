	3	Project	Summary/Abstract	28	Study	Title:		A	randomized	double-blinded	controlled	trial	comparing	dilation	and	evacuation	29	outcomes	with	and	without	oxytocin	use	30		31	Objective:		Our	study	objective	is	to	determine	whether	routine	use	of	intravenous	(IV)	oxytocin	32	will	affect	bleeding	outcomes	at	the	time	of	dilation	and	evacuation	(D&E)	at	18	to	24-weeks	33	gestation.			34		35	Background:		Abortion	is	one	of	the	most	common	procedures	performed	in	the	United	States.		36	While	surgical	abortion	is	considered	to	be	a	safe	procedure,	rates	of	hemorrhage,	the	most	37	common	complication	that	occurs	at	the	time	of	surgical	abortion,	increase	with	gestational	38	age.		Few	studies	have	identified	effective	interventions	to	manage	blood	loss	during	D&E	39	(dilation	and	evacuation),	the	procedure	used	to	terminate	pregnancy	above	14	weeks	40	gestation.		Many	practitioners	use	uterotonics,	including	oxytocin,	to	help	minimize	blood	loss,	41	however,	oxytocin	administration	has	never	been	studied	with	D&E.			42		43	Design:	We	propose	a	randomized,	double-blinded,	placebo-controlled	trial	at	two	sites,	the	44	University	of	Hawaii	(UH)	and	the	University	of	Washington	(UW).		Subjects	who	present	for	45	D&E	at	18	to	24-weeks	gestation	will	be	recruited	and	randomized	to	IV	oxytocin	versus	IV	fluid	46	alone.		Bleeding	will	be	measured	during	the	procedure	and	until	the	time	of	discharge	from	the	47	postoperative	care	unit.			48		49	Outcomes:		The	primary	outcome	is	the	rate	at	which	providers	intervene	to	control	blood	loss	50	during	D&E	procedures.		Interventions	include	bimanual	massage,	administration	of	51	medications	(i.e.	misoprostol,	methergine)	and	performing	additional	procedures	(i.e.	52	placement	of	an	intrauterine	tamponade	balloon,	exploratory	laparoscopy	or	laparotomy).		53	Secondary	outcomes	include	measured	blood	loss,	complication	rates,	procedure	length,	and	54	postoperative	pain	and	satisfaction.			55		56	Sample	size	&	population:		We	designated	a	15%	decrease	in	provider	interventions	to	control	57	blood	loss	to	be	clinically	significant.		To	achieve	this,	with	80%	power	and	two-sided	alpha	of	58	0.05,	we	need	83	subjects	per	group	for	a	total	sample	of	166	women.		Patients	will	be	59	recruited	in	Honolulu,	HI	at	the	UH	site	and	Seattle,	WA	at	the	UW	site.		Eligible	participants	60	include	women	14-years	and	above	presenting	for	termination	of	pregnancy	including	those	61	with	fetal	demise	or	fetal	anomalies.			Exclusion	criteria	include	placenta	accreta,	preoperative	62	misoprostol	use,	or	women	unable	or	unwilling	to	provide	written	informed	consent.	63		64	65

	4			66	1.		Background	&	Rationale	67		68	Nearly	1.2	million	abortions	are	done	in	the	United	States	each	year,	making	it	one	of	the	most	69	common	surgical	procedures	performed	(1).		Only	a	small	number	of	surgical	abortions,	1.9	per	70	1000	procedures,	result	in	a	complication	(1,	2).		Dilation	and	evacuation	(D&E),	the	surgical	71	procedure	used	to	terminate	pregnancy	above	14	weeks	gestation,	has	a	higher	risk	of	72	complication.		Hemorrhage,	defined	as	blood	loss	over	500-ml,	occurs	in	0.8%	to	2.1%	of	all	73	D&E	procedures	and	is	the	most	common	complication	of	D&E	(3,	4).		The	rate	of	hemorrhage	74	increases	with	gestational	age;	up	to	6.3%	of	D&Es	performed	above	18	weeks	gestation	are	75	affected	by	hemorrhage	(5).		76		77	In	an	attempt	to	decrease	hemorrhage	with	D&Es,	many	abortion	providers	routinely	78	administer	uterotonics	like	oxytocin	(6).		The	ability	of	oxytocin	to	decrease	bleeding	is	79	extrapolated	from	the	obstetric	literature	where	clear	evidence	demonstrates	that	it	decreases	80	hemorrhage	when	used	routinely	at	the	time	of	a	full-term	delivery.		Studies	evaluating	routine	81	oxytocin	for	first-trimester	surgical	abortion	failed	to	show	any	change	in	blood	loss	(7,	8).		To	82	date,	no	randomized	trials	have	evaluated	routine	oxytocin	administration	at	the	time	of	D&E	in	83	the	second	trimester.		Because	of	its	effect	on	blood	loss	at	the	time	of	a	term	delivery,	84	oxytocin	is	often	used	during	surgical	termination	of	pregnancy	at	a	variety	of	gestational	ages.		85	There	is	no	documented	“standard	of	care”	in	the	literature	regarding	prophylactic	use	of	any	86	uterotonics	during	D&E.			At	The	Queen’s	Medical	Center	(QMC),	many	providers	very	87	commonly	use	oxytocin	at	the	time	of	D&E.		We	seek	to	determine	whether	this	intervention	88	decreases	blood	loss	and	the	need	to	perform	interventions	to	control	bleeding.			89		90	We	have	performed	a	preliminary	retrospective	analysis	of	a	subset	of	patients	(n=23)	91	undergoing	D&E	at	18-	to	24-weeks	(Study	Title:	Abortion	Database,	WIRB	Approved,	Study	ID	92	2013-88).		This	study	included	procedures	performed	by	UH/UCERA	Faculty	Physicians.		Eight	of	93	23	(34.8%)	patients	included	in	this	subset	received	oxytocin.		We	found	that	those	who	94	received	oxytocin	had	a	mean	estimated	blood	loss	(EBL)	of	112.5-ml	while	those	who	did	not	95	receive	oxytocin	had	a	mean	EBL	of	135.3-ml.		A	difference	in	blood	loss	of	22.8-ml	(about	5	96	teaspoons)	does	not	have	any	clinical	consequences	for	the	patient.		In	other	words,	the	patient	97	does	not	experience	a	drop	in	their	blood	count	(hemoglobin),	would	not	have	any	symptoms	98	of	anemia	(lightheadedness	or	weakness),	and	would	not	require	any	additional	treatment	99	because	an	additional	22.8-ml	of	blood	was	lost	during	a	procedure.		100		101	Importantly,	this	retrospective	analysis	does	not	properly	answer	our	clinical	question.		For	a	102	research	study	to	answer	a	question	it	is	important	to	be	able	to	properly	assess	the	following:	103	1. Exposure	–	In	this	case	the	exposure	is	whether	or	not	the	patient	received	oxytocin	104	and	the	dose	of	oxytocin.		With	a	retrospective	analysis,	we	are	“stuck”	with	105	whatever	information	is	available	in	the	medical	record.		In	terms	of	collecting	106	
		Version	3		
	5	information	on	the	exposure	(oxytocin),	we	have	information	on	whether	a	patient	107	received	oxytocin	but	the	amount	infused	was	not	always	recorded.			108	2. Outcome	–	In	this	case,	the	outcome	is	estimated	blood	loss.		In	terms	of	collecting	109	information	on	the	outcome,	estimated	blood	loss	recorded	in	the	medical	record,	is	110	known	to	be	unreliable,	inconsistent,	and	not	uniformly	collected.		Typically	in	the	111	operating	room,	the	surgeon	and	anesthesiologist	estimate	blood	loss	by	visually	112	inspecting	the	amount	of	blood	in	the	collection	canister	and	the	blood	on	surgical	113	sponges.		It	is	no	surprise	that	one	obstetrical	study	comparing	estimated	and	114	measured	blood	loss	demonstrated	a	difference	of	nearly	300-ml	between	the	two	115	groups	(9,	10).			116	3. Confounders	–	A	confounder	is	something	that	“mixes”	or	“blurs”	the	effect.		A	117	researcher	may	be	attempting	to	relate	an	exposure	to	an	outcome	but	is	actually	118	measuring	the	effect	of	a	third	factor,	known	as	a	confounding	variable	to	the	119	outcome.		For	example,	the	results	of	our	preliminary	analysis	show	that	patients	120	who	did	not	receive	oxytocin	had	slightly	less	bleeding.		However,	what	if	some	121	confounding	factor	(i.e.	low	platelets,	higher	gestational	age,	multiple	gestation,	122	etc.)	made	it	more	likely	for	patients	who	had	a	higher	risk	of	bleeding	to	get	123	oxytocin?		Although	we	were	trying	to	measure	the	effect	of	oxytocin	on	bleeding	124	we	may	have	in	fact	been	measuring	the	hidden	effect	of	confounders	on	bleeding.		125	Sometimes	confounders	are	easily	identifiable,	sometimes	they	are	unknown,	yet-126	to-be	identified	factors.				127		128	The	retrospective	analysis	we	conducted	does	not	adequately	address	our	scientific	question	129	because	of	the	three	factors	listed	above.		In	our	randomized	controlled	trial	we	will	be	able	to	130	improve	on	the	quality	of	data	collected	in	the	following	ways;	131	1. Exposure	–	We	will	know	if	a	patient	received	oxytocin	and	those	who	get	oxytocin	132	will	get	a	standard	amount	of	the	medication	133	2. Outcome	–	Blood	loss	will	be	accurately	measured	rather	than	estimated.			134	3. Confounders	-	Conducting	a	randomized	controlled	trial	is	the	best	way	to	avoid	135	confounding	because	assignment	of	participants	into	one	group	or	another	happens	136	purely	by	chance.		In	other	words,	possible	confounders	don’t	affect	whether	the	137	patient	receives	or	does	not	receive	the	intervention.	138		139	Though	oxytocin	is	a	safe,	inexpensive	medication,	no	medication	is	administered	without	some	140	risk.			Some	abortion	providers	hypothesize	that	use	of	oxytocin	can	make	it	more	difficult	to	141	remove	pregnancy	tissue	because	the	uterine	muscle	contracts	around	the	surgical	instrument	142	making	them	difficult	to	manipulate	(5).		Oxytocin	may	increase	postoperative	uterine	cramping	143	causing	the	patient	unnecessary	discomfort	(11).		Though	no	published	reports	describe	adverse	144	events	when	oxytocin	is	used	at	the	time	of	D&E,	when	used	during	labor	and	delivery	at	term	145	or	induction	termination	in	the	second	and	third	trimester,	oxytocin	related	complications	such	146	as	anaphylaxis,	uterine	rupture,	arrhythmias	and	water	intoxication	have	been	reported	(12-147	15).	Unnecessary	use	of	oxytocin	would	raise	abortion	related	healthcare	costs	both	directly,	148	via	the	cost	of	the	medication,	and	indirectly,	via	the	cost	of	treating	related	adverse	events	and	149	pain.	150	
		Version	3		
	6		151	This	study	will	be	conducted	in	compliance	with	the	protocol	approved	by	the	Research	and	152	Institutional	Review	Committee,	and	according	to	Good	Clinical	Practice	standards,	applicable	153	federal	regulations,	and	QMC	institutional	policies,	and	QMC	research	policies	and	procedures.			154		155		156	2.		Specific	Aims/Objective/Purpose:	157		158	Primary	Objective:		Our	primary	objective	is	to	determine	whether	routine	use	of	oxytocin	159	decreases	the	rate	of	intervention	to	decrease	excess	blood	loss	compared	to	IV	fluid	alone	in	160	women	having	D&E	between	18-	and	24	-weeks	gestations	(for	special	considerations	for	22-	to	161	23-week	and	6-day	gestations	see	Inclusion	Criteria).			Interventions	to	decrease	bleeding	have	162	been	defined	as	bimanual	massage,	use	of	uterotonics	(misoprostol,	methylergonovine,	163	carboprost	tromethamine),	injection	of	additional	vasopressin,	balloon	tamponade	or	packing,	164	re-aspiration,	exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy,	need	for	uterine	artery	embolization	or	165	hysterectomy.	166		167	Secondary	Objectives:			168	• Measured	blood	loss	(described	in	section	6	under	“Surgical	Protocol”)	169	• Procedure	length,	measured	from	placement	of	the	speculum	to	removal	of	speculum		170	• Complications	including	uterine	perforation,	cervical	or	vaginal	laceration,	hemorrhage	171	(blood	loss	greater	than	500	ml),	need	for	transfusion,	exploratory	laparotomy	or	172	laparoscopy		173	• Postoperative	pain:	recorded	60-minutes	after	the	end	of	the	procedure	using	a	10-cm	174	visual	analog	scale	(VAS)	and	compared	to	preoperative	baseline	score	175	• Patient	Satisfaction:	measured	60-minutes	after	the	procedure	using	5-point	scale	and	176	compared	to	preoperative	baseline	score	177		178	3.		Study	Design	179		180	Overall	Study	Design	181	We	propose	a	randomized,	double-blind,	placebo-controlled	trial	of	women	undergoing	D&E	at	182	18-	to	24-weeks	gestation	(for	special	considerations	for	22-	to	23-week	and	6-day	gestations	183	see	Inclusion	Criteria).		Women	will	be	randomized	to	receive	30-units	of	IV	oxytocin	versus	IV	184	fluid	alone.		This	study	will	be	performed	at	two	sites:	The	Queen’s	Medical	Center	(UH	site,	185	Honolulu,	Hawaii)	and	University	of	Washington	Hospital	and	Clinics	and	Cedar	River	Clinic	(UW	186	sites,	Seattle,	WA).		The	gestational-age	limits	were	selected	for	two	reasons.		First,	studies	187	have	shown	rates	of	hemorrhage	increase	significantly	past	18-weeks	gestation	and	are	188	reported	to	be	as	high	as	6.3%	(5).		Second,	a	survey	of	abortion	providers	who	participate	in	189	
		Version	3		
	7	the	Family	Planning	Fellowship	LISTSERV	found	that	providers	who	routinely	use	oxytocin	190	during	D&E	generally	do	so	starting	at	18-weeks	gestation.	191		192	Description	of	the	drug	to	be	studied	193	Pitocin®,	or	synthetic	oxytocin,	is	made	by	JHP	Pharmaceuticals	in	Rochester,	MI.		The	research	194	pharmacists	at	each	site	will	be	given	a	randomization	scheme	and	will	accordingly	prepare	an	195	IV	solution	that	contains	either	500-ml	of	lactated	ringers	or	500-ml	of	fluid	mixed	with	30-units	196	of	oxytocin.	Study	medications	will	be	labeled	with	study	identification	numbers	based	on	197	allocation	(see	Randomization).			198		199	Sample	Size	&	Duration	200	We	designated	a	15%	decrease	in	intervention	rates	to	control	blood	loss	as	clinically	201	significant.		To	achieve	this,	with	80%	power	and	two-sided	alpha	of	0.05,	we	need	83	subjects	202	per	group	for	a	total	sample	of	166	women.			At	the	UH	site	(QMC),	we	estimate	100	D&E	203	procedures	between	18-	and	24-weeks	gestation	will	be	performed	over	the	next	12-months.		204	We	estimate	50%	of	all	eligible	patients	will	agree	to	participate	giving	us	an	enrollment	of	205	approximately	55-60	patients	over	a	14-month	period.		UW	site	investigators	have	estimated	206	180	abortions	at	18-	to	24-weeks	will	occur	over	the	next	year.		Similar	to	the	UH-site,	we	207	estimate	50%	of	eligible	subjects	will	be	recruited	and	we	should	therefore	enroll	about	100-208	120	patients	in	14-month	period.		Each	subject’s	involvement	lasts	from	the	time	of	the	pre-209	operative	visit	until	discharge	from	post-operative	unit.			210		211	Randomization	212	An	individual	not	involved	with	subject	recruitment,	enrollment	or	follow-up	will	determine	213	allocation	of	subjects	by	computer-generated	random	numbers	in	block	sizes	to	be	determined	214	by	that	individual.		The	investigators	will	provide	research	pharmacists	sealed,	sequentially-215	numbered,	opaque	envelopes	containing	study	group	assignment	which	will	be	decided	on	the	216	day	of	surgery.		The	research	pharmacists	will	prepare	study	medication	(either	IV	fluid	alone	or	217	IV	fluid	with	oxytocin)	and	will	label	the	fluid	bag	with	a	study	identification	number.		218	Investigators	will	assign	each	subject	a	study	identification	number	in	sequential	order.		Study	219	medication	will	be	delivered	to	the	operating	room	prior	to	the	procedure.	220		221	The	research	pharmacist	will	be	the	only	individual	not	blinded	to	group	assignment	and	will	222	not	have	contact	with	study	investigators	or	the	research	coordinators	prior	to	the	procedure.		223	An	opaque	sealed	envelope	outlining	group	assignment	(oxytocin	or	IV	fluid	alone)	will	224	accompany	each	solution	of	IV	fluid.		The	research	assistant	will	keep	this	envelope	with	them	225	during	the	procedure.		The	surgeon,	anesthesiologist	and	all	assistants	will	be	blinded	to	group	226	assignment.		However,	the	surgeon	or	anesthesiologist	may	instruct	the	research	assistant	to	227	open	the	envelope	to	determine	group	assignment	if	the	patient	exhibits	signs	of	complications	228	directly	related	to	oxytocin	such	as	anaphylaxis,	arrhythmia,	or	water	intoxication	or	in	case	of	229	emergency	where	the	physician	feels	unblinding	is	necessary.	230		231	Follow-up	procedure		232	
		Version	3		
	8	Study	procedures	will	end	when	the	patient	is	discharged	from	the	medical	facility.		Patients	233	will	receive	standard	post-abortion	care	as	performed	at	the	various	practice	sites.		In	terms	of	234	post-operative	pain	and	satisfaction	assessment,	this	will	be	assessed	approximately	1-hour	235	after	the	D&E	in	the	recovery	room.		Any	complications	that	occur	before	the	patient	is	236	discharged	from	the	medical	facility	will	be	recorded.		237	Study	Flow	Schematic	238			239

Exclusion	Criteria:	260	• Ultrasound	findings	suggestive	of	placenta	accreta	261	• Patients	requiring	preoperative	misoprostol	262		263	In	clinical	research,	pregnant	patients	are	considered	to	be	a	vulnerable	research	population	264	due	to	the	interplay	of	maternal	and	fetal	health	risks.		In	the	case	of	patients	seeking	abortion,	265	the	focus	is	turned	solely	to	the	health	of	the	woman	as	the	pregnancy	is	undesired	and	will	be	266	terminated.			267		268	Minors	are	also	considered	a	vulnerable	research	population	and	we	will	seek	IRB	approval	to	269	include	patients	aged	14-years	and	older.		In	both	Hawaii	and	Washington	State,	parental	270	consent	is	not	required	for	minors	age	14-years	and	older	to	receive	pregnancy	care,	including	271	an	abortion.		According	to	the	American	College	of	Obstetricians	and	Gynecologists	(ACOG)	272	Committee	Opinion	on	“Guidelines	for	Adolescent	Health	Research”,	the	Code	of	Federal	273	Regulations	allows	parental	consent	to	be	waived	in	clinical	situations	where	parental	274	permission	is	not	typically	required.		The	Code	of	Federal	Regulations	also	states	that,	“in	275	certain	research	studies,	adolescent	minors	would	not	be	considered	children	and	parental	276	permission	would	not	be	required.		Such	research	includes	certain	clinical	studies	involving	277	pregnancy,	family	planning,	and	treatment	of	STDs	where	the	adolescent	can	legally	consent	to	278	such	services.”	(16)	There	is	no	published	medical	evidence	or	theoretical	reason	why	279	adolescents	would	have	a	higher	risk	of	complications	during	D&E	than	adults.	280		281	Through	our	consent	process,	we	will	make	it	clear	that	participation	in	this	study	is	voluntary.		282	Participants	will	not	be	approached	until	after	they	have	already	secured	medical	care	for	the	283	abortion	procedure	(i.e.	preoperative	evaluation,	consent	for	the	abortion	procedure,	and	284	scheduling	are	complete).		We	will	not	post	advertisements	for	recruitment	and	will	only	285	approach	patients	who	have	already	consented	to	the	abortion	procedure.		Subjects	will	not	be	286	provided	with	any	remuneration	for	study	participation.		We	will	make	it	clear	that	if	patients	287	are	not	willing	to	participate	in	the	study,	they	will	still	be	provided	the	same	standard	of	care.			288		289	5.

This	study	will	be	conducted	at	UH	(QMC)	and	UW.	295		296	Subject	recruitment,	admission	and	allocation	297	Providers	(listed	in	Appendix	C	–	Roles	of	Personnel)	will	approach	patients	who	meet	inclusion	298	criteria	about	study	participation	at	the	preoperative	visit,	which	takes	place	in	UH	Faculty	299	Practice	Sites	at	least	one-	to	two-days	before	the	procedure.		Invitation	to	participate	will	be	300	offered	only	after	patients	have	received	standard	counseling	and	have	provided	written	301	consent	for	the	abortion	procedure	itself.		It	will	be	made	clear	to	all	patients	that	their	decision	302	to	enroll	or	not	enroll	in	the	study	will	not	affect	their	access	to	requested	abortion	care.		303	Consent	for	the	study	will	be	obtained	by	study	investigators.		In	the	rare	instance	that	the	304	investigators	recruit	another	physician’s	patient,	attending	physician	permission	will	be	305	obtained	first,	before	approaching	the	patient.		After	enrollment,	a	copy	of	the	study	consent	306	will	be	given	to	the	subject	(see	Consent	Form	attachment).	307		308	No	advertisements	will	be	posted	for	this	study.		Subjects	will	be	recruited	at	UH	Faculty	309	Practice	sites	(i.e.	not	part	of	QMC).		At	the	UW	site,	subjects	will	be	recruited	at	Cedar	River	310	Clinic	or	UW	Hospital	and	Clinics	where	they	will	also	perform	the	procedures	in	the	outpatient	311	setting.		On	the	day	of	the	procedure,	the	surgeon	will	meet	with	the	subjects	one-	to	two-312	hours	before	the	procedure	to	confirm	they	are	still	willing	to	participate.			313		314	Criteria	for	Discontinuation		315	Participants	may	end	study	participation	upon	request	at	any	point	in	the	study.		For	example,	316	they	may	withdraw	any	time	prior	to	the	procedure	or	they	may	decline	to	complete	317	postoperative	the	postoperative	satisfaction	and	pain	score.		After	study	consent	and	318	randomization	but	prior	to	the	procedure,	patients	may	be	discontinued	if	it	is	revealed	that	the	319	patient	meets	any	of	the	exclusion	criteria.		320		321	We	will	follow	intention-to-treat	principles	and	analyze	all	data	based	on	its	allocation	322	regardless	of	whether	or	not	the	intervention	was	received.		323		324		325	6.		Study	Procedures/Protocol	326		327	Procedure	setting	328	At	UH	faculty	practice	sites,	surgical	abortions	above	18-weeks	gestation	are	performed	in	an	329	operating	room	setting.		One	of	six	experienced	D&E	providers	will	perform	all	procedures.			At	330	the	UW	site,	one	of	two	experienced	D&E	providers	will	perform	all	abortions	in	either	the	331	operating	room	or	outpatient	surgical	center	setting.		At	both	sites,	fellows	may	participate	in	332	the	procedure	under	direct	supervision.		In	study	documents,	we	will	record	the	name	of	the	333	surgeon,	whether	a	fellow	participated	in	the	procedure	and	their	level	of	training.	334	
		Version	3		
	11		335		336		337	Screening/Preoperative	evaluation	338	Patients	requesting	abortion	procedures	who	meet	inclusion	criteria	will	be	recruited	at	the	339	preoperative	visit	which	typically	occurs	one-	to	two-days	before	the	procedure	at	the	UH	340	faculty	practice	sites,	however,	if	patients	have	any	doubts	or	ambiguity	about	the	abortion,	341	they	can	be	given	as	much	time	as	they	need	to	consider	their	options	before	scheduling	342	surgery.		Study	investigators	will	thoroughly	consent	patients	for	the	study	(see	Subject	343	Recruitment,	Admission,	Allocation).			344		345	Standard	pre-operative	counseling	and	assessment	(including	routine	blood	or	laboratory	tests)	346	will	be	done,	contraceptive	counseling	will	be	performed	and	surgical	consent	will	be	obtained.		347	For	patients	with	HMSA	insurance,	we	have	received	pre-approval	status.		Therefore,	no	348	additional	actions	need	to	be	taken	on	the	part	of	the	subject	or	investigators	to	assure	health	349	insurance	coverage.		The	preoperative	care	of	study	participants	will	differ	from	usual	care	in	350	the	following	way:	351		352	• Components	of	demographic	and	health	related	information	will	be	recorded	in	study	353	documents.		All	information	recorded	in	study	documents	is	part	of	usual	preoperative	354	assessment.		We	will	not	be	obtaining	any	additional	information	from	study	355	participants	356		357	Pre-operative	evaluation	on	the	day	of	surgery	358	In	the	pre-operative	area,	the	following	study	procedures	will	be	performed:	359	• Approximately	one-	to	two-hours	before	the	procedure,	providers	will	confirm	that	360	subjects	are	willing	to	participate.			361	• Pain/Satisfaction	Assessment:		The	research	assistant	will	assess	subject’s	pain	score	362	using	a	10-cm	VAS	and	patient	satisfaction	using	a	5-point	scoring	system	within	60-363	minutes	of	the	procedure.		Assessment	will	be	made	before	any	anesthetic	medications	364	have	been	given.		These	values	will	serve	as	a	baseline	to	compare	with	the	365	postoperative	assessment	described	later.			366		367	Intraoperative	Evaluation	368	Participation	in	this	study	does	not	alter	the	key	portions	of	the	surgical	procedure.		Standard	369	D&E	procedures	will	be	performed	under	ultrasound	guidance	according	to	the	usual	standard	370	of	care.		Each	patient	will	receive	general	anesthesia	or	deep	sedation	with	choice	and	dosage	371	amounts	of	anesthetic	agents	decided	by	the	anesthesiologist.		Unless	there	is	a	372	contraindication,	surgeons	will	give	all	patients	5-units	of	vasopressin	mixed	with	10-mL	of	373	saline	in	a	paracervical	block.		This	is	the	current	practice	at	QMC	based	on	scientific	evidence	374	(17)	and	recommendations	by	the	National	Abortion	Federation	(NAF)	(18)	and	Society	of	375	Family	Planning	(SFP)	(3).		As	is	the	usual	practice,	amniotic	fluid	is	drained	from	the	uterus	376	prior	to	removing	products	of	conception.		Intraoperative	care	of	study	participants	will	differ	377	from	usual	care	in	the	following	ways:			378	
		Version	3		
	12	• Study	Drug	Administration:		Upon	speculum	insertion,	500-ml	of	lactated	ringers	or	500-379	ml	of	lactated	ringers	with	30-units	of	oxytocin	will	be	given	as	an	IV	fluid	bolus	infusion	380	over	approximately	15-minutes.		The	dose	of	oxytocin	is	extrapolated	from	the	obstetric	381	literature;	oxytocin	is	used	at	this	does	at	the	time	of	term	delivery	at	QMC	and	382	throughout	the	US	(16).		Currently,	the	same	dose	of	oxytocin	is	very	commonly	383	administered	at	QMC	on	labor	&	delivery	and	during	D&Es.			384	• Blood	Loss	Measurement:		It	is	the	usual	practice	at	QMC	for	the	surgeon	to	handle	all	385	products	of	conception	throughout	the	procedure	until	it	is	sealed	in	a	specimen	386	container	and	they	will	continue	to	do	so.		Simple	visual	inspection	is	known	to	be	387	inaccurate	in	estimating	blood	loss	(9,	10).		Thus,	following	the	procedure,	the	surgeon	388	or	research	assistant	will	measure	blood	loss	with	a	graduated	cylinder.			389	• Weighing	of	gauze	and	sponges:	Used	gauze	or	sponges	will	be	weighed	and	the	dry	390	weight	of	the	gauze	or	sponge	will	be	subtracted	and	converted	from	grams	to	milliliters	391	using	a	one-to-one	ratio.	392	• Measurement	of	procedure	length:		The	research	coordinator	will	measure	and	record	393	length	of	procedure	in	seconds	starting	from	when	the	speculum	is	placed	and	ending	394	when	the	speculum	is	removed	from	the	vagina.			395		396	In	rare	cases,	the	surgeon	may	not	able	to	separate	amniotic	fluid	from	blood.		In	these	cases,	397	hematocrit	of	the	blood-amniotic	fluid	mixture	will	be	checked	at	completion.		This	hematocrit	398	will	be	compared	to	the	patient’s	preoperative	serum	hematocrit	to	determine	the	dilution	399	ratio	and	ascertain	blood	loss.		We	plan	to	validate	this	process	by	performing	the	same	400	hematocrit	assessment	on	a	subset	of	patients	whose	amniotic	fluid	was	separated	at	the	start.			401	Intraoperative	complications	such	as	hemorrhage	(blood	loss	greater	than	500-ml),	need	for	402	transfusion,	uterine	perforation,	cervical	laceration,	vaginal	laceration,	or	need	for	laparoscopy	403	or	laparotomy	will	be	documented.		Complications	such	as	cervical	or	vaginal	laceration,	or	404	uterine	perforation,	will	be	managed	according	to	current	standards	of	care.		The	research	405	coordinator	will	record	all	such	events	in	the	study	documents.		If	the	surgeon	is	concerned	for	406	excessive	bleeding	due	to	uterine	atony,	measures	will	be	taken	to	manage	it.		The	decision	to	407	intervene	will	be	based	on	signs	of	impending	hemorrhage	such	as	the	presence	of	brisk	and/or	408	prolonged,	bright	red,	vaginal	bleeding	or	accumulation	of	over	200ml	of	blood	loss	with	409	ongoing	significant	bleeding	or	signs	of	hemodynamic	instability.		Ultimately,	the	provider	410	involved	must	use	their	best	clinical	judgment	to	decide	when	to	intervene.		When	providers	411	feel	it	is	necessary	to	intervene,	they	will	perform	the	following	interventions	in	the	order	412	described	below	(3):	413	1. Bimanual	uterine	massage	414	2. Intramuscular	methylergonovine	0.2-milligrams	(may	repeat	dose	in	2-	to	4-hours)	415	3. Rectal	misoprostol	800-micrograms		416	4. 250-micrograms	of	intramuscular	carboprost	tromethamine	(may	repeat	dose	every	417	15-	to	90-minutes)	418	5. Intra-uterine	balloon	tamponade		419	
		Version	3		
	13	6. Additional	surgical	procedures	such	as	re-aspiration	after	procedure	completion,	420	exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy	(including	those	resulting	in	hysterectomy),	421	or	uterine	artery	embolization.	422		423	The	rationale	for	using	an	algorithm	is	to	standardize	the	care	of	patients	and	more	accurately	424	assess	our	main	study	outcome,	the	need	for	intervention	to	control	bleeding.		Study	425	investigators	agreed	upon	the	order	of	interventions	because	it	so	closely	mirrors	current	426	clinical	practice,	though	a	written	algorithm	does	not	currently	exist.		The	algorithm	does	not	427	dictate	that	a	provider	must	wait	a	certain	amount	of	time	between	steps.		If	the	provider	feels	428	they	need	to	move	on	to	the	subsequent	step	in	the	algorithm	to	best	care	for	the	patient,	they	429	may	do	so	at	any	time.		If	contraindications	to	one	of	the	uterotonics	exist,	the	provider	may	430	skip	to	the	next	step	in	the	algorithm	and	this	will	be	documented.			Providers	may	use	431	additional	injections	of	vasopressin	at	any	time	during	the	procedure	at	their	discretion	to	432	control	excess	bleeding;	these	additional	injections	will	be	noted	in	the	study	documents.			433		434	Postoperative	Evaluation	435	After	the	procedure	is	complete,	the	surgical	team	will	transfer	the	patient	to	the	recovery	unit	436	where	she	will	spend	a	minimum	of	60-minutes	(6).		The	following	will	be	performed	in	the	437	postoperative	care	unit:	438	• Pain	management:		All	patients	will	receive	15-milligrams	of	IV	ketorolac	or	500-439	milligrams	of	oral	naproxen	at	the	time	of	procedure	completion	unless	they	have	440	contraindications	to	these	medications	(18,	19).		Anesthesiologists	may	give	alternative	441	or	additional	doses	of	pain	medication	if	the	patient	does	not	obtain	relief	with	initial	442	dose.		All	pain	medications	administered	will	be	recorded	in	study	documents.				443	• Pain/Satisfaction	Assessment:		The	research	assistant	will	assess	patient	satisfaction	and	444	postoperative	pain	60-minutes	after	the	procedure.		Satisfaction	will	be	assessed	using	a	445	5-point	scoring	system	and	pain	will	be	assessed	using	a	10-cm	VAS	(19-21).			446	• Postoperative	Bleeding	Assessment:		Before	the	patient	is	discharged,	the	research	447	assistant	will	collect	and	weigh	all	used	pads	to	quantify	postoperative	bleeding,	448	subtracting	out	the	weight	of	a	dry	pad	from	the	used	pad.			449	• Monitoring	for	Signs	of	Adverse	Events:		Respiratory	rate,	heart	rate	and	oxygen	450	saturation	will	be	continuously	monitored	from	the	time	oxytocin	is	administered	until	451	subject	arrives	in	the	post-operative	area	as	is	the	usual	routine	for	patients	having	452	surgery.		Blood	pressure	will	be	measured	at	frequent	intervals	as	determined	by	the	453	anesthesiologist.		When	patients	are	in	the	postoperative	recovery	area,	vital	signs	will	454	be	checked	per	the	QMC	Same	Day	Surgery	protocol	which	includes	continuous	heart	455	rate	and	oxygen	saturation	with	blood	pressure	checked	every	five-minutes	for	the	first	456	15-minutes,	every	15-minutes	for	the	next	hour,	then	every	hour.		Patients	will	be	asked	457	every	30-minutes	if	they	are	experiencing	symptoms	of	pain,	bleeding,	heart	458	palpitations.		Any	complications	that	occur	postoperatively	will	be	recorded.		459		460	Please	see	attached	Data	Collection	forms,	which	will	be	used	throughout	the	above	processes.		461	See	Study	Flow	Schematic	for	visual	representation	of	the	above.	462		463

	14	7.		Drug	Supply,	Packaging,	Labeling	and	Storage	464	Pitocin	®	or	synthetic	oxytocin	is	made	by	JHP	Pharmaceuticals	in	Rochester,	Michigan.		It	is	465	currently	stocked	by	the	pharmacy	and	a	supply	of	study	medication	may	be	ordered	by	the	466	QMC	pharmacy.		Oxytocin	is	supplied	as	packages	of	twenty-five	oversized	1-mL	vials,	each	467	containing	10	units	of	oxytocin	or	as	a	10-mL	multiple-dose	vial	containing	10	units	of	oxytocin	468	per	mL	(total	=	100	units	of	oxytocin).		It	must	be	stored	at	15°–25°C	(59°–77°F).		With	proper	469	storage,	the	shelf	life	of	this	medication	is	up	to	3-years.		Once	mixed	in	a	bag	of	IV	fluids,	the	470	solution	expires	after	90-days.		The	manufacturer	provides	standard	labeling	of	oxytocin	vials;	471	however,	study	drugs	will	be	re-labeled	by	the	research	pharmacist	to	conceal	the	472	randomization	status	of	the	subject.	All	listed	providers	have	prescribing	privileges	for	study	473	medications.		474		475	8.		Statistical	Methods	476	Patients	may	discontinue	from	the	study	at	any	time.		If	a	patient	withdraws,	we	will	follow	477	intention-to-treat	principles	and	will	analyze	subjects	in	the	groups	they	were	assigned	to.			478		479	Primary	Outcome:		Use	of	any	of	the	following	interventions	to	control	bleeding:	480	• Bimanual	massage	481	• Uterotonics	including:	misoprostol,	carboprost	tromethamine,	methylergonovine	482	• Injection	of	additional	vasopressin	483	• Balloon	tamponade	484	• Re-aspiration	after	procedure	completion	485	• Exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy		486	• Uterine	artery	embolization	487	• Hysterectomy	488		489	We	will	compare	intervention	rates	between	treatment	and	control	groups	using	a	chi-square	490	test.		If	significant	differences	in	demographic	or	abortion	related	characteristics	exist	between	491	study	groups,	we	will	employ	multiple	logistic	regressions	to	control	for	these	differences.			492		493	Secondary	Outcomes:	494	• Measured	blood	will	be	compared	using	a	student’s	t-test.		495	• Procedure	length	will	be	compared	using	a	student’s	t-test	496	• Complications	(described	in	Section	6)	will	be	compared	using	a	chi-square	test	497	• Postoperative	pain	will	be	compared	using	a	student’s	t-test	498	• Patient	Satisfaction	will	be	compared	using	a	student’s	t-test	499		500	We	anticipate	that	some	outcomes	such	as	measured	blood	loss	and	procedure	length	may	not	501	be	normally	distributed.		If	this	is	the	case,	we	will	use	an	appropriate	transformation	to	502	normalize	the	data	distribution	prior	to	analysis.			503		504	
		Version	3		
	15	No	interim	analysis	is	planned.		A	Data	Safety	Monitoring	Board	(DSMB)	has	been	assembled	to	505	review	data	(See	Section	10B,	Page	20).		Otherwise,	the	principal	investigators	will	be	506	responsible	for	protecting	and	monitoring	the	rights,	safety	and	welfare	of	the	subjects	at	each	507	site.		Statistical	analysis	will	be	performed	with	R-software®.		Data	will	be	analyzed	using	508	intention	to	treat	principles.		Missing	data	will	be	noted.		Only	the	primary	investigators	and	509	research	assistants	will	have	access	to	study	records,	which	will	be	kept	in	locked	file	cabinets	in	510	the	study	investigator’s	office.		All	data	will	be	entered	into	a	database	without	personal	health	511	identifiers	for	analysis.		Any	publications	or	presentations	will	be	reported	without	reporting	512	any	personal	health	identifiers.		Any	deviations	from	the	planned	statistical	analysis	will	be	513	documented.		514			515	Number	of	subjects	and	statistical	power	516	Hemorrhage,	defined	as	EBL	greater	than	500-ml,	is	a	rare	outcome	that	occurs	in	less	than	one	517	to	6.3%	of	D&Es	above	18-weeks	gestation	(3-5).		Given	this,	a	study	to	decrease	the	rate	of	518	hemorrhage	would	not	be	feasible	because	it	would	require	a	large	sample.		 Our	primary	519	outcome,	the	rate	of	provider	intervention	to	decrease	bleeding,	represents	a	meaningful	520	clinical	outcome.		When	an	intervention	is	required	to	prevent	excessive	blood	loss	it	adds	time	521	and	expense	to	the	procedure.		Each	intervention	poses	some	increased	risk	of	morbidity.		522	Importantly,	when	additional	interventions	are	required,	it	increases	the	level	of	concern	for	523	the	surgeon.		If	our	study	is	successful,	decreasing	surgical	time	and	healthcare	costs	will	be	a	524	strong	motivation	for	others	to	adopt	this	intervention.			525		526	Though	a	study	may	have	several	measured	outcomes,	the	sample	size	is	based	on	the	study’s	527	primary	outcome.	In	this	study,	the	primary	outcome	is	the	rate	of	intervention	to	decrease	528	excess	blood	loss.		Our	primary	outcome,	the	rate	of	provider	intervention	to	decrease	529	bleeding,	represents	a	meaningful	clinical	outcome.		When	an	intervention	is	required	to	530	prevent	excessive	blood	loss	it	adds	time	and	expense	to	the	procedure.		Each	intervention	531	poses	some	increased	risk	of	morbidity.		Importantly,	when	additional	interventions	are	532	required,	it	increases	the	level	of	concern	for	the	surgeon.		We	think	the	rate	of	provider	533	intervention	is	the	most	important	factor	a	surgeon	will	consider	when	deciding	whether	to	use	534	a	medication	like	oxytocin.		If	our	study	is	successful,	decreasing	surgical	time	and	healthcare	535	costs	will	be	a	strong	motivation	for	others	to	adopt	this	intervention.			536		537	Other	outcomes	we	will	collect	data	on	in	this	study	include	measured	blood	loss,	procedure	538	time,	complications	(uterine	perforation,	cervical	or	vaginal	laceration,	hemorrhage	(blood	loss	539	greater	than	500-ml),	need	for	transfusion,	exploratory	laparotomy	or	laparoscopy,	540	postoperative	pain,	and	patient	satisfaction.		Though	each	of	these	is	important,	the	sample	541	size	in	a	research	study	is	based	on	the	ability	to	demonstrate	differences	in	the	primary	542	outcome.				543		544	Based	on	an	unpublished	study	from	Oregon	Health	and	Science	University	(OHSU)	that	was	545	performed	with	patients	in	the	same	gestational	age	as	proposed	here,	we	have	estimated	our	546	baseline	need	for	intervention	to	be	20%	(22).		We	have	deemed	a	decrease	of	15%	from	20%	547	to	5%	to	represent	a	clinically	significant	change.		In	other	words,	we	are	trying	to	show	that	548	
		Version	3		
	16	prophylactic	oxytocin	will	change	the	provider	intervention	rate	from	20%	in	the	unexposed	549	(placebo)	group	to	5%	in	the	exposed	(treatment)	group.		A	clinically	significant	decrease	means	550	that	the	effect	size	is	large	enough	to	be	important	to	physicians	and	patients.		Thus,	we	believe	551	that	a	surgeon	will	be	willing	to	use	a	medication,	in	this	case	oxytocin,	if	it	will	decrease	their	552	need	to	perform	additional	interventions	from	20%	to	5%.			553		554	For	results	to	be	meaningful	scientifically,	they	must	also	be	statistically	significant.		Statistical	555	significance	is	based	on	two	parameters,	power	and	alpha.		By	convention,	research	studies	556	typically	set	power	at	0.80	or	80%	meaning	there	is	an	80%	chance	of	detecting	a	difference	557	between	two	treatments	if	a	real	difference	exists	and	a	20%	of	making	a	false-negative	558	conclusion.		Alpha	is	conventionally	set	at	0.05	or	5%	meaning	there	is	a	5%	chance	that	results	559	were	due	to	chance	rather	than	a	true	difference	(false-positive	conclusion).	560		561	We	based	our	sample	size	calculations	on	these	conventions:	power	of	0.80	and	alpha	of	0.05.		562	Based	on	these	parameters,	we	calculated	that	a	sample	size	of	75-subjects	per	group	is	needed	563	to	demonstrate	a	difference	of	15%.	To	account	for	a	projected	10%	dropout	rate,	we	will	564	randomize	83-subjects	to	each	group	for	a	total	enrollment	of	166-subjects.		If	we	meet	our	565	recruitment	goals,	we	will	have	the	ability	to	demonstrate	a	decrease	of	15%	or	more	in	the	566	need	for	interventions	to	decrease	bleeding.			567	9.		Risks/Benefit	Assessment	568		569	Risk	Category	570	This	study	presents	minimal	risk	to	the	subjects	involved.		Minimal	risk	is	defined	as	"the	571	probability	and	magnitude	of	harm	or	discomfort	anticipated	in	the	research	are	not	greater	572	than	those	ordinarily	encountered	in	daily	life	or	during	the	performance	of	routine	physical	or	573	psychological	exams	or	tests."		The	study	involves	routine	venipuncture	which	would	be	done	574	regardless	of	whether	an	individual	participated	in	this	study.			575		576	Any	patient	who	undergoes	a	D&E	is	at	risk	for	bleeding.		For	patients	in	the	treatment	group,	577	although	oxytocin	has	a	theoretical	risk	of	adverse	events	including	cardiac	arrythmia,	water	578	intoxication,	uterine	rupture,	and	allergic	reaction,	these	events	are	rare	and	have	not	been	579	documented	during	D&E	(12-15).		These	adverse	events	are	more	likely	to	occur	to	patients	580	who	are	exposed	to	large	and/or	prolonged	doses	of	oxytocin,	such	as	doses	used	for	labor	581	induction	(23,	24).		No	cases	of	water	intoxication	have	been	reported	with	a	single	30-unit	582	infusion	diluted	in	500-ml	of	IV	fluid	at	the	time	of	D&E.		Because	oxytocin	is	already	very	583	commonly	used	during	D&E	at	QMC,	the	risk	posed	to	the	patient	by	this	study	is	minimal	as	it	584	is	not	outside	of	the	standard	of	care	for	this	procedure.	Care	will	be	taken	throughout	the	585	surgery	and	in	the	post-operative	area	to	identify	any	signs	of	side	effects	from	study	drug	586	usage.			587		588	If	bleeding	occurs	to	patients	in	the	placebo	group,	many	other	suitable	medications	and	589	procedures,	aside	from	oxytocin,	are	readily	available	if	needed.		Furthermore,	many	590	
		Version	3		
	17	practitioners	throughout	the	country	do	not	use	oxytocin	routinely	so	the	placebo	protocol	591	would	not	be	considered	outside	the	current	standard-of-care.	592		593	Experiencing	an	unplanned	pregnancy	or	a	fetal	demise	can	be	a	stressful	time	for	a	patient.		594	However,	this	study	does	not	add	any	additional	psychological	or	social	risks	to	the	subject.		The	595	patient	will	not	incur	any	additional	economical	costs	for	study	participation	nor	will	596	remuneration	be	provided.		Patient	will	be	made	aware	that	she	can	discontinue	the	study	at	597	any	time	and	that	she	will	still	be	offered	the	procedure	she	requests.		We	will	utilize	a	data	598	safety-monitoring	plan	(DSMP)	(see	Section	10B)	to	monitor	and	track	adverse	events	that	may	599	be	related	to	the	investigation.		If	this	study	meets	criteria	for	an	interim	analysis	and	a	review	600	of	the	data	demonstrates	the	study	posing	significant	risk	to	the	subjects,	we	will	stop	the	study	601	at	that	time.			602		603	Potential	Benefits	604	There	are	likely	no	direct	benefits	to	the	subjects	who	participate	in	this	study.		Because	we	do	605	not	believe	that	oxytocin	will	significantly	affect	bleeding	during	D&E,	we	do	not	think	that	the	606	treatment	group	will	receive	any	direct	benefits	over	the	placebo	group.		Overall,	the	results	of	607	the	study	will	help	patients	having	D&Es	in	the	future.		If	oxytocin	is	ineffective	at	decreasing	608	the	need	for	interventions	to	control	bleeding	during	D&E,	we	can	stop	administering	it,	609	thereby	decreasing	health	care	costs.	If	it	is	found	to	be	effective,	routine	use	of	it	could	help	610	women	avoid	complications	of	excess	bleeding	in	the	future	and	decrease	overall	morbidity	and	611	mortality	associated	with	this	procedure.		Because	there	is	currently	no	established	“standard	612	of	care”	regarding	uterotonic	use	during	D&Es,	results	from	this	study	may	help	to	develop	613	future	guidelines	that	would	direct	providers	in	how	to	optimally	care	for	their	patients.		614		615	Financial	Obligations/Cost:	616	It	will	be	made	clear	that	subjects	will	not	be	billed	for	study	drug	or	additional	hematocrit	tests	617	necessary	to	determine	blood	loss.		All	standard	of	care	labs,	medications	and	procedures	will	618	be	billed	through	the	subjects'	insurance.	There	will	be	no	compensation	offered	for	injury	or	619	adverse	events	of	this	study.	620		621	10.		Safety	&	Adverse	Events	622		623	A.		Adverse	Event	(AE)	Reporting	624	An	adverse	event	is	defined	as	any	adverse	finding,	temporally	associated	with	drug	use.		These	625	findings	include	an	abnormal	physical	finding	or	sign,	a	new	or	increased	symptom,	and	626	abnormal	test	or	laboratory	study,	or	a	cluster	of	signs,	symptoms,	and	abnormal	assessments.		627	An	unexpected	adverse	drug	experience	is	defined	as	any	adverse	drug	experience,	the	628	specificity	or	severity	of	which	is	not	consistent	with	the	risk	information	described	in	the	629	general	investigational	plan	or	has	been	previously	observed	in	relation	to	this	medication.	630	
		Version	3		
	18	A	severe	adverse	event	is	defined	as	any	adverse	drug	experience	occurring	at	any	dose	that	631	results	in	any	of	the	following	outcomes:	death,	a	life-threatening	adverse	drug	experience,	632	inpatient	hospitalization	or	prolongation	of	existing	hospitalization,	a	persistent	or	significant	633	disability/incapacity,	or	a	congenital	anomaly/birth	defect.		An unexpected adverse event is 634	defined as any adverse drug experience, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent 635	with the risk information described in the general investigational plan. Unexpected, as used in 636	this definition, refers to an adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed.		Any	637	SAE,	whether	or	not	related	to	the	study	product,	will	be	reported	to	the	IRB	and	if	appropriate,	638	the	FDA,	within	24-hours.	The	initial	SAE	report	will	be	followed	by	submission	of	a	completed	639	SAE	report.	640	Adverse	events	due	to	oxytocin	are	anticipated	to	be	extremely	unusual	in	this	study.		Possible	641	AEs	include,	electrolyte	imbalances,	severe	allergic	reactions,	and	heart	beat	abnormalities.		Of	642	note,	none	of	these	adverse	events	have	been	reported	during	D&E	procedures.		The	643	healthcare	providers	will	monitor	subjects	for	signs	of	adverse	events	during	the	procedure	and	644	in	the	post-operative	area	via	routine	frequent	vital	sign	assessments.		(See	Section	6,	645	Postoperative	Evaluation)		All	subjects	will	be	informed	about	the	definitions	of	AEs	and	SAEs,	646	and	asked	to	report	these	events	during	participation.		All	AEs	and	SAEs	occurring	during	the	647	course	of	the	study	will	be	collected,	documented,	and	reported	to	the	Principal	Investigator	on	648	an	AE	or	SAE	Forms.	Each	week,	study	investigators	will	review	these	forms	from	the	previous	649	week	for	events	that	were	reported	as	new	or	continuing.	The	study	investigators	will	follow	all	650	AEs	and	SAEs	to	the	point	of	a	satisfactory	resolution.		Unanticipated	non-serious	adverse	651	events	will	be	reported	within	30	days.		All	SAEs	will	be	reported	to	one	of	the	PIs	within	24-652	hours.		653		654	In	the	event	that	a	subject	is	withdrawn	from	the	study	or	the	investigator	decides	to	655	discontinue	a	subject	due	to	an	SAE,	the	subject	will	have	appropriate	follow-up	medical	656	monitoring.	Monitoring	will	continue	until	the	problem	identified	has	resolved	or	stabilized	with	657	no	further	change	expected,	is	clearly	unrelated	to	the	study	product,	or	results	in	death.	658	Outcomes	of	SAEs	and	unexpected	AEs	that	occurred	during	the	previous	year	will	be	included	659	in	progress	reports	to	the	IRB.		660		661		662	B.		Data	&	Safety	Monitoring	(DSM)	663	The	principal	investigators	will	be	primarily	responsible	for	protecting	and	monitoring	the	664	rights,	safety	and	welfare	of	the	subjects.		These	investigators	will	meet	regularly	(i.e.	weekly	or	665	bimonthly	depending	on	subject	enrollment)	with	the	research	coordinators	to	monitor	data	666	quality.			667		668	We	will	create	a	DSMP	to	track	and	monitor	any	potential	adverse	outcomes	to	study	subjects.		669	The	DSM	report	summary	will	be	sent	to	the	IRB	on	a	twice-annual	basis	or	more	frequently	if	670	requested	as	part	of	an	ongoing	progress	report.		Included	in	the	DSM	report	will	be:	subject	671	sociodemographic	characteristics,	expected	versus	actual	recruitment	rates,	retention	rates,	672	
		Version	3		
	19	any	quality	assurance	or	regulatory	issues	occurring	during	that	period,	summary	of	AEs	and	673	SAEs,	and	any	action	or	changes	to	the	protocol	since	last	report.		Routine	documented	674	meetings	will	be	held	to	review	study	progress,	AEs,	SAES,	and	update	changes	to	the	protocol	675	at	least	every	six	weeks.		If	there	is	a	clear	trend	in	adverse	events,	unblinding	can	be	done	at	676	any	time	and	the	study	may	be	terminated	early	if	it	is	felt	that	the	study	poses	untoward	677	effects	on	subjects.			678		679	All	Adverse	Events	(AE)	as	defined	in	Section	10	(Safety	&	Adverse	Events,	Page	18)	occurring	680	during	the	course	of	the	study	will	be	collected	and	documented.		Each	week,	a	study	681	investigator	will	review	accumulated	AE	events	from	the	previous	week.		The	study	682	investigators	will	follow	all	AEs	to	the	point	of	a	satisfactory	resolution.		All	AEs	will	be	assessed	683	to	determine	if	they	meet	criteria	for	a	serious	adverse	event	(SAE)	or	unexpected	adverse	684	event	(UAE),	also	defined	in	Section	10.		Any	SAE	or	UAE	will	be	reported	to	the	PI	(or	a	co-685	investigator	if	the	PI	is	not	available)	within	24-hours.		686		687	Any	UAE	and	SAE,	whether	or	not	related	to	the	study	drug,	will	be	reported	to	the	DSMB	688	within	24	hours.	The	DSMB	will	meet	at	the	start	of	the	study	and	will	reconvene	after	the	first	689	10	patients	have	been	recruited	from	the	UH	site.		Thereafter,	they	will	meet	after	a	total	of	30	690	patients	and	50	patients	have	been	recruited	from	the	UH	site.		If	it	takes	more	than	6	month	691	intervals	to	reach	these	recruitment	milestones,	a	meeting	will	be	convened	so	that	no	longer	692	than	6	months	will	pass	without	a	meeting.		If	an	SAE	or	UAE	occurs,	the	DSMB	will	be	693	convened	within	a	week	to	review	the	SAE	or	UAE.					694		695	At	scheduled	meetings,	the	DSMB	will	review	and	evaluate	accumulated	study	data	for	696	participant	safety,	study	conduct	and	progress,	and	make	recommendations	concerning	the	697	continuation,	modification,	or	termination	of	the	trial.		As	recommended	by	the	National	698	Institutes	of	Health,	the	DSMB	will	be	responsible	for	defining	its	processes,	including	event	699	triggers	that	would	call	for	an	unscheduled	review,	stopping	guidelines,	unmasking	(unblinding)	700	and	voting	procedures	prior	to	initiating	any	data	review	(25).		These	event	triggers	would	701	include	but	not	be	limited	to:		serious	adverse	events	(see	Page	18,	Section	10)	or	a	trend	in	702	increased	rates	of	side	effects	or	complications	to	study	subjects.	703		704	Data	Safety	Monitoring	Plan	will	include	the	following	protection	elements:			705	• Subject	Safety	&	Protection:		No	data	collection	activities	will	begin	until	IRB	approval	706	has	occurred.	To	screen	for	adverse	events,	vital	signs	will	be	continuously	monitored	707	during	the	surgical	procedure	and	patients	will	be	frequently	assessed	until	discharged	708	home	(See	Section	3,	Postoperative	Evaluation).		Subjects	will	be	removed	from	the	709	study	at	any	point	if	they	request	to	do	so	or	if	there	are	any	unanticipated	problems	710	involving	risks	to	subjects	or	others,	unexplained	adverse	outcomes,	or	life	threatening	711	adverse	events.		Any	such	issues	will	be	reported	to	the	IRB	(See	Section	10,	Adverse	712	Event	Reporting).		We	will	still	follow	an	intent-to-treat	analysis.	713		714	• Data	Integrity:		Primary	investigators	will	assure	that	subject	inclusion	criteria	are	being	715	met,	transcription	of	data	is	accurate	and	complete,	units	of	measure	are	recorded	716	
		Version	3		
	20	appropriately,	and	calculations	are	standardized	and	performed	accurately.		This	will	717	occur	on	a	biweekly	or	monthly	schedule	depending	on	subject	enrollment.	718		719	• Subject	Privacy:		Subjects	will	be	consented	privately	and	in-person	by	the	investigators	720	(See	Section	5,	Subject	Recruitment,	Admission,	Allocation).		All	questions	will	be	721	answered	before	subject	signs	consent.	722		723	• Data	Confidentiality	&	Study	Documentation:		All	subjects	will	be	assigned	a	unique	724	study	ID	number.	No	identifying	information	will	be	used	in	data	analysis	procedures	or	725	in	research	reports.		Only	Principal	Investigators,	and	research	coordinator(s)	involved	in	726	the	conduct	of	this	study	will	have	access	to	patient	data	that	include	personal	727	identifiers.	Data	will	be	recorded	in	a	paper	chart	and	converted	into	electronic	file.		We	728	will	keep	paper	charts	in	a	locked	drawer	and	password-protect	electronic	files.	We	will	729	keep	codes	linking	the	study	identification	number	with	the	name	of	the	subject	730	confidential,	secured	by	password-protected	data	file	within	the	locked	research	unit	of	731	the	Principal	Investigator.		All	information	collected	during	this	study	will	be	kept	private	732	to	the	extent	allowed	by	federal,	state	and	local	law.		Data	will	be	de-identified	prior	to	733	analysis.		Patient	identifiers	that	link	them	to	data	collected	during	the	conduct	of	this	734	study	will	be	destroyed	at	the	earliest	possible	opportunity	consistent	with	study	735	conduct	and	applicable	research	regulations.	Records	will	be	destroyed	by	the	UH-736	contracted	shredder	service	when	applicable.	737		738	• Product	Accountability:		The	research	pharmacist	will	be	responsible	for	ordering,	739	mixing,	labeling,	storing,	and	disposing	of	expired/unused	study	drugs.		This	will	be	done	740	in	accordance	with	study	specifics	(see	Section	6,	Description	of	Drug	to	be	Studied)	and	741	will	be	overseen	by	the	Primary	Investigators.	742		743	• Rights	of	Refusal	and	Withdrawal:		Patients	will	be	free	to	refuse	enrollment	or	744	withdraw	from	the	study	at	any	time.		Participants	may	refuse	to	answer	individual	745	questions	posed	throughout	the	study.			746	11.		Data	Handling	&	Record	Keeping	747		748	A.		Confidentiality	&	Data	Security	749	Information	about	study	subjects	will	be	kept	confidential	and	managed	according	to	the	750	requirements	of	the	Health	Insurance	Portability	and	Accountability	Act	of	1996	(HIPAA).		Those	751	regulations	require	a	signed	subject	authorization	informing	the	subject	of	the	following:		752	i.	What	protected	health	information	(PHI)	will	be	collected	from	subjects	in	this	study	753	ii.	Who	will	have	access	to	that	information	and	why	754	iii.	Who	will	use	or	disclose	that	information	755	iv.	The	rights	of	a	research	subject	to	revoke	their	authorization	for	use	of	their	PHI.		756		757	
		Version	3		
	21	In	the	event	that	a	subject	revokes	authorization	to	collect	or	use	PHI,	the	investigator,	by	758	regulation,	retains	the	ability	to	use	all	information	collected	prior	to	the	revocation	of	subject	759	authorization.		For	subjects	that	have	revoked	authorization	to	collect	or	use	PHI,	attempts	760	should	be	made	to	obtain	permission	to	collect	at	least	vital	status	(i.e.	that	the	subject	is	alive)	761	at	the	end	of	their	scheduled	study	period.	762		763	Consent	forms	are	drafted	and	included	in	Appendix	D.		These	consent	forms	will	be	approved	764	by	each	institutions’	IRB.		The	consent	forms	at	UH	(QMC),	will	be	provided	in	the	English	765	language	only	and	therefore	study	will	only	be	available	to	those	patients	with	command	of	the	766	English	language.	Consent	forms	will	be	reviewed	with	each	subject	when	they	are	admitted	to	767	the	study.		Subjects	will	be	given	a	copy	of	the	signed	document	for	their	records	768		769	Hard	copies	of	clinical	information	and	data	will	always	be	kept	in	a	secured	place	in	our	770	research	offices,	and	only	study	team	members	will	be	able	to	access	them	on	an	as-needed	771	basis.		Key	personnel	may	not	alter	the	data	in	any	database	without	specific	cause	and	772	approval	of	the	Investigator.		For	de-identification,	all	subjects	will	be	assigned	a	unique	study	773	ID	number	when	they	enter	the	study.		Data	will	be	recorded	in	a	paper	chart	and	converted	774	into	electronic	file	database.		Study	databases	will	be	password	protected,	and	all	portable	775	devices	will	be	fully	encrypted.		No	data	will	be	sent	over	the	Internet	unless	it	is	de-identified;	776	data	will	be	sent	from	UW	to	UH	but	not	from	UH	to	UW.		Data	will	be	de-identified	prior	to	any	777	analysis.		We	will	keep	codes	linking	the	study	identification	number	with	the	name	of	the	778	subject	confidential,	secured	by	password-protected	data	file	within	the	locked	research	unit	of	779	the	Principal	Investigators	at	each	site.		Further	measures	to	ensure	data	security	will	adhere	to	780	security	standards	set	by	the	QMC	and	the	Research	and	Institutional	Review	Committee.	781		782	B.		Record	Retention	783	Study	documents	will	be	retained	for	at	least	three	years	after	the	formal	discontinuation	of	784	this	project.		They	will	be	stored	in	locked,	secured	cabinets	in	the	PI’s	office.		All	data	will	be	785	de-identified.		Any	electronic	files	will	be	password	protected	and	encrypted.		If	both	Primary	786	Investigators	leave	Hawaii,	they	will	make	arrangements	to	store	the	data	with	the	UH	787	Department	of	OBGYN	to	be	destroyed	at	the	designated	time.			788		789	C.		Direct	Access	to	Source	Data/Documents	790	The	investigators	will	permit	study-related	monitoring,	audits,	RIRC	review,	and	regulatory	791	inspections/audits	by	providing	direct	access	to	all	study	related	data/documents.		This	will	be	792	indicated	in	the	consent	process	with	the	potential	subjects.	793		794	12.		Ethical	Considerations	795		796	
		Version	3		
	22	This	study	will	be	conducted	according	to	US	and	international	standards	of	Good	Clinical	797	Practice,	applicable	government	regulations	and	institutional	research	policies	and	procedures.	798		799	This	protocol	and	any	amendments	will	be	submitted	to	The	Queen’s	Medical	Center	Research	800	and	Institutional	Review	Committee	(RIRC)	for	formal	approval	to	conduct	the	study.		The	801	decision	of	the	RIRC	concerning	the	conduct	of	the	study	will	be	made	in	writing	to	the	802	investigator	and	a	copy	of	this	decision	will	be	provided	to	the	sponsor	before	commencement	803	of	this	study.	804		805	All	subjects	for	this	study	will	be	provided	an	informed	consent	form	describing	this	study	and	806	providing	sufficient	information	for	subjects	to	make	an	informed	decision	about	their	807	participation	in	this	study.		This	consent	form	will	be	submitted	with	the	protocol	for	review	808	and	approval	by	the	RIRC	for	the	study.		The	formal	consent	of	a	subject,	using	the	RIRC-809	approved	consent	form,	must	be	obtained	before	that	subject	has	any	study	procedure.		This	810	consent	form	must	be	signed	by	the	subject	or	legally	acceptable	surrogate,	and	the	811	investigator-designated	research	professional	obtaining	consent.	812		813	For	other	“Ethical	considerations	of	study	population,”	see	Section	4.			814		815	13.		Study	Finances	816	• Study	funds	from	this	project	are	through	a	grant	from	the	Society	of	Family	Planning	(see	817	attached	grant	letter).	These	funds	will	go	towards	salaries	of	staff,	paying	for	the	study	818	drug	(oxytocin),	any	additional	blood	work	that	is	done	solely	to	help	ascertain	blood	loss	819	instead	of	treat	patient,	and	all	additional	equipment	not	otherwise	typically	present	in	an	820	operating	room	and	clerical	necessities.	(see	Appendix	B	–	Budget	for	more	information).		821	All	of	the	other	healthcare	costs	are	standard-of-care	that	would	be	billed	to	the	patient	or	822	her	insurance	regardless	of	whether	or	not	she	was	participating	in	a	study.		823	• Study	funds	will	pay	for	the	research	medications	(oxytocin)	and	an	additional	laboratory	824	tests	(like	hematocrit)	that	are	outside	the	standard-of-care.		Otherwise,	patient	or	patient’s	825	insurance	will	pay	for	the	costs	of	the	procedure.		826	• The	PI	or	the	physician	performing	the	procedure	will	provide	emergency	medical	827	treatment,	but	the	subject’s	insurance	will	be	billed	for	this	treatment.		No	other	payment	is	828	available.	829	• There	is	no	remuneration	being	offered	for	the	subjects.		830	• The	PIs	have	no	financial	or	personal	conflict-of-interest	with	this	study	medication.	831		832	14.

Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  1.0 Background 
 
1.1 Ovarian cancer is an aggressive malignancy that results in over 15,000 deaths per year in 
the United States [1]. Most patients diagnosed with this cancer die from it. Nonetheless, the fact that approximately 25% of patients with even stage IIIC -- that is, large (> 2cm) peritoneal metastases that extend beyond the pelvis and the most commonly diagnosed stage of ovarian cancer -- can be cured underscores the need to maximize the efficacy of 
the therapeutic approaches that are recognized as contributing to this small chance of cure 
[1].  
 
1.2 Capitalizing on Therapeutic Modalities with Demonstrated Efficacy :  Aggressive 
Surgery.   Although novel therapeutic interventions continue to emerge, the medical 
literature clearly demonstrates the importance of thoroughly capitalizing on therapeutic 
modalities that have already demonstrated an essential therapeutic role.  For example, a 
large body of literature shows that the definition of “optimal debulking” of tumor dramatically improves overall survival, and the definition of this term has evolved over time to the benefit of patients with ovarian cancer [2].  Previously, residual nodules of 1 cm or less in size defined an optimal debulking surgery, but now this definition has been 
further refined as yielding “no gross residual tumor.”  Indeed, Chi and others have 
illustrated the importance of operating to achieve “no gross residual tumor.” Examining 465 patients, these investigators assessed various prognostic factors, most relevantly, the extent of postoperative residual disease [2].  In multivariate analyses, hazard survival ratios (95% confidence intervals) increased significantly based on postoperative assessment of extent of residual disease:  no gross residual disease (reference);  </= 1 cm 
of gross residual disease yielded a hazard ratio of 2.07 (1.23, 3.46);  and > 1 cm gross 
residual disease yielded a hazard ratio 3.70 (2.27, 6.04).  These investigators concluded that the goal of any surgery for ovarian cancer should be “no gross residual disease” and, in the absence of this outcome, surgical cytoreduction to the greatest extent possible should be undertaken.  Such conclusions are relevant because they underscore the 
observation that highly aggressive surgeries that include enterotomies, resections of large 
portions of bowel, and manipulation of the bowel are not only commonplace but also highly justified in the state -of-the-art treatment of ovarian cancer.   
 Indeed, the aggressiveness of these surgeries has yielded grade 3 or worse complication rates, which include death, in the range of 15 -22%, as reported from high- volume 
medical centers [3,4].  Such notable complication rates underscore the need to evaluate strategies not only to lessen postoperative complications but also to improve long -term 
survival by means of exploring interventions to enhance postoperative recovery and thereby enable the prompt administration of chemotherapy.  
 
1.3 Capitalizing on Therapeutic Modalities with Demonstrated Efficacy :  The Timely 
Administration of Post-Operative Chemotherapy.   Mahner and others recently 
demonstrated that timely administration of postoperative chemotherapy to patients with ovarian cancer improves outcomes [5].  These investigators examined individual patient data from 3326 ovarian cancer patients who had participated in 3 prospective phase III trials.  Within this large cohort, the median time to chemotherapy was 19 days (range 1, 
56 days), but starting chemotherapy sooner appeared to confer a survival advantage.  
Among patients who had had an optimal debulking surgery, a longer time to chemotherapy initiation was associated with a poorer survival (per week delay hazard ratio=1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.005, 1.176; p=0.038).  Indeed, a one week delay in 
MC1267  6 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  chemotherapy yielded an 8.7% increase in mortality in patients who had received an 
optimal debulking surgery.  These data point to the importance of the timely 
administration of chemotherapy in patients who have undergone an optimal debulking 
surgery for ovarian cancer.  
 The above data become even more compelling when one considers preclinical data on surgery, the timing of chemotherapy, and tumor growth.  Fisher and others used a murine mammary tumor model to assess mitotic activity within tumors [6].  Assessing mitotic 
activity at various time points with respect to surgery, these investigators observed that an 
increase in mitotic activity and tumor growth occurred during the first 3-4 days after surgery and that the administration of cyclophosphamide the day of surgery was more advantageous in suppressing tumor growth.  In addition, Gunduz and others showed that tumor growth within residual malignant disease gained momentum to an extent that did 
not seem to occur in the absence of surgery, thus also suggesting that prompt 
administration of chemotherapy post -operatively is advantageous [7].  Taken together, 
such data provide preclinical justification to bolster further the conclusions from Mahner and others that the early administration of chemotherapy after optimal surgical debulking for ovarian cancer leads to more favorable clinical outcomes.  
 Admittedly, not all data provide a consistent message on the importance of the timing of the administration of chemotherapy in postoperative ovarian cancer patients.  In an earlier review from Larsen and Blaakaer, this issue was discussed in detail in the context of a systematic analysis of seven previously -published studies [8].  Although two of the 
studies included in this review also suggested that prompt administration of 
chemotherapy led to improved outcomes, the other five reported no significant 
differences in outcomes -- neither in a positive nor negative direction -- with the prompt 
administration of chemotherapy.  Many factors might account for the negative neutral findings in these 5 studies, including 1) retrospective bias, or the plausible possibility that patients with worse prognostic factors may have started chemotherapy sooner, thus 
balancing out these negative prognostic factors but not improving clinical outcomes;  2)  
small sample sizes but with the larger studies in this analysis suggesting in either univariate or sub-analyses that timely chemotherapy administration may in fact be clinically advantageous with improved survival;  and 3)  relatively small variability in chemotherapy timing in general which again suggests that a much larger sample size might be necessary to detect subtle clinical benefits with early administration of 
chemotherapy.  Despite the above, the recent, robust data from Mahner and others, the 
other two supporting studies referenced by Larsen and Blaakaer, the fact that plausible explanations can be invoked to account for the neutral negative findings observed in the five previous studies, an absolute lack of negative studies that show clear clinical detriment with the early administration of postoperative chemotherapy in retrospective 
studies, and preclinical studies which also advocate for the early administration of 
chemotherapy --  all indicate a need to investigate ways to treat ovarian cancer patients promptly in a postoperative setting and justify proceeding with the current proposal.  
 
1.4 Oral Serum Bovine Immunoglobulin (SBI):  A Review of Preclinical and Clinical 
Findings.  Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is an orally 
administered prescription medical food containing a proprietary formulation of immunoglobulins (> 50% IgG) and other serum proteins.  The term medical food, as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21USC.360ee(b) (3) is “a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a…. condition for which 
MC1267  7 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  distinctive nutritional requirements based on recognized scientific principles, are 
established by medical evaluation.”   Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein 
isolate is intended for the nutritional management of a patient who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone.  Serum -derived 
bovine immunoglobulin has self -affirmed generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status 
with no objections from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
A large portion of SBI consists of immunoglobulins, primarily IgG and to a lesser extent IgM as well as other proteins and amino acids.  SBI is derived from manufacturing processes for bovine serum albumin (BSA), making it a valuable but easily accessible byproduct.  Previous studies show that SBI resists part of the digestive process and that 
some of active IgG remains present in the gastrointestinal tract.  This combination of 
immunoglobulins and other proteins are thought to lead to the immunomodulatory effects of SBI and are thought to lead to maintenance of the intestine as a barrier and attenuation of malabsorption after an inflammatory assault to the gastrointestinal tract.  Indeed, when taken together, previous studies show that oral ingestion of SBI improves the absorption 
of nutrients, reduces intestinal permeability, and decreases overall infection rates.  The 
most striking clinical evidence in support of the above entails the administration of SBI to weanling farm animals with the observation of increased dietary intake and greater weight gain compared to control animals [9-11].  The published literature is replete with observations that show animals maintain their weight during the weaning process and continue to thrive as a result of SBI supplementation.  
 Although studied on a far smaller scale in humans, SBI has nonetheless been studied clinically, and these early clinical studies outline a need to further study SBI within other 
medical conditions . At least 5 previous clinical studies demonstrate the complete safety 
of SBI in both children and adults with even some early evidence of clinical improvement 
in various medical conditions .  First, Lembecke and others focused on 10 male children, 
ages 9 to 25 months, with severe malnutrition.  These children were supplemented with 
SBI over a 7 -day period during their nutritional recovery [12]. With SBI 
supplementation, they manifested a drop in fecal wet and dry weight, an observation that might suggest greater absorption of fat and energy perhaps as a result of this supplementation.  Although no major differences over time were seen in these children’s 
growth patterns, importantly, this intervention did not result in any adverse events.  
Second, Begin and others conducted a randomized trial in children less than 1 year of age from an impoverished region of Guatemala.  Children were randomly assigned to 4 different nutritional supplements, two of which included SBI [13].  One hundred seven of these children received SBI.  Although this 8 -month intervention did not improve growth 
patterns or morbidity as had been hoped, absolutely no adverse events related to SBI were observed.  In a third study, Earnest and others evaluated 52 adults, both men and women, with hypercholesterolemia to test the hypothesis that milk prote ins such as SBI 
might have a salutary effect on cholesterol [14].  In this randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled trial, SBI did result in a statistically significant reduction in LDL 
cholesterol over 6 weeks with no similar changes in the placebo group.  Once again, no 
adverse events occurred with the use of SBI.  Fourth, in a small 8 -patient study of AIDS 
patients who were suffering from HIV enteropathy, supplementation with SBI over 8 
weeks at a dose of 2.5 grams orally BID yielded a drop in the fr equency of bowel 
movements from 5.7 per day to 2 per day (unpublished date, personal communication from Gerald Klein, M.D., from Entera Health).  Patients also reported an improvement in 
MC1267  8 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  gastrointestinal-related quality of life that occurred concomitantly with supplementation.  
As anticipated, this intervention was again well -tolerated . 
 Finally, a 51 -patient unpublished study focused on irritable bowel disease, randomly 
assigning patients to SBI 10 grams per day versus SBI 5 grams per day versus placebo (unpublished date, personal communication from Gerald Klein, M.D., from Entera Health).  Patients assigned to the 10 g/day SBI supplement reported a drop in the number of days of symptoms, including abdominal pain (P=.008), flatulence (P=.003); bloating 
(P=.044); loose stools (P=.011), and urgency of defecation (P=.050), although 
statistically significant differences between groups were not detected.  At the same time, this dose of SBI was considered safe with no adverse events. These findings suggest a role for further SBI for its potential salutary bowel effects and for testing the 10 gram dose in the proposed postoperative study with a schedule of 5 grams twice a day . 
 Taken together these 5 studies provide the following two conclusions:  1)  SBI is well -
tolerated, with no previously-reported adverse events, even among children, malnourished patients, AIDS patients, and patients with irritable bowel disease, all of whom would be considered highly vulnerable to severe adverse events with the 
administration of an unsafe intervention and 2)  these very preliminary studies indicate 
that in some circumstances, such as severely malnourished children, in AIDS patients with HIV enteropathy, and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, SBI might confer a favorable effect on bowel integrity that appears in turn to translate into less diarrhea and fewer other gastrointestinal symptoms.  In view of the fact that these very preliminary clinical data are consistent with multiple similar observations in animals, a 
strong argument can be made for further studying SBI in postoperative gynecological 
cancer patients who undergo major, extensive surgeries and could conceivably benefit from a swifter recovery to enable them to receive potentially curative chemotherapy in a more timely manner.   Hence, in the current proposal/protocol, we test the hypothesis that 
SBI improves postoperative recovery to a greater extent than placebo.  
 
1.5 Translational Component:  In effect, we hypothesize here that SBI, as a medical food , 
will enhance postoperative recovery .  However, to date, no biomarker or set of 
biomarkers have been demonstrated to serve as accurate predictors or correlates of convalescence.  As a result, this laboratory -based exploratory portion of this 
proposal/protocol will examine well -accepted inflammatory biomarkers and proteins that 
have previously been characterized within the gut microbiome in an effort to assess candidate biomarkers that might be suggestive of successful  convalescence in a 
postoperative setting.  This approach is pragmatic and logical, in view of the fact that the surgeries conducted in ovarian cancer patients often entail a great deal of manipulation and sometimes resection of the bowel.  Hence, we propose to measure neopterin, soluble 
CD14, fatty acid binding protein, zonulin, a variety of inflammatory cytokines, and other 
such markers outlined in section 14.21 with the goal of identifying candidate biomarkers that might be utilized in a larger study that focuses further on testing SBI to enhance convalescence in a postoperative setting in ovarian cancer patients [14a,14b,14c,14d, 14e]. This study will include a serial assessment at baseline, at a mid -time point, and a t 
the end of the intervention. A complete listing of candidate markers appear in section 
14.21 of this protocol.   
 
1.6 Consideration of Alternative Study Designs.   In view of the fact that this proposal tests a 
convalescent  strategy that is novel and as yet has not received widespread attention, the 
investigators have considered a variety of alternative study designs, as outlined below:  
MC1267  9 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015   
1) A variety of other “nutritional boosters” have been touted, so why focus on SBI?   
Importantly, in addition to the scientific justification and prior clinical data described 
above, SBI’s manufacturing processes have been carefully monitored via quality assurance protocols for consistency, reliability, and safety.  Based in Iowa, Entera 
Health, Inc is providing SBI for this trial;  this product is manufactured by Proliant 
Biologicals, Boone, Iowa, USA in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and FDA guidelines for medical good ingredients (21 CFR Part 110) .  Enter a 
Health  is the largest manufacturer of bovine serum albumin (BSA), as used in 
research laboratories worldwide, and contributes protein products to major pharmaceutical companies throughout the United States to enable these other companies to proceed with the manufacturing and distributing of a variety of FDA-
approved agents. This degree of experience, demonstration of safety, and product 
awareness has enabled Entera Health, Inc to acquire for SBI “generally recognized as 
safe” (GRAS) FDA status that allows for the prompt testing of this agent in a variety 
of clinical settings without the need for an IND application.  
 This latter point merits further explanation.  N umerous discussions with staff from 
Proliant Biologicals , including the Chief Medical Office, Dr. Gerry Klein, and 
members of the Mayo Clinic regulatory community, have provided direction to the 
study team, indicating that a submission to the FDA for an IND is not necessary  (See 
Appendix VII) .  These discussions have highlighted the following three points .  First, 
evidence of GRAS status (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/gras_notices/GRN000169.pdf ) has been  
provided.  Again, this product is food -based and “generally recognized as safe,” thus 
providing some reassurance of safe administration.  Second, Proliant Biologicals personnel have pointed out that, as per 21 CFR Part 105.3, this company is not 
attempting to palliate a disease state. Rather th e focus o f the current study is 
postoperative convalescence.  This complete lack of focus on a disease state again 
makes an IND unnecessary .  Third, this protocol attempts to enhance convalescence 
after surgery with the use of this  food product, as per Title 21, Part 105, section (a), 
(1), (i), with no associated drug claim.  .  SBI is not a drug but rather a nutritional 
agent.  In the absence of a drug claim, that the testing of SBI  does not require an 
IND.  
 
2) Quality-of -life assessment appears to be a very “soft” outcome.  Why not focus on 
another endpoint, such as time -to-chemotherapy administration itself?   We point out 
that the Symptom Distress Scale and the Postoperative Quality of Life questionnaire s 
have  been validated and used for many years to measure quality of life  [15].  Such 
questionnaires have also been used in many settings, including cancer settings and after other major illness, such as post -myocardial infarction.  Th ese instrument s ask 
relevant questions related to bowel function, pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that 
are all highly germane to oncologists as they decide whether to begin chemotherapy in postoperative cancer patients.  As most oncologists will acknowledge, specific criteria for starting chemotherapy are not well-defined, but it is of paramount importance to assess the symptoms above in conjunction with general postoperative 
healing in making a decision on when to start postoperative chemotherapy.  
Moreover, it should be noted that th e instrument s above are brief and enable a 
patient -reported , paper -based  formatting that provides for a highly practical approach 
to symptom assessment.  We point out that we had carefully considered evaluating time-to-chemotherapy administration as the primary endpoint for this study, but the 
MC1267  10 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  fact that this endpoint can be artifactually modified as a result of return appointment 
availability and other scheduling issue s suggest that patient -reported quality of life is 
a more clinically accurate and meaningful primary endpoint  for the current 
proposal/protocol . 
 
3) This study does not focus specifically on ovarian cancer patients, yet the underlying 
premise is that reduction of time -to-chemotherapy administration is important 
specifically in the management of ovarian cancer patients.  Why the discrepancy?  
The primary driving force for including all patients with gynecological surgeries is to complete this study quickly and consider future development strategies promptly. Given the fact that other gynecological surgeries also involve major operations and given that a quality of life outcome would be relevant to these patients as well, we decided to embark on a more encompassing study design that includes a wide -range 
of patients with difference gynecological cancer types.  Were a larger study to be planned, then a more narrow focus on ovarian cancer patients would be called for.  
 
4) What if SBI supplementation does not improve quality of life?  A great deal of effort 
will have gone towards a negative neutral study.  If our hypothesis proves incorrect 
and we observe no improvement in postoperative recovery, as suggested by improved 
quality of life scores, in the SBI versus placebo arm, we will nonetheless have 
acquired prospective quality of   life data (based on pooling data in both arms in 
ovarian cancer patients) that will position us well to proceed with other future interventions to test ways to decrease the time-to-chemotherapy administration in postoperative ovarian cancer patients.

 6.0  Registration/Randomization Procedures  
6.1 Registration Procedures 
 
6.11 To register a patient, access the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC)  web page 
and enter the registrat ion/randomization application. The registration/ 
randomization application is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Back up 
and/or system support contact information is available on the Web site. If unable 
to access the Web site, call the MCCC Registration Office at (507) 284 -2753 
between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central Time (Monday through Friday). 
 
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are available on the MCCC web page ( http://hsrwww.mayo.edu/ccs/training
) and detail the 
process for completing and confirming patient registration.  Prior to initiation of the protocol intervention, this process must be completed in its entirety and a 
MCCC subject ID number must be available as noted in the instructions.  It is the 
responsibility of the individual registering the patient to confirm the process has 
been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent.  Patient registration via the registration/randomization application can be confirmed in any of the following ways:  
• Contact the MCCC Registration Office (507) 284- 2753.  If the patient was 
fully registered, the MCCC Registration Office staff can access the 
information from the centralized database and confirm the registration.  
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section 
“Finding/Displaying Information about A Registered Subject.”  
 
6.12 A mandatory  baseline correlative research component is part of this study, the 
patient will be automatically registered onto this component (see Sections 3 .19 
and 14.1). 
 
An optional correlative research component is part of this study, there will be an option to select if the patient is to be registered onto this component (see Section 14.0) 
 
• Patient has/has not given permission to give his/her blood sample (s) for 
research testing  for Cycles 2 and 3  
MC1267  14 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015   
6.13 Documentation of IRB approval must be on file in the Registration Office before 
an investigator may register any patients.  
 
In addition to submitting initial IRB approval documents, ongoing IRB approval documentation must be on file (no less than annually) at the Registration Office (fax: 507-284-0885).  If the necessary documentation is not submitted in advance of attempting patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the 
patient may not be enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.  
 
When the study has been permanently closed to patient enrollment, submission of annual IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary.  
 
6.14 Prior to accepting the registration, the registration/randomization application will 
verify the following:  
• IRB approval at the registering institution  
• Patient eligibility  
• Existence of a signed consent form  
• Existence of a signed authorization for use and disclosure of protected health information   
 6.15 Intervention on this protocol must commence at Mayo Clinic Rochester,  under 
the supervision of a medical oncologist .  
 
6.16 Intervention cannot begin prior to registration and must begin ≤  7 days after 
registration. 
 
6.17 Pre-intervention tests/procedures (see Section 4.0) must be completed within the 
guidelines specified on the test schedule.  
 
6.18 All required baseline symptoms (see Section 10. 6) must be documented and 
graded.

Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  6.2 Randomization Procedures  
 
6.21 The factors defined in Section 5.0 will be used as stratification factors.  
 
6.22  After the patient has been registered into the study, the values of the stratification factors will be recorded, and the patient will be assigned to one of the following intervention groups using the Pocock and Simon dynamic allocation procedure 
which balances the marginal distributions of the stratification factors between the 
intervention groups [16].  
• Oral Serum Bovine Immunoglobulin (SBI)  
• Placebo  
 
6.3 Procedures for Double -Blinding the Intervention Assignment  
 
6.31 After the intervention assignment has been ascertained by the registration/randomization application, the patient’s study medication code 
number will be displayed on the confirmation of registration screen.  
 
6.32 The data manager/nurse/pharmacist at the patient’s institution must contact the 
MCCC Registration Office for a code number when additional study product is needed for the patient.  
 
6.33 The number of the intervention bottle /packet assigned to the patient will be 
recorded on the dosing form.  
 
6.34 MCCC Registration Office personnel will monitor the supply of coded bottles /packets at each participating institution and will arrange for the oncology 
pharmacist to send further supplies to the participating institutions as needed.

MC1267  16 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  7.4 Breaking Codes in Double –Blinded Studies -The intervention code may not be broken 
except for emergencies.   
 
In the event of an emergency, call the MCCC Registration Office at (507) 284 –2753 to 
break the code on Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Central Time.  If the 
code must be broken after hours, assume the patient was assigned to active treatment and treat accordingly.  Place a call to the MCCC Registration Office and leave a message informing them of the need to un- blind a patient.  Provide your contact information so 
that MCCC Registration Office personnel can return the call the next business day.  
 
8.0 Dosage Modification Based on Adverse Events  
 
There are no dose modifications in this trial. If the patient experiences a grade 1 or worse adverse 
event that is thought to be related to the study intervention, the patient should discontinue the 
intervention and proceed to the 4 week post intervention observation.   
 
9.0 Ancillary Treatment/Supportive Care  
 
9.1 Antiemetics may be used at the discretion of the attending physician.  
 
9.2 Blood products and growth factors should be utilized as clinically warranted and following institutional policies and recommendations.  The use of growth factors should follow published guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 2006 Update of Recommendations for the Use of White Blood Cell Growth Factors: An Evidence -Based Clinical Practice Guideline J Clin Oncol 24(19): 3187- 3205, 
2006 .  
 
9.3 Patients should receive full supportive care while on this study.  This includes blood product support, antibiotic treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnosed or concurrent medical conditions.  All blood products and concomitant medications such 
as antidiarrheals, analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study 
intervention administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical records.  
 
10.0 Adverse Event (AE) Reporting and Monitoring  
 
10.1 Adverse Event Characteristics  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:   The descriptions and grading scales found 
in the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access 
to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0.   A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be 
downloaded from the CTEP web site: (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
)     
 
10.11 Adverse event monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  First, identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE version 4.0.  Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10.2) 
MC1267  17 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  and if the adverse event is related to the medical intervention or procedure (see 
Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be 
reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4).  Expedited reports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting mechanisms defined by the protocol (see Sections 10.52 and 18.0).  
 
10.12 Each CTCAE term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single MedDRA Lowest Level Term (LLT).  Grade is an essential element of the Guidelines and, in general, relates to severity  for the purposes of regulatory reporting to NCI.  
 
NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by the above grading scale, is NOT  the same 
as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4.  
 
10.2 Expected vs. Unexpected  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on the agent-
specific information provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol.  
 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of this protocol.  
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information 
provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
 
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or procedure, the 
following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s). 
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s).  
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a 
medical intervention suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal 
relationship between the agent and the adverse event.

event.  
 
10.5 Other Required Reporting  
 
10.51  Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital 
abnormities or birth defects, must be reported immediately to the study team.  
 
MC1267  20 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  10.52 Death  
 
Any death occurring within 30 days of the last dose, regardless of 
attribution to an agent/intervention requires expedited reporting within 
24-hours  to the study team. 
 Any death occurring greater than 30 days with an attribution of possible, probable, or definite to an agent/intervention requires 
expedited reporting within 24- hours to the study team . 
 
Reportable categories of Death  
 
• Death attributable to a CTCAE term. 
 
• Death Neonatal:  A disorder characterized by cessation of life during the 
first 28 days of life.  
 
• Death NOS:  A cessation of life that cannot be attributed to a CTCAE 
term associated with Grade 5.  
 
• Sudden death NOS:  A sudden (defined as instant or within one hour of 
the onset of symptoms) or an unobserved cessation of life that cannot be 
attributed to a CTCAE term associated with Grade 5.  
 
• Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 
“Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and 
polyps) – Other (Progressive Disease)” under the system organ class 
(SOC) of the same name.  Evidence that the death was a manifestation of 
underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes suggesting tumor growth 
or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted.  
 
10.53 Secondary Malignancy  
 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
• All secondary malignancies that occur  during the study require reporting 
to the study team.  Three options are available to describe the event:  
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML]) 
 o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
 o Treatment -related secondary malignancy 
 
MC1267  21 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  • Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol. 
 
10.54  Second Malignancy  
 
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second 
malignancies require ONLY routine reporting.

Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  14.2 Collection and Processing  
 
14.21  Correlative Research   
 
 This protocol will check the following laboratory-based translational studies from the blood at baseline and at the time of completion of the intervention:  
 
1. Biomarkers to explore convalescence will be examined . Biomarkers 
associated with bacterial translocation, enterocyte damage and intestinal epithelial barrier function will be measured with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in vitro.  LPS binding 
protein (LBP), bactericidal/permeability increasing protein (BPI), 
soluble CD14 (sCD14),16s rDNA, intestinal fatty acid binding 
protein (I -FABP) and zonulin in plasma  will be measured in this 
manner. 
 
2. We will also measure plasma CRP and d dimer.  Commercially 
available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays will be used 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions for measuring for inflammation -coagulation parameters.  
 
3. Plasma cytokines involved  in the pro-inflammatory cascade will be 
assessed.  These cytokines include TNF -α, IFN-γ, IL 1, IL 6, IL 10, 
as well as neopterin.  Standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits will be used according to manufacturer’s recommendations.  
 
 For the translat ional component of this study, patients will have blood 
drawn at the time points specified in section 4.0.   
 Blood will be drawn in 2 purple top tubes capable of holding a blood volume of 7cc.  Each tube will be spun down, and the plasma will be stored at  -80 degrees centrigrade. 
 
Frozen plasma will be batched and sent to EnterHealth at the end of the 
study (see below for shipping details.) ELISA kits will be used to assay all the proteins .  
 
14.3 Shipping and Handling  
 
14.31 Kits will be used for this study.  
 
14.311  Kits will be supplied by the Biospecimen Accessioning and Processing Shared Resource (BAP).  
 
14.312  The kit contains supplies and instructions for collecting, processing and shipping specimens.

15.0 Product Information  
 
15.1 Serum -Derived Bovine Immunoglobulin Protein Isolate (SBI, EnteraGam
TM) or 
matching placebo  
 
15.11  Background: Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is an orally 
administered prescription medical food containing a proprietary formulation of bovine immunoglobulin (> 50% IgG) and other serum proteins.  The product is manufactured in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practices and FDA guidelines for medical food ingredients.   
It is indicated for the nutritional management of a patient with enteropathy who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients.  
Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate must be non -digestible 
and able to reach the gastrointestinal tract to benefit an immunocompromised or 
otherwise dysfunctional GI mucosa. In humans, SBI is used as a passive, 
immunity -enhancing nutrient to augment traditional medications. Clinical studies 
have provided evidence that SBI lowers total and LDL cholesterol in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, reduces symptoms of gastroenteropathy in IBS -
D and HIV+ patients, increases GI absorption, and decreases GI permeability.  
 
MC1267  26 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  15.12  Formulation: Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is a light -
colored powder composed of finely ground flakes of immunoglobulin and other 
serum proteins (ie, transferrin, albumin, alpha and beta proteins).  Serum -derived 
bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is supplied in individual packets 
containing 5 grams of SBI and the following ingredients: dextrose, orange (natural and artificial flavors) and coloring (Yellow #6).  
Matching placebo packets will be supplied and will appear identical to SBI with respect to volume, appearance, and taste. The ingredients of the placebo will 
include dextrose, orange (natural and artificial flavors) and coloring (Yellow #6).  
 
15.13  Preparation and storage :  Blinded investigational product (SBI or 
matching placebo) will be packaged in kits containing 5 grams of SBI per each packet or as matching placebo packets.  An investigational product 
kit with a unique ID number will contain 14 packets (7 days of required 
product) and 4 extra packets (18 packets total) to accommodate the flexibility with return visits.  Packets are to be stored at 20 -25°C (68 -77°F), with excursions permitted 
between 15 -30°C (59-86°F).  
 
15.14  Administration:  SBI is administered orally or enterally.  Each patient will be instructed to add the contents of one packet (5 grams) to a cup and dissolve the powder with approximately on-half cup (4 fl. ounces or 120 mL) of water.  The patient will stir to mix and drink the contents.  The patient will take one dose twice a day, in the morning and the evening, with or without food.  Foods such as 
applesauce or pudding may be used instead of liquid to blend the product if the 
patient desires.   
 
15.15  Potential Agent Interactions:  No significant interactions of SBI with commonly prescribed medications have been observed.   
 15.16  Known potential toxicities :  Study subjects with known beef allergies or 
allergies to other components of SBI should not take SBI.   
As with any ingested food or product, subjects who develop a hypersensitivity or 
food intolerance to SBI should discontinue its use.  
Subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take SBI, as there are no 
data regarding the effects.  
Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin has self -affirmed generally recognized as 
safe (GRAS) status, with no objections from the FDA, and is demonstrated to be 
safe and well tolerated in pediatric and adult patients.  SBI is marketed in Mexico, the Czech Republic, Japan, Egypt, and the United States.  More than 
100,000 kg of SBI in various dosages have been ingested by the general 
population since 2001.  No serious adverse events have been reported to the manufacturer or the FDA.  
Literature reports indicate AEs include worsening or reoccurrence of diarrhea, constipation, and worsening neuropathy.  Increased urination, stomach cramps, fatigue, headache, sore throat, softened stools, and nausea have also been 
reported.

16.0  Statistic al Considerations and Methodolog y  
16.1 Overview  
 
This randomized study is pilot in nature insofar as its main goal is to provide preliminary 
data to put in place the groundwork for a much larger, definitive study.  The primary aim of the current study is to compare the time-to -quality of life (QOL) improvement from 
baseline in postoperative gynecological cancer patients who are receiving oral SBI vs. 
placebo.  If this trial can provide preliminary evidence that oral SBI significantly 
improves the time -to-QOL improvement as compared to placebo, further study would be 
warranted to determine whether the administration of oral SBI shortens the time- to-
chemotherapy administration post -operatively in ovarian cancer patients.  In addition to 
time-to-QOL improvement, this trial will also compare adverse event rates, complication 
rates, QOL from validated QOL tools, and intervention compliance between patients 
receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.   
 
16.11 Primary Endpoint and Statistical Design:  To compare the time-to-QOL 
improvement from baseline in postoperative gynecological cancer patients who are receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.  
 
Final Analysis:  
The primary goal of this trial is to compare the oral SBI arm (experimental) to the placebo arm (standard), where the alternative hypothesis is that the 
experimental arm has a shorter time to QOL improvement from baseline as 
compared to the standard arm.  For this primary endpoint, the total score of the 
14-item Postoperative Quality of Life  (PQL) tool [15] will be used, where the 
total score could range from 0 to 140 (0 being the worst and 140 being the best) .  
These scores will be converted to the percentage scale, where a score of 140 will 
MC1267  28 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  be converted to 100 and a score of 0 will remain as 0.  This  QOL will be 
measured weekly for the entire 12 week length of the study and at the end of the 
intervention.   QOL improvement will be defined as at least a 10 point increase in 
the QOL score from baseline, on the percentage scale.   This 10 point change 
represents a clinically meaningful improvement in QOL based on work done by 
Jeff Sloan [17].   The date at which the QOL score is first known to increase by at 
least 10 from baseline (on the 100 point scale) , will be considered the event date 
for the purpose of analysis.  Patients without at least a 10 point increase in QOL  
from baseline, will be censored on their last QOL evaluation date up to a 
maximum of 12 weeks.  We will enter a total of 70 evaluable patients (35 per 
arm) using a 1:1 randomization scheme.  The primary analysis will be a 
comparison of oral SBI vs. placebo using a two-sided log-rank test between the 2 Kaplan -Meier curves
 [18].  This analysis will take place after an approximate 16 
month accrual period, and after 6 6  total events across both arms combined 
(which should happen after about 12  weeks of follow -up in all evaluable 
patients).  Additionally, we assume a constant accrual rate over the course of the 
study, and that no patients will drop-out of the study, since historically the lost to 
follow -up rate is <1%.  To determine the appropriate sample size of 35 evaluable 
patients per arm, we assumed exponential survival and that the median time-to-QOL improvement is around 3 weeks in the oral SBI arm and 6 weeks in the placebo arm (HR=2).    This hazard ratio is based on our institution’s data which 
shows that patients often begin postoperative chemotherapy 6 weeks after 
surgery.  These assumptions yield 80% power to detect a significant difference between the arms using a 2 -sided log-rank test at alpha=0.05.  All patients who 
meet the eligibility criteria, sign the consent form, and are randomized, will be considered evaluable for this endpoint.  All eligible patients will be followed a 
maximum of 12 weeks.  If the 2 -sided log -rank test p -value is < 0.05 showing 
significantly shortened time -to-QOL improvement in the oral SBI arm as 
compared to placebo, further study will be warranted.  Of course, any final 
decisions will be based on all primary and secondary endpoints.   
 
16.2 Sample Size:  The study design to be utilized is fully described in Section 16.11 (see 
above).  There will be 35 evaluable patients randomized to each arm of this study.  
We anticipate accruing an additional 15 patients to each arm to account for ineligibility, 
cancellation, major intervention violation, or other reasons.  Therefore, maximum accrual 
is  100 patients ( 50 per arm).   
 
16.3 Accrual Time and Study Duration:   The anticipated accrual rate is approximately 4-5 
patients per month.  Therefore, the accrual period for this randomized Pilot study  is 
expected to be around 24  months.  The final analysis can begin approximately 28 months 
after the trial begins, i.e., as soon as the last patient registered has been observed for 4 months.  
 
16.4 Other Considerations:  Adverse events as well as scientific discoveries or changes in 
standard care will be taken into account in any decision to terminate the study.  
 
MC1267  29 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015   
16.5 Data & Safety Monitoring : 
 
16.51 The principal investigator(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint problems that might be developing.   The trial is monitored continually by the study team 
who are notified of every grade 4 and 5 event in real time.  The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible 
for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based on 
reports provided by the MCCC Statistical Office.   
 16.52  Adverse Event Stopping Rules:  The stopping rules specified below are based on the knowledge available at study development.  We note that the Adverse Event 
Stopping Rule may be adjusted in the event of either (1) the study re -opening to 
accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of the trial and in consideration of 
newly acquired information regarding the adverse event profile of the intervention(s) under investigation.  The study team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse event profiles that have not crossed the 
specified rule below.  CTCAE v4.0 will be used to determine grading for these 
stopping rules.  
 
We expect about 10% of patients to experience grade 3 or worse adverse events (at least possibly related to the study intervention).  In addition, we  expect less 
than 1% of patients to experience a Grade 5 adverse event, at least possibly 
related to the study intervention . Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this 
study if at any time we observe adverse events that satisfy any of the following within each arm separately (i.e. if any of the following occur in arm A or arm B, we will suspend accrual to the trial):  
 
• If at any time 4 or more in the first 20 treated patients (or 20% or more 
after the first 20) experience a Grade 3 or worse adverse event (possibly, probably, or definitely related to the intervention ).  
• If at any time, 1 patient experiences a grade 5 adverse event (possibly, probably, or definitely related to  the intervention ).  
  
We note that we will review all Grade 5 adverse events on a case-by -case basis 
as well (regardless of attribution), and may suspend accrual after just one  
Grade 5 event, if we feel it is necessary for patient safety.  
 
16.6 Definitions and Analyses of Secondary Endpoints :  All these endpoints will be assessed 
individually and will also be compared between the 2 arms.   Monthly phone calls may be 
used to collect the  secondary endpoint information for each patient, including adverse 
events, surgical complications, and other data (e.g. patient reported weight, intervention compliance, etc.).  We will be assessing, reporting on, and potentially analyzing all the data collected from these monthly telephone calls.   
 
16.61  Adverse Events:   All eligible patients who have intitiated therapy  will be 
considered evaluable for adverse event analyses.  The maximum grade for each type of adverse event will be recorded for each patient up to 16  weeks post -
randomization (12 weeks of intervention + 1 month post -intervention observation 
timepoint) , and frequency tables will be reviewed to determine adverse event 
MC1267  30 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  patterns.  The overall adverse event rates for grade 2 or higher adverse events, 
will be compared using Chi -Square or Fisher’s Exact tests.  In addition, the 
surgical complication rates (up to 1 month post -surgery) will also be compared 
between the 2 arms using Chi -Square or Fisher’s Exact tests.   
 
16.62   Intervention Compliance :  Intervention compliance will be assessed using the 
Compliance Questionnaire in Appendix V.  The frequency and percentage for 
each Compliance Questionnaire category will be summarized descriptively by 
cycle and by intervention arm.  In addition, cycle by cycle compliance data will be compared between the 2 arms using a Chi -square test.   
 
16.63 Quality of Life:  QOL will be measured with 3 QOL tools.  For the primary 
endpoint, the total score from the 14-item Postoperative Quality of Life (PQL) 
tool [15] (Appendix II) will be used (16.11) .  As a secondary analysis, all 14 of 
the individual items from the PQL tool (Appendix II), along with the 4 additional 
items after the PQL questions (Appendix II) will be analyzed and compared between the 2 intervention arms.  In addition, the time -to-QOL improvement will 
be compared between the 2 arms for any increase (> 0) from baseline for the total 
score from the PQL tool.  This will be done descriptively, and using a Kaplan -
Meier analysis [18] , where any increase in the QOL from baseline will represent 
an event.   QOL will also be measured using the Uniscale (Appendix III ), and the 
previously-validated Symptom Distress Scale (SDS; Appendix IV ).  These QOL 
tools will measure QOL at baseline, every week up to  12 weeks post -
randomization, and at the end of intervention.  Differences between post -
randomization and baseline QOL scores will be analyzed and compared between 
the 2 arms using a Wilcoxon Rank-sum test.  Also, other graphical and statistical methods will be used to compare the QOL  and time -to-QOL improvement  
between the 2 arms.  As an exploratory analysis, we will also collect QOL data on patients who  do not start intervention/placebo or discontinue 
intervention/placebo early and are willing to be followed per the test schedule 
(Section 4).  This analysis will be descriptive in nature to see if these patients have a poorer QOL than patients who stay on study.  
 
16.64 Translational Component :  The hypothesis is that oral SBI will improve 
postoperative recovery .  However, we know of no biomarkers indicative of 
postoperative recovery.  Hence in an exploratory manner , we will measure a host 
of candidate biomarkers.  This study will include serial assessment at baseline, at 
a mid -way timepoint,  and at the end of the intervention intervention.  The 
differences between biomarker values over time  will be compared between the 2 
intervention arms using a Wilcoxon Rank-sum test.  In addition, other graphical 
and statistical methods will be used to compare the data over time between oral 
SBI and placebo.   All these analyses will be considered hypothesis-generating.  
 
16.7 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
16.71   This study will be available to all eligible patients, regardless of race, or ethnic 
origin.  
 
16.72   There is no information currently available regarding differential effects of this regimen in subsets  defined by race, or ethnicity, and there is no reason to expect 
such differences to exist.  Therefore, although the planned analysis will, as 
MC1267  31 MCCC Addendum 6  
Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  always, look for differences in intervention effect based on racial groupings, the 
sample size is not increased in order to provide additional power for subset 
analyses.  
 
16.73  The geographical region served by the Mayo Clinic has a population which 
includes approximately 5% minorities.  We expect about 5% of patients will be classified as minorities by race and all will be women.  Expected sizes of racial subsets are shown in the following table:  
Accrual Estimates by Ethnicity/Race

Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent including, for example, Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam. (Note: Individuals from the Philippine Islands have been recorded as Pacific Islanders in previous data collection strategies.)  
Black or African American – a person having origins in any of the black racial 
groups of Africa. Terms such as “Haitian” or “Negro” can be used in addition to

Protocol Version Date:  May 7, 2015  Appendix VII Entera Health Clarification Letter  
 
 
To whom it may concern: 
 Please find enclosed for review Protocol …..  Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate (SBI) is an orally administered 
prescription medical food containing a proprietary formulation of bovine immunoglobulins and proteins.  The term medical food, as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee (b) (3)) is "a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation."   Serum -derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is intended for the nutritional 
management of a patient with enteropathy who, because of therapeutic or chronic medical needs, has limited or impaired capacity to ingest, digest, absorb, or metabolize ordinary foodstuffs or certain nutrients, the dietary management of which cannot be achieved by the modification of the normal diet alone. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin has self-affirmed generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with no objections from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is demonstrated to be safe and well -tolerated in pediatric and adult patients.  
 Medical foods are regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration
 under the Food Drug and 
Cosmetic Act regulations 21 CFR 101.9(j) (8), however, medical foods do not undergo premarket review or approval by FDA since they do not meet the definition of the term drug in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act includes, among other things, “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease . . .” and “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.” In addition, substances designated as GRAS for use in food are not approved as drug products since they are not intended to evaluate the product's ability to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease; therefore an IND under part 312 is not required.

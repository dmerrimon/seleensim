 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Pancreatic Cancer  
Pancreatic cancer is the 10
th most common cause of cancer, and the 4th most common 
cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with an annual incidence of 45,220 
new diagnoses per year [1].  The only curative treatment for pancreatic cancer is 
surgery, yet approximately 75% of patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease. Of those patients with surgically resectable disease, the 5-year survival is around 20%.  Among those with unresectable disease distant metastatic spread remains the primary problem, though up to 1/3 of patients will die from local tumor progression 
[2].  Additionally, local tumor progression leads to pain, gastrointestinal obstruction, or 
bleeding, all of which substantially decrease a patient’s quality of life.  Thus, local tumor control remains a crucial part of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer who are not candidates for curative therapy.  
1.2 Treatment options for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer 
 
The optimal treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer remains unclear, though current treatment often includes chemotherapy, or chemotherapy with radiotherapy.  Unfortunately, patients with unresectable disease are not curable, and therefore chemotherapy is delivered with the intent of delaying disease progression, and 
lengthening life.  Radiotherapy focuses on controlling the primary pancreatic tumor.  
Unfortunately, neither chemotherapy nor radiation has proven effective with unresectable pancreatic cancer, and the median overall survival for this disease is only 
around 10-12 months. 
 
1.3 Radiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
 
Conventional radiotherapy in pancreatic cancer is given daily over 5-6 weeks with concurrent chemotherapy.  The Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group conducted a series of studies with chemoradiotherapy in pancreatic cancer defining its effectiveness.  More recent series on chemoradiotherapy have yielded mixed results, with some reports of 
improved efficacy, and others without.  A primarily limitation of chemoradiation relates to 
the side effects including nausea, vomiting, and fatigue, with a substantial fraction of patients experiencing grade 3-4 toxicity.  Unfortunately, despite its efforts, conventional chemoradiation has low local control rates often in the range of 50% or lower.  Additionally, this 5-6 week treatment duration occupies a significant time burden for 
patients and caregivers, plus this can delay much needed systemic chemotherapy.  In 
an attempt to improve local control and reduce treatment time investigators have started to use shorter more intense courses of radiotherapy, specifically, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). 
 1.4  Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in pancreatic cancer 
  
SBRT in pancreatic cancer shows great promise with initial studies showing high rates of local control.  The initial study from Stanford escalated the dose of single fraction radiotherapy from 15 Gy in a single fraction to 25 Gy in a single fraction [3].  A subsequent phase II study treated patients to 45 Gy in 25 fractions with conventionally 
fractionated radiation, followed by 25 Gy in a single fraction [4]. Two of the 16 patients in 
this trial (13%) had grade 3 toxicity.  Additional data with 25 Gy in a single fraction found 
  Page 7  
 high rates of local tumor control with a 1-year freedom from local progression rate of 
84% [5].  Unfortunately, the Stanford group found increased risk of late toxicity with the 
25 Gy in 1 fraction regimen [6].  The close proximity of the stomach and duodenum put 
these organs at risk in radiotherapy directed at the pancreas.  Of 73 patients treated with 25 Gy in a single fraction, 12 had grade 2-4 duodenal toxicity [6].  More recently, Stanford has preliminarily reported on a phase II trial 5-day course of SBRT [7].  This 5 fraction schedule going to 33 Gy was safe, with one reported toxicity 
event, though the efficacy was lower with decreased rates of local control.  The 
observation that 33 Gy in 5 fractions was safe but had lower local control suggests that there may be room for dose escalation.  This current trial will determine the maximal tolerated dose of SBRT in 5 fractions, for which the efficacy will be tested in a subsequent phase II trial. 
 
This trial will escalate the dose from 40 Gy in 5 fractions, to 60 Gy in 5 fractions, at 5 Gy intervals.  Comparing different radiation fractionation schedules is complex, though the standard metric used is the biologic effective doses (BED), and the BED of multiple radiation fractionation schedules is provided below in Table 1.  The selection of a dose 
range with this study was based on a number of factors.  First, the starting dose level of 
45 Gy has been found safe in recently reported hyporfactionated regimens in pancreatic cancer [8]. in five fractions is the natural extension beyond 33 Gy in five fractions found safe by the Stanford researchers.  The final dose level of 60 Gy in five translates into a BED of 132 for tumor response, and 300 for late toxicity. This final dose level is similar to that used by Koong, et al. with 141 for tumor response, and 305 for late toxicity.

1.5  Primary study hypothesis 
 
The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of five fraction stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) in pancreatic cancer.  
1.6 Imaging/treatment correlative study background 
 
This trial is designed to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) under a fixed 5-fraction 
SBRT regimen. To do this, it is necessary to verify that the treatment accuracy remains 
consistent throughout, so as to not be a confounding factor in the outcome. Perhaps the biggest contributing uncertainties are the inter- and intra-fractional organ motion, principally driven by patients’ respiration. Physiological changes may also impact organ motion during SBRT. To compensate for organ motion, generic margins are commonly 
applied to the CTV, such as ITV and PTV. In this trial, 2-3 mm PTV margin will be used 
and may be trimmed further depending on the location of the duodenum or stomach.  For such a tight margin, along with highly hypofractionated dose, it becomes prudent to validate that the image guidance technologies used in this trial are adequate to meet the demanded accuracy. To do this, this trial will employ the following sequence of imaging: 
1) kV/kV to bones, 2) CBCT to soft tissue and fiducial markers (4DCBCT if available), 3) 
fluoroscopy to fiducial markers during free-breathing, and 4) repeat CBCT to soft tissue and fiducial markers (4DCBCT if available) at the end of treatment. This sequence of imaging will help minimize the initial setup uncertainties due to inter-fractional motion (steps 1-3) as well as to monitor the intra-fractional motion (step 4). In addition to these primary objectives, the images will be further analyzed to determine 1) the minimum 
adequate margin in each principal direction per patient population, 2) identify anatomical 
motion surrogates for when fiducials are not available, and 3) potential for various adaptive RT strategies.

4.0 PRETREATMENT EVALUATIONS 
 
The evaluations/interventions listed below should be done prior to the patient starting any protocol treatment (but may be done subsequent to the patient enrollment). In the unlikely event that results of any of these tests raise questions about the patient’s eligibility for this study, please contact Dr. James Murphy immediately (858) 534-3508. 
 
4.1  Required Evaluations (In addition to the mandatory pre-testing for eligibility in Section 
3.0) 4.1.1 History and physical examination including height, weight, and Karnofsky 
Performance Status (KPS). 
4.1.2 CT of the abdomen, and pelvis. 
4.1.3 Laboratory blood tests including CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, and CA 
19-9. 
    
5.0 ENROLLMENT PROCEDURES 
 
5.1 Recruitment  
Subjects will be identified by study investi gators and/or clinical research coordinators at 
participating centers.  Information regarding the study will be included on the Moores UC San Diego Cancer Center Clinical Trials webpage and Clinicaltrials.gov.  
5.2 Informed Consent   
The investigational nature and objectives of the trial, the procedures and treatments 
involved and their attendant risks and discomforts, and potential alternative therapies will be carefully explained to the subject and a signed informed consent will be obtained.  
5.3 Screening Procedures 
  
Written informed consent will be provided prior to any study procedures. Documentation of informed consent will be maintained in the subject’s research chart and medical 
  Page 11  
 record. Studies or procedures that were performed for clinical indications or as standard 
of care (not exclusively to determine study eligibility) may be used for baseline values 
even if the studies were done before informed consent was obtained.  
 5.3 Placement of Fiducial Markers  
Treatment on this protocol requires placement of 3-5 gold fiducials for targeting purposes.  The fiducials will be used as surrogates for targeting the daily tumor position 
during treatment.  The fiducials will be placed directly into the tumor, or surrounding 
normal pancreatic tissue under endoscopic ultrasound or CT guidance.  Fiducials may be implanted prior to enrollment as this is an acceptable standard of care procedure for any patient receiving radiotherapy for locally advanced pancreatic cancer.  Also, if a patient had an attempted surgical resection that was aborted, fiducials may have been 
implanted intraoperatively, which is also allowable prior to study enrollment.   
 Fiducial placement into pancreatic tumors carries a low risk of toxicity [9,10].  In one report of 50 patients who had fiducials implanted into the pancreas through endoscopy only one patient (2%) had minor bleeding without a significant drop in hemoglobin, and 
this event did not require hospitalization [10].  In another report of 61 patients who had 
fiducials implanted percutaneously under CT guidance only two patients (3.3%) had minor bleeding episodes [9].  
6.0 RADIATION THERAPY 
 
6.1  Pre-SBRT tests and procedures  
6.1.0 Pre-SBRT tests 
- Medical history and clinical examination. 
- CBC, Chemistry Panel, CA19-9. 
- Gold fiducial seed placement percutaneously, intraoperatively, or under 
endoscopic ultrasound guidance, which may be performed prior to enrollment.   
- Signed informed consent document. 
 
6.1  External Beam Radiation Therapy  
 
6.1.0 Patient setup and simulation 
 
6.1.0.1 Position 
CT simulation will be done in the supine position with patient in an Alpha Cradle, 
or Vac-Lok for immobilization. 
  
6.1.0.2 Imaging All subjects will undergo a 3-dimensional (3D) CT scan with intravenous contrast, and slice thickness ≤2.5 mm.  This 3D scan should preferably be done during an 
expiratory breath hold phase.  Following the 3D CT, a four-dimensional (4D) CT 
scan with respiratory gating will be done to account for tumor motion.  CT scans should include T4/T5 to L5/S1.  6.1.0.3 Contrast  
Intravenous contrast is used during the CT simulation scan. If a patient cannot 
  Page 12  
 receive IV contrast then an MRI can be done and fused to the treatment planning 
CT scan.  Oral contrast will consist of a cup of water that the patient will drink 30 
minutes before the simulation. 
 
6.1.1 Treatment planning 
 
6.1.1.1 Planning CT scan The treatment planning CT scan will be defined as the CT from simulation that 
most clearly shows the tumor and adjacent normal tissue, and can be any of the 
following: 
1) Expiratory phase of the 4D CT scan (50%);  2) Expiratory 3D CT simulation scan 3) Average of select sequences from the 4D CT scan around expiration 
including 30%, 40%, 50% (end expiration), 60%, and 70%. 
 
6.1.1.2 CT fusion 
When available, a recent diagnostic pancreas protocol CT, PET/CT, or abdominal MRI should be fused with the planning CT scan, using fiducial-to-fiducial fusion if possible. 
 
6.1.1.3 Tumor target delineation The pancreas gross tumor volume (GTV) will be identified on the treatment planning CT scan.  The internal target volume (ITV) will be defined by the attending radiation oncologist using the 4D CT scan to account for respiratory motion. The final planning target volume (PTV) will consist of a 2-3 mm 
expansion around the ITV.  The PTV can be trimmed off of the duodenum or 
stomach at the treating physician’s discretion.  Elective nodal regions will not be irradiated.  6.1.1.4 Treatment planning 
Treatment will consist of 6 MV or 15 MV photons directed at the PTV using 6-12 
fields or a modulated arc technique.  Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques such as fixed-field IMRT, or volume modulated arc therapy (VMAT) can be used to reduce dose to surrounding normal tissues.  The dose should be prescribed as follows: 
1) 90-95% of the PTV (preferably 95%) should receive 100% of the 
prescription dose 
2) No more than 1 cm
3 of the PTV can receive >120% of the prescription dose 
 6.1.1.5 Normal tissue constraints Normal tissue dose should be minimized. Specific organ constraints are as 
follows. 
1) Duodenum : no more than 1 cm
3 of duodenum may exceed the prescription 
dose. 
2) Stomach : no more than 1 cm3 of the stomach may exceed the prescription 
dose. 
3) Small bowel (excluding duodenum) : no more than 1 cm3 of small bowel 
may exceed the prescription dose.  
4) Large bowel : no more than 1 cm3 of large bowel may exceed the 
prescription dose. 
5) Liver : 700 cm3 of normal liver should receive less than a mean dose of 15 
  Page 13  
 Gy. 
6) Kidneys (combined) : combined volume should have 75% <12 Gy. 
7) Spinal cord : no more than 1 cm3 should exceed 8 Gy. 
8) If the above tumor and normal tissue constraints cannot be made then the 
prescription dose to the PTV can be reduced such that 100% of the GTV will receive the prescription dose.  If this constraint cannot be met, then the patient should be removed from the protocol.  
 
6.1.1.6 Heterogeneity corrections 
Heterogeneity corrections should be applied. 
 
6.1.2 Treatment delivery 
Patients will receive 5 fractions over a five day period.  Treatment should start 
preferably on Monday, and extend through the following Friday, though it may 
extend over 2 weeks if scheduling issues arise. 
  
Patient position will be verified daily before each treatment with the following 1) Orthogonal kV/kV imaging focusing on bone anatomic alignment. 
2) Daily cone-beam CT before and after each treatment will be conducted to 
verify anatomic location and stability. 4DCBCT should be used if available. 3) Fluoroscopy will be used to confirm that the tumor fiducials fall within the respiratory gating window (aperture). The gating window or patient position should be adjusted to ensure precise positioning.       
 
 
6.2 Radiation Adverse Events 
 Risks and side effects related to radiation include:  
Likely (more than 10%)  
 Tiredness 
 Nausea 
 Damage to the duodenum, stomach, or intestine including ulceration, bleeding, 
or perforation which may require surgery or hospitalization.

  10.2 Adverse Events (AEs) 
 
Adverse event information will be documented on appropriate case report forms (CRF) which will include timing, severity and perceived causation of the events and followed until they either stabilize or resolve.  This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for  adverse events (CTCAE) of 
the National Cancer Institute for reporting of adverse events within 90 days after 
completion of radiation therapy.  A copy of the current version of the CTCAE version 4.0 
can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov/ reporting/ctc.html). Adverse events after 90 days after completion of radiation therapy will be scored with the RTOG/EORTC Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Schema. A copy of the current version of the RTOG/EORTC scale is available on the RTOG home page 
(http://www.rtog.org/ResearchAssociates/ AdverseEventReporting/RTOGEORTCLateRa
diationMorbidityScoringSchema.aspx).  
 Definition of an AE:  any untoward medical occurrence in a patient receiving study 
treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with 
the use of an experimental intervention, whether or not related to the intervention.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any untoward medical 
occurrence that: 
 Results in death. 
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease should be reported as event (SAE) itself. 
 Is life-threatening. 
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe). 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization for ≥ 24 hours. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
  Page 16  
  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Is an important medical event 
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event”.  
 
 
10.3 Steps to Determine If Expedited Reporting for an Adverse Event is Indicated  
Step 1:  Identify the type of adverse event using the CTCAE v4.  The CTCAE v4 
provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed.  A copy of the CTCAE v4 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ).  Additionally, if assistance is needed, the NCI 
has an Index to the CTCAE v4 that provides help for classifying and locating terms.   
  Step 2:  Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE v4. 
 Step 3:  Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, Unlikely Related, Possibly Related, Probably Related, and Definitely Related. 
Note:  This includes all events that occur within 30 days of the last dose of 
protocol treatment.  Any event that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be reported according to the instructions above. 
 
Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  Expected events are 
those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent.  An adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in: 
 
 the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section of this 
protocol; 
 the investigator’s brochure or the drug package insert  
  Step 5:  Review Section 10.6 to determine if: 
 there are any protocol-specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring; and/or 
 there are any protocol-specific exceptions to the reporting requirements. 
 
10.4 Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
 
Expedited Reporting 
 
 The Principal Investigator must be notified within 24 hours of learning of any 
serious adverse events, regardless of attribution, occurring during the study. 
 The UCSD Human Research Protections Program (HRPP) and the Moores 
Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) must be notified 
  Page 17  
 within 10 business days of “any unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others” (UPR). 
The following events meet the definition of UPR: 
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other problems), which in 
the opinion of the Principal Investigator was unanticipated, involved risk to subjects or others, and was possibly related to the research procedures. 
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the IRB-approved 
protocol that alters the level of risk. 
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate 
apparent immediate hazard to a research subject. 
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring report, updated 
sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding that indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for the research. 
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject or others. 
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or that 
cannot be resolved by the Principal Investigator. 
 
Routine Reporting 
 
 The UCSD HRPP will be notified of any adverse events that are not 
unanticipated problems involving risk to subjects or others (non-UPRs) at the time of the annual Continuing Review.  
 The FDA will be notified of all other adverse events that do not meet the criteria 
for expedited reporting at the time of the IND Annual Report.  
 10.5 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Therapy  
 a) Adverse Events requiring removal from study. 
b) Non-compliance that in the opinion of the investigator does not allow for ongoing 
participation. 
c) Physician determines it is in the subject’s best interest. 
 10.6 Criteria for Removal from Study 
 
a) Loss to follow-up. b) Withdrawal of consent for any further data submission. 
 
11.0 DATA COLLECTION 
 
11.1 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
 In addition to adverse event monitoring and clinical oversight by the principal investigator 
and co-investigators, quality assurance of the study will be performed by the clinical 
trials office internal monitor. Monitoring intervals will be dependent upon the number of patients enrolled.   
  Page 18  
 This study will also use the UCSD Moores Cancer Center Data Safety and Monitoring 
Board to provide oversight in the event that this treatment approach leads to unforeseen 
toxicities. The DSMB will review data from this study semi-annually.   
 Data from this study will be reported semi-annually and will include:  
1) the protocol title, IRB protocol number, and the activation date of the study.  2) the number of patients enrolled to date  
3) the date of first and most recent patient enrollment 
4) a summary of all adverse events regardless of grade and attribution   5) a response evaluation for evaluable patients  6) a summary of any recent literature that may affect the ethics of the study. 
 
11.2 Confidentiality Procedures 
 
Recruitment procedures will involve the review of patient records by designated study personnel (e.g., investigators and/or study coordinators) in order to identify potentially eligible patients.  Since Protected Health Information (PHI) will be accessed via the 
hospital’s medical record database and scheduling system (e.g., CPRS) prior to 
contacting the potential subject about the research study, we are requesting a partial waiver of HIPAA authorization for access to PHI for purposes of prescreening only.  Standard HIPAA authorization to collect research  data from the subject's medical record 
will be obtained at the time of informed consent.  
Protected health information (PHI) will be maintained in the subjects' medical charts and 
thus confidentiality is protected via routine procedures.  Data specific to this study will be kept in an electronic database to which only the principal investigator and involved study personnel will have access.  The database will be de-identified by removing subjects' names and assigning a unique identifier to each subject.  The database will be 
maintained on a protected disk drive in the radiation oncology department. 
 
 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 12.1 Statistical Analysis  
12.1.1 Primary Endpoint: The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of five fraction SBRT in pancreatic cancer.  The MTD will be 
defined from dose limiting toxicity, which will represent grade ≥3 gastrointestinal (GI) 
toxicity.  GI toxicity from SBRT can occur anywhere from 6 weeks to 1 year after SBRT, with the median time to a toxic event being 6 months [6].  Because of the long “window” for toxicity a classic phase I 3+3 dose-escalation trial design would require a substantial amount of time between enrolled subjects to observe for toxic events. Therefore, to improve efficiency this study will use a time to event continual reassessment method 
(TITE-CRM) trial design [11], described in more detail below. 
  
12.1.2  Secondary Endpoints   
12.1.2.1 Local control. The cumulative incidence of local failure will be 
determined for all patients treating distant progression or death as a competing 
  Page 19  
 risk. Local progression will be defined as a ≥20% increase in size on CT 
compared with CT prior to SBRT. 
 
12.1.2.2 Distant metastatic progression rate. The cumulative incidence of distant 
metastatic failure will be determined for all patients treating death as a competing risk. In patients initially presenting with locally advanced disease, distant disease progression will be defined as the appearance of new metastatic lesions. In patients presenting with metastatic disease, distant progression will be defined 
as a ≥20% increase in size on CT of the previously noted metastatic lesions. 
 12.1.2.3 Overall survival. Overall survival will be measured from the date of 
diagnosis through death of any cause. Survival will also be reported from the date of SBRT for comparisons to other trials in the literature. Finally, survival will 
be stratified by those with locally advanced disease, and those with metastatic 
disease on presentation.  12.1.2.4 Dose response. An exploratory analysis evaluating for a correlation 
between radiation dose response and local control will be done with a competing 
risk analysis, dividing patients into two groups stratified by the median dose.. 
 12.1.2.5 Longitudinal quality of life. We will track longitudinal quality of life using 
the European Organization for Research and Treatment in Cancer (EORTC) quality of life core cancer questionnaire with the pancreatic cancer module (EORTC QLQ C-30/ PAN26) (see appendix). The questionnaire will be given 
prior to treatment, and periodically during follow-up visits after treatment has 
concluded.  Trends will be assessed with a linear mixed effects model.  12.1.2.6 Correlation between quality of life and disease progression. Disease 
progression is a commonly used surrogate endpoint in clinical trial with pancreas 
cancer, however its relationship with quality of life has not clearly been 
demonstrated. Therefore, we will assess for correlation between quality of life and local or distant disease progression.  12.1.2.7 Dose-volume relationship with duodenal/gastric toxicity. We will plan to 
use logistic regression models to determine the relationship between grade ≥3 
duodenal or gastric toxicity and dose to these structures. The dose to the 
duodenum will be extracted from our treatment planning system.  12.1.2.8 Ability to receive additional chemotherapy. We will determine the 
fraction of patients who are able to receive additional chemotherapy among 
those whose initial intent was to do so. After consultation with an oncologist, but 
prior to treatment, we will record whether patients wish to receive additional chemotherapy after the course of chemo-radiotherapy delivered with this study. Possible responses include: yes, no, or undecided. We will then record who receives subsequent chemotherapy after completing treatment in our protocol.  
12.1.2.9 Surrogate target discovery. We will determine the natural anatomical 
surrogates that best correlate with the motion of the fiducial markers. Potential 
surrogates include the superior mesenteric vessels, aorta, portal vein, and soft-tissue border of the pancreas. This information will help treat pancreas cancer 
  Page 20  
 patients using image guidance technologies who could not have the markers 
placed. 
 
12.1.2.10 Adaptive RT strategies. We will conduct a study to determine the best 
adaptive RT strategies that maximize the therapeutic ratio based on analyzing the information contained in the daily imaging studies to be performed on the patients.  
 
12.2 Trial Design, Sample Size, and Study Duration 
 12.2.1 Trial Design: We will use a time to event continual reassessment method (TITE-CRM) trial design [11] to enroll a maximum of 30 patients onto this protocol. 
 
The primary goal of this trial will be to determine the SBRT dose associated with a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in 20% of patients. DLT will be defined as grade ≥3 gastrointestinal 
toxicity (defined further below).  
The TITE-CRM extends the original CRM by weighting each patient’s contribution to the 
likelihood function described below.  To determine the recommended dose for a newly enrolled patient, model parameters are esti mated via the weighted likelihood. All 
previously enrolled patients who had either experienced toxicity or had completed the 12-month observation period without toxicity are assigned weights of 1; otherwise they are assigned weights equal to the proportion of the observation period they have 
completed. 
 The first patient in this study will enroll at dose level #2.  Dose de-escalation can occur at anytime, though dose escalation will be restricted to 1 level between sequential patients.  Additionally, before escalating the dose to the next level two conditions must be met: 1) 
the sum of the observation periods for all patients at the current dose level must be at 
least 12 months; and 2) at least one patient must have been under observation for at least 6 month at the current dose level.  The rationale for these two conditions is mainly due to the short life expectancy of this patient population, which has a median survival of 8.25 months.  
A two-parameter logistic regression model will be used to estimate the probability of 
toxicity at each dose level after each patient has been enrolled, which will inform the decision as to whether we should dose-escalate the patient in question.  A final two-parameter logistic model will be fitted using follow-up data from 6 months after accrual of the last patient

Dose level Probability of dose limiting toxicity 
1 0.01 
2 0.05 
3 0.10 4 0.20 5 0.30 
 12.2.2 Dose Limiting Toxicity: The only toxicity observed thus far in pancreas SBRT has been related to nearby normal gastrointestinal organs, namely the duodenum and 
  Page 21  
 stomach.  Dose limiting toxicity in this study will be defined as any grade 3-5 
gastrointestinal toxicity as measured by the Common Terminology for Adverse Events, 
version 4.0 (see appendix). 
 12.2.3 Maximum Sample Size: 30  12.2.4 Study duration: We anticipate accruing 12 patients per year, and will follow the last patient for a minimum of 6 months. 
 
12.2.5 Interim analysis: This TITE-CRM trial design will de-escalate the radiation dose rapidly according to the observed dose-limiting toxicity. In addition to this built-in dose de-escalation we plan to conduct interim safety analysis after enrollment of every  patient.  We will stop the trial early if either of the following three conditions are met: 
Condition 1 for early trial stoppage:  more than 50% of patients at any dose level 
experience a dose-limiting toxicity. 
Condition 2 for early trial stoppage:  more than 34% of patients at dose level #1 
experience a dose-limiting toxicity. 
 
12.2.6 Operating Characteristics of the design: We used simulation to investigate the 
operating characteristics of our TITE-CRM configuration.  We set the prior probability of toxicity at dose levels as in the table above, and investigate four different scenarios for the true underlying probabilities of toxicity:  
 Scenario 1: Toxicity probabilities (.01, .05, .10, .20, .30) for dose 1-5, 
respectively (Prior Probability = True Probability) 
 Scenario 2: Toxicity probabilities (.01, .05, .07, .10, .15) for dose 1-5, 
respectively (Prior Probability > True Probability) 
 Scenario 3: Toxicity probabilities (.01, .05, .07, .10, .25) for dose 1-5, 
respectively (Prior Probability > True Probability) 
 Scenario 4: Toxicity probabilities (.05, .10, .20, .30, .50) for dose 1-5, 
respectively (Prior Probability < True Probability)  
We set our target rate of toxicity at the MTD to be .20, and set a vague normal prior with 
mean 0 and variance 1.34 (9).  When a simulated patient enters the study, they are assigned to the dose chosen by the ‘titecrm’ function in the R library dfcrm  (10), 
following the rules for dose escalation above. The incoming patient experiences a toxicity with probability given by the true underlying rate of toxicity for their assigned 
dose level, with toxicity time occurring uniformly between 0 and 12 months.  Potential 
drop out (i.e. death) times are drawn randomly (with replacement) from the literature [5].  We set the number of simulations for each scenario at 5000.  Operating characteristics of the TITE-CRM simulation under different scenarios are 
included in the table below. 'Power' is defined as the simulated probability that the 
algorithm will recommend the correct MTD, defined in our simulation as the dose whose true toxicity probability is closest to, but not great than, the target (dose 4, 5, 4, and 3 for each of the four scenarios, respectively) at the trials conclusion.  Trial duration is the amount of time (in months) from the first patients’ enrollment to the end of the final patients observation period.  Total Obs. is the cumulative observation time (in months) 
on all 30 patients.  Pr(Tox.) is the simulated probability of toxicity in that configuration, 
and Pr(Tox. Above MTD) is the simulated probability of a subject having toxicity at a dose above the MTD.

In conducting this research you are required to follow the requirements listed in the INVESTIGATOR MANUAL.  
Investigators are reminded that the IRB must be notified of any changes in the study.  In addition, the PI is 
responsible for ensuring prompt reporting to the IRB of proposed changes in a research activity, and for ensuring 
that such changes in approved research, during the period for which IRB approval has already been given, may not 
be initiated without IRB review and approval except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the 
subject (45 CFR 46.103(4)(iii)).  The PI must also inform the IRB of any new and significant information that may 
impact a research participant’s safety or willingness to continue in the study and any unanticipated problems 
involving risks to participants or others.
DHHS regulations at 45 CFR 46.109 (e) require that continuing review of research be conducted by the IRB at 
intervals appropriate to the degree of risk and not less than once per year. The regulations make no provision for 
any grace period extending the conduct of the research beyond 4/18/2023.  You will receive continuing review 
email reminder notices prior to this date; however, it is your responsibility to submit your continuing review report 
in a timely manner to allow adequate time for substantive and meaningful IRB review and assure that this study is 
not conducted beyond 4/18/2023.  Investigators should submit continuing review reports in the electronic system at 
least six weeks prior to this date.
Research activity in which the VA Maryland Healthcare System (VAMHCS) is a recruitment site or in which VA 
resources (i.e., space, equipment, personnel, funding, data) are otherwise involved, must also be approved by the 
VAMHCS Research and Development Committee prior to initiation at the VAMHCS.  Contact the VA Research 
Office at 410-605-7000 ext. 6568 for assistance.

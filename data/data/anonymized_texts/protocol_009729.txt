Title of study:  Safety and acceptability of deferiprone delayed release tablets in patients with 
systemic iron overload  
Study code:  LA61 -0218  
Phase of development:  Phase 2  
Objectives:  Primary objective:   To evaluate the safety of deferiprone  delayed release (DR) 
tablets  in two different dosage groups in patients with systemic iron overload . 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate the tolerability of deferiprone  DR tablets in two different 
dosage group s in patients with systemic iron overload  
• To evaluate the acceptability to patients of deferiprone DR

 Multi -center open -label study in patients with transfusion -dependent blood disorders 
who are currently taking deferiprone immediate release tablets (Ferriprox®) for the 
treatment of systemic iron overload. There will be two treatment groups, defined as 
“low dosage” (Group A) and “high dosage” (Group B).  With Ferriprox, the 
recommended starting dosage is 75 milligrams  per kilogram of body weight (mg/k g) 
per day  and the recommended maximum is 100 mg/kg  per day, but for most 
patients, the precise daily amount differs from either of these values  since  doses 
must be tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals and 
rounded to the nearest half -tablet .  Study participants will be assigned to Group A or 
Group B depending on which end of the range their Ferriprox intake is closer to, 
with equal numbe rs of patients enrolled in each group:  
• Group A, low dosage:   Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a 
dosage that is closer to 75 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
• Group B, high dosage:   Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a 
dosage that is closer to 100 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
In each group, participants will be provided with deferiprone DR tablets to be 
taken twice daily (b.i.d.) for 28 days at  a total daily dosage the matches the total 
amount of Ferriprox they have been taking three times daily (t.i.d.)  as closely as 
possible. Individual doses will be rounded to the nearest 500 mg half -tablet.   
Doses are always to be taken with food.  Following the last dose, patients will 
return to their regular chelation regimen.

Study design (cont’d):  Screening will be conducted wit hin 14 days prior to the start of dosing, and with the 
exception of hematology, laboratory results obtained at that time will be treated as 
the baseline values. Blood s amples will be collected for the assessment of 
biochemistry (screening and Days 3, 7, 14 , 21, and 28), hematology (screening, 
baseline, and Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), serology (screening only), and other safety 
parameters (screening and Day 28); and urine samples will be collected for 
urinalysis (screening and Day 28).  For the Day 3, 7, 14, an d 21 samples, patients 
may choose to visit a local laboratory instead of the study site; if this is done, they 
must use the same laboratory throughout the entire study.  If deemed necessary, 
patients with ongoing adverse events may be asked after the last dose to provide 
further blood samples until resolution.  On Day 28, patients will be asked for their 
views on the acceptability of the delayed release formulation vs. the immediate 
release (Ferriprox) tablets .   
Any patient who withdraws before completing treatment will be requested to 
return for an Early Termination visit, at which time the procedures scheduled for 
the Day 28  visit will be conducted.  
As this will be the first time that deferiprone DR is administe red to patients with 
iron overload, as a precaution, enrollment will be conducted progressively in small  
groups , and safety results will be reviewed following the enrollment of a limited 
number of patients . Decisions regarding continuation will be based on  the findings.  
Duration of 
participation : The duration of participation will be 28 days , excluding the screening period . 
 
Criteria for 
evaluation:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Safety  
In recognition of the variability of levels of the liver enzymes alanine  
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) in patients with 
iron overload, the criterion for deciding whether an individual patient’s increases 
for each of these enzymes during the study constitute a safety concern  will be set as 
follows:  
• For a patient whose level is within the normal range at bas eline, the criterion 
will be reaching a value of 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
• For a patient whose level is above the ULN at baseline, the criterion will be 
reaching a value of 5 times the baseline value  or 10 x ULN  
For each dosage group, the fo llowing will be determined:  
• The number and percentage of patients with increased post -dose levels of 
ALT and/or AST that meet  either of the criteria defined above  
• Adverse events (AEs):  Frequency, intensity, time to onset, duration, and 
relatedness to stud y drug

Notes : 
- With the exception of hematology, laboratory results obtained at screening  
will be treated as the baseline value s. 
- There will be a window of ±1 day for assessments done at Days 3 and 7 , 
and of ±2 days for assessments done at Days 14, 21, and 28.  
- The investigator may increase the frequency of safety evaluations if 
deemed appropriate for assessment of any clinically significant adverse 
event .  In the case of increases in liver enzymes that  meet the criteria for 
being considered a safety concern, the patient is to be followed  until 
resolution of the event , beyond Day 28 if necessary . 
- If a patient withdraws from the study, the End of Study procedures are to be 
performed at an early terminatio n visit.  
Schedule of Evaluation of Acceptability  
Questionnaire on patient preference for IR vs. DR formulation:  Day 28  
Statistical methods:  The Clopper -Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) of the incidence of post-dose 
levels of ALT or AST that meet the criteri a for being considered a safety concern  
will be calculated for each dosage group .  Similarly, the Clopper -Pearson 95% CI  of 
the inciden ce of gastrointestinal (GI) distress  reported by patients during the study 
will also be calculated. Other  AEs will be summarized by using frequency tables. 
The incidence of abnormal data for safety measures will be presented for each 
dosage group . The continuous and discrete variables for safety data will be  
summarized with descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) and frequency tables, respectively, at each assessment. 
For each dosage group , frequency tables will b e used to summarize the response to 
each question of the questionnaire on treatment acceptability between Ferriprox 
IR vs. deferiprone DR. Based on the responses to the question on overall 
preference for one formulation or the other, a one-sample proportio n test  will be 
used to test if the overall preference for deferiprone DR is greater than 0.5 for 
each dosage group .

 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Beta thalassemia and certain other hereditary blood disorders are characterized by  abnormal 
form s of hemoglobin  that lead to excessive destruction of red blood cells  and severe  anemia , 
necessitating  frequent and lifelong red blood cell (RBC) transfusions . As each RBC unit 
contains approximately 200 mg of iron and there is no natural mechanism for the excretion of 
extra iron, body iron accumulates rapidly in the absence of chelation treat ment , with 
particular impact on the heart , endocrine glands , and liver. While iron plays an essential role 
in many metabolic pathways, free iron is toxic to cells, acting as a catalyst in the formation of 
free radicals  and leading to morbidity and mortalit y. Accordingly,  life-long iron chelation 
therapy is necessary for survival.  
Deferiprone (3 -hydroxy -1,2-dimethylpyridin -4-one) is a bidentate iron chelator that binds 
ferric iron tightly in a 3:1 (deferiprone:iron) molar ratio and has markedly lesser affinity for 
other cations.  Deferiprone’s small molecular size, lack of charge at physiological pH, and 
balanced octanol:water partition coefficient support cell permeability and rapid access to 
both extracellular and intracellular labile iron stores.1 
Immediate -Release Deferiprone  
Three commercial oral formulations of immediate  release (IR) deferiprone are currently 
marketed by ApoPharma Inc.  under  the brand name Ferriprox®:  500 mg film -coated tablets, 
1000 mg film -coated tablets, and a 100  mg/mL oral solution. In the European Union, all 
3 formulations have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the 
treatment of iron overload in p atients with thalassemia major for whom deferoxamine 
therapy is contraindicated or causes serious toxicity. In the United States, the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) has approved the 500 mg tablets and the 100 mg/mL oral solution for 
the treatment of pa tients with transfusional iron overload due to thalassemia syndromes when 
current chelation therapy is inadequate ; and in Canada, all three formulations of Ferriprox 
were  approved in 2015 by Health Canada for the same indication.    
Ferriprox must be  taken three times a day, at a total daily  dosage of 75 up to 99 or 100 mg/kg  
(i.e., 3 equal doses of 25 to 33 mg/kg t.i.d.).  However, p ost-marketing feedback from both 
clinicians and patients has indicated that the number of tablets per day, as well as t he need to 
take a dose  in the middle of the day, creates a situation where the choice  is sometimes  made 
to forgo the mid -day dose , particularly in the case of  school -age children .  The scale of this 
omission has not been formally assessed, but the frequenc y with which ApoPharma is asked 
if Ferriprox can be taken twice instead of three times  daily supports the intuitive sense that 
mid-day dosing is a bona fide  concern for a significant  segment of the  patient  population.

 Delayed -Release Deferiprone  
In an ef fort to improve patient compliance, ApoPharma Inc. has develop ed a 1000 mg 
delayed release (DR) deferiprone tablet that would support twice -daily (b.i.d.) administration 
instead of the t.i.d. regimen required for the IR tablets.  It contains an enteric coat ing to 
significantly decrease drug release in the stomach , and the composition of the core allows 
half-tablets to provide similar bioavailability of drug as that from a whole tablet .  To date, the 
DR formulation has been assessed in  four ApoPha rma-sponsored trials  in healthy volunteers :  
two that looked at pharmacokinetics (PK)  and two that looked at tolerability, with one of the 
tolerability studies adding a special focus on the effect of this formulation on liver enzyme 
levels . 
In the first PK study , LA53 -0116  (N=28 ), healthy volunteers received a single 1000 mg dose 
of deferiprone DR  (equivalent to about 15  mg/kg  for a subject weighing 70 kg ) in the forms 
of a whole tablet  under fed conditions , a whole tablet  under fasting conditions, and two half-
tablets under fed conditions. In the second , LA45 -0116  (N=36 ), healthy volunteers subjects  
received a total daily dosage of 3000 mg  of deferiprone DR  (equivalent to about 45  mg/kg  
for an average -weight subject ), divided into 2 equal doses per day , for 3 consecutive days, 
under fed conditions.  Both trials included a control treatment of the licensed Ferriprox IR 
tablets, administered as a single dose in the first trial and as a t.i.d. regimen in the second, 
and both involved a comparison of the safety and tolerability of the two formulations  as 
well as o f PK parameters .  It was demonstrated that the extent of drug exposure (i.e., AUC) 
of the DR formulation was equivalent to that of the IR tablet after a single dose. There were 
no significant food effects on the pharmacokinetics of the DR formulation. There were also 
no differences in drug exposure between a whole tablet and two half -tablets  of the DR 
formulation. At steady state, the PK profile of the two dose adminis trations of DR over a 
24-hour period  under fed conditions demonstrated  a peak (i.e., C max) and extent of drug 
exposure that were equivalent to those of the  three dose administrations of IR over a 24 -
hour period .  With respect to safety, the DR tablet at this dosage was found to be safe and 
well tolerated . 
Study  LA58 -0117 , with a planned sample size of 86, was a Phase I study that evaluated 
the gastrointestinal (GI)  tolerance of deferiprone DR.  Healthy subjects were randomized to 
receive the highest approved dosage  (100 mg/kg daily ) of either deferiprone DR or 
Ferriprox IR for 3  days, with dosing conducted in the fasting state in order to assess 
tolerability under the conditions most likely to induce GI distress , even though  the 24-hour 
bioequivalence of DR and IR tablets had been  demonstrated only in the fed state in study 
LA45 -0116 .  Subjects randomized to deferiprone DR received 50 mg/kg b.i.d., while those  
randomized to Ferriprox received 33 m g/kg t.i.d. While the study was still in progress, it was 
observed that of the 19 participants at that time  who had received the DR formulation, 31.6%  
experienced nausea and 26.3%  experienced vomiting, compared to rates of 20.0% and 0.0%,

 respectively, amon g the 20 subjects who had received Ferriprox. None of the events were 
deemed to be serious or severe,  but in 2 cases they led to v oluntary withdrawal . The study 
was terminated early as it was determined that sufficient information had been obtained  on 
the GI tolerance of deferiprone DR in the fasting state . The subsequent study, LA60 -0118  
(N=50) , assessed the tolerability of  deferiprone DR  in healthy volunteers in the fed state , 
which is the condition under which iron-overloaded patients will be instructed to take it , as 
its 24 -hour bioequivalence to Ferriprox IR tablets was demonstrated under fed conditions . 
In both study LA58 -0117 and the subsequent study LA60 -0118, the dosage of deferiprone DR  
was set at 100 mg/kg/day ( 50 mg/kg b.i.d.), which i s the maximum recommended dose that 
would be prescribed to patients for the treatment of systemic iron overload.  While LA60 -0118  
was in progress, it was observed that half the subjects dosed to date had asymptomatic 
elevated levels of alanine aminotransfe rase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
with approximately 20% reaching values of approximately  5 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN) and 1 subject reaching 8 x ULN.  Subjects remained asymptomatic, and liver enzyme 
levels  returned to normal following the last dose.  The protocol was amended to reduce the 
dosage for the remaining  subjects  to 75 mg/kg/day (37.5 mg/kg b.i.d.), which is the dose  
normally pr escribed  for the treatment of  iron-overload  at the start of therapy, in order to 
evaluate if there is a dose -related effect with regard to elevation of liver enzymes  in healthy 
volunteers .  That study is ongoing.   
1.2 Rationale  
According to pharmacokinetic bioequivalence criteria, adverse events that depend on C max 
and/or AUC would be expected to be the same for two formulations that provide  equivalent 
Cmax and AUC over a 24 -hour period. While  transient liver enzyme elevations ar e a known 
adverse event at initiation of therapy with Ferriprox IR, particular attention will be paid to 
this effect in the current study given the rate of elevated liver enzymes seen in the Phase I  
study . While the reason for that happening is unclear, it  is hypothesized that this effect will 
be less prominent in iron -overloaded individuals, since with them, unlike in healthy 
volunteers, deferiprone will rapidly bind to excess iron and will thus be less available for 
involvement in other biochemical  reacti ons. 
Previous clinical trials of deferiprone IR in patients with thalassemia have shown that ALT 
values in individual patients fluctuate , with declines from baseline of up to 369 U/ L and 
increases from baseline of up to 564 U/ L.2  ALT  levels of at least twice the upper limit of the 
reference range have been observed in up to 60% of patients treated with deferiprone.3  In the 
majority of these patients, the increase is asymptomatic and return s to baseline levels without 
discontinuation or dose reduction of deferiprone. In ApoPharma clinical trials, e levations of 
liver enzymes led to discontinuation of deferiprone therapy in only 5  of 889 patients ; 4 (0.4%)  
due to increased serum ALT levels and 1 (0.1%) due to an i ncrease in both ALT and AST.

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 58 
 The current study will evaluate  deferiprone DR in the target population of iron -overloaded 
patients. Participants must have been  on Ferriprox IR tablets for at least 3 months  at the time 
of enrollment,  and will be switched to d eferiprone DR tablets for 28 days  at approximately 
the same daily dosage at which they have been  taking Ferriprox IR.   The study will thus be 
able to evaluate if switching from the IR to the DR formulation will have an impact on liver 
enzyme levels. S ome i ncreases are to be expected in this population, due to liver iron 
overload and frequent blood transfusions, and may be considered acceptable.  In recognition 
of this, study participants’ past record of liver enzyme levels will be taken into account  when 
assessing safety concerns .  With regard to other adverse effects, because of the higher than 
expected rates of gastrointestinal events that were observed in healthy volunteers (studies 
LA58 -0117  and LA60 -0118), attention will be paid to the occurrence of GI events as well.  
Finally, in addition to the assessments of safety and tolerability, the study will allow for 
patients’ input on the acceptability of this new formulation and of the change in dosing from 
t.i.d. to b.i.d.  
1.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
The safety profile of two formulations is expected to be the same since they provide  
equivalent  drug exposure  over a 24 -hour period.  The elevations of ALT and AST that were 
seen in the Phase I subjects following b.i.d. dosing with deferiprone DR were not o f clinical 
concern . However , it is possible  that this formulation ha s a greater impact on liver enzymes 
than does t.i.d. dosing with the immediate -release formulation, at least in healthy volunteers.  
Whether this difference extends to patients with system ic iron overload is not yet known.  
Nevertheless, n o other safety concerns were identified following a 3 -day dosing period in 
healthy volunteers.  
Comprehensive  safety information  on Ferriprox is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure 
for that product.4 In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were nausea, 
vomiting, and chromaturia  (seen in more than 10% of patients) and  increased ALT , arthralgia, 
and neutropenia  (seen in more than 1% of patients); and  the most serious adverse reaction was 
agranulocytosis, defined as an absolute  neutrophil count (ANC) less  than 0.5 x 109/L.  
Agranul ocytosis has been reported  in approximately 2% of patients taking Ferriprox, and l ess 
severe episodes of neutropenia (ANC < 1.5 x 109/L but > 0.5 x 109/L) have been reported in 
approximately 6.4%  of patients . In clinical trials, all events of agranulocytosis or neutropenia 
resolved upon discontinuation of Ferriprox.  Because of this known risk, participants in the 
present study will undergo safety monitoring  that includes  a weekly blood count to ensure early 
detection in case of a significant dr op in ANC.      
With respect to benefit, a s bioequivalence of deferiprone DR tablets to Ferriprox IR tablets 
over a 24 -hour period has been demonstrated, it is expected that study participants  will 
achieve at least the same efficacy that they have been obtaining from  Ferri prox.  Furthermore ,

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 58 
 given the recognized concerns  associated with t.i.d. dosing, the opportunity to achieve the 
same control of iron overload through a less onerous  regimen may be perceived as  an 
advantage by some patients .

3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 Description of Study Design  
This is a m ulti-center open -label study in patients with transfusion -dependent blood disorders  
who are currently taking deferiprone immediate release tablets (Ferriprox) for the treatment of 
systemic iron overload.   There will be two treatment grou ps, defined as “low dosage” (Group 
A) and “high dosage” (Group B).  With Ferriprox, the recommended starting dosage is 75 
milligrams  per kilogram of body weight (mg/kg) per day  and the recommended maximum is 
100 mg/kg  per day, but for many patients, the pr ecise daily amount differs from either of these 
values  since doses must be tailored to the individual patient’s response and therapeutic goals 
and rounded to the nearest half -tablet . Study participants will be assigned to Group A or Group 
B depending on which end of the range their Ferriprox intake is closer to, with equal numbers 
of patients enrolled in each group:  
• Group A, low dosage:  Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a dosage that is 
closer to 75 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
• Group B, high dosage:  Patients currently taking Ferriprox tablets at a dosage that is 
closer to 100 mg/kg /day (n=15)  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 18 of 58 
 In each group, participants will be provided with deferiprone DR tablets to be taken twice 
daily (b.i.d.) for 28 days at a total daily dosage the m atches the total amount of Ferriprox they 
have been taking three times daily (t.i.d.) as closely as possible. Individual doses will be 
rounded to the nearest 500 mg half -tablet.  Doses are always to be taken with food.  
Following the last dose, patients wi ll return to their regular chelation regimen.  
Screening will be conducted within 14 days prior to the start of dosing, and with the exception 
of hematology, laboratory results obtained at that time will be treated as the baseline values. 
Blood s amples will  be collected for the assessment of biochemistry (screening and Days 3, 7, 
14, 21, and 28), hematology (screening, baseline, and Days 7, 14, 21, and 28), serology 
(screening only), and other safety parameters (screening and Day 28); and urine samples will 
be collected for urinalysis (screening and Day 28).  For the Day 3, 7, 14, and 21 samples, 
patients may choose to visit a local laboratory instead of  the study site; if this is done, they 
must use the same laboratory throughout the entire study.  If deemed necessary, patients with 
ongoing adverse events may be asked after the last dose to provide further blood samples for 
up to 30 days or until resolut ion. On Day 28, patients will be asked for their views on the 
acceptability of the delayed release formulation vs. the immediate release (Ferriprox) tablets .   
Any patient who withdraws before completing treatment will be requested to return for an 
Early Termination visit, at which time the procedures scheduled for the Day 28  visit will be 
conducted.  
As this will be the first time that deferiprone DR is administered to patients with iron 
overload, as a precaution, enrollment will be conducted progressively in small groups , and 
safety results will be reviewed following the enrollment of a limited  number of patients . 
Decisions regarding continuation will be based on the findings.   Details are provided in 
Section 3.1.1 . 
3.1.1 Precautions Regarding Enrollment  
The process to be followed with respect to  enrollment is described below.  
3.1.1.1  Criteria for Safety Concerns  
As a consequence of  liver iron overload and frequent blood transfusions , patients in the target 
population may have fluctuations of AST and/or ALT that frequently exceed the reference 
ranges.   In recognition of this variability, for each of these enzymes, the criteri a for de ciding 
whether an individual patient’s increases during the current study is of concern will be set as 
follows:  
 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 58 
 • For a patient whose baseline level  is within the normal range, the criterion will be 
reaching a value of 5 times the ULN during the study.  
• For a patient whose baseline level is above the ULN, the criterion will be reaching a 
value of 5 times the baseline value during the study  or 10 x ULN.  
All cases of patients meeting either of the above criteria  at any point during the study must be 
reported to ApoPharma by the investigator within 24  hours of occurrence, using the sponsor’s 
SAE form .   
If at any time during the study a patient’s ALT and/or AST values reach a level of 10 x ULN , 
do the following:  
• If the patient is symptomatic and/or has any other clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory results, immediately withdraw the patient from the study.  
• If the patient is asymptomatic and has no other clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory re sults, interrupt treatment and obtain a confirmatory count the next day.  
• If the value is confirmed to be ≥10 x ULN : 
o Stop treatment , withdraw the patient  and complete all end of study 
assessments scheduled for Day 28  
o Document the event and report it within 24 hours  to ApoPharma  
o Monitor the patient daily until the elevated value returns to a level that is 
regarded  as not clinically significant  
• If the confirmatory value is found  to be < 10 x ULN , resume treatment as per 
protocol, and monitor liver enzyme levels within 3 days of resuming therapy.  
3.1.1.2   Rules for Enrollment  
The rules that will be applied for enrolling patients in each group are described below , using 
the criteri a provided in Section 3.1.1.1 .  Decisions will be made by a safety committee 
whose composition is described  in Section  8.  
Sites will enroll and start the dosing of patients in both groups . Once enrollment has 
reached 5 patients  in either group , enrollment will be paused, the safety data of those 
5 patients will be reviewed by the safety  committee after all 5 have completed at least one 
week of dosing, and further enrollment will depend on whether the findings are satisfactory 
or raise safety concerns.

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 58 
 If the first group to reach an N of 5 is Group A  (low-dosage) : 
• If there are no safety concerns after one week of dosing , the safety committee will 
issue approval for enrol lment of  all remaining patients in Group A and enrollment in 
Group B up to 5 patients. (The criteria for enrollment in Group B are described below.)  
• If 2 or more of the first 5 patients in Group A reach the criteria defined in Section 3.1.1.1 ,  
the committee will issue approval  for enrollment of just 5 more patients in Group A, 
and enrollment in Group B  will be put on hold . Dosing of the first 5 Group A patients  
will continue, and the committee will r eview the data of the 10 Group A patients once 
all of them have completed at least 1 week of dosing.  
o At this point, if there are no safety concerns, the committee will issue approval for 
enroll ment of  the final 5 patients in Group A  and for enrollment of Group B to 
resume, as per the criteria described for that group.  
o If 4 or more of the 10 patients in Group A who have been dosed to date reach the 
criteria defined in Section 3.1.1.1 , enrollment of additional patients in both groups  
will be put on hold, and the following processes are to be conducted:   
▪ Any patients who have reached the criterion and are symptomatic and/or 
have other associated abnormal laboratory values  are to be withdrawn 
from the study.  
▪ Patients who did not reach the criterion and for whom there are no other 
safety concerns should continue dosing.  
▪ Patients  who did reach the criterion but are asymptomatic and do not have 
any other associated abnor mal laboratory values should continue dosing , 
but must have  their enzyme levels monitored every 2 days:  
• If just one patient experiences a confirmed elevation of ALT and/or 
AST ≥10 x ULN , that patient is to be withdrawn from the study , but 
enrollment of the final 5 Group A patients may proceed .  
• If two or more patients experience a confirmed elevation of ALT 
and/or AST ≥10 x ULN, treatment is to be interrupted for all 
patients, and the safety committee must promptly meet to review all 
available safety data and recommend whether or not the study should 
continue .

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 58 
 If the first group to reach an N of 5 is Group B  (high -dosage) : 
• If there are no safety concerns after one week of dosing, enroll all remaining patients in 
the study.  
• If 2 or m ore of the first 5 patients in Group B reach the criteria defined in Section 3.1.1.1 , 
the committee will issue approval for enrollment of just 5 more patients in Group B.   
Dosing of the first 5 Group B patients will continue, and the committee will review the 
data of the 10 patients once all of them have completed at least 1 week of dosing.   
(Enrollment may continue in the meantime in Group A, provided the stopping criteria 
defined for that group are not met.)  
o At this point, if there are no safety concerns, the committee will  issue approval for 
enrollment of the final 5 patients in Group B. 
o If 4 or more of the 10 patients in Group B who have been dosed to date reach the 
criteria defined in Section 3.1.1.1 , enrollment of additional patients in Group B  will 
be put on hold , and as the processes  described below  are to be conducted . 
(Enrollment may continue in the meantime in Group A , provided the stopping 
criteria defined for that group are not met.)  
▪ Any patients who have reached the criterion and are symptomatic and/or 
have other associated abnormal laboratory values  are to be withdrawn 
from the study.  
▪ Patients who did not reach the criterion and for whom there are no other 
safety concerns should continue dosing.  
▪ Patients who did reach the criterion but are asymptomatic and do not have 
any other associated abnormal laboratory values  should continue dosing  
but must have  their enzyme le vels monitored every 2 days:  
• If just one patient experiences a confirmed elevation of ALT and/or 
AST ≥10 x ULN , that patient is to be withdrawn  from the study , but 
enrollment of the final Group B patients may proceed.   
• If two or more patients experience a confirmed elevation of ALT 
and/or AST ≥10 x ULN, treatment is to be interrupted for all 
patients, and the safety committee must promptly meet to review all 
available safety data and recommend whether or not the study should 
continue  
 
Repeat assessments to confirm laboratory results may be performed.  The decision on whether 
to put the study on hold or terminate it  will be made by the safety committee .

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 22 of 58 
 If a confirmed  elevation of ALT and/or AST  > 10 x ULN  is experienced by two subjects in 
the same dosage group , a review of the data must immediately take place to decide whether 
or not  the study should continue.  The investigator must report any occurrence of this  to the 
sponsor within 24 hours  of occurrence , using the sponsor’s SAE form . 
3.2 Ration ale for Study Design  
Study  population: To date, f our Phase I trials  have been or are currently being conducted to 
assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of deferiprone delayed release tablets in 
healthy volunteers.  This study will be the first to look at the DR  formulation in the population  
for which it is  intended. It is possible that the rates of adverse events that were seen in healthy 
subjects would occur at different rates  in patients, due to the different  action of an iron chelator  
in iron -overloaded vs. non -iron-loaded recipients.  
Dosage s:  Patients with systemic iron overload are usually prescribed deferiprone at a dosage 
ranging from 75 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day.  Dosages within both the upper half and the 
lower half of this range  will be investigated, to determine if there is a dose eff ect on the 
adverse events that were seen in healthy subjects  (due to tailoring of dosages to individual 
patient needs  and to rounding , most potential subjects will not be  on a dosage of 
Ferriprox that is exactly  75 mg/kg /day or exactly 100 mg/kg /day).  In all cases, the total 
daily dosage of deferiprone DR will be made  to match that of Ferrip rox IR as closely as 
possible. Since dosages will be rounded to the nearest 500 mg and body weights of participants  
will differ , some variability is unavoidable.  
Safety Precautions :  The findings from the first  5 participants to be enrolled in either dosage 
group will be assessed before enrollment can continue . Details are provided in Section  3.1.1 . 
As a further precaution, alert events have been defined that will mandate extra  monitoring or 
termination  from the study in any patient in whom they are observed .  Information  on alert 
events is provided in Section 4.5.1 . 
Endpoints :  The endpoints are safety and acceptability.  No endpoints for efficacy have been 
included, as  bioequivalence of deferiprone DR tablets to Ferriprox IR tablets over a 24 -hour 
period has already been demonstrated.  
3.3 Rationale for Selection of Doses  
For Ferriprox, dosages of 75 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day represent the most common  
starting  dose and the maximum recommended dose, respectively, of the therapeutic dose 
range approved for patients with systemic iron overload .  The dosage groups in this study 
will be  within either  the upper half or the lower half of this range . 
The Phase I studies  LA58 -0118 and LA60 -0118 , conducted in healthy volunteers, both evaluated 
the maximum recommended dose of deferiprone ( 100 mg/kg/day) w ithout the titration that is 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 23 of 58 
 normally recommended for initiation of treatment in patients with iron overload. In both 
studies, following receipt of deferiprone DR, there were higher than expected percentages of 
subjects with GI events  and elevated liver en zymes.   It is possible that  starting  the dosing  
directly at 100 mg/kg/day with no titration may have been a factor  in the occurrence of both 
types of  events. It  is also known  that healthy volunteers  are more  adversely impacted by an 
iron chelator  in ways that iron-overloaded patients would not be .  That is, these events  may 
prove to be less prominent in the latter since with them, deferiprone will rapidly bind to 
excess iron and will thus be less available for involvement in other biochemical react ions.  
As the maximum  recommended  dosage of deferiprone is essential in some patients, it is 
important to assess dosages at the high end of the range  in the target population, with safety 
measures in place to ensure that participants are not placed at undu e risk. In the case of liver  
enzymes, increases  in ALT and AST  are commonly observed in patients with transfusion -
dependent thalassemia, irrespective of deferiprone therapy, and thus the clinical significance of 
any increase needs to be evaluated in individual patients based on their medical history.   
Comparison of the  low and high  dosages  will allow for assessment  of a dose effect  of 
deferiprone .  In healthy volunteers, in contrast to the elevated ALT and AST level s seen at 
100 mg/kg/day, no such concerns were observed in the earlier study LA45 -0116 , which  
employed a f ixed dosage of 1500 mg b.i.d., the equivalent of about 20 mg/kg in an average -
weight (70 kg) person . There would be no purpose in assessing a sub -therapeutic dosage in 
patients, but it will be of interest to see if there are fewer or less severe liver enzyme 
elevations  in the lower dosage group .

4.4 Enrolment Violations  
The criteria for enrolment must be followed explicitly.  If there is inadvertent enrolment of 
patients who do not meet enrolment criteria, the investigator should consider withdrawing these  
individuals  from the study.  
4.5 Patient Withdrawal  
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without 
consequence to future c are by the investigator or study center.  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study at any time , at the discretion of the investigator , 
for any of the following reasons : 
• Medical or safety reasons considered significant by the patient  and/or the  investigator  
• Requirement for concomitant medication that might  interfere with the evaluation  of 
study treat ment or may be contraindicated  
• Receipt of a rescue medication  
• Occurrence of other illnesses that might affect the patient’s further participation in 
the study o r evaluation of study treatment  
• A protocol deviation that might  interfere with study assessments , as judged by the 
investigator  
• Repetitive patient non -compliance  with the protocol or with instruction s of the 
investigator  
• Participation in another  clinica l trial at any time during the conduct of this study  
• Any other situation where, in the opinion of the investigator , continuation of the 
study would not be in t he best interest of the patient  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 26 of 58 
 A patient must be withdrawn from t he study if any of the following conditions apply:  
• Pregnant or planning to become pregnant (see Section 7.1.4 ) 
• A confirmed ALT or AST value >10 x ULN  (see Section s 4.5.1.1  and 7.1.1.8.1 ) 
• A confirmed ANC value < 0.5 x 109 (see Section s 4.5.1.2  and 7.1.1.8.2 ) 
• Occurrence of any adverse event characterized as life -threatening or  disabling that is 
not associate d with the patient’s condition  
• Termination of the study by the sponsor  
Patients who decide  to withdraw participation in the study  should always be contacted , if 
possible,  in order to ask about  the reason for withdrawal , whether any adverse events (AEs)  
occurred, and use  of concomitant medications.  A withdrawn patient should return for an 
early termination visit and a follow -up visit. All investigational product and materials should 
be returned.  If any AEs occurred, the investigator must attempt to follow up the outcome 
until resolution . 
If a patient withdraws or is withdrawn before completing the study, the date and reason for 
the withdrawal must be entered on the source document and on the appropriate  page of the 
electr onic case report form ( eCRF), and all other appropria te eCRF pages must be completed.  
4.5.1 Alert Events  and Individual Stopping Rules  
Certain events are defined in this study as alerts, meaning that any occurrence  must be 
carefully monitored , and in some cases may mandate withdrawal of a patient or even early 
termination of the study.  
4.5.1.1  Elevated Liver Enzymes  
A patient  who reaches  an ALT and/or AST value  ≥10 x ULN  at any time during the study  is 
to be immediately  withdrawn  if he or she is additionally symptomatic and/or has any other 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory results . If there are no other signs of concern, a 
confirmatory count is to be obtained the next day .  If the value  is confirmed , the patient is 
to be withdrawn; if it is not, the patient is to be  closely monitored .  Details are provided in 
Section 3.1.1.1 . 
4.5.1.2  Neutropenia  
A sudden drop in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is a reaction  that has been associated with 
deferiprone treatment and is considered an adverse event of special interest.   ANC values 
will be monitored  throughout the study.  For a case of mild, moderate, or severe neutropenia 
to be confirmed, there must be 2 consecutive counts  of ANC , a maximum of 3 days apart , 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 58 
 that are both less than a specific  value. If at any time, a patient’s confirmed ANC level is 
found to be below < 1.5 x 109/L, the investigator is to do the following:  
• Mild neutropenia:   If the confirmed ANC is < 1.5 x 109/L but ≥1.0 x 109/L, continue 
treatment without interruption, but monitor ANC every 2 days until resolution.  
• Moderate neutropenia:  If the confirmed ANC is < 1.0 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L, 
interrupt treatment and monitor ANC every 2 days until resolution . The patient should  
re-initiate treatment once the event is resolved . If ANC is still < 1.5 x 109/L after 14 
days, withdraw patient from the study and monitor until resolution of the event.  
• Severe neutropenia  / agranulocytosis : If a single ANC is < 0.5 x 109/L, immediately 
interrupt  treatment without waiting for confirmation of the count  and obtain a second 
measurement  the following day.  If the second ANC is still < 0.5 x 109/L, permanently  
withdraw t he patient from the study  and follow the procedures for the management 
of agranulocytosis . 
Details on  the management of each category of neutropenia are provided  in Section 7.1.1.8.2 . 
4.5.1.3  Infection  
If a patient report s any symptoms indicative of infection such as fever, sore throat, or flu -like 
symptoms, interrupt treatment immediately  and obtain an ANC measurement, and monitor 
ANC more frequently; every 2 days if it is below  <1.5 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L.  Therapy 
can be re-initiated once all symptoms have been resolved and it is deemed safe by the 
investigator.   (If ANC is found to be above 1.5 x 109/L, treatment can be continued  if the  
investigator assesses the patient and considers continuation to be safe . Treatment  should be 
interrupted in any case of fever of 38.5 °C or greater. )  
4.5.2 Follow -up of Patient Withdrawal  Due to Pregnancy  
All female s of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to 
study entry and prior to first administration of the study drug , and must agree to use an 
approved method of contraception (as defined in inclusion criterion # 5) throughout the 
course of the trial.  If a patient does become pregnant, the investigator must do the following  
upon becoming aware of the pregnancy : 
• Ensure that the study medication is stopped immediately  
• Inform the sponso r via the pregnancy report form  
• With the patient’s consent, follow the pregnancy  closely , and provide reports to the 
sponsor until delivery or other resolution  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v  1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 28 of 58 
 A male patient must inform the investigator if his female partner becomes pregnant during 
the trial or within 1 month following the last dose of study medication.  As with the 
pregnancy of a female subject, the site must inform the sponsor and, if the part ner consents, 
follow the pregnancy and provide the sponsor with a report on its outcome.  
4.5.3 Replacement of Patients Who Withdraw  
Patients  who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.  
4.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
To be considered for enrollment, patients cannot be taking any iron chelator other than 
Ferriprox.  Those who are on a combination regimen of Ferriprox and another product are not 
eligible.  
In addition, d uring the trial, they may not take any other investigational  product, or any drugs 
that are known to cause agranulocytosis.  Medications  that are being taken on a stable regimen 
and that are considered necessary  for the subject’s  welfare may continue to be taken , at the 
discretion of the invest igator.  All medications  (including  study product, herbal medications, 
and over -the-counter medications) and nutrition al supplements taken from 3 months prior to 
screening  up to the end of the study ( Day 28 or early termination) must be reviewed by the 
investigator  and recorded in the source document and  in the ap propriate section of the eCRF.  
4.7 Rescue Medication  
Patients will be assigned to Group A or Group B  based on the total daily dosage of Ferriprox 
they h ave been taking  for the last 3 months  (i.e., closer to  75 mg/kg /day or closer to 100 
mg/kg/day ) and must remain on their assigned  dosage for the duration of the study.  If it is 
determined during the study that a change in dosage or the addition of another  chelator is 
required to control iron load, that patient will be withdrawn from the trial.

5.2 Method of Assignment to Treatment  
All patients must have been on a stable regimen of  Ferriprox IR  tablets for at least the 
past 3 months , and will be assigned to take  deferiprone  DR at approximately the same 
daily  dosage that they are currently on.  Those  who are presently on  Ferriprox at a dosage 
closer to 75 mg/kg/day  will be assigned to Group A , and those who are presently on  
Ferriprox at a dosage closer to  100 mg/kg/day will be assigned to Group B .  In both cases , the 
total dosage of  deferiprone DR will be as close as possible to that of Ferriprox , but divided 
b.i.d. instead of t.i.d.  
5.3 Blinding Procedures  
Not applicable.  This study is open label.  
5.4 Allocation of Patient  Numbers  
After provision of informed consent , each patient will be assigned a unique ID number , and 
will be identified in all study data by this number rather than by name.  The ID number will 
consist of  6 digits, where t he first  3 digits represent the site code (00 1 for site  #1, 002 for site 
#2, etc. ) and the next 3 digits are assigned sequentially for each individual  enrolled at that site.  
For example, if site #1 enrolls 8 patients, the ID number s will be 00 1001 to 00 1008.  The 
assigned ID numbers of patients who are screening failures or who withdraw from the study  
will not be reused . 
5.5 Treatment Compliance  
Compliance will be determined as follows: 1) the patient  will keep a daily record of  the 
number of tablets taken , and 2) at Day 28 , the investigator or a delegate will inspect the 
medication containers , whether empty, partly used, or unopened, and will check the number 
of tablets remaining.  Compliance will be calculated by  the number of tablets taken divided 
by the number o f tablets prescri bed.  Any discrepancies must be discussed with the patient 
and documented in the source documents.  Reasons for non -compliance with the treatment 
will be recorded in the source document and in  the eCRFs. The investigator should discuss 
treatment compliance with the patient at each visit  or during each telephone call . 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 35 of 58 
 If the number of returned tablets is less than it should be but  the patient reports having taken  
the correct amount of medication , the site will report compliance as 100% in the eCRF , and 
will provide the reason for the apparent over -compliance (e.g., tablets were accidentally 
spoiled and could not be ingested), along with the actual percentage . Both u nder-compliance  
< 80% and  over-compliance >120% will be reported as a protoc ol deviation , unless under -
compliance is due to treatment interruption because of infection or neutropenia or other 
extenuating circumstances  (see Section  7.1.1.8 ). 
6 STUDY TREATMENTS  
All patients  will be treated with  deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  at approximately  
the same total daily dosage that they had been prescribed for Ferriprox .  
6.1 Investigational Product  
Deferiprone delayed release (DR) 1000 mg is a white to off -white, capsule -shaped, beveled 
edge, biconvex coated tablet, engraved with “FPX” score “DR” on one side and “APO” score 
“1000” on the other side. The tablets are manufactured by Apotex Inc., and will be supplied 
to the clinical site by ApoPh arma Inc.  
6.1.1 Dosage Form and Mode of A dministration  
Deferiprone DR tablets are to be taken twice a day, approximately 12 hours apart.  The route  
of administration is oral.   All patients will take approximately the same total daily dosage 
that they were taking  three times a day with Ferriprox IR, whether that dosage was closer to 
75 mg/kg/day (Group A) or closer to 100 mg/kg/day  (Group B) . The dosage for each subject  
will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 500 mg. The tablets are scored in a way that they 
can be split into two halves that maintain the release characteristics of the whole tablets.  
6.1.2 Precautions for Use  
The tablets are to be kept in a tightly closed bo ttle in order to prote ct them from moisture . 
The bottles are to be kept  out of the sight and reach of children.  
6.2 Packaging and Labeling  
The tablets are packaged in 75 cc opaque, white, round high-density polyethylene (HDPE) 
bottles with induction seal s and child -resistant caps . The bottles contain 50 tablets and a  
desiccant  bag, and will bear a label whose content is  in accordance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements.

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 36 of 58 
 6.3 Shipping and Storage  
The study medication at each site will be kept in a secure location  (a locked room or cabinet)  
under adequate storage conditions , as per label requirements, under the control of the 
investigator   and with access to authorized individuals only . Product is to be kept at room 
temperature ( 15–30 ºC / 59–86 ºF ). The room must have a  calibrated  digital temperature -
monitoring device , and site personnel must use  a temperature log to facilitate daily recording 
of the temperature of the storage facility.  Temperature deviations must be immediately 
reported to the sponsor fo r investigation and determination of impact on the study medication.  
Each shipment of investigational product will include shipment documents, which the 
investigator or a designate must complete as per the provided instructions and retain the 
original copies in the Investigator Trial File . 
6.4 Product Accountability  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all study drug received at the study 
center is inventoried and accounted for throughout the study. Records of receipt, storage and 
administration of the study drug supplied must be maintained , and drug accountability will be 
performed . At the conclusion of the study, a final inventory must be performed by the 
investigator or delegate. The sponsor will be responsib le for determining  the specific 
conditions for destruction of unused product . 
6.5 Replacement Doses  
Patients who report  that their medication has been lost or damaged  will need to return to  the 
study site to receive replacement tablets . Requests for replacemen t must be made in writing 
to the sponsor by the qualified staff member .  All information related to the lost  or damaged  
medication and the replacement medication is to be recorded in the drug accountability forms  
and patient source data . 
6.6 Disposition of Unu sed Product  
All investigational product (IP) that is unused for any other reasons will be returned to the 
sponsor  or discarded by the site  according to internal procedures , if approved, in writing, by 
the sponsor.   Destruction certificates for the completed destructions (or proof that IP was sent 
for destruction) will be obtained .  The destruction may take place only after written approval 
by the sponsor.

 7 MEASUREMENTS AND EVA LUATIONS  
7.1 Safety Measurements  
7.1.1 Medical Events , Adverse Events,  and Serious Ad verse Events  
7.1.1.1  Definition of Medical  Events  and Adverse Events  
Medical Event  (ME) : Any new untoward medical occurrence  or worsening of a  pre-existing 
condition  in a clinical trial participant  that occurs after signing the informed consent form 
(ICF) but befo re receiving the first dose of  study drug . 
Adverse Event  (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who is administered a 
pharmaceutical or other therapeutic product  in a clinical study , not necessarily having a 
causal relationship with the product . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign, symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not 
considered related to that product.  
AEs include:  
• Exacerbation of a pre -existing illness , including  acute episo des/crisis of a chronic 
underlying condition  
• An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre -existing episodic event or condition  
• A condition detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration, even though it 
may have been present prior to the start  of the study  
• A continuous persistent disease or symptom present at baseline that worsens following 
the start of the study  
• Accidents (e.g., involving a motor vehicle)  
• Reasons for changes in concomitant medication ( type of drug and/or dose)  
• Medical, nursing , or pharmacy consultation  
• Admission to hospital and surgical operations  
• Abnormal ities in  laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis), 
ECG , or other assessments (e.g. , vital signs) that are not part of a larger medical 
condition already recorded as an AE and which are judged by the investigator to be 
clinically significant. The investigator should exercise medical and scientific judgment in 
deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other abnormal assessment is 
clinically significant.

 AEs do not include:  
• A pre -existing disease or condition present or detected at the start of the study that does 
not worsen  
• Hospital admissions or s urgical procedures that had been planned prior to enrolment into 
the study  
• The disease o r disorder being studied, or a sign or symptom associated with that disease 
or disorder, unless it has worsened  
• An overdose of either the study treatment or concurrent medication without any signs or 
symptoms  
7.1.1.2  Monitoring and Documenting of Medical Event s and Adverse  Events  
Prior to enrolling a patient , study site personnel will note the occurrence and nature of any 
medical condition(s) in the source documents and the a ppropriate section of the eCRF. 
During the study, they will note any change in the conditio n(s), and the occurrence and 
nature of any MEs/ AEs.  MEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed  until the first 
dose of study drug , and AEs will be collected from the time the treatment starts  until 30 days 
after the last dose . 
AEs and SAEs that are related to the underlying medical condition for which the patient 
enrolled in the clinical trial will be recorded separately  from others . 
Patients will be instructed to report any MEs/ AEs to the investigator  or a delegate .  In 
addition, at site visits and telephone calls, the investigator will solicit information about the 
occurrence  of MEs/ AEs through open -ended , non-leading verbal question s such as:  
• How are you feeling?  
• Have you  had any medical problems since the last vi sit? 
• Have you taken any new medic ations , other than that provided in thi s study, since the 
last visit?  
Based on the patient’s response to these  question s, the investigator or delegate should ask 
additional questions relevant to the specific complaint, such  as: 
• How severe is/was the symptom?  
• How often did the symptom occur?  
• How long did the symptom last?  
The patient should also be questioned about any previously reported AEs that have not 
resolved.

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 39 of 58 
 The i nvestigator will evaluate a ll AEs/MEs for their relationship to the investigational 
product (Section  7.1.1.3 ), intensity (Section  7.1.1.4 ), and seriousness  (Section  7.1.1.5 ), and 
will document any measures taken to address the event .  There should be an  attempt to 
establish a diagnosis of the AE based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. 
Wherever possible, a diagnosis should be documented , rather than t he individual signs/
symptoms. All information is to be clearly recorded in the source documents.  
If the dosage of study drug is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, the 
circumstances leading to such reduction or discontinuation  must be clearly documented . 
All AEs must be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up. The investigator is responsible for ensur ing that 
follow -up includes any supplemental i nvestigations that are  needed  to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE  as completely as possible . This may include additional laboratory 
tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals . 
7.1.1.3  Assessment of Causality  
The relationship of an AE to the study drug should be determined by the investigator after 
thorough consideration of all available facts, including associative connections (time or place),  
pharmacological explanations, previous kn owledge of the drug, presence of characteristic 
clinical or pathological phenomena, exclusion of other causes, and/or absence of alternative 
explanations. The causal relationship of an adverse event to study drug will be assessed 
according to the following  criteria (based on World Health Organization definitions):  
• Not related:  Temporal relationship to study drug administration is missing or 
implausible, or there is no evident cause.  
• Possibly related : Reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug,  but 
event could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs 
or chemicals.  
• Probably related:  Reasonable time sequence to administration of study drug, and 
unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a  clinically reasonable response on 
withdrawal (de -challenge). Re -challenge information is not required.  
• Definitely related:  Plausible time relationship to study drug administration , and cannot 
be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  The 
response to withdrawal of the drug (de -challenge) should be 
clinically plausible. The event must be definitive pharmacologically 
or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory re -challenge procedure 
if necessary.

LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 40 of 58 
 7.1.1.4  Assessment of Intensity  
Intensity  refers to the degree  of discomfort  or impairment  associated with an event . The 
intensity  of MEs/AEs  is to be reported on the  eCRF . To maximize consistency  in assessment, 
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) scale is to be used.  
7.1.1.5  Serious Adverse Event s 
An SAE is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adv erse event  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly in the offspring of a patient who received the study treatment  
• An important medical event that does not result in death, is not  life-threatening, and does 
not necessitate hospitalization but which in the investigator’s judgment may jeopardize 
the patient and may necessitate  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of those  
outcomes. Examples includ e allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or tre atment -related 
substance abuse.  
 
Clarificati ons: 
• “Life-threatening ” means that the patient was, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. This definition does not include an 
event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
during the study is not considered an AE.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs 
hospitalization, the event is considered an SAE.  
• “Inpatient” hospitalization means the patient has been formally admitted to a hospital for 
medical reasons. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation at a 
casualty or emergency room unless the event meets one of the other crit eria for being an SAE.  
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41 of 58 
 • With regard to the criteria for an important medical event , medical and scientific 
judgment should be used in deciding whether prompt reporting is appropriate in this 
situation.  
7.1.1.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Event s 
All SAEs occurring up to  30 days following completion  of or discontinuation from  the study 
must be reported to the sponsor , regardless of whether they are suspected of having a causal 
relationship with the study drug. Any SAEs for which the investigator  does suspect  a causal  
relationship must be reported to the sponsor  regardless  of the time elapsed since the last dose 
of the study drug.  
Patients will be instructed to report SAEs to the investigator within 24 hours , by telephone. 
In turn, the investigator must report all SAEs to the sponsor within 24 hours  of occurrence 
or notification by the patient, using the sponsor’s SAE form. The sponsor will provide 
contact information for reporting SAEs. An assessment of caus ality must be provided at the 
time of the initial report. In the case of an SAE that is fatal or life -threatening, the  
investigator or delegate must then complete and submit a follow -up SAE form to the sponsor 
within 5 calendar days , and must submit furthe r follow -up forms if additional relevant 
follow -up information becomes available.  
The sponsor will submit reports of SAEs  to the appropriate regulatory agencies, in line with 
local regulatory requirements and timelines.  
Investigators must report all SAEs to their IRB/IEC  as well as to the sponsor .  If any SAE 
that is considered  at least possibly related to the study medication and is unexpected  occur s at 
one site, the  sponsor will promptly inform all other sites of  this, and  all investigators must 
then report this event to their own IRBs/IECs, following the same timelines as above or 
following local IRB/IEC polic y, whichever takes precedence.  
7.1.1.7  Follow -up and Document ation of SAEs  
SAEs that occur during the study and up to  30 days after the last dose of study drug must be 
documented in the patient’s medical record and on the SAE report form. The investigator 
should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other 
clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis rather than the individual signs/symptoms 
should be documented as the SAE.  
All SAEs must be followed until resolution, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the patient is lost to follow -up. The investigat or is responsible for ensuring  that 
follow -up includes any supplemental investigations that may be indicated , in order  to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE  as completely as possible . This may include 
additional laboratory tests or investigat ions, histopathological examinations, or consultation 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42 of 58 
 with other health care professionals.  The sponsor may request that the investigator perform or 
arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations.  
If a patient dies during participa tion in the study or during a specified  follow -up period, the 
sponsor should be sent a copy of any post -mortem find ings, including histopathology.  
New or updated information is to be recorded on the originally completed SAE report form , 
with all changes si gned and dated by the investigator.  
The clinical research associate ( CRA ) will verify the original SAE report form against the 
source documents at the next monitoring visit.  
7.1.1.8  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
7.1.1.8.1  Elevated Liver Enzymes  
Due to the rate of eleva ted levels of ALT and AST seen in healthy volunteers in study 
LA60 -0118 , particular attention will be paid to these measures  in the current study  to 
determine if their rates are higher than expected in patients with systemic iron overload.  
Investigators are to review all laboratory reports promptly , and are to report any increases in 
ALT or AST that meet the criteria described in Section 3.1.1  to the sponsor within 24 hours 
of occurrence, using the sponsor’s SAE form.  
7.1.1.8.2  Neutropenia  
Individuals  taking deferiprone must be monitored for neutropenia, defined as a confir med 
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5 x 109/L. Categories of neutropenia are as follows:  
 
Mild:  A confirmed ANC < 1.5 x 109/L but ≥1.0 x 109/L  
Moderate:  A confirmed ANC < 1.0 x 109/L but ≥ 0.5 x 109/L 
Severe  / agranulocytosis:  A confirmed ANC < 0.5 x 109/L 
For a case of neutropenia to be confirmed, there must be 2 consecutive counts, a maximum 
of 3 days apart , that are both less than the specified value. If the 2  counts are not in the same 
severity category, a third count will be required to determine the severity.  If a patient has just 
a single ANC value less than  1.5 x 109/L this is to be documented in the eCRF as an AE of 
“decreased ANC”, but is not to be defined as neutropenia.   The investigator is to use judgment 
as to whether the decrease is clinically significant.  
In addition to having ANC monitored, patients  will be advised to immediately report any 
symptoms indicative of infection such as fever  (≥ 38.5°C) , sore throat, and flu-like symptoms  
at any time during treatment or during the first week following treatment. They will be 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43 of 58 
 provided with an emergency services card with contact information , and advised to carry it 
with them at all times.  
Depending of the severity of neutropenia, patients will either remain in or be withdrawn 
from the study. The management of different severities o f neutropenia  is described below.  
Mild and moderate neutropenia:  
A patient  who develop s mild neutropenia is to  continue treatment without interruption , but 
ANC is to be monitored every 2 days  until resolution .  
A patient  who develop s moderate neutropenia is to  interrupt treatment as soon as the 
neutropenia is confirmed , and ANC is to be monitored every 2 days  until resolution . 
The patient should re -initiate treatment once the event is resolved , defined as 2 consecutive 
ANC ≥ 1.5 x  109/L. If ANC is still < 1.5 x 109/L after 14 days, the investigator is to do the 
following : 
• Withdraw  patient from the study and monitor  him/her until resolution of the event  
• Advise  patient regarding protective isolatio n 
• Examine  patient the same day (if possible) , including drug h istory and physical 
examination  
• Notify ApoPharma Inc. using the SAE form  
Severe neutropeni a/agranulocytosis:  
A patient  in whom a single ANC measurement < 0.5 x  109/L is detected is to immediately 
stop treatment, without waiting for confirmation of the count,  and a second measurement is 
to be done the following day. If the second ANC is still  < 0.5 x  109/L, the patient  is to be 
permanently w ithdrawn  from the study , and ANC is to be monitored daily  until resolution . 
The following procedures should be done by the  investigator or the treating physician, as 
appropriate:  
• Provide protective isolation; if clinically indicated, admit patient to hospital and 
obtain vital signs every 4 hours  
• Examine the patient the same day, if possible, including drug history and physica l 
examination  
• Notify ApoPharma Inc. using the SAE form.  
The following additional measures describe a suggested medical management and 
monitoring:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 44 of 58 
 • If possible , consider obtain ing bone marrow aspirate for:  
o Histology  
o Progenitor culture  
o Frozen storage (1 mL sample)  
• If possible , consider obtain ing bone marr ow biopsy (minimum length 3 mm)  
• Perform septic work -up including chest X -ray, bl ood, urine , and throat cultures  
• Obtain q4h temperatures from patient (monitored by family at home if patient is not 
in the hosp ital) 
• If warranted, administer granulocyte stimulating factors, such as G -CSF 10 μg/kg, on 
an in-patient basis if possible, beginning the same day that the ANC is confirmed as 
< 0.5 x 109/L; administer daily until ANC is > 1.5 x 109/L on 2 consecutive days  
• If ANC < 0.5 x 109/L for 7 days, repeat bone marrow biopsy and aspirate weekly 
during the period o f agranulocytosis, if warranted  
7.1.1.8.3  Infections  
If a patient develops fever  (≥ 38.5°C)  or symptoms and signs  of that indicate systemic 
infection  (e.g., chills, sore throat, mouth ulcers)  during the study, deferiprone must be 
interrupted immediately , and neutrophil count should be obtained and monitored more 
frequently ; every 2 days if ANC is <1.5 x 109/L.  Therapy with deferiprone can be  
re-initiated onc e all symptoms have been resolved and it is deemed safe by the investigator.  
7.1.2 Laboratory Measurements  
Samples for l aboratory safety assessments will be taken  at the time points indicated below.   
Biochemistry:   Total protein, gamma -glutamyl 
transferase (GGT ), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
sodium, potassium, chloride, glucose, bilirubin 
(total, direct, and indirect), alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), albumin, blood urea 
nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, uric acid, alkaline

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 45 of 58 
 Hematology:  Hemoglobin, total WBC count, 
ANC, MCV, and platelet count  Screening , baseline , and Day s 7, 14, 
21, and  28 
Coagulation:    Prothrombin Time (PT), Partial 
Thromboplastin Time (PTT), and International 
Normalized Ratio (INR)  Screening and Day 2 
Serology:    HIV Ag/Ab Combo, hepatitis B 
(HBsAg (B)), and hepatitis C (anti -HCV (C))  Screening  
Urinalysis:   Color, appearance, specific gravity, 
pH, leukocyte, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, 
blood, nitrite, urobilinogen. Microscopic 
examination must be performed if dipstick test is 
outside the reference range for leukocyte, blood, 
nitrite or protein .  (Note: F or patients with sickle 
cell disease, samples are to be sent for microscopy 
if there is blood in the urine or three or more “plus 
signs” for protei n.)  Screening and Day 28  
 
Pregnancy testing:   Beta-HCG qualitative serum 
pregnancy test  Screening and Day 28  
 
Notes:  
• With the exception of hematology, laboratory results obtained at screening will be 
treated as the baseline values.  
• There will be a window of ±1 day for assessments done at Days 3 and 7, and of 
±2 days for assessments done at Days 14, 21, and 28.  
• The investigator may increase the frequency of safety evaluations if deemed 
appropriate for assessment of any clinically significant adverse event.  In the case of 
increases in liver enzymes that meet the criteria for being considered a safety concern, 
the patient is to be followed until resolution of the event, beyond Day 28 if necessary.  
• If a patient  withdraws from the study, the End of Study procedures are to be 
performed at an early  termination visit . 
 
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report by signing or initialing 
and dating it. Any laboratory values that fall outside a clinically accepted range, or values 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 46 of 58 
 that differ significantly from previous values, must be marked by the investigator as either 
“CS” (clinically significant) or “NCS” (not clinically significant).  Any that are marked as 
CS must be further explained and documented as an AE.  
7.1.3 Other Safety Meas urements  
7.1.3.1  Physical Examinations  
Physical examination will consist of an examination of head, ears, eyes, nose, throat and 
neck, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal system, musculoskeletal 
system, neurological systems (central and per ipheral), and skin, nails, hair, and scalp. A 
complete examination will be performed at  screening, and a symptom -oriented examination 
will be performed at Day 28 . Any abnormalities noted prior to the first dose of study 
medication will be recorded as eithe r medical history  or a medical event ( depending on time 
of occurrence) , while any that are noted at the end of the study  will be recorded as AEs. 
Body weight  (without shoes) will be measured at screening only.  
7.1.3.2  Vital Signs  
Resting heart rate, resting blood pressure, and body temperature will be taken.  Blood  
pressure should always be measured in the sitting position, after a minimum 3 -minute resting 
period, and using the same arm each time if possible. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures 
are to be  recorde d from one measurement.  
Vital signs will be measured at screening and Day 28 . Clinically significant out -of-range 
values for vital signs will be reported as AEs (see Section  7.1.1.1 ). 
7.1.3.3  Concomitant Medications  
The following information about prior and concomitant medications is to be recorded:  
• All medications used within the 3 months prior to baseline  
• Any medications that the patient continues to take during the study  
• Any medications that the patient starts to take during the study  
The name, dose, route, frequency, indication, and stop and start dates of all medications used 
during the study must be noted in the source documents and eCRFs, as well as whether or not 
the medication was used to treat an AE. 
Information on concurrent med ications will be obtained at every site visit  or telephone 
contact .

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 47 of 58 
 7.1.4 Procedures in Case of Pregnancy  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, she will be immediately 
withdrawn. The pregnancy will be immediately reported to the sponsor, and information 
about the pregnancy is to be recorded on the appropriate form and in the patient’s eCRF. The 
patient will be followed to determine the outcome, and any premature termination of the 
pregnancy will be reported.  Upon delivery, the child will be examined for any adverse 
symptoms or congenital anomalies. Follow -up information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the sponsor  no later than 8 weeks following the delivery.  
If the partner of a male patient becomes pregnant durin g the course of the study, or if the 
fetus may have been exposed to the patient’s study  products either through maternal 
exposure or through transmission via semen following paternal exposure, the pregnancy must 
be reported to the sponsor, and information about the pregnancy must be recorded on the 
appropriate form and in the patient’s eCRF.  If the partner provides consent for follow -up of 
the pregnancy, she will be followed until the delivery of the child, and information on the 
delivery status of the mot her and child will be forwarded to  the sponsor  no later than 8  weeks 
following the delivery date.  
Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy that the investigator believes may 
have been caused by the study product or by a protocol procedure wi ll be reported to  the 
sponsor  as described in Section  7.1.1.6 . 
7.2 Acceptability Measurements  
On Day 28, following completion of study treatment , patients will be asked what their 
preference is between the two formulations (Ferriprox IR vs. deferiprone DR) with respect to 
scheduling, ease of administration, and tolerability.   The questionnaire  is provided in 
Appendix 1.   
8 STUDY COMMITTEES  
A safety committee will be set up that is composed of representatives from ApoPharma  Inc. 
(the Vice President  of Medical Affairs, the Director of Medical Safety, and the Director of 
Clinical Research)  and the principal investigators.  Other experts may be included as needed. 
This committee  will review the available safety data at specified time points, with a 
particular emphasis on the number of patients with  ALT and/or AST levels that meet the 
criteria described in  Section 3.1.1.1 , to confirm if enrollment may continue .

 9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
SAS Windows version 9.3 or higher will be used for statistical analysis. The safety population , 
defined in Section 9.3.1 , will be the primary population for this study.  
The continuous and discrete variables for safety data will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimu m, and maximum) and frequency tables, 
respectively, at each assessment.  
9.1 Endpoints  
9.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the incidence of any post -dose occurrence of increases in ALT 
and/or ALT levels that meet one of the criteria for being considered a safety concern .  The 
safety criteria are:  
• For a patient whose baseline level is within the normal range, the criterion will be 
reaching a value of 5 times the ULN durin g the study.  
• For a patient whose baseline level is above the ULN, the criterion will be reaching a 
value of 5 times the baseline value during the study  or >10 x ULN.   
9.1.2 Secondary  Endpoint s 
Secondary endpoints are as follows:  
• The assessment of tolerability will be based on the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) 
distress reported by patients during the study . 
• The assessment of acceptability will be based on the number of patients who indicate 
that they prefer  the DR formulation over Ferriprox IR after considering their 
preference with respect to scheduling, ease of administration, and tolerability . 
9.2 Determination of Sample Size and Study Power  
This is the first study of the safety, tolerability , and acceptabili ty of deferiprone DR tablets in 
patients with systemic iron overload . No formal power calculation can be  performed . It is 
believed that t he data that will be obtained in this study will be adequate  to evaluate the 
effect of the DR formulation on liver enzy mes.

 9.3 Study Populations  
9.3.1 Safety  Population  
The primary  analysis population used in this study will be the safety population , which  will 
include all patients  who received at least one dose of deferiprone DR tablets . 
9.3.2 Per Protocol Population  
The per protocol population , which  include s all patients  who completed the study without 
major study deviations , will be the secondary population for the assessment of the primary 
endpoint . 
9.4 Data Analysis Plan  
9.4.1 Planned Analyses  
9.4.1.1  Patient Disposition and Drug Exposure  
The number of patients  who were exposed to the study medication, who completed the study, 
and who withdrew from the study will be presented , along with reasons for withdrawals . 
9.4.1.2  Patient Characteristics  
Patients  characteristics including demographic s will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics for continuous variables and with frequency tables for categorical variables. 
Medical history will be summarized using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  Prior and concomitant medica tions will be summarized using the WHO Drug 
Dictionary (WHO -DD).  
9.4.1.3  Analysis of Safety  
The Clopper -Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) of the incidence of post -dose levels of 
ALT or AST  that meet the criterion for being considered a safety concern will be ca lculated 
for each dosage group . Similarly, the Clopper -Pearson 95% CI of the incidence of GI distress 
reported by patients during the study will also be calculated. Other AEs will be summarized 
by using frequency tables. The incidence of abnormal data for safety measures will be 
presen ted for each dosage group .  
9.4.1.4  Analysis of Acceptability  
For each dosage group , frequency tables will be used to summarize the response to each 
question of the questionnaire in Appendix 1  on treatment acceptability between Ferriprox IR 
vs. deferiprone DR.  Based on the response to the question on overall preference for one 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 58 
 formulation or the other  (Question #4 ), a one-sample proportion test will be used to test if the 
overall preference of deferiprone DR is greater than 0.5 for each dosage group . 
9.4.2 Interim Analy ses 
No interim analysis is planned.  
9.5 Criteria for Evaluability of Patient Data  
All patients  who receive d at least one dose of study product  will be eligible for evaluation of 
safety . 
10 DATA MANAGEMENT CONS IDERATIONS  
10.1 Data Management  
The sponsor’s Clinical Data Management group will be responsible for the processing,  
coding , and validating/cleaning of clinical study data. Patient  data will be entered by the  
investigator or designee using the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) provided by the  
spons or. Clinical data will be entered and stored into a validated database. The eCRFs will be 
provided in the Electronic  Data Capture ( EDC) system  hosted by the sponsor. Trained users 
will access the system via a secured gateway. Users  will be only authorized to access data for 
their study site. Data will be entered directly  into the system from the source documents in 
lieu of the paper CRFs. On -line and off -line edit checks will be used to prompt the user to 
provide clean and accurate data. Clinical  Data Manag ement will code and monitor the data 
for accuracy. The data will  be coded using the current versions of the MedDRA (Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) and  WHODD (World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary) dictionaries. An electronic signature  will be required of the investigator on the 
eCRFs , and the study monitor will verify  the eCRFs on -line. 
Clinical data management activities will be performed by the sponsor in accordance with  
applicable standards and data cleaning procedures of the sponsor. An audit trail of all  data 
processing will be stored in the database. The study biostatistician will be notified  when all 
subject data are ready for analysis.  
Integrity of the database will be assured by limiting access through username/password  
combination and account control. Authorized access to the database will be provided to  those 
individuals with an inspection/auditing function (Regulatory Authorities/Quality  Assurance); 
“read only ” access will be provided to avoid unintentional corruption of the  database.  
The database will be backed up daily.

Electronic CRFs may be generated and/or printed at any time using the sponsor’s EDC 
system.  These eCRFs may be used for electr onic submission data archiving or data review. 
A copy of the final patient -specific eCRFs  will be sent to the clinical study sites after 
database freeze.  
11 MONITORING, AUDITS , AND INSPECTIONS  
11.1 Source Documents  
The investigator  or delegate will maintain adequately detailed source documents supporting 
significant source data for each patient . Source data are defined as all information in original 
records and/or certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observation s, or other 
activities in a clinical study that are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the 
study : e.g., medical history , physical examination , laboratory results , and x-ray or ultrasound 
results . The investigator  will also retain all printouts/reports of tests  or procedures performed 
as a requirement of the study.  All source data  that is printed  on thermal paper , including 
laboratory printouts and ECGs scans , must  be photocopied , initialed , and dated as authentic 
equivalents to the thermal paper documents  to enable extended retention time.  
The source documents must be available at the time of an audit;  a site visit from the sponsor , 
sponsor representatives, or IRB/IEC ; and a regulatory authorit y inspection . 
11.2 Monitor ing 
Monitoring of the investigational sites will be conducted by the sponsor or contracted to a 
qualified CRO.  The sponsor will determine the extent, nature, and frequency of on -site visits 
that are needed  to ensure  that the study is being conducted in ac cordance with the approved 
protocol (and any amendments), GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  At site 
visits , the monitor will, as required, assess the progress of the study ; check  that the study data 
chosen for verification are authentic, acc urate, and complete ; verify that t he safety and rights 
of patients are being protected ; compare original documents with data entered into the study 
database ; and i dentify any issues and address their resolution . 
The investigator agrees to allow the monitor (s) direct access to all relevant documents , and to 
allocate his/her time and the time of staff to discuss findings , corrective actions  and any 
relevant issues. In addition to contacts during the study, the monitor may also contact the site 
prior to  the start of the study to discuss the protocol and data collection procedures with site 
personnel.

 11.3 Audits and Inspections  
In accordance with the principles of ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, the study 
site may be inspected by regulatory autho rities and/or audited by ApoPharma Quality  
Assurance (QA) or their designates. The investigator  and relevant clinical support staff will 
be required to be actively involved in  audits and inspections , including staff interviews , and 
to make all necessary do cumentation and data available upon request.  
During the course of the study and/or after it has been completed, one or more investigator 
site audits may be undertaken by auditors from ApoPharma QA or delegates. The purpose of 
these audits is to determine w hether or not the study is being/has been conducted and monitored  
in compliance with recognized ICH E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, protocol and 
approved amendment requirements, applicable local SOPs , and local laws and regulations. It 
is the resp onsibility of the investigator  and site staff to promptly address , by coordinating 
with ApoPharma Clinical Research,  any deficiencies stemming out of regulatory inspections 
and ApoPharma QA or delegate audits , and to ensure that agreed -upon corrective and 
preventive actions are implemented as soon as possible.  
An inspection by any regulatory authority may occur at any time during or after completion 
of the study. If an investigator  is contacted by a regulatory authority for the purpose of 
conducting an insp ection or to discuss any compliance issues, he/she is required to contact 
ApoPharma Clinical Research immediately.  
11.4 Site Closure  
Upon completion of the study, the investigator must conduct the following activities, when 
applicable:  
• Return all study data  and equipment  to the sponsor  
• Complet e data clarifications and/or resolutions  
• Ensure that drug accountability i s completed  and that unused medication is either 
destroyed or return ed to the sponsor, as instructed  
• Review site study records for completeness  
 
The sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this study 
at any time and for any reason. If such action is taken, the sponsor will discuss this with the 
investigator (including the reasons for taking such ac tion) at that time. The sponsor will 
promptly inform all other investigators conducting the study if the study is suspended or 
terminated for safety reasons, and will also inform the regulatory authorities of the 
suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) for the action. If required by 
ApoPharma Inc.  Deferiprone delayed release 1000 mg tablets  
LA61 -0218  Clinical Study Protocol, v 1.0 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 58 
 applicable regulations, the investigator must inform the IRB/IEC  promptly and provide the 
reason for the suspension or termination.  
If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data must be returned to th e sponsor. In 
addition, the site must conduct final disposition of all unused study medication in accordance 
with the study procedures.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between  the investigator and the sponsor.  
11.5 Retention of Records  
In accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, following closure of the study, the 
investigator will maintain a copy of all site study records in a safe and secure location. The 
sponsor will i nform the investigator of the time period for retaining these records to comply 
with all applicable regulatory requirements.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
12.1 Informed Consent  
Prior to entering a patient into the study, the investigator or a designate must obtain w ritten 
informed consent from the patient  and/or where applicable the patient’s  legally authorized 
representative , according to the sponsor’s  procedures and as described in the Declaration of 
Helsinki, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and U.S. applicable Code of Federal 
Regulations Title 21, Part 50 .  The investigator  will ensure that the patient  and/or legal  
representative is given full and adequate verbal and written information about the nature, 
purpose, and possible risk s and benefit s of the study , and is given ample opportunity to ask 
questions and to discuss the study with family  members . The investigato r must make a 
conscientious effort to be fully satisfied that the patient and/or legal representative has truly 
understood that for which the consent has been given. The patient and/or the legal 
representative must be notified that he/she is free to discon tinue participation in the study at 
any time, and that such withdrawal will not affect present or future care. In the case  of a 
minor or an incapacitated adult who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing the study 
information, the investigator  must ensure that this individual’s  decision to not participate or to 
withdraw from the study will be respected even if consent is given by the legal representative.  
The sponsor will provide a  model version of the i nformed consent form to the sites as a 
separate document. Each site  may then revise this version  according to the requirements  of 
its individual IRB/IEC.  
The patient  and/or legal representative will sign and date the consent form prior to the first 
study intervention , and  will be provided with a copy of the signed and dated ICF. Should a

 protocol amendment be made, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the 
protocol. The investigator  must then ensure that the revised ICF is signed by all patients  
currentl y enrolled as well as those subsequently entered in the study.  
12.2 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the protocol is reviewed and approved by 
a properly constituted IRB or IEC  (accord ing to  ICH GCP guidelines , Section 3.2). The 
IRB/IEC  must also review and approve the site’s ICF and any other written information that 
will be provided to patient s, prior to any enrollment and the release of any advertisement s for 
patient recruitment. Prior to the start of the study , the investigator or designee must forward 
copies of the IRB/IEC  approval and the approved ICF materials  to the sponsor.  
If it is necessary to amend either the protocol or the ICF  during the study , the investigator 
will be responsible for ensuring that the IRB/IEC  reviews these amended documents , and that 
IRB/IEC  approval of the amended ICF is obtained before any additional  patients are enrolled . 
Copies of the amended ICF and of the IRB/IEC ’s appro val of it must be forwarded to the 
sponsor as soon as they are available.  
12.3 Patient  Confidentiality  
To ensure that patients’ identities remain  unknown to the sponsor , all data will be identified 
by patient ID. 
The investigator  must inform patients  of the pos sibility that representatives from regulatory 
authorities and/or the sponsor  may require access to hospital or clinic records , including 
signed ICFs that contain patients’ names and IDs , for verification of data pertinent to the 
study, including medical history.  
The investigator  is responsible for keeping a list of all patients  entered, including patient  
code, patient  ID, full name, and last known address.

For this trial, some sites will recruit subjects for the SCA arm only while other sites recruit subjects for 
the FUBV arm. Subj ects who are screened for the FUBV arm and do not quali fy, will be screened and 
offered potential enrollment in the SCA study arm, if appli cable. 
 
 
Subj ects e nrolled in the SCA arm will have one visit only: the baseline visit.  It is anticipated the visit will 
last less than an hour and include consenting, medical and radiographi c history review, a physical, vitals 
and neurological assessments. The visit information and neurological assessments will be completed via 
interview with the site coordina tor who will enter the data into the electronic case report forms. 
Subj ects e nrolled in the SCA arm will not have a standard MRI done at the baseline visit. Instead, data 
will be collected  from their latest MRI scan, from which the CASH lesion was identified. 
 
 
Subj ects e nrolled in FUBV arm will have three study visits: Baseline, Year 1 and Year 2.  It is anticipated 
that each visit will last about 2 hours. The visits will include consenting (Baseline only), medical and 
radiographi c history review, a physical, vitals and neurological assessments. The visit information and 
neurological assessments will be completed via interview either in person or via telephone with the site 
coordinator who will enter the data into the electronic case report forms.  Subjects will have a standar d

SWI/VenBold, and post-contrast scans.  The research MRI sequences are QSM and DCEQP sequences. 
No additional gadolinium is required for the addi tional research sequences. 
 
 
Subjects w ill not be compensated for their participation. A large percentage of subjects will be coming in as 
part of their clinical care and we do not anticipate special costs for subjects for these visits.  To promote 
retention and follow  up visit compliance, subjects enrolling in the FUBV arm will receive travel 
reimbursement  for each of the 3 study visits.   
 
 
Data elements to be collected include: the subject’s age, gender, race and disease-related history. We 
will also collect information about their clinical MRI scans, includin g the number of lesions seen on the 
scan, as well as, (for FUBV subjects,)  the MRI QSM and permeability values, calculated durin g post- 
process ing. This data will be shared with the DCC.  Any personal identifiers, including the subject’s 
name, date of birth, and medical record number, will be held locally, separa tely from the study file, in 
locked cabin ets in private offices per institutional guid elines.

2 INTRODUCTION 
 
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE 
 
There are fewer than 200,000 cases of brain cavernous angiomas (CA) in North America today 
who have suffered a symptomatic hemorrhag e (SH). Cavernous angiomas with symptomatic hemorrhage 
(CASH ) are most likely to re-bleed and cause further neurologic sequelae. Among these are smaller 
cohorts of CASH with different genotypes, lesion locations, or other chara cteristics portendin g variable 
disease severity or prospective risk. Surgi cal resection of CASH is associated with substantial morbidi ty 
and cost, particularly in deep and brain stem lesions, which are also more likely to bleed, and cause serious 
disabili ty. It would be desirable to develop a drug that stabilizes CASH, and prevent recurrent bleeding. 
CASH with recent bleed, where surgical resection is not undertaken, are the most likely cases to be 
followed  expectantly per current evidence based guidelines, with clinical equipoise for testing novel 
therapies to prevent re-bleeding. 
 
 
Candidate Therapeu tics Under Development. Several candida te therapeutics have emerged in 
recent years, aimed at targeting signalin g aberrations related to the loss of CCM gene function, and 
associated vascular permeability, angiogenic activity and infla mmatory response. Several drug s have 
already been shown to prevent lesion development or hemorrhag e in preclinical experiments meeting 
the most stringent NINDS criteria of rigor and  objectivity.  Novel  agents are being  pursued  by the 
phar maceutical indu stry specificall y for this disease, and are currently at various stages of development. 
Other drug s in current clinical use for other appli cations are being explored for proof of concept effect, 
with the aim of potential repurp osing. All these candida te drug s will ultimately require dose optimization 
and testing of safety and efficacy in multi-site clinical trials. 
 
 
Oppo rtunities in Clinical Research. Much progress has been made in understandin g the 
epidemiology and natural history of CAs, and several outcome assessment tools have been proposed, 
includin g an adjudi cated definition of SH durin g clinical follow-up. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging 
techniqu es have appli ed dynamic contrast enhan ced quan titative perfusion (DCEQP) and quan titative 
susceptibility mappin g (QSM) to measure vascular leak and lesional iron content in CAs, and these have 
been linked to clinical activity in longitudina l follow-up, holding promise as sensitive biomarkers of lesional 
hemorrhag e. There is a strong collaborative culture among major researchers in this disease, catalyzed by 
a very engag ed patient advocacy and support group, the Angi oma Allian ce. 
 
 
Gaps in Trial Readiness. Establish ed CA research databases have not considered CASH specificall y. 
The ability to screen and enroll cases with CASH , particularl y those whose lesion has not been resected, 
has never been assessed at multiple sites, nor the spectrum of their baseline chara cteristics, includin g 
time from SH, hemorrhagi c lesion location, disabili ty status, and demographi c features such as gender. 
Quality of life (QOL) has never been systematically evalua ted in CAs, and it is unclear what functional 
status instruments best capture the clinical impact of CASH . Biomarkers of vascular permeability and iron 
leak in CAs have never been deployed or valida ted at multiple sites using uniform protocols. These and

clinical outcomes instruments have not been harmonized, nor evalua ted for their relative sensitivity and 
reliability, yet are essential to the plannin g of needed clinical trials. Without this information, clinical trials 
could use false assumptions and likely fail. 
 
 
In response to these gaps in trial readin ess, we propose Specific Aim 1 to harmonize data entry, 
and to assess  detection rates and baseline chara cteristics of CASH cases at multiple sites with high volume 
and clinical interest in CAs. Specific Aim 2 shall deploy rigorous tests of feasibility, accuracy, precision and 
reproducibility of biomarker measurements at multiple sites, critical to their potential appli cation as 
surrogate outcomes in clinical trials. Specific Aim 3 shall assess rates of clinical events versus chang es in 
biomarkers and functional status/QOL measures during prospective follow-up. Leadin g CA research 
teams have been assembled with expertise in the questions being tackled, includin g rigorous statistical 
appr oaches, sample size estimates, and a data coordinating center with a proven record in trial plannin g 
and execution. An Executive Committee with broad expertise will advise and make suggestions regardin g 
trial design, data capture and collection as a collaborative effort with NINDS. They will offer suggestions 
prior to and durin g the progress of each aim, propose revisions, help us interpret emerging results, and 
ultimately appr ove and prioritize workable trial models. There is no DSMB for this non-interventional 
trial. 
 
 
Specific milestones are proposed and go/no-go decisions based on interim anal yses and results of 
these aims. Data from this project will insure the most stringent rigor in trial assumptions, includin g 
valida ted detection rates and baseline features specific to CASH . We will endorse or reject outcome 
instruments or biomarkers based on empiric observations, hypothesizing a clinically meaningfu l impact of 
putative therapies. And we will determine the sample size, cogent stratification for relevant subgr oups, 
length of follow-up, and the number of sites needed to test trial hypotheses. Corollary goals are to ready 
pilot sites with expertise in these facets of disease evaluation and follow-up, to be deployed and emulated 
in prospective clinical trials. Other goals are to complete preparatory and regulatory milestones needed 
before laun ching actual trials, and to assemble research core teams who would oversee and manag e 
prospective trials. Such a comprehensive project has never been undertaken in this disease. The timing 
cannot be more opportune, with therapeutic targets identified, unmatched collaboration among 
stakeholders, and several drugs ready to benefit from the proposed trial readin ess. 
 
 
 
 
2.2 BACKGROU ND 
 
Cavernous Angioma: A Common Lesion, an Uncommon Disease. Cavernous angioma (CA) of the 
brain is also referred to in the literature as cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), hemangioma or 
cavernoma. The lesion consists of clustered, giant, blood-filled capillar y spaces (“caverns”), lined by 
endothelium, and separa ted by an amorphous matrix lacking mature vessel wall angioarchitecture1. CA 
occurs in a sporadic form, manifesting a solitary lesion or a cluster of lesions associated with a venous 
developmental anomaly2. The disease is familial in 20-30% of cases, associated with multiple lesions that 
develop over time throughout the patient’s   brain3. The familial form (OMIM #116860; 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0  5 Apr 2017  1

Protocol Version 1.4

http://omim.org/entry/116860) exhibits a Mendelian autosomal dominan t inheritance due to a 
heterozygous loss-of-function mutation in one of 3 genes (CCM1/KRIT1, CCM2/Malcav ernin, and 
CCM3/PDCD10)4-10. Multiple cavernomas may also develop after crania l irradia tion. Magnetic resonance 
imaging (MR I) is the hallmark diagn ostic modality for these lesions, includin g sequences revealing chronic 
and acute hemorrhag e, and tiny occult lesions. CAs are histologically identical in familial and sporadic 
cases, and harbor somatic mutations in the same three ge nes11-13. 
 
 
CAs are often detected incidentally, or in association with seizures or non-specific symptoms14-16. 
The natural history of such lesions is exceedingl y benign, with <0.5% annual risk of clinically significa nt 
hemorrhag e, and there is consensus about these cases not needing interventions beyond symptom 
manag ement and surveillance17. But once a lesion has manifested a symptomatic hemorrhag e (SH), its 
untreated clinical course is quite serious, with a 42% (CI 27-58) rate of recurrent bleeding or focal 
neurologic deficit within 5 years17-19. CASH is hence a singula r clinical entity, distinguishin g lesions with a 
uniqu e risk profile, impacting a patient’s life and meriting clinical intervention. The adjudi cated definition 
of CASH20 requires diagn ostic evidence of new lesional bleeding or hemorrhag ic growth, in association 
with directly attributable symptoms. 
 
 
Lesions in the brain stem and deep brain locations are more likely than other CAs to bleed21, 
rebleed18, and cause severe disabili ty19, 22. It is unclear if this greater propensity to SH simply reflects the 
clinical impact of bleeds in those locations, while lesions in less eloquent brain regions may bleed at similar 
rates but more likely without symptoms. Per current clinical practice and evidence-based guid elines, CAs 
are typically observed expectantly, and surgically excised only after significan t clinical sequelae (typically 
one or more hemorrhagi c strokes) particularl y in deep or brain stem locations17, 23. Healthcare costs of 
hemorrhagi c stroke can reach up to $27,400/case in the first 90 days (2007 dollars), excludin g 
socioeconomic impact of lost productivity24. 
 
 
While brain surgery for lesion excision may benefit some patients, it can be associated with 
significan t cost and morbidity. It is expensive, with a typical craniotomy costing $37,438 in 2011 dollars25, 
excludin g the cost of complications. More concerning are complications and morbidi ty with CA surgical 
excision, particularl y with brain stem lesions, associated with a particularl y alarming rate of surgical 
adverse events23. In a non-randomized popula tion-based cohort study, lesion excision was associated with 
significan tly worse functional outcomes and greater complications compared to conservative 
manag ement23. Stereotactic radiosurgery has been proposed but there is controversy about its 
effectiveness and concern about complications and radiation-indu ced genesis of new CAs26, 27. 
 
 
The rates of development of new lesions, and of first SH in asymptomatic CAs, are far too low to 
allow meaningfu l testing or to compel primary prevention strategies for CASH . Cases with recent SH, 
where surgical resection is not undertaken (mostly in deep and brain stem locations), are the most likely 
to be followed expectantly per current evidence based guid elines17, with clinical equip oise for testing 
novel therapies aimed at preventing re-bleeding . It would be desirable to develop a drug that stabiliz es 
CASH , and prevent recurrent bleeding . It would mitigate neurologic sequelae of re-bleeds and the 
complications of surgical resect ion in many patients. Based on current knowledge of natural history, the

likelihood of therapeutic benefit for secondary prevention (symptomatic re-bleed) would be greatest 
within 2-3 years after a SH17-19. 
 
 
 
 
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
 
This is an observational cohort study with no plann ed intervention. 
 
 
Risks to  participan ts of this study are minimal and include loss of privacy and confidentiality, and 
risks associated with MRI and intravenous gadolinium administration. To minimize risk to 
participants, follow up visits have the option of being done remotely.  Visits that require 
MRI scans, the scans will be completed during the participants standard of care visit.  
Protection again st these minimal ri sks s hall be insured by each site’s PI and the project’s ce ntral 
institutional review board (cIRB). 
 
 
Protection again st loss of privacy  and confid entiality. The main risk to study participan ts is loss of 
privacy, which is minimized through utilization of sound confidentiality procedures. All study personnel 
will undergo certification on the protection of human subjects,  currently through CITI, as well as HIPAA 
certification. All study records will be kept locally in locked files in private offices. Electronic files will be 
kept on secured drives managed at each institution, with access limited to key study personnel. All study 
data will be entered on a secure, password-protected  database manag ed by the Data Coordina ting Center 
at Johns Hopkins University. 
Reasons for exclusion for screened patients not enrolled into the trial will be recorded. Each 
participating site will enter screening data into the trial’s EDC system for review of screening and eligibili ty 
performance. Data to be collected for screen failed patients will include, age (numerical), gender, race, 
type of disease (sporadic or familial), and reason for exclusion from the study. Once all fields are 
completed, or an inclusion/exclusion criterion is failed, the system will either document the subject as a 
screen failure or prompt the coordina tor to enroll the eligibl e subject. Ineligibl e patients will be assigned 
a unique screening number with no protected health information (e.g., name, medical record number, 
date of birth, etc.) stored in the system. Following written informed consent each enrolled subject is then 
assigned a unique study number, which contains a unique site number, by the EDC for data collection 
purp oses. A list of enrolled subjects  includin g identifiable information (name, medical record number, 
contact information, etc.) mapped to uniqu e study number, along with signed consent forms, will be 
maintained in a secure location by local study personnel at the site, outside of the EDC, for local tracking 
purp oses. Data analyzed on enrolled cases in Aims 1-3 shall be conducted  without any access to any 
information about subject identity. 
Because patients being studied already carry the diagnosis of CA, we do not believe that 
participation in this study will adversely affect the patient’s ability to obtain life or medical insuran ce or 
employment. Information from this research will remain anonymous and confidential in the research 
database, and security measures w ill be in place to prevent unau thorized access  to the system and data.

requirement for the study (contrast to be used is called MultiHan ce). Patients with CASH have likely 
undergone numerous prior MRI studies as part of standar d of care diagn osis and manag ement of their 
disease. Those with gadolinium allergy, or who cannot tolerate MRI scans because of claustrophobia will 
be excluded. Patients with retained metal objects are also excluded unless the metal object can be 
positively confirmed to be MRI compatible, as per standar d clinical MRI procedures. Per institutional 
policy, every patient will be screened and excluded for pregnan cy, where safety of high field MRI and 
gadolinium contrast agents have not been establish ed. 
Gadoliniu m-based contrast agents have been used for diagn osis and treatment guidan ce in more 
than 100 million patients worldwide over the past 25 years, with a spectacular safety record, and no 
known untoward clinical effect except in rare instances and only in patients with renal insufficiency. We 
shall use current U.S. FDA guidelines to screen for and exclude patients with renal insufficiency, which 
are at risk of developing rare nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. There is currently no known clinical 
signifi cance, nor any restriction of gadoliniu m use by the U.S. FDA despite reports of potential 
accumulation of trace gadoliniu m molecule in the human brain . If evidence emerges durin g the trial of 
clinical harmful effects of gadolinium or formal U.S. FDA injunction again st its use, we would cease its use 
and obtain IRB and NINDS appr oval to modify the protocol to continue the study without gadoliniu m 
permeability biomarker. This would not impact the QSM lesional iron concentration biomarker, which 
does not require gadolinium contrast. 
 
 
There will be no direct benefits to patients for participating in this study. However, the 
information gained from this study may lead to successful clinical trials testing novel therapies in patients 
with cerebral cavernous angiomas.

3 OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
Specific Aim 1: To harmonize data entry, and assess prospective enrollment rates and baseline 
chara cteristics of CASH cases at multiple high volume sites with clinical interest in CAs. 
 
 
Specific Aim 2: To test the feasibility, accuracy, precision and reproducibility of MRI biomarker 
measurements at multiple sites, critical to their potential appli cation as predictive, diagn ostic or outcome 
measures. 
 
 
Specific Aim 3: To assess rates of symptomatic hemorrhag e and chang es in biomarkers and 
functional status/QOL  measures durin g prospective follow-up. 
 
 
Specific milestones are proposed and go/no-go decisions based on interim anal yses and results of 
these aims. Data from this project will insure the most stringent rigor in trial assumptions, includin g 
valida ted enrollment rates and baseline features specific to CASH . Results will endorse or reject outcome 
instruments or biomarkers based on empiric observations, hypothesizing a clinically meaningfu l impact of 
putative therapies.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
 
This is an observational cohort study of CASH cases with no intervention. Seven high -volume 
cavernous angioma sites have been identified for this project. We propose to activate sites and prepare 
data structure in year 1, then prospectively screen and enroll 200 CASH cases in years 2-5 at multiple sites. 
We shall collect harmonized baseline data, and enroll a subset of approximately 120 cases into the follow- 
up and imaging biomarker validation (FUBV) arm at 4 or so sites to assess and compare clinical outcomes, 
biomarker outcomes, and functional status and patient-reported quali ty of life outcomes for potential use 
in future clinical trials. 
 
 
Clini cal Coordina ting Center (CCC): 
The Clinical Coordina ting Center, located at the University of Chicago, will train site coordina tors 
on the protocol and data entry, as well as track enrollment rates. The CCC will also be responsible for 
answering site questions about enrollment and subject eligibili ty. 
 
 
Data Coordina ting Center (DCC): 
The Data Coordina ting Center, located at Johns Hopkins University, will develop and oversee the 
trial electronic data system to ensure the integrity of data collection, safety and coordina tion of data 
storage and access.  Study site staff will be trained, sites activated and pilot cases completed  in year 1 and 
data collection thereafter for years 2-5. The DCC shall performed data monitoring and generate data 
reports for analysis by Investigators as proposed in the respective Specific Aims 1-3.  T he DCC will review 
the online case forms for completeness, logic, and consistency, then verify the entered data again st the 
uploaded source records/data collection worksheets in a rand om 5% sample of cases. Routine queries 
identified in this process will be entered into the EDC system (triggering an automated notice to the site). 
The monitors will then work with the site personnel to obtain correction of all data errors and resolution 
of the correspondin g queries. 
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
 
Justification of Rare Disease. Brain CA lesion prevalence has been estimated at 0.46-0.63% of the 
popula tion based on consecutive imaging studies in the MRI era27-29. A 0.5% lesion prevalence was 
confirmed by the detection of 131 CAs among 24,535 consecutive autopsies30. In these consecutive 
imaging or autopsy studies, consistently <10% of lesions had manifested a SH. In the one prospective 
popula tion based study in the MRI era, 12% of detected CAs presented with a SH19.  Based on <10-12% 
CASH prevalence among all cavernomas and assuming 0.5% of 325 million adul ts of the U.S. popula tion 
harb or a CA, it is projected that fewer than 162,500 to 195,000 adul ts are living with a cavernoma that 
has bled at least once. Fewer numbers would harbor a CA with a more recent SH, warran ting therapeutic 
targeting. Based on an estimated prevalence of 60,000 cavernomas in the U.S. with clinical symptoms 
warran ting therapeutic intervention, Recursion Pharmaceuticals received Orphan Drug Designation in 
2010 from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (http://www.pr.com/press-release/640210).

Similarly, the European Consortium Orphan et has designated brain CA as a rare disease, Orpha 164 
(http://www.orpha.n et/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php ?lng=EN&Expert=164). 
 
Knowledge Gaps Regarding the Prevalence of CASH and Baseline Characteristics. For plannin g and 
exec uting multi-site clinical trials, it is unclear what fraction of CA patients would meet the likely trial 
eligibili ty criteria of SH within the prior year with an unresec ted lesion. That prevalence varied between 
10-25% in the three largest ongoing CA research databases at U.S. institutions, with different referral 
patterns and enrollment criteria. This might vary further at other institutions, and with systematic 
screening . Prospective prevalence of CASH in systematic screening of CAs, and enrollment rates at 
multiple sites are not known. These data are esse ntial for the proper design of clinical trials, includin g the 
number of prospective sites needed. It is further unclear how CASH cases might vary by age, sex, familial 
versus sporadic, lesion size and location, associated venous anomaly, past bleeds, and baseline disabili ty. 
These features varied or were not assessed consistently in the 3 active prospective CA research databases 
in the U.S. More importantly, the assessment of these features at multiple sites has never been 
harmonized or adjudicated. Further, it is unclear what functional status and Qua lity of Life (QoL) 
instruments best capture the clinical impact of CASH. Inclusion/exclusion criteria and stratification for 
these chara cteristics will be important in clinical trials, as they will impact natural risk, and potentially the 
effect of putative therapies. These critical knowledge gaps will be addr essed  in Specific Aim 1 of this 
proposal. 
 
 Oppo rtunities and Challenges with Novel Biomarkers Linked to Clinical Bleeding in CAs. 
Vascular leak is a funda mental feature of CAs, mediating hemorrhag e and the associated accumulation of 
non-heme iron (includin g hemosiderin). Pre-clinical studies demonstrated rescue of vascular permeability 
and decreased lesional iron deposition with ROCK inhibi tors and statins31, and B-cell depletion therapy32 
in murine CA models recapitulating the human disease. Awad’s group in Chicago implemented a novel 
MRI appli cation of assessing iron deposition in human CAs using quan titative susceptibility mappin g 
(QSM)33-36. Mean lesional QSM was shown to reflect actual iron concentrations assessed by mass 
spectroscopy in resected  human CA specimens35. Rese archers in Chicago and New Mexico optimized a 
second techniqu e, dynamic contrast enhan ced quan titative perfusion (DCEQP) measure on MRI in human 
subjects,  reflecting mechanistically postulated vascular hyper-permeability33, 34, 37-39. The Awad team used 
both QSM and DCEQP successfully in over 200 CA subjects and showed  strong inter-observer agreement 
in QSM and DCEQP measurements, stability of both measurements in clinically stable lesions, and 
reproducibility across MRI instrument platforms at the Chicago site36, 38. As predicted  by the conservation 
of mass hypothesis, CA lesions with greater permeability (Ki) had high er lesional iron content (QSM)36, and 
lesional iron content was greater in older patients and in CAs with prior SH36. More recent studies 
demonstrated a significan t increase of mean lesional QSM and DCEQP Ki in human CA lesions manifesting 
interval SH or growth durin g longitudina l follow-up, while these did not chang e in stable lesions33. There 
were tight, sensitive and specific thresholds of QSM and DCEQP increases in association with clinical 
events33. Therefore, it is postulated that the QSM and DCEQP may be used as in vivo measures of 
hemorrhagi c activity and vascular leak, respectively, and may reflect sensitive, clinically meaningfu l 
therapeutic effect in human CAs. No other biomarkers have been as linked mechanis tically to CA, nor 
associated as closely with clinical events.

However, the QSM validations and clinical correlations in CAs have been conducted at a single 
site to date, and DCEQP was appli ed to CAs at only two sites using slightly different protocols. FDA 
appr oved image acquisition sequences of QSM and DCEQP have been implemented on different MRI 
instruments from major manufa cturers, but their validation at multiple sites have not been reported, nor 
specificall y in CAs. The feasibility, accuracy, precision and reproducibility of biomarker measurements at 
multiple sites are critical to their potential appli cation as outcomes instruments in clinical trials. We 
propose a rigorous appr oach to addr ess these gaps in Specific Aim 2 of this project. 
 
Knowledge Gaps Regarding Follow- and 
Outcomes Assessment. Reducing the rate of 
recurrent SH as a clinical outcome would 
decrease the burd en of disease, since a single SH

based on recurrent SH would require at least a 1- to 2-year study and a signifi cant number of patients 
(Table). The relative mix of lesions with different re-bleed rates will greatly influence the sample size 
needed to show treatment effect based on this primary outcome. Limiting trials to brain stem lesions 
would enhan ce statistical power, but also restrict recruitment and prevent generalizabili ty of a drug ’s 
effects to other CASH cases that could benefit. Other studies suggest an equall y high rate of SH in deep 
supra -tentorial and possibly cerebellar CAs21. The rates of recurrent SH have never been assessed 
prospectively at multiple sites in CASH trial candidates. 
 
Moderate to severe disabi lity after SH has been reported in 11-22% of patients17, 40-42. A CA re- 
bleed causes signifi cantly greater disabili ty than initial SH22. The proportion of CASH cases with any 
functional disabili ty varied between 26 and 65% at U Chicago, Mayo and BVMC cohorts. Only two studies 
assessed  QOL in CAs, and both were limited to surgical patients. One study43 used Karnofsky performance 
scale, Patzold Rating and SF-36, and the second44 used only SF-36. Newer QoL scores (e.g. EQ-5D and 
PROMIS 29) have been validated and are more specific for stroke patients compared to SF-3645-53, and 
easier to obtain than the Patzold Rating54.  No study to date has reported QOL  measures or their chang es 
over time in CASH patients observed without surgery. It would be useful to assess functional outcome 
and QOL measures at baseline and document their change over time with or without a symptomatic re- 
bleed. One or more may be fit for use as a putative outcome in clinical trials of phar macotherapies, and 
may even be useful in future surgical trials. As to the QSM and DCEQP biomarkers of lesional hemorrhag e 
and permeability, even if they are successfully and reliably deployed at multiple sites, it remains unclear 
how they change during longitudinal follow-up in cases with CASH, and whether their changes are more 
sensitive than clinical events. The gaps of knowledge regardin g outcome measures in clinical trials are 
addr essed  in Specific Aim 3 of this proposal.

Urgent Need for Clinical Trial Readiness. Potential drug development for CASH is very promising, 
but also illustrates what past-NINDS Director Story Landis , PhD described as “an embarra ssment of 
riches”. As with many rare neurologic diseases, funda mental discoveries have identified cogent 
mechani stic targets for therapies, but their development into viable clinical solutions invariab ly meets 
obstacles and uncertainties in trial readin ess. In this disease, there is a huge opportunity through clinical 
equip oise to target CAs with recent SH, where surgical resection of lesion is not undertaken, with the aim 
of preventing recurrent bleeding within 2-3 years. There are uniqu e collaborations among major experts 
and stakeholders in place, yet a critical “Valley of Death” awaits drug development in the absence of 
readin ess for multi-site clinical trials. Obstacles include a lack of harmonization of screening , baseline 
cohort chara cterization, prevalence rates and screen/enroll ratios, risk stratification and the assessment 
of clinical, functional and biomarker outcomes at multiple sites. Further gaps include the unknown rate 
and se nsitivity (fitness for purp ose) of outcome parameters durin g  follow-up, needed to postulate 
treatment effects. These obstacles and gaps are readily addr essed  by the proposed clinical readin ess 
project. The timing cannot be more opportune, with therapeutic targets identified, and several drug s 
ready to benefit from a track to clinical testing in about five years. 
 
 
 
4.3 END OF STUDY DEFINI TION 
 
A participan t is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed all phases of 
the study includin g the last visit or the last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule of Activities (SoA), 
Section 1.3. 
 
 
Cases whose CASH lesion has been resected  will be considered to have reached endpoint, and will 
not be followed further during the study. The indication for surgery shall be noted, includin g any SH prior 
to CASH lesion resection. 
 
 
Cases who develop a recurrent SH durin g follow-up, and their CASH lesion has not been excised, 
will remain in the study until they complete follow- up, and will undergo all scheduled assessments. 
 
 
If an enrolled subject decides to discontinue the study, fails follow-up, or develops an exclusion 
criterion after enrollment in the study (becomes pregnant, undergoes CASH lesion excision, etc .), he/she 
will be considered an attrition after recording the causative event. Data collected prior to the attrition 
shall still be included in the study and no further patient follow-up will take place. An allowance in sample 
size calculation is made for up to 30% attrition or missing data from any cause.

Subjects  meeting these eligibility criteria are considered eligibl e for the SCA arm. 
 
Additional FUBV Arm Exclusion Criteria. To be eligibl e for Aims 2 and 3, CASH cases enrolled in Aim 1 will 
be further excluded from FUBV arm inclusion for the following reasons: 
(1) unabl e to undergo MRI with contrast and/or because of contraindi cations (e.g. pacemaker, metallic 
foreign body, pregnan cy) or other reasons (severe claustrophobia, too large or too heavy for MRI scanner). 
(2) pregnan t or breastfeeding women due to unknown harm to fetus/child from MRI.

5.4 SCREE N FAILURES  
 
Sites will enter all patients with CCM disease seen at their institution. The study database 
(VISION-EDC) will include a list of possible exclusions from which the study team will choose for all patients 
found to be not eligibl e for the trial. The most common reason for exclusion is likely to be a lack of 
ymptomatic hemorrhag e within the last year.

Participan ts are free to withdra w from participation in the study at any time upon request. 
 
7.2 LOST TO FOLLOW-UP 
 
If an enrolled subject decides to discontinue the study, fails follow-up, or develops an exclusion 
criterion after enrollment in the study (becomes pregnant, undergoes CASH lesion excision, etc .), he/she 
will be considered an attrition after recording the causative event. Data collected prior to the attrition 
shall still be included in the study. An allowance in sample size calculation is made for up to 30% attrition 
or missing data from any cause. 
 
 
The following actions must be taken if a participan t fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit: 
 
• The site will attempt to contact the participan t and reschedule the missed visit [within 2 months 
of the study window] and counsel t he participan t on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain if the participan t wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
 
• Before a participan t is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every 
effort to regain contact with the participan t (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, 
a certified letter to the participan t’s last known mailing addr ess or local equivalent methods). 
These contact attempts should be documented in the participan t’s medical record or study file. 
 
• Should the participan t continue to be unreachabl e, he or she will be considered to have 
withdra wn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.

8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURE S 
 
All eligibl e subjects will be identified by the study team at each site. Based on clinic schedules and 
current patient databases, all CCM patients with a symptomatic hemorrhag e within the last 12 months 
(of screening ) are eligibl e for the trial. Sites will screen neurology, neurosurgery, and neurointerventional 
radiology clinic schedules, MRI schedules, and attend Neurovascular rounds to help identify potential 
subjects.  Addi tionally, study sites will rely on referrals from the various services listed above, or self- 
referrals via web searches and through the Angioma Allia nce, a patient support group. Once identified, 
the study coordina tor at each site, along with the site PI, will screen the subject for basic eligibili ty. 
Screened subjects not scheduled to come in for a clinical visit within their eligibili ty window will be 
contacted by the study coordina tor or PI to explain the study and determine if the subject is interested. 
When the subject comes in, either for a standar d clinic visit or for a study visit, the study team will 
review the subject's medical history to ensure the subject meets t he inclusion criteria. The trial will be 
explain ed and informed consent obtained. After consent is obtained a physical exam (height, we ight, 
vital signs) will be completed, a baseline modified Rankin Score obtained, and EQ-5D, PROMIS 29, and NIH 
stroke scale assessments completed. The study team will also collect information about the subject's 
history, pertinent to the disease (history of seizure, resection of other lesions, etc.). All subjects at the 
FUBV sites (enrolled to the FUBV arm) will have a MRI scan includin g the additional sequences for research 
as specified in Specific Aim 2 (QSM/DCEQP). All women of childbearing age will undergo a urine or serum 
beta-HCG pregnancy test prior to MRI to confirm no pregnan cy, per local institutional guid elines. 
 
 
 Subj ects enrolled in the FUBV arm will return for 2 follow up visits: one at 12 months and the other at 
24 months. Excluding the informed consent process, all baseline procedures will be repeated. Subjects  
will have completed their participation upon completion of the baseline visit procedures (SCA arm) or 
the year 2 visit (FUBV arm). All subjects enrolled in the SCA arm will have one study visit only. 
 
 
FUBV subjects will  receive travel stipends  for each of the 3 study visits.  Those subjects traveling less than 
200 miles to the enrolling site will receive $50 per visit (baseline, Year 1, Year 2).  Those traveling more than 
200 miles to the enrolling site will receive $500 per visit (baseline, Ye ar 1, Year 2).

9 STATISTICA L CONSIDERATIONS 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0  5 Apr 2017  21  
  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND PROPOSED ANA LYSES  
 
 
Specific Aim 1. Desc riptive statistics (frequencies, min, max, mean, standa rd deviation) and 
contingency table analysis will be performed to identify any possible coding errors. Data inconsistencies 
identified will be sent back to sites for correction. We will calculate the proportion and exact 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of CASH cases among all CA cases at each SCA site and overall. Baseline 
chara cteristics will be summarized using chi-square tests for categorical variabl es and t-tests for 
continuous variabl es. EQ -5D measures are scored on the T-score metric, with a mean of 50 and standard 
deviation (SD) of 10 in a referent popula tion (mild, moderate, and severe impairment is defined as 0.5- 
1.0 SD, 1.0-2.0 SD, or 2.0+ worse than the mean, respectively). Spearman correlation coefficients w ill be 
calculated between  mRS and Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 scales, and mean scores of Euro-QoL and 
PROMIS29 will be stratified by mRS levels. This analysis will allow us to determine ceiling effects of scores 
and how well the Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 data are distributed in CASH cases. Functional and QOL  scores 
shall also be anal yzed by pre-defined subgr oups (sex,  genotype and lesion location), to inform 
stratification or the need for adap tive randomization in clinical trials. 
 
Specific Aim 2. This will follow the same design for QSM and DCEQP data acquired using these 
phan toms. A p<0.05 will be considered a failure, or significan t non-zero difference. The accuracy of QSM 
and DCEQP values will be assessed  at each of the sites participating in the FUBV arm by estimating the 
coefficient of determination r2 between  the observed and known phan tom values, with r2 ≥ 0.95 needed 
to validate accuracy of each techniqu e35. The Pearson’s correlation coefficients r of the FUBV subjects will 
also be compared using Fisher transformation. The precision of QSM and DCEQP measurements will be 
tested by comparin g two separa te measurements acquired at each site, using a paired t-test (7 
ferumoxytol concentrations acquired twice by QSM, and 7 permeability values simulated  w ith  t he 
phan tom twice by DCEQP). The reproducibility of phantom measurements will be evalua ted by comparin g 
the QSM and DCEQP simulation values acquired at New Mex ico and Mayo Rochester  again st the values 
obtained at Chicago, and one another, using a two-sample t-test. 
 
 
Specific Aim 3. Time to recurrent SH will be analyzed using Kapla n Meier method and Cox 
proportional hazard s regression approach. Rates of recurrent SH/patient/year from initial SH qualif ying 
event, and SH/patient/year from enrollment (potentially more relevant for trial modeling) will be 
estimated along with 95% CIs. Chang es in mean lesional QSM and Ki durin g 1 and 2-year epochs will be 
compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test to assess chang es within patients over time, 
includin g 95%  CIs. To test predictive, monitoring or surrogate outcome hypotheses, two sample t-test or 
Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare such chang es between patients with and without 
recurrent SH. Categorical variabl es such as proportions of patients with a drop in mRS score ≥ 1 point, 
difference in EQ-5D and PROM IS 29 scores, NIHS S scores, between patients with and without recurrent 
SH will be compared using Chi-squar e or Fisher’s exact test. Associations of baseline chara cteristics (sex, 
lesion locations, familial/sporadic) and recurrent SH as a bina ry outcome (yes/no) will be assessed  using 
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0  5 Apr 2017  22 Trial Readiness in Cavernous Angiomas with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) 
Protocol Version 1.4 
6 March   
  
univariabl e and multivariable logistic regression and reported as odds ratios and 95% CIs. Dependin g on 
the number of recurrent SH over the 2-year period, we may analyze re-bleeds as a continuous outcome 
and the associations of baseline features or biomarkers assessed using linear regression. Performance of 
final model(s) will be assessed using r2  in the case of linear regression, area under the curve (AUC) and 
Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of-fit test55  in the case of logistic regression, or concordan ce index in the 
case of Cox proportional hazard s regression. AUCs between  various models (univariabl e) will be compared 
using the method proposed by DeLong et al56. For biomarkers, we will create a binar y variabl e (yes/no) 
dependin g on whether the % chang e in mean lesional QSM or Ki durin g 1-year epochs exceed  previously 
defined respective thresholds (+ 5.8% QSM and +39.6% for Ki)33 that were significantly associated with 
new clinical events at high sensitivity and specificity in previously stable lesions. We will then assess the

and lesional QSM and Ki in relation to SH durin g the same epochs, using McNemar’s test with SH (yes/no 
binar y) as the reference standard . All tests  will be 2-sided and p-values <0.05 considered statistically 
significan t. 
 
 
 
 
9.2 SAMPL E SIZE DETER MINATION 
 
Screening  and Clinical  Assessme nt (SCA) Arm: We calculated the width of the exact 95% CI for 
detect ing CASH cases, varying the prevalence from 10% to 25% based on the range in preliminary data, 
and total sample sizes screened from 500 to 1,500. Based on these sample size models, we propose 
recruiting 200 CASH cases for the SCA arm of this project, to be enrolled durin g years 2-5, an average of 
50 cases/year at all sites, and less than one case/site/month. Assuming a 15% prevalence of CASH cases 
(the average in three ongoing registries), a screening sample size of 1,333 would be required over a 4-year 
period (333 cases to be screened/year) to detect 200 CASH cases ± 2% (i.e., 13% to 17%). Even if the true 
prevalence is lower (e.g. 10%) or high er (25%), we will have excellent precision to within ± 1.5% to 2.5%, 
respectively, correspondin g to 134 - 334 CASH cases for the same screening sample size. These CASH 
sample sizes will also allow flexibility in describin g the proportion of important subgroups (i.e. sex, lesion 
location, genotype), and provide realistic estimates of recruitment at SCA sites (screened/enrolled ratio). 
 
 
The 7 main sites are all high-volume CA clinical centers, with demonstrated ability to screen the 
requisite number of cases. Their recent clinical activity is demonstrated by the number of CA cases (n) 
seen  over a 12-month period with diagn osis ICD9 228.02 on initial or follow-up visits at each of the 
institutions: 1) University of Chicago (n=106), 2) Mayo Clini c-Rochester (n=70), 3) University of New 
Mex ico (n=80), 4) University of Utah (n=40), and 5) Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix (n=200); TOTAL 
(n=496). We would need to screen 1,333 CA cases over a 4-year period at the 5 sites (333 CAs screened 
each year), in order to identify and enroll 200 CASH cases, based on the estimated prevalence of 15% 
CASH cases among overall CA cases. This is a very realistic target, with 496 CAs actually evaluated per year 
at the 5 sites for the SCA arm.    To help meet the target enrollment, The University of California- San

Fran cisco (n=70) was added as a recruitment site in Februar y 2019 and Johns Hopkins University (n=150) 
will be added in 2020.  If we do not meet our target enrollment of CASH cases, we may add additional, 
yet to be decided on, sites.  
 
 
Follo w-up and Biomarker Valida tion (FUBV ) Sites: University of Chicago, University of New Mex ico, 
Mayo, University of California San Francisco, and Johns Hopkins  were chosen because of addi tional 
established infra structure for advanced imaging , includin g identified MRI physicists, neuroradiologists and 
site engin eers who will work with the Biomarker Imaging Core (BIC) on implementing QSM and DCEQP 
protocols. A subset of appr oximately 120 CASH cases will be enrolled at FUBV sites to perform imaging 
biomarker validation studies (Specific Aim 2) and follow-up of CASH cases annuall y for up to two years 
(Specific Aim 3) to  evalua te chang es in outcomes. T his subset of CASH cases will undergo a research MRI 
scan at baseline and at 1 and 2-year follow-up visits and undergo modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 
and EQ-5D, PROMIS 29, and NIHS S assessments. A target recruitment of 120 CASH cases over 3-4 years 
at the sites conducting the FUBV arm is amply justified, with demonstrated 256 CA cases recently evaluated 
per year at those sites, expecting to identify 38 CASH cases each year (15% prevalence). Utah and Barrow 
may also serve as alternate FUBV arm sites if needed, with large demonstrated CA clinical activity. The 
University of California San Fran cisco  and Johns Hopkins are now   part of the FUBV ar m . 
 
 
Assuming a sample size of 120 CASH cases, and allowing 30%  dropouts or missing biomarker or 
other data, we would have 84 evaluabl e patients (168 patient-years). We project 10%-20% re-bleed 
rate/year, supported by popula tion studies and meta-analyses  of CASH18, 19, with the high er estimate 
particularl y appl ying to brainstem  cases. We would hence expect 17-34 SHs. Based on this, for continuous 
outcomes we will have 80% power at an alph a level of 0.05, to detect a difference between the means of 
patients with and without re-bleeding of at least 0.63-0.77 standar d deviation. For categorical outcomes 
(i.e. presence or absence of a risk factor) we will be able to detect a difference of 32-40% between these 
two groups. This allows testing of questions regarding the rate of SH, and the prevalence of other 
outcomes in relation to SH durin g follow-up (Specific Aim 3). 
 
 
 
9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANA LYSES 
Cavernous angiomas with symptomatic hemorrhag e (CASH ) are most likely to re-bleed and cause 
further neurologic sequelae. It would be desirabl e to develop a drug that stabiliz es CASH , and prevent 
recurrent bleeding . CASH with recent bleed, where surgical resect ion is not undertaken, are the most 
likely cases to be followed expectantly per current evidence based guid elines, with clinical equip oise for 
testing novel therapies to prevent re-bleeding . They are the most likely cases to be targeted for clinical 
trials. 
 
 
Appr opriate and complete statistical modeling of data collected by the sites for both SCA/FUBV 
arms are imperative to the planning , development, and completion of a success ful Phase III interventional 
trial. The most critical component is the accurate assessment of the enrollment rates of CASH across 
several sites, as well as the between-site variabili ty in these estimates. Both within and between  sites 
variabili ty will be used to adequately power a Phase III trial, will be calculated by developing random- 
effect models along with using appr opriate link functions quan tifying the rates of CASH in these models.

As a follow-up step, in-depth data analyses  will be performed using the demographi c, imaging , 
clinical and biomarker data collected. These are appli ed to develop models assessing how predictive each 
of these factors is to the development of recurrent SH. Understandin g which factors are most predictive 
of SH will be crucial in developing a covariate adap tive rand omization scheme for the Phase III trial that 
insures proper balan ce in these prognostic factors between treatment arms. Finall y, statistical 
assessments of chang es in lesional iron content and permeability biomarkers, QOL, mRS, and NIHS S durin g 
follow-up of CASH patients will be performed. Understandin g how these measures chang e over time will 
be an important step in the process of developing hypotheses  on the effect of treatment on these as 
putative secondar y or surrogate outcomes, or as potential composite outcomes. 
 
 
 
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
 
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
Data collection. Key variabl es to be collected in this study will be decided on by all stakeholders 
in Year 1. At a minimum, these will include patient demographi cs, genotype, baseline MRI lesion features 
of the hemorrhagi c CA (size, location), time from SH, prior bleeds/dates, and diagnosis date. Functional 
status will be measured using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score57, Euro-QoL53, PROMIS2952, and NIH 
Stroke Scale. PROMIS 29 short forms are an assessment of anxiety, depression, and fatigue, and have been 
valida ted for use in several common neurological disorders. Presence of obstructive sleep apnea. Recent 
finding s suggest that sleep apnea results in decreased blood flow to the brain . This transient ischemia 
may be implicated in CA hemorrhag e. Sleep apnea questions will be included in the dataset and response 
anal yses  as described under the topic Predictors of SH. 
 
 
Data harmoniza tion. Common data elements from each site will be reviewed, upda ted, and 
harmonized using an iterative, stepwise process based on DataSHaPER (DataSchema and Harmonization 
Platform for Epidemiologic Rese arch) recommendations58-60. Questionnair es, codebooks, and protocols, 
etc. at the 3 established CA databases (Table 2) will be compiled and distributed for review. A series of 
Exec utive Committee teleconference calls will be held in Year 1 to decide on a set of ‘target’ data elements 
for potential clinical trials, as has been similarly done with the consensus process for developing clinical 
guid elines paper17. The EDHC and DCC will then develop standardiz ed electronic data entry forms and 
codebooks for data collection. Each site shall be trained in abstracting and entering data for their cases 
online. Data will be collected prospectively in Years 2-5. Anal ysis datasets will be generated quar terly by 
the DCC for quali ty control anal ysis by EDHC. 
 
 
Event  Rate: Time to recurrent SH will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier method and Cox 
proportional hazard s regression approach. Rates of recurrent SH/patient/year from initial SH qualif ying 
event, and SH/patient/year from enrollment (potentially more relevant for trial modeling) will be 
estimated along with 95% CIs.

Protocol Version 1.4 
6 March   
  
Biomarker chang es over 2 years: Chang es in mRS, EQ-5D, PROMIS 29, and NIHS S scores, mean 
lesional QSM and Ki durin g 1 and 2-year epochs will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed 
rank test to assess chang es within patients over time, includin g 95%  CIs. 
 
 
Predictors of SH: Two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare such 
chang es between patients with and without recurrent SH. Categorical variabl es such as proportions of 
patients with a drop in mRS score ≥ 1 point, between patients with and without recurrent SH will be 
compared using Chi-squar e or Fisher’s exact test.  Associations of baseline characteristics (sex, lesion 
locations, familial/sporadic) and recurrent SH as a binar y outcome (yes/no) will  be assessed  using 
univariabl e and multivariable logistic regression and reported as odds ratios and 95% CIs. Dependin g on 
the number of recurrent SH over the 2-year period, we may analyze re-bleeds as a continuous outcome 
and the associations of baseline features or biomarkers assessed using linear regression. Performance of 
final model(s) will be assessed using r2  in the case of linear regression, area under the curve (AUC) and 
Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of-fit test55  in the case of logistic regression, or concordan ce index in the 
case of Cox proportional hazard s regression. AUCs between  various models (univariabl e) will be compared 
using the method proposed by DeLong et al56. For biomarkers, we will create a binar y variabl e (yes/no) 
dependin g on whether the % chang e in mean lesional QSM or Ki durin g 1-year epochs exceed  previously 
defined respective thresholds (+ 5.8% QSM and +39.6% for Ki) that were significan tly associated with new 
clinical events at high sensitivity and specificity in previously stable lesions33. We will then assess the 
association of this newly created variabl e (“biomarker event”) with SH rate treated as both continuous 
(using two sample t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test) and binar y (using Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test) 
outcomes of interest. Finally, we shall compare the sensitivity/specificity of changes in mRS, QOL,  and 
NIHS S scores, and lesional QSM and Ki  in relation to SH durin g the same epochs, using McNemar’s test 
with SH (yes/no binar y) as the reference standa rd. All tests  will be two-sided and p-values <0.05 
considered statistically significan t. 
 
 
We will calculate the proportion and exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of CASH cases among all 
CA cases at each SCA site and overall. Baseline characteristics will be summarized using chi-squar e tests 
for categorical variabl es and t-tests  for continuous variables. Baseline Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 measures 
will be valida ted for use in CAs. Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 measures are scored on the T-score metric, with 
a mean of 50 and standar d deviation (SD) of 10 in a referent popula tion (mild, moderate, and severe 
impairment is defined as 0.5-1.0 SD, 1.0-2.0 SD, or 2.0+ worse than the mean, respectively). Spearman 
correlation coefficients will be calculated between mRS and Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 scales, and mean 
scores of Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 will be stratified by mRS levels. This analysis will allow us to determine 
ceiling effects of scores and how well the Euro-QoL and PROMIS29 data are distributed in CASH cases. 
 
 
Homogeneity of event rates, biomarker chang es, and other endpoin ts in years 1 and 2. This will be 
assesse d, as it impacts (1) sample size calculations for time averaged assessments of the impact therapies, 
and (2) whether future trials should be conducted for 1 or 2 years.

10.1.4  FUTUR E USE OF STORE D DATA 
 
Firsts in this Disease: Harmonization of Baseline Characteristics and Outcomes Assessments. We 
propose for the first time a harmonized multi-site assessment of enrollment rates of CASH , baseline 
features relevant to stratification in clinical trials, and follow-up assessments of functional outcomes and 
QOL  in relation to clinical bleeds. W ithout this information, clinical trials could use false assumptions and 
likely fail. We introduce novel biomarkers of vascular leak and hemorrhag e, with firm mechani stic 
founda tions, that have been linked to clinical disease activity. We shall test their reliability and validity at 
multiple sites, and assess their chang es over time, with and without clinical re-bleeds, hence their fitness 
as outcomes instruments in clinical trials. Such a comprehensive project has never been undertaken 
previously in this disease. The recent James Lind Allia nce priority setting partnership conducted  by 
Cavernoma Allia nce U.K. identified among the top priorities for research several aims of this trial readin ess 
proposal (http://www.jla.nihr.a c.uk/priority-settingp artnerships/cavernoma/). 
 
Scientific Rigor and Translation to Trial Modeling. Teams at UCSF and Mayo Clinic include 
investigators and statisticians, with respective experience in disease characteristics and data 
harmonization, and in prospective follow-up and natural history. The Chicago team contributes engin eers

and physicists with demonstrated expertise with the proposed biomarkers, and a statistician with the 
greatest experience in the analysis of QSM and DCEQP data. The team at Johns Hopkins contributes a solid 
record in data structure, safety and integrity, trial modeling (includin g highl y successful CLEAR and MISTIE 
trials, and recent plannin g of AT-CCM POC), and a longstandin g proven collaboration with Awad’s Chicago 
team. The senior statistician at Johns Hopkins and statisticians from the various Cores will cross-critique 
statistical plan s proposed in each of the aims, and refine them durin g year 1, addin g another level of peer- 
inpu t and diversity of opinions, and optimizing data format for future analyses. Later in the project, they 
will construct workable models for multi-site trials based on emerging results. This will insure the most 
stringent rigor in trial assumptions, includin g valida ted estimates and confidence intervals of detection 
rates and baseline features of eligibl e subjects.  They will endorse or reject outcome instruments or 
biomarkers based on empiric observations, hypothesizing a clinically meaningful impact of putative 
therapies. And they will propose the most optimal sample size, length of follow-up, and number of sites 
needed to test trial hypotheses.  Our Advisory Committee will provide guidan ce and prioritization of 
workable trials to be conducted  by indu stry or academia. 
 
 
Ultimately, the data collected in this trial will help shape future trials in this disease by informing 
enrollment possibilities, disease progression, numbers of subjects available, feasibility of enrolling at 
multiple centers, etc. The data collected durin g this study will be anal yzed to better  understand this 
popula tion and will be used to prepare gran ts for future trials, includin g drug treatment trials. 
 
 
 
10.1.5  KEY ROLES AND STUDY GOVERNANCE 
 
Scientific Cores: There are three scientific cores that include Epidemiology and Data Core (EDHC), 
Biomarker Imaging Core (BIC) and Follow-up and Clini cal Hypotheses  Core (FCHC). 
 
 
Exec utive Committee (EC): Project PI, co-chairs, Core leaders and other site PIs shall form the project’s 
Exec utive Committee. The EC shall teleconference monthly regardin g trial progress and review interim 
anal yses  yearly and at midterm in each specific aim. The NINDS Program Officer shall attend all EC 
meetings and teleconferences. 
 
 
Advisory Committee (AC): will meet with the EC each fall in conjunction with the Angi oma Allian ce 
Investigators Workshop and by teleconference each spring . A progress report shall be presented by the 
EC and the AC shall help resolve emerging problems, propose alternative appr oaches, or identify uniqu e 
opportunities. The AC will make specific suggestions about each aim, propose revisions, and ultimately 
appr ove the emerging study protocols.  In years 2-4, the AC shall review project progress, and in Years 3- 
5 emerging data (interim reports) and all go/no-go decisions. In Years 4-5, the AC shall be expand ed to 
include representative of StrokeNet and NCAS TS, agencies who might sponsor Phase III trials. The AC may 
also be called upon for ad hoc advice regardin g problems and opportunities as they arise. 
 
 
Central Institutional Review Board (cIRB): The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine will be utilized 
for this trial readin ess project.

10.1.6  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
Quali ty control. After agreement on key variabl es to be collected in this study, we will generate 
10 case summaries for training , meant to illustrate the variability in identifying CASH cases and will 
discover any uncertainties in target variabl e definitions that require clarifica tion before sites commence 
data collection. For outcome measures that are more subjective (e.g. verification of SH, mRS, lesion 
size/location), a second clinical assessor with CA experience (Awad, Flemming or Morrison) will review 
the anonymized raw data on the case and assess the parameters independently. We will calculate the 
interrater reliability for the 10 trainin g cases to determine the percent agreement (kappa ). 
 
The DCC will review the online case forms for completeness, logic, and consistency, then verify 
the entered data again st the uploaded source records/data collection worksheets in a rand om 5% sample 
of cases. Routine queries identified in this process will be entered into the EDC system (triggering an 
automated notice to the site). The monitors will then work with the site personnel to obtain correction 
of all data errors and resolution of the correspondin g queries. 
 
 
 
10.1.7  DATA HAN DLING AND RECOR D KEEPING 
 
10.1.7.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGE MENT RESPONSIBILITIES 
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site 
investigator. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibili ty, and 
timeliness of the data reported. 
 
 
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data. 
 
 
Hard copies of the study visit worksheets will be provided for use as source document worksheets for 
recording data for each participan t enrolled in the study.  Data recorded in the electronic case report 
form (eCRF) derived from source documents should be consistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents. 
 
 
Clini cal data will be entered into the Vision database, a 21  CFR Part 11-compliant data capture system 
provided by Prelude Dynamics. The data system includes password protection and internal quali ty 
checks,  such as automatic range checks, to identify data that appear inconsistent, incomplete, or 
inaccurate. Clinical data will be entered directly from the source documents. 
 
 
10.1.7.2  STUDY RECOR DS RETE NTION 
Participation in this study requires that origina l study documents be retained for a minimum of 2 
years following the end of the trial. This standar d complies w ith U.S. FDA regulations (21 cfr §312.62[c]). 
Trial Readiness in Cavernous Angiomas with Symptomatic Hemorrhage (CASH) 
Protocol Version 1.4 
6 March  
NIH-FDA Clinical Trial Protocol Template – v1.0  5 Apr 2017  32  
  
Records must not be destroyed without first contacting the study investigator to ensure that the time 
limits defined in the regulations have been met. 
 
 
For the purp oses of this section, “origina l study documents” are defined as: 
Subject records created at or available to the study center durin g the subject’s  participation in 
the trial, or any other document that supports entries in the EDC system and represents the 
origina l source of that information, includin g but not limited to appli cable sections of medical 
charts, patient correspondence, laboratory data, pharmacy logs and drug accountability forms, 
as we ll as any forms or documents used to compile or maintain origina l subject data or study 
procedura l information. 
 
 
All Esse ntial Regulatory Documents [as defined under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Regulations] 
including : all material communications with the IRB; all communications that are related to study 
subjects  or which otherwise document material study-related procedures or safety issues. All study 
documents should be uploaded to the source documents se ction of the database. The database will be 
used as the master repository for all site and Sponsor regulatory documents. 
 
 
 
10.1.8  PROTOCO L DEVIATIONS 
 
Protocol Compliance: Procedures will be implemented to maximize adherence to the protocol. 
Early review of data is made possible by real-time entry of data into a database with validations and real- 
time monitoring. Minor or administrative deviations will be reported to the JH IRB at the time of 
continuin g review. Examples of minor administrative deviations include: follow up visits and/or study 
tasks occurrin g outside the protocol required time frame because of the subject’s schedule. 
 
 
 
FDA Guidance for Electronic Data Entry Compliance: The design and development of the 
electronic database system will reflect the FDA Guidan ce for Indu stry for Computerized Systems Used in 
Clini cal Trials (April 1999) as well as the Electronic Records/Electronic Signa tures rule (21 CFR part 11). A 
secure, computer generated, time- stamped electronic record will allow reconstruction of the course of 
events relating to the creation, modifica tion, and deletion of an electronic record. Source documents will 
be retained to enable a reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. The system will ensure that all 
appli cable regulatory requirements for record keeping and record retention in clinical trials are met with 
the same degree of confidence as are provided with paper systems. Clini cal investigators will retain the 
origina l copy of all source documents uploaded onto the eCRF. Query resolution correspondence will be 
maintained and eCRF edits will be tracked by the system. Chang es to a required record will not obscure 
the origina l information. The record will clearly indicate the time a chang e was made and clearly provide 
a means to locate and read the prior information through the audi t trail. This audi t trail will be in 
complian ce with the 21 CFR 11.10(e). The record, along with supporting documentation, will also indicate 
who made the chang es and when chang es were made.

Security measures will be in place to prevent unau thorized access to the system and data. To 
ensure that individual s have the authority to proceed with data entry, the system will be designed to 
verify the electronic signature (user id and password) at the start of a user session. Each entry to an 
electronic record, includin g any chang e, will be made under the electronic signature of the individual 
making that entry. A separate electronic signature will not be required for each entry or chang e; a single 
electronic signature will cover multiple entries or changes. Individual s who maintain the electronic 
record systems as well as the audi t trail will carry the responsibilities to protect authenticity, integrity, 
and confidentiality of electronic records. Audi t trails will be availabl e at the study site or any other 
location where associated electronic study records are maintained. T he system will be designed to 
contain the prompts, lookup values, cross-field validations, flags, and on-line help to encourage 
consistent use of clinical terminology and to alert the user in case that data entered are out of 
acceptable rang e. External safeguard s will be in place to ensure that access to the computerized system 
and to the data is restricted to authorize personnel. Servers will be stored in a physically secured, 
guard ed data ce nter. 
 
10.1.9  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHA RING POLICY 
 
 
Trial readin ess upda tes shall be presented annuall y at the Angi oma Allia nce Investigators 
Workshop. Relevant results shall be presented at a major scientific meeting and submitted for publi cation 
within one year of the respective interim or final analyses,  includin g a guid elines paper on reporting 
terminology. A complete de-identified dataset containing all variabl es collected and a data dictionary will 
be submitted to NINDS for data sharin g within a timeframe to be agreed upon with NINDS Program 
Officer. We shall discuss with NINDS the appli cation of our data structure to vet and appr ove as “common 
data elements” to be appli ed in future research with this disease 
(www.comm ondataeleme nts.nind s.nih.g ov).

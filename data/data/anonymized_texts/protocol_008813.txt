 1.0     PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
This is a two arm phase  II trial to assess  the progression -free and overall  survival  as well as the 
safety  and efficacy  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  using  a  preparative  
regimen  with busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine,  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  (ATG),  and a T cell 
depleted  stem  cell transplant  from a histocompatible  related  or unrelated  donor  in patients  with 
relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  The administration  of calculated  doses  of donor  
lymphocyte  infusions  post transplantation  is designed  to decrease  the rate of relapse  or to induce  
complete  remissions  in patients  with residual  disease  following  the allogeneic  transplant.  
Candidates  for this trial will include  patients  with multiple  myeloma  with relapsed  disease  following  
autologous  stem  cell transplantation  who achieved  at least a partial  response  (PR) following  prior 
chemotherapy  (cohort  1) and patients  with high-risk cytogenetics  at diagnosis  achieving  at least a 
very good  partial  response  (VGPR)  following  prior autologous  stem  cell transplantation  (cohort  2). 
Patients  with plasma  cell leukemia  or patients  achieving  less than PR/VGPR  are not eligible  for 
this trial. Hematopoietic  stem  cell donors  for this trial will include  individuals  who are 10/10  HLA 
matched  or one antigen  or allele  mismatched  at the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1  or DQB1  locus,  as 
defined  by high resolution  methods.  Donors  who are 8/10 HLA matched  with an antigen  or allele  
mismatched  at HLA-DQB1  and at one other  locus  will also be eligible  for the trial. All patients  will 
be conditioned  for transplantation  with busulfan  (Busulfex®) (0.8 mg/Kg/dose  Q6H x 10 doses),  
melphalan  (70 mg/m2/day x 2 doses)  and fludarabine  (25mg/m2/day x 5 doses).   Doses   of 
busulfan  and melphalan  will be adjusted  according  to ideal body weight,  busulfan  will be adjusted  
according  to first dose  pharmacokinetic  studies  and doses  of fludarabine  will be adjusted  
according  to measured  creatinine  clearance.  Patients  will also receive  ATG (Thymoglobulin®) 
prior to transplant  to promote  engraftment  and to prevent  graft-versus  host disease  post 
transplantation.  The preferred  source  of stem  cells will be peripheral  blood  stem  cells (PBSC)  
mobilized  by treatment  of the donor  with G-CSF for 5-6 days.  PBSC  will be isolated,  and T-cells 
depleted  by positive  selection  of CD34+  progenitor  cells,  using  the CliniMACS  Cell Selection  
System.  The CD34+ T-cell depleted  peripheral  blood  progenitors  will then be administered  to the 
patients  after they have completed  cytoreduction.  If the use of CD34+ PBSC  is not possible,  the 
alternative  graft will consist  of bone  marrow  derived  stem  cells T-cell depleted  by CD34  selection  
of bone  marrow  using  the Milteni  CliniMACS  device.  This system  has recently  been  validated  and 
implemented  for T-cell depletion  of bone  marrow,  and will replace  the Lectin/SRBC  T-cell 
depletion  procedure.  No drug prophylaxis  against  GvHD  will be administered  post transplant.  All 
patients  will also receive  G-CSF post-transplant  to foster  engraftment.  Patients  will also receive  
donor  lymphocyte  infusions  following  transplantation  derived  from the same  hematopoietic  stem  
cell donor.  Donor  lymphocytes  will be administered  prophylactically  at calculated  doses  of 5x105 
CD3+  cells/kg  4-6 months  and a second  dose  5x105  CD3+ cells/kg  3-4 months  post initial  infusion  
to recipients  from HLA-matched  donors.  The second  infusion  will be administered  in the absence  
of graft-versus -host disease.  A third infusion  of 1x106 CD3+ cells/kg  can be administered  2-4 
months  following  the second  infusion,  if the patient  did not achieve  a complete  remission  and 
lacks  signs  of graft-versus -host disease.  Recipients  of HLA-mismatched  allografts  will be infused  
with donor  lymphocytes  preemptively  at disease  relapse  or progression  of disease,  if no complete  
remission  was obtained  following  the transplant.  These  patients  will then receive  1x105 CD3+ 
cells/kg  at diagnosis  of relapse  or progression,  but no sooner  than 4-6  months   post 
transplantation.  A second  infusion  of 5x105 CD3+ cells/kg  will be administered   1-3  months  
following  the first infusion  provided  the patient  lacks  signs  of graft-versus -host disease.  A third

infusion  of 1x106 CD3+ cells/kg  can be administered  3-4 months  following  the second  infusion,  if 
the patient  did not achieve  a complete  remission  and lacks  signs  of graft-versus -host disease.  
Recipients  of HLA-matched  allografts  will be treated  preemptively  at diagnosis  of relapse  or 
progression  and according  to the treatment  plan described  for those  recipients  of HLA- 
mismatched  allografts.  Patients  will be monitored  post transplant  for donor  engraftment,  
chimerism,  incidence  and severity  of acute  and chronic  GvHD,  regimen -related  toxicity,  
characteristics  of hematopoietic  and immune  reconstitution;  transplant  related  and  relapsed  
related  mortality,  overall  and disease -free survival.  
A maximum  of 30 patients  per cohort  will be accrued  to the study  and the accrual  period  is 
expected  to last 3 years  with an additional  24 months  of follow  up after the accrual  has been  
completed.  The primary  endpoint  of the study  is to assess  one-year progression  free survival  from 
the time of transplant.  An event  is defined  as a disease  progression  or death.  For the relapsed  
multiple  myeloma  cohort,  a single  stage  design  that differentiates  between  one-year PFS rates  of 
0.30 and 0.54 will be used  to assess  treatment  efficacy.  For the high-risk multiple  myeloma  
cohort,  a single  stage  design  that differentiates  between  one-year PFS rates  of 0.45 and 0.69 will 
be used  to assess  treatment  efficacy.  
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
To study  in a prospective  phase  II trial the progression -free survival,  efficacy  and safety  of a 
chemotherapy -based  cytoreduction  using  busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine,  and ATG with T-cell 
depleted  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplants  from histocompatible  related  and unrelated  donors,  
in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  This trial also incorporates  prophylactic  or 
preemptive  post transplantation  administrations  of calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocyte  infusions  
derived  from the same  hematopoietic  stem  cell donor.  
 
Primary  objectives  of this trial are: 
 
1.   To determine  the rates  of progression -free (PFS)  and of overall  survival  (OS)  at 12 
months  post transplant.  
 
Secondary  objectives  of this study  are: 
 
1. To  assess   the  transplant -related   morbidity   and  mortality   for  patients   with  multiple  
myeloma.  
2. To assess  the incidence  of and severity  of acute  and chronic  GvHD.  
3. To compute  the current  multiple  myeloma  free survival  curve  in order  to account  for 
patients  who relapse  and are restored  to remission  through  DLI. 
4.  To explore  the associations  between  progression  free survival  and the CT antigens  - 
CT7, CT10, MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1. 
 
3.0     BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
3.1. Advanced  Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Multiple  Myeloma  (MM)  is a malignant  disease  of plasma  cells that accumulate  in bone  marrow,  
leading  to bone  destruction  and bone  marrow  failure  1-2. The disease  accounts  for approximately  
10% of all hematologic  malignancies,  with an estimated  20,000  new MM diagnoses  in 2007,  and 
about  11,000  projected  to die of the disease  this year.  The median  survival  of patients  with high-

risk myeloma  is <2–3 years  compared  with a median  survival  of 6–7 years  for patients  with 
standard -risk MM.2 Several  independent  prognostic  factors  have been  developed  to stratify  
standard -risk and high-risk myeloma  patients  in order  to estimate  median  survival  and justify  
treatment  approaches.  High-risk prognostic  factors  can be determined  by molecular  classifications  
such  as deletion  13, deletion  17p, and immunoglobulin -heavy  chain  translocations  t (4; 14) or t (14; 
16). Despite  the introduction  of promising  novel  agents  including  thalidomide,  bortezomib,  and 
lenalidomide,  patients  with high-risk myeloma  continue  to do poorly,  even with tandem  autologous  
bone  marrow  transplantation.2-3 Multiple  previous  studies  have demonstrated  a median  
progression -free survival  of only 7-8 months  in patients  with high-risk cytogenetics  after high-dose  
therapy  and autologous  stem  cell transplantation.4-6 This translates  into progression -free survival  of 
35% at one year of this patient  cohort.  
 
3.2. Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Conventional  treatments  with chemotherapy  and radiation  therapy  for patients  with 
multiple  myeloma  (MM)  are non-curative  but improve  quality  of life and duration  of survival.  High- 
dose  chemotherapy  with autologous   transplantation   is  safe and has  low TRM  (< 5%),  but  is 
associated  with a continuing  and nearly  universal  risk of disease  progression  and relapse.  Even  
so, autologous  transplantation  is superior  to continued  conventional  chemotherapy.7 Although  
recent  data indicate  that tandem  autologous  transplants  are superior  to a single  procedure,8 even 
with this approach,  patients  remain  at risk of relapse  and additional  approaches  are needed.  
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is currently  the only curative  
treatment  available  for patients  with multiple  myeloma.  However,  at this time,  allogeneic  
hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantations  are not standard  of care for multiple  myeloma  patients  as 
the success  rate in these  patients  has been  compromised  by a high incidence  of transplant - 
related  mortality  and high incidence  of acute  and/or  chronic  graft-versus - host disease  (GvHD).9-10 
This protocol  uses T-cell depleted  allogeneic  stem  cell infusions  to reduce  the risk of transplant - 
related  mortality  and graft versus  host disease.  
 
3.2.1.  Autologous  Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Barlogie  et al11- 13 demonstrated  that the toxicity  of high-dose  melphalan  could  be 
decreased  by autologous  stem  cell transplantation  and that the use of peripheral  blood  
hematopoietic  stem  cells led to wider  application  of high-dose  therapy  using  autologous  stem  cell 
support.  With autologous  hematopoietic  stem  cell support  following  high-dose  melphalan,   the 
toxic death  rate was less than 3% in most  studies14-15. At a dose  of 200 mg/m2, high response  
rates  in both untreated  and previously  treated  patients  are reported.16-21 In addition,  recent  data 
indicate  melphalan  200 mg/m2 is less toxic but equally  effective  as  melphalan   with  TBI.22- 23 
Barlogie  et al also demonstrated  the feasibility  of tandem  autologous  PBSC  transplants  using  
melphalan  200 mg/m2 for the first transplant  and melphalan  200 mg/m2 (79 patients)  or melphalan  
140 mg/m2 plus TBI (1,125  cGy) (10 patients)  for the second  transplant.  Of 123 patients,  87% 
completed  one autologous  transplant  and 76% completed  a tandem  second  autologous  
transplantation  by 7.5 and 13 months,  respectively,  with a median  interval  between  autologous  
transplantations  of 4.5 months.  The group  reported  40% CR to tandem  transplants  and a median  
event -free survival  of 49 months,  based  on intent  to treat analysis  in this single  center  experience.  
For responding  patients,  high-dose  therapy  followed  by autologous  PBSC  rescue  has  been  
shown  to be superior   to continued  treatment  with conventional   chemotherapy,  leading   to  the

widespread  use of autologous  transplantation  for myeloma  patients  up to and beyond  the age of 
70.24-25 In the IFM study,  the progression  free and overall  survival  curves  separated  after 3 years  
with improved  disease  free and overall  survival  at 6 years  post-transplantation  for the group  that 
received  tandem  autologous  transplants  compared  to those  receiving  single  transplants.   Overall  
the median  event  free survival  was 31 versus  37 months,  6-year event  free survival  was 19% 
versus  28% and 6-year overall  survival  26% versus  46% for single  versus  tandem  transplants,  
respectively.  While  TRM  rates  observed  in these  studies  are low, patients  continued  to remain  at 
risk for disease  relapse  and progression,  with only a minority  of patients  remaining  disease  free at 
six years.  Importantly,  when  Rajkumar  et al assessed  progression -free and overall  survival  based  
on risk category  of standard  versus  high-risk patients,  progression -free and overall  survival  were  
only 8 months  and 14 months,  respectively,  in patients  with high-risk disease  who did not achieve  
a CR following  high-dose  Melphalan  and autologous  stem  cell transplantation.  Patients  in the 
high-risk category  achieving  a CR following  ASCT  had a progression -free and overall  survival  of 
only 12 months  and 23 months,  respectively.2, 7 
 
3.2.2.  Allogeneic  Hematopoietic  Stem  cell Transplantation  for Multiple  Myeloma  
 
Allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  (HSCT)  is currently  the only curative  treatment  
available  for patients  with multiple  myeloma.  Despite  the potential  advantages  of graft-versus - 
tumor  immune  responses  and a tumor  free source  of stem  cells,  conventional  high-dose  
conditioning  with allogeneic  bone  marrow  or PBSC  transplantation,  the success  rate in these  
patients  has been  compromised  by a high incidence  of transplant -related  mortality  and high 
incidence    of   acute    and/or    chronic    graft-versus -   host   disease    (GvHD)    and   associated  
complications  with transplant -related  mortalities  (TRM)  exceeding  40%.9-10   The TRM  associated  
with allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  for MM exceeds  that reported  after 
allotransplantation  for hematologic  malignancies  such  as acute  and chronic  myeloid  leukemias  for 
unclear  reasons.  It possibly  reflects  the high incidence  of co morbid  disease,  especially  renal  
failure.  The largest  group  of myeloma  patients  treated   with  allogeneic   bone   marrow  
transplantation,  reported  by Gahrton  et al, 9-10 included  162 patients  treated  in  35  different  
European  centers  from 1983  to 1993.  Early  toxicity  was high with an approximate  40% mortality  
within  the first six months.  Bensinger  et al7 reported  on 80 patients  treated  between  1987  and 
1994.  Seventy -one percent  of these  patients  were  considered  to have  refractory  disease  at the 
time of transplant.  TRM was high, with 42% deaths  within  the first 100 days and a few additional  
treatment -related  deaths  later.  When  used,  it is generally  limited  to younger  patients,  in contrast  
to the advanced  age profile  of MM patients  at diagnosis.  In the experience  at Fred Hutchinson  
Cancer  Research  Center  (FHCRC),  Day 100 TRM  after conventional  allografting  exceeded  50% 
in patients  ≥ 50 years  of age. The inability  of myeloma  patients  to tolerate  allografting  remains  
largely  unknown,  but may relate  to an inability  of generally  elderly   and  immune   suppressed  
patients  to tolerate  the combined  effects  of high-dose  therapy  and allografting  in a single  
procedure.  In contrast,  a Phase  II study  using  a two-step approach  where  high-dose  melphalan  
and autologous  stem  cell transplantation  was followed  by a non-myeloablative  alloge neic 
transplant  showed  that donor  engraftment  can be established  with a conditioning  regiment  of low 
dose  total body  irradiation  (TBI)  (200 cGy),  cyclosporine  (CSA)  and mycophenolate  mofetil  (MMF)  
combined  with peripheral  blood  stem  cell (PBSC)  allografting.  This study  demonstrated  that 
allografting  can be safely  and effectively  performed  if the high-dose  regimen  is administered  
separate   from  the  allografting   procedure.     In  this  study,   approximately   60%  of  the  patients

achieved  complete  remission  (CR)  with an overall -survival  of approximately  85% at one year.  26 
One of the objectives  of the study  to reduce  TRM  at three  months  to < 20%,  was achieved,  as 
only 13% of patients  experienced  treatment -related  mortality.26-27 Overall,  the introduction  of non- 
myeloablative  for conditioning  therapies  in the treatment  of myeloma  has demonstrated  reduced  
toxicity  and transplant -related  mortality.13-1 6, 20 However,  results  from transplants  with non- 
myeloablative  regimens  were  poor if the patient  had failed  prior autologous bone  marrow  
transplantations  or had developed  chemotherapy -resistant  disease.17, 20 
To extend  the potential  benefits  of allogeneic   transplants  to the full range  of patients  
developing  disorders  for which  a transplant  is indicated,  particularly  older  patients  (> 50 years  of 
age),  who constitute  the majority  of patients  with MM, as well as patients  lacking  HLA-matched  
sibling  donors,  major  emphasis  has been  focused  on the development  of approaches  which  could  
circumvent  severe  acute  and chronic  GvHD  so as to reduce  its morbidity  and mortality  in both 
HLA-matched  and HLA-non-identical  transplant  recipients.  While  no combination  of 
immunosuppressive  drugs  administered  to recipients  of HLA-matched  related  or unrelated  
unmodified  hematopoietic  stem  cells grafts  has prevented  the development  of acute  and chronic  
GvHD,  this serious  transplant  related  complication  can be prevented  by the depletion  of T 
lymphocytes  from the allograft  prior to administration  in HLA matched  related  and unrelated  
recipients  as well as in HLA-disparate  recipients.28-35 In our own series,  among  232 consecutive  
adult leukemic  patients  (median  age 41) engrafted  with marrow  transplants  from HLA-matched  
siblings  depleted  of T-cells by soy bean  agglutinin  and E rosette  depletion,  the incidence  of grade  
II-III GvHD  was 3% and the incidence  of chronic  graft vs. host disease  was 5%.36     Similarly,  in 
over 100 unrelated  marrow  grafts  transplanted  using  this T-cell depletion  technique,  the incidence  
of grade  II-IV GvHD  and of chronic  GvHD  has been  8%.37
 
 
Initially,  the central  limitation  to the effectiveness  of T-cell depleted  marrow  transplants  
was a high risk for graft rejections   or late graft failures.  Studies  conducted  at our institution  
demonstrated  that such  graft failures  are principally  caused  by residual  host T-lymphocytes  which  
regenerate  early  after transplant  and are able to reject  donor  hematopoietic  cells through  their 
cytotoxic  interactions  with major  class  I or class  II HLA alloantigens  in recipients  of HLA-disparate  
transplants,  or minor  alloantigens  presented  by HLA class  I determinants  in recipients  of HLA- 
matched  grafts.38-39 Based  on these  findings,  our group  conducted  a sequence  of trials combining  
myeloablative  doses  of either  total body irradiation,  thiotepa  and fludarabine  or busulfan,  
melphalan  and fludarabine  with antithymocyte  globulin  (ATG)  which  reduced  the incidence  of graft 
failures  following  HLA-matched  T cell depleted  transplants  to less than 2% and the incidence  of 
graft failure  following  unrelated  and 1-2 allele  disparate  marrow  grafts  to less than 8%.36-37, 40 
These  rates  of graft failure  are comparable  to those  observed  following  unmodified  transplants  
from such donors.41 Additionally,  Aversa  et al42- 44 demonstrated  that when  G-CSF mobilized  
peripheral  blood  stem  cells are utilized  as the source  of hematopoietic  stem cells for  T-cell 
depleted  graft,  the doses  of stem  cells provided  are 5-10 fold higher  than those  that can be 
achieved  in a marrow  transplant  and allow  a  durable   engraftment   and  hematopoietic  
reconstitution  even in HLA-haplotype  disparate  leukemic  recipients.42 Based   upon   this 
observation,  G-CSF mobilized  peripheral  blood  stem  cells are currently  the preferred  source  of 
hematopoietic  cells for T cell depleted  transplants.

Initial  proof  of donor  lymphocytes  derived  from the same hematopoietic  stem  cell donor  to exert  a 
graft-versus -leukemia  effect  resulted  from the pioneering  findings  of Kolb et al45 and was later 
confirmed  by several  centers.46-50 Patients  who developed  relapses  of chronic  myelogenous  
leukemia  (CML)  following  an allogeneic  marrow  transplant  were  induced  into durable  molecular  
remissions  by high doses  of peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells derived  from the original  HLA- 
matched  transplant.  These  studies  provided  the first evidence  that enhanced  resistance  to 
leukemia,  accrued  through  a marrow  allograft  by comparisons  of relapse  rates  following  
syngeneic  vs HLA-matched  allogeneic  transplants,  was indeed  mediated  by cells in the donor  
graft.46 
 
Several  observations  suggest  the existence  of graft-versus -myeloma  immune  activity  following  
allogeneic  transplantation.  Bjorkstrand  demonstrated  indirect  evidence  in a case-matched  
analysis  of 189 myeloma  patients  treated  with either  autologous  transplant  or allogeneic  
transplantation.  He found  a significantly  higher  rate of relapse  from CR or disease  progression  
from PR in the autologous  transplant  group  compared  to patients  who underwent  allogeneic  
transplantation.51 In addition,  the quality  of remission  appeared  greater  following  allogeneic  
transplantation  as molecular  remissions  were  rarely  (7%) achieved  after autografting  (n=15)  
compared  to a 50% molecular  remission  rate seen  after allografting  (n=14).52 These  data suggest  
that the chemoresistance  of myeloma  cells might  be overcome  by immune  antitumor  effects  of the 
allograft.  The existence  of a graft-versus -myeloma  effect  has been  more  directly  confirmed  by 
results  of donor  lymphocyte  infusion  (DLI)  in patients  who relapse  after failure  of conventional  
allografts.53-55 Salama  reported  results  on 25 patients  who received  DLI (median  dose  1x108 
mononuclear  cells/kg)  for MM relapsing  after an allograft.  Some  patients  received  chemotherapy  
prior to the DLI and some  received  multiple  escalating  doses  of DLI. Overall,  7 of 15 achieved  a 
CR and 3, a partial  response  (PR).  Lokhorst53 reported  on 27 patients  receiving  DLI following  
partially  T-cell  depleted   allo  transplants.     The  DLI were   given   a  median   of  30  months  post- 
transplant.  Overall,  14 of 27 patients  responded  with 5 CRs.  Responding  patients  received  at 
least 1x108 mononuclear   cells/kg.  All responding  patients  developed  graft-versus -host disease  
following  administration  of the relatively  high doses  of donor  T lymphocytes.  
 
Alyea  et al. combined  a CD6 T-cell-depleted  allogeneic  BM  with prophylactic  
administration  of CD4+ DLI 6 to 9 months  after BMT in an effort  to reduce  TRM  and to induce  a 
GVM  response  after BMT.  Twenty -four patients  with matched  sibling  donors  and chemotherapy - 
sensitive  disease  underwent  BMT following  a TBI, Cytoxan  or Cytoxan,  Busulfan  conditioning  
regimen.  CD6 T-cell depletion  of donor  bone  marrow  was the sole method  of graft-versus -host 
disease  (GvHD)  prophylaxis.  GvHD  after BMT was minimal,  1 (4%) grade  III and 4 (17%)  grade  II 
GvHD.  Fourteen  patients  received  DLI (1-3x107/kg CD4+ cells),  3 in complete  response  and 11 
with persistent  disease  after BMT. Significant  GVM  responses  were  noted  after DLI in 10 patients  
with persistent  disease,  resulting  in 6 complete  responses  and 4 partial  responses.  After DLI, 50% 
of patients  developed  acute  (> or = II) or extensive  chronic  GvHD.  Two-year estimated  overall  
survival  and current  progression -free survival  (PFS)  for all 24 patients  is 55% and 42%,  
respectively.  The 14 patients  receiving  DLI had an improved  2-year current  PFS (65%)  when  
compared  with a historical  cohort  of MM patients  who underwent  CD6-depleted  BMT survived  6 
months  with no GvHD  and did not receive  DLI (41%)  (P =.13).  Although  this study  suggested  that 
prophylactic  DLI induced  significant  GVM  responses  after allogeneic  BMT,  only 58% of patients

were  able to receive  DLI despite  T-cell depleted  BMT due to transplantation  associated  toxicities.  
The authors  of this study  therefore  suggested  that less toxic transplantation  strategies  are needed  
to allow  a higher  proportion  of patients  to receive  DLI and the benefit  from the GVM  effect  after 
transplantation.56 
 
3.3. Rationale  for Study  
 
This study  aims  at improving  progression -free survival  while  reducing  the transplantation -related  
complications  in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  To achieve  these  goals,  we 
propose  to perform  T-cell depleted  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  from related  
or unrelated  matched  or one HLA-antigen/allele  mismatched  donors  with chemotherapy  only 
conditioning  and prophylactic/preemptive  administrations  of calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocyte  
infusions,  derived  from the same  hematopoietic  stem cell donor.  Our initial  experience  with T-cell 
depleted  transplants  has been  in patients  with myelodysplastic  syndrome  and acute  leukemia.  
Our results  summarized  below  showed  that patients  with advanced  MDS  have better  transplant  
outcomes  if they are transplanted  in remission  after chemotherapy.  Because  MDS  patients  are 
mostly  older  patients  (>age  40), as are patients  with multiple  myeloma,  and some of them  are not 
eligible  to receive  total body irradiation,  our institution  developed  a chemotherapy  only preparative  
regimen  including  busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  for these  patients  
who could  also benefit  from T-cell depleted  SCT from HLA matched  or HLA disparate  related  and 
unrelated  donors.  The results  of our experience  of T-cell depleted  SCT in patients  with advanced  
MDS  with the chemotherapy  only preparative  regimen  are summarized  in the next paragraph.  
 
A phase  II trial with a chemotherapy  only conditioning  was performed  from August  2001  – 
June 2007  (Boulad  et al ASH 2007).  This trial demonstrated  that the use of busulfan,  melphalan  
and fludarabine  followed  by T-cell depleted  transplants  from matched  related,   mismatched  
related,  matched  unrelated  or mismatched  unrelated  donors  in patients  with advanced  MDS  is 
safe and has a significant  efficacy  as demonstrated  by the improved  DFS.  This trial included  63 
patients;  7 children  and 56 adults.  The median  age was 55.4 years  with a range  of 0.6 to 71.3;  
forty pts were  50 with 12 pts older  than 60 years.  The diagnoses  included:  primary  MDS  (33 
patients)  and AML evolved  from MDS  (20 patients),  de novo AML in CR1 (9 patients)  or CR 2 (1 
patient).  The donors  were  HLA matched  (A, B, C, DR, DQ by high resolution)  related  (13), 
mismatched  related  (4), matched  unrelated  (46). Except  in two patients,  the source  of stem  cells 
was peripheral  blood.  Sixty  two patients  were  evaluable  for outcomes  and had at least 6 months  
of post transplant  followup.  Results  of this trial demonstrated  that this preparative  regimen  was 
safe as determined  by the low incidence  of graft rejection,  and GvHD.  All but 2 patients  achieved  
durable  engraftment.  One recipient  of unrelated  HLA disparate  transplant  experienced  primary  
graft failure  and one of unrelated  HLA disparate  transplant  experienced  graft rejection.  Acute  
GvHD  II- IV developed  in 7 patients  (18%)  and chronic  GvHD  in 4 patients  (7%) (3 extensive),  
despite  the advanced  age of this group.  Moreover,  oral mucositis  was less severe  as compared  to 
the mucositis  seen  after myeloablative  doses  of TBI-containing  regimens.  Thus,  the objectives  of 
securing  consistent  engraftment  with graft failure  <10%  and grade  II-IV acute  GvHD  in 1 HLA 
disparate  locus  recipient  have been  met in this trial. 
 
The prophylactic/preemptive  administration  of calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocyte  
infusions   has  been   integrated  to  reduce  potential   relapses   of the disease.   Historically,  donor

lymphocyte  infusion  were  performed  at time of relapsed  disease,  requiring  doses   of 1x107  - 
1x108/kg CD3+ cells to induce  a remission.  As detailed  above  under  3.2.3.  Donor  Lymphocyte  
Infusions,  these  doses  have also been  associated  with development  of acute  and chronic  graft- 
versus -host disease.  As proposed  in this trial, doses  of donor -derived  CD3+ T-cells will be given  in 
the range  of 5x105/kg CD3+ cells from matched  donors  and 1x105/kg CD3+ cells from one 
allele/antigen  mismatched  donors  with a first dose  administered  5-6 months  post transplantation.  
Finally,  the addition  of ATG to the chemotherapy  only conditioning  regim  en with busulfan,  
melphalan  and fludarabine  in our previous  trial has shown  to reduce  the incidence  of graft failures  
following  HLA-matched  T-cell depleted  transplants  to less than 2% and the incidence  of graft 
failure  following  unrelated  with 1-2 allele  disparate  marrow  grafts  to less than 8%. 
 
Pilot trial 
 
To assess  whether  this chemotherapy  only preparative  regimen  including  busulfan,  
melphalan,  fludarabine  and anti-thymocyte  globulin  could  be safely  administered  to patients  with 
relapsed  high-risk multiple  myeloma  and whether  these  patients  who could  benefit  from T-cell 
depleted  allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell transplantation  from HLA matched  related  or 
unrelated  donor,  we performed  an initial  pilot trial. Five patients  with high-risk MM, all of which  
relapsed  following  multiple  chemotherapy  regimen  and after one or two preceding  autologous  
stem  cell transplantations  underwent  T-cell depleted  transplants  from HLA-matched   siblings  
(3pts),  matched  unrelated  (1pt) or mismatched  unrelated  (1pt) donors.  Details  of the individual  
patients  and their outcomes  are described  in the paragraph  below,   but  in  summary,   all  five 
patients  durably  engrafted  with 100%  donor  chimerism  with patients  being  22, 16, 14, 10 and 4 
months  following  the allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation.  None  of the patients  developed  acute,  
chronic  graft-versus -host disease  or graft failure  at this time.  Three  of these  patients  achieved  a 
complete  remission,  one patient  remains  in near complete  remission  and one patient  had stable  
disease  with M-spike  of 0.2g/dl  for 20 months  following  the transplant.  
 
UPN #1 is a 40+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM. He was treated  with 
Thalidomide  and Dexamethasone  followed  by his 1st autologous  SCT with Mel 200 and 2nd 
autologous  SCT 4 months  later.  He relapsed  after 15 months  and was treated  with Lenalidomide  
and Dexamethasone  x 3 cycles.  He underwent  allogeneic  HSCT  from 9/10 unrelated  female  with 
HLA-DQB1  antigen  mismatch  22 months  post autologous  SCT.  The patient  had 7% Plasma  cells 
in his marrow  at admission.  The patient  tolerated  the transplantation  very well, engrafted  promptly  
without  requiring  readmission  following  discharge  from this hospitalization.  The patient  received  
infusion  of low doses  of donor  lymphocytes  (5x104/kg) at 5 months  and 12 months  post transplant  
and remained  at very stable  disease  with low levels  of M-protein  ranging  between  0.2 and 0.3 
mg/d  x 20 months.  This patient  has recently  developed  signs  of progression  of disease  and 
received  1x106 /kg CD3+ donor  T cell infusion  two months  ago and it is currently  too early  to 
assess  the response,  but he has not developed  signs  of GvHD.  
 
UPN #2 is a 30+ y/o male,  who was diagnosed  with stage  III IgA lambda  with high-risk 
cytogenetics,  (del 13, t (4; 14). He was treated  with Velcade  and Dexamethasone  x 6 cycles  
followed  by an autologous  SCT.  He relapsed  3 months  later.  The patient  was given  1 cycle  of 
Lenalidomide  and Dexamethasone,  which  he tolerated  very poorly  and was switched  to Velcade  
and Dexamethasone  x 2 cycles.  He underwent  allogeneic  HSCT  from his 10/10  identical  sister  in 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

9 months  post autologous  SCT.  He is currently  16 months  post transplant  in complete  remission  
without  complaints.  The patient  received  two doses  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at 7 
and 14 months  without  signs  of acute  or chronic  graft-versus -host disease.  
 
UPN #3 is a 30+ y/o male  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM diagnosed  with deletion  13. He 
was initially  treated  with Lenalidomide  and Dexamethasone  x 5 cycles  without  a response.  He 
was then treated  with VAD x 5 cycles  with only limited  response  (28%  plasma  cells in marrow),  
and continued  with autologous  SCT with minimal  response.  He  was  given  
Velcade/Dexamethasone  and Thalidomide  x 4 cycles  with partial  response.  He underwent  
allogeneic  HSCT  from his 10/10  identical  sister  7 months  post autologous  SCT.  The patient  
tolerated  the transplantation  without  complications,  stably  engrafted  with 100%  donor  chimerism  
and is back to work fulltime.  He is currently  14 months  post transplant  in near complete  remission.  
The patient  received  two doses  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at 6 and 10 months  without  
signs  of acute  or chronic  graft-versus -host disease.  
 
UPN #4 is 50+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG lambda  MM with high-risk 
cytogenetics  (del 17p, del 13q, t11; 14). He was treated  with Thalidomide  and Dexamethasone  x 
4 months  with progression  of disease  + renal  failure,  followed  by Velcade,  interrupted  by 
development  of myocardial  infarction  followed  by CAGB  in the setting  of CHF,  EF 35%.  
Afterwards  he was continued  on Velcade  x 1 cycle  followed  by VP-16 + Cytoxan  with PR. He 
underwent  autologous  SCT with Melphalan  200 and relapsed  after one year.  He was given  VAD 
with PD and VP-16/Cytoxan  x 3 cycles  with partial  response.  He underwent  allogeneic  SCT from 
10/10  unrelated  donor  17 months  post autologous  SCT and engrafted  promptly  without  
complications.  The patient  is currently  10 months  post transplant  with all donor  chimerism  and in 
complete  remission.  The patient  received  a first dose  of 5x 105/kg CD3+ donor  lymphocytes  at 6 
months  and has currently  no signs  of acute  or chronic  graft-versus -host disease.  
 
UPN #5 is a 60+ y/o male,  diagnosed  with stage  III IgG kappa  MM. He was initially treated  
with Revlimid,  Dexamethasone  and /Biaxin  (BIRD)  with PR. Autologous  SCT was performed  with 
good  response,  but the patient  relapsed  after one year.  He was started  on Revlimid,  Velcade  and 
Dexamethasone  x 4 cycles  followed  by Revlimid  maintenance  therapy,  which  he tolerated  poorly.  
Allogeneic  SCT from 10/10  HLA matched  brother  was performed  2 years  post autologous  SCT.  
This patient  engrafted  promptly  with all donor  chimerism  and achieved  complete  remission  post 
transplantation,  but unfortunately  passed  away  in 5 months  post allogeneic  SCT with respiratory  
failure  as a consequence  of pneumonia.  The cause  of the pneumonia  was likely  viral, but the 
patient  had refused  to be intubated  and a bronchoscopy  could  not be performed.  
 
These  results  can be compared  to the outcome  of patients  enrolled  by our group  onto the 
national  BMT CTN trial #04-024. On this protocol,  all patients  with multiple  myeloma,  
independently  of risk category  of cytogenetics  of their disease,  who had an HLA-identical  sibling,  
were  treated  with an autologous  stem  cell transplant  with Melphalan  200mg/m2  conditioning  
followed  by a non-myeloablative  allogeneic  transplant  from the sibling  with 200cGy  Total  Body  
Irradiation  as conditioning  regimen.  The complete  and official  analyses  of this national  trial are still 
pending,  but there  were  9 patients  enrolled  onto the auto/allo  arm of this trial by our group.  Seven  
of these  9 pts actually  underwent  allogeneic  transplantation.  Of these  7 pts, 3 pts developed  
acute   graft-versus -host  disease,   of  which   2  pts  also  developed   chronic   GvHD.   2  of  7  pts

developed  chronic  GvHD  without  preceding  acute  GvHD.  Two of 7 patients  died.  One patient  died 
7 months  following  the transplant  secondary  to complications  of acute  GvHD,  the other  patient  
died of progression  of disease.  
 
 
3.5. Summary  
 
The success of allogeneic  SCT in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma  depends  
on multiple  variables.  Our  approach  involving  T-cell depleted,  reduced -intensity,  myeloablative  
allogeneic  transplant  has the potential  to overcome  two major  obstacles  limiting  the success  of 
allogeneic  transplantation  for patients  with multiple  myeloma,  namely  graft-versus -host disease  
and associated  morbidity  and mortality.  The prophylactic/preemptive  administration  of low doses  
of donor  lymphocyte  infusions  is designed  to reduce  the relapse  mortality  post transplant  and to 
improve  the PFS with this treatment.  In the pilot trial of 5 patients  treated  with high-risk multiple  
myeloma,  as described  in detail  above,  this approach  has been  well tolerated  in these  patients  
with high-risk and relapsed  MM. None  of these  patients  has development  of graft-versus -host 
disease  or graft failure.  Furthermore,  3 of the 5 patients  transplanted  achieved  a  complete  
remission  and 2 patients  obtained  near complete  remissions  with lasting  durations.  
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a two arm phase  II trial to assess  overall  survival,  progression -free survival,  efficacy  
(decrease  the transplant  related  mortality)  and safety  of allogeneic  hematopoietic  stem  cell 
transplantation  using  a preparative  regimen  with busulfan,  melphalan,  fludarabine,  and anti- 
thymocyte  globulin  (ATG),  and T-cell depleted  stem  cell transplant  from a histocompatible  related  
or unrelated  donor  in patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  myeloma.  The prophylactic  or 
preemptive  administration  of donor  lymphocyte  infusions  is performed  to decrease  the rate of 
relapse  and thus to prolong  event -free and overall  survival.  
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  will be cytoreduced  with IV busulfan,  melphalan  and fludarabine.  Busulfan  will be 
administered  at a dose  of 0.8mg/Kg  q6hrs  for 10 doses  on days -9, -8, -7. Doses  for busulfan  
should  be adjusted  according  to pharmacokinetic  studies.  Melphalan  will be administered  at a 
dose  of 70 mg/m2/day for 2 days on days -7, -6. Fludarabine  will be administered  at a dose  of 25 
mg/m2/day for 5 days on days -6, -5, -4, -3, -2. Patients  will also receive  rabbit  anti-thymocyte  
globulin  (ATG)  to prevent  immune  mediated  graft rejection.  The ATG will be administered  at a 
dose  of 2.5 mg/Kg/day  IV on days -3 and -2. Doses  for busulfan,  melphalan  and ATG should  be 
adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  ideal body  weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body  
weight . Doses  of fludarabine  should  be reduced  to 80% of dose  for measured  creatinine  
clearance  of 40-70ml/min.  Day -1 will be a day of rest before  receiving  the T-cell depleted  stem

Historically,  under  the multicenter  BMTCTN trial 0303  (IRB 06-005 ) which  employed  the 
CliniMACS  device,  GCSF  mobilized  PBSC,  after washing,  were  suspended  in buffered  
saline  only and then incubated  with antiCD34  coated  paramagnetic  beads  prior to 
separation  of the CD34+ cells bound  to the beads  by adherence  to an electromagnet  in 
the CliniMACS  device.  A provision  recommended  as an adjunct  but not required  or 
known  to be necessary  was that the diluent  in which  the washed  GCSF -mobilized  PBMC  
were  incubated  with the antiCD34  coated  beads  also include  30% autologous  plasma  or 
intravenous  gamma  globulin  at a concentration  of 1.5 mg/ml.  This provision  was not  
used  by the centers  participating  in the BMTCTN  trial, including  our own. That trial 
recorded  an incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  of 20.5%  and a 7.6%  incidence  of 
extensive  GVHD.  While  these  findings  were  significantly  better  than any results  recorded  
with drug prophylaxis  or methods  of T-cell depletion  developed  at other  centers,  the 
incidence  of acute  GVHD  was higher  than what we had published  using  SBA-E-  T-cell 
depleted  marrow  or CD34+ (ISOLEX)  E- T-cell depleted  PBSC.  Since  we did not see 
significant  GVHD  in the small  number  of patients  that we contributed  to the trial, we 
ascribed  the higher  incidence  to limited  experiences  with the CliniMACS  device  and to 
recent  changes  in the grading  system  used  for acute  GVHD.  Accordingly,  no changes  in 
procedures  were  made  to protocol  10-051. 
 
However,  as accrual  to 10-051 proceeded,  we observed  an increase  in GVHD  even  in 
HLA-matched  cases,  and severe  acute  GVHD  in some  patients  who received  partially  
HLA-matched  transplants.  Again,  the data were  not different  from the BMT CTN trial 
results,  but these  results  were  different  compared  to our experience  with patients  
previously  transplanted  with T-cell depletion  by the ISOLEX   method.  However,  the rate 
of acute  GVHD  was higher  than that reported  by 2 European  groups  using  the 
CliniMACS  device  for HLA disparate  grafts.  We subsequently  learned  that the largest  of 
these  centers,  Perugia  U., did incorporate  IVIG in the incubation  step.  
 
Considering  the possibility  that in the absence  of plasma  or IVIG,  cells can non- 
specifically  adsorb  to paramagnetic  beads,  the cytotherapy  laboratory  validated  
separation  of CD34+ cells on the CliniMACS  in the presence  or absence  of IVIG in the 
incubation  period,  demonstrating  comparable  yields  of CD34+ cells and similar  levels  of 
T-cell depletion.  Thereafter,  on 7/25/12,  the procedure  was modified  to include  the IVIG.  
In February  2013,  we evaluated  the incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  and chronic  
GVHD  in patients  treated  since  then.  The incidence  of acute  grade  II-IV GVHD  has been  
significantly  lower  approximating  5%. 
 
In order  to be able to meaningfully  compare  the incidence  of acute  GVHD  in patients  
receiving  transplants  fractionated  in the presence  or absence  of IVIG and therefore  
obtain  a better  overall  understanding  of the actual  rate of acute  GvHD,  we wish to 
continue  to enroll  patients  on the relapsed  arm and increase  the number  of pts by 17 pts 
to a total of 47 pts. 
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
5.1. Busulfan  (Busulfex®)

a. Source  and pharmacology:  Supplier:  Otsuka  Pharmaceutical;  Busulfan  is a bifunctional  
alkylating  agent  known  chemically  as 1, 4-butanediol,  dimethanesulfonate.  BUSULFEX®  
(busulfan).  This is an agent  in which  two labile  methanesulfonate  groups  are attached  to 
opposite  ends of a four carbon  alkyl chain.  In aqueous  media,  busulfan  hydrolyzes  to 
release  the methanesulfonate  groups.  This produces  reactive  carbonium  ions that can 
alkylate  DNA.  DNA  damage  is thought  to be responsible  for much  of the cytotoxicity  of 
busulfan.  
 
b. Formulation  and stability:  It is supplied  as a clear,  colorless,  sterile,  solution  in 10 mL 
single  use ampoules.  Each  ampoule  of BUSULFEX  contains  60 mg (6 mg/mL)  of 
busulfan,  the active  ingredient,  a white  crystalline  powder  with a molecular  formula  of 
CH 3SO 2O (CH 2)4OSO 2CH 3 and a molecular  weight  of 246 g/mole.  Busulfan  is dissolved  in 
N, N-dimethylacetamide  (DMA)  33% wt/wt  and polyethylene  glycol  400, 67% wt/wt.  
Busulfan‟s solubility  in water  is 0.1 g/L and the pH of a >0.5%  solution  in 0.9%  Sodium  
Chloride  Injection,  USP or 5% Dextrose  Injection,  USP as recommended   for  infusion  
reflects  the pH of the diluent  used  and ranges  from 3.4 to 3.9.

5.3 Fludarabine  (FLUDARA®)  
 
a. Source  and pharmacology:  Supplier:  Berlex  Laboratories,  Inc. FLUDARA  FOR  
INJECTION  contains  fludarabine  phosphate,  a fluorinated  nucleotide  analog  of the 
antiviral  agent  vidarabine,  9-ß-D-arabinofuranosyladenine  (ara-A)  that  is  relatively  
resistant  to deamination  by adenosine  deaminase.  The chemical  name  for fludarabine  
phosphate  is 9H-Purin -6-amine,  2-fluoro -9-(5-O-phosphono -ß-D-arabinofuranosyl).  
Fludarabine  phosphate  is rapidly  dephosphorylated  to 2-fluoro -ara-A and then 
phosphorylated  intracellularly  by deoxycytidine  kinase  to the active  triphosphate,  2-fluoro - 
ara-ATP.  This metabolite  appears  to act by inhibiting  DNA  polymerase   alpha,  
ribonucleotide  reductase  and DNA primase,  thus inhibiting  DNA  synthesis.   The 
mechanism  of action  of this antimetabolite  is not completely  characterized  and may be 
multi-faceted.  
 
b. Formulation  and stability:  Each  vial of sterile  lyophilized  solid cake contains  50 mg of 
the active  ingredient  fludarabine  phosphate,  50 mg of mannitol,  and sodium  hydroxide  to 
adjust  pH to 7.7. The pH range  for the final product  is 7.2-8.2. Reconstitution  with 2 mL of 
Sterile  Water  for Injection  USP results  in a solution  containing  25 mg/mL  of fludarabine  
phosphate  intended  for intravenous  administration.  FLUDARA  FOR  INJECTION  is 
supplied  in a clear  glass  single  dose  vial (6 mL capacity)  and packaged  in a single  dose  
vial carton  in a shelf pack of five

Injection,  USP 5 mL. The reconstituted  preparation  contains  approximately  5 mg/mL  of 
Thymoglobulin,  of which  >90%  is rabbit  gamma  immune  globulin  (IgG).  The reconstituted  
solution  has a pH of 7.0± 0.4. Human  red blood  cells are used  in the manufacturing  
process  to deplete  cross -reactive  antibodies  to non-T-cell antigens.  The manufacturing  
process  is validated  to remove  or inactivate  potential  exogenous  viruses.  All human  red 
blood  cells are from US registered  or FDA licensed  blood  banks.  A viral inactivation  step 
(pasteurization,  i.e., heat treatment  of active  ingredient  at 60°C/10  hr) is performed  for 
each  lot. Each  Thymoglobulin  lot is released  following  potency  testing  (lymphocytotoxicity  
and E-rosette  inhibition  assays),  and cross -reactive  antibody  testing  (hemagglutination,  
platelet  agglutination,  anti-human  serum  protein  antibody,  antiglomerular  basement  
membrane  antibody,  and fibroblast  toxicity  assays  on every  5th lot). 
 
c. Solution  preparation:  Each  reconstituted  vial contains  25 mg or 5 mg/mL  of 
Thymoglobulin.  Transfer  the contents  of the calculated  number  of Thymoglobulin  vials into 
the bag of infusion  solution  (saline  or dextrose).  Recommended  volume:  per one vial of 
Thymoglobulin  use 50 mL of infusion  solution  (total  volume  usually  between  50 to 500 
mL). Mix the solution  by inverting  the bag gently  only once  or twice.

* busulfan  dosing  and administration:  
Patients  will have busulfan  levels  drawn  after the first dose  on day 1, with adjustments  in 
dosing  based  on the pharmacokinetics  of the first dose..  Dose  should  be adjusted  if 
patient  is >125%  ideal body  weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body  
weight  per MSKCC‟s standard  of care and BMT busulfan  guidelines.  
 
** melphalan  dosing  and administration:

Dose  should  be reduced  to 80% (20mg/m2  per day) of dose  for measured  creatinine  clearance  of 
40-70ml/min.  
 
Anti-seizure  prophylaxis  with Keppra  will be administered  to all patients  starting  day –10 or 24 
hours  prior to starting  busulfan  for the prevention  of busulfan -associated  seizures.  
 
9.2. Peri-transplant  treatment  to promote  engraftment  
 
a. Rabbit  anti-thymocyte  globulin*  (Thymoglobulin®) and methylprednisolone  
(MPD)  will be administered  in the pre-transplant  period  for all patients.  Patients  will receive  
rabbit  ATG (Thymoglobulin®)  at 2.5 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days on days -3 and -2. 
Methylprednisolone  will be given  at 2 mg/Kg/day  x 2 days with the ATG administration  and 
will be discontinued  thereafter.  ATG dose  should  be adjusted  if patient  is > 125%  ideal 
body weight  and should  be calculated  on adjusted  ideal body  weight  and will be 
administered  as per MSKCC  standard  of care guidelines.  
 
Side-effects  of ATG may occur  (see section  11.0 "Toxicities/Side  Effects").  If a reaction  
consisting  of fever  and chills  occurs,  then the infusion  will be slowed down,  meperidine  
could  be given  for the relief of the chills,  and when  the reaction  improves  the infusion  rate 
could  be slowly  escalated  again.  Should  a severe  significant  systemic  reaction  to the 
rabbit  ATG occur,  then the alternative  equine  ATG will be administered  at doses  of 15 
mg/Kg/day  x 2 days.  
 
b. All patients  will be treated  with G-CSF (filgrastim)  at 300 g SC QD for patients  
<60kg or 480 g SC QD for patients  >60Kg.  G-CSF administration  will begin  on day +7 
and will continue  until the ANC is >2000.  
 
9.3. Prophylaxis  against  acute  graft-versus -host disease  
 
No further  GvHD  prophylaxis  will be administered.  
 
9.4. Stem  Cell Transplantation    
 
9.4.1.  PBSCT  
 
Donor  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells:  stimulation,  harvesting,  isolation  and T-cell depletion . 
 
For related  donors , beginning  5-6 days before  the day of transplant,  the normal  donor  will receive  
10 mcg/kg  of GCSF,  administered  subcutaneously  daily for at least 5 days.  On the fifth and sixth 
days of this course  of G-CSF,  the donor  will undergo  daily leukapheresis  designed  to provide  a 
minimum  of 109 mononuclear  cells/kg  of the transplant  recipient's  weight.  For unrelated  donors , 
the G-CSF will be administered  and the leukapheresis  obtained  according  to the National  Marrow  
Donor  Program  protocol  and IND. 
 
Isolation  of CD34+  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells  with the CliniMACS TM System,  Miltenyi  
Biotec.  
The apheresis  product  is collected  from a blood  of related  or unrelated  donors.  Aliquots  of the 
apheresis  product  are collected  and then tested  and screened  as per blood  banking  guidelines.  
The apheresis  product  is then prepped  for the CliniMACS  Cell Selection  System.  The mechanism  
of action of the CliniMACS Cell Selection System is based on magne tic-activated cell sorting, 
which  can select  or remove  specific  cell types  depending  on the cell-specific  immunomagnetic

label used  as further  detailed  below.  The apheresis  product  is first co-incubated  with the 
CliniMACS  CD34  reagent  (antibody -coated  paramagnetic   particles).   Prior  to  and  during  
incubation  of the antiCD34  beads  with the mobilized  PBSC,  intravenous  gammaglobulin  is added  
to the incubation  fluid at a concentration  of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml.  After magnetic  labeling  and washing,  
the cells are passed  through  a high-gradient  magnetic  separation   column   in  the  CliniMACS  
clinical  cell selection  device.  Magnetically  labeled  CD34+  cells are retained  in the magnetized  
column,  and CD34-negativ  e cells flow through  as the effluent  fraction  and will be discarded.  The 
CD34+positiv  e cells  retained  in the column  are eluted  by removing  the magnetic  field from  the 
column,  then washing  the cells through  the column  and collecting  them.  The final CD34+  cell 
enriched  product  is concentrated  by centrifugation  and tested  before   final  release   for 
administration  as per SOPs  from the MSKCC  Cytotherapy  Lab Manual.  
 
Before  infusion,  the CD34+  cells will be washed  in normal  saline  for intravenous  infusion  
containing  1% human  serum  albumin,  and suspended  in a volume  of 25-50 ml for intravenous  
administration.  Aliquots  of the product  are taken  for in-process  and final product  testing  will be 
performed  as per SOPs  from the Cytotherapy  Lab Manual.  
 
This study  (protocol)  will be conducted  under  BB-IND #14060.  BB-IND #14060  is an existing  IND 
that was approved  by the FDA and we are currently  using  the Miltenyi  device  in the same  way. 
 
9.4.2.  BMT  (if PBCST  not possible)  
 
Twenty \ four to forty-eight  hours  after the patient  has completed  treatment  with fludarabine,  bone  
marrow  will be harvested  from the donor  in the operating  room  according  to standard  procedure.  
The procedure  for T cell depletion  with soybean  agglutinin  (SBA)  and sheep  red blood  cells (E) 
has been  previously  described36, 40  as per the SOP  from the MSKCC  Cytotherapy  Laboratory.  
 
The amount  of marrow  harvested  will be such  to provide  a minimum  of 1 x 107  SBA-E- 
mononuclear  cells/kg  of the transplant  recipient's  weight.  In very rare instances,  the amount  of 
marrow  cells harvested  from the donor  may be inadequate  to provide  a high enough  cell yield 
after the complete  T-cell depletion  procedure  outlined  above,  to ensure  engraftment.  This can be 
predicted  at any of the initial  steps  before  the final RBC  rosetting.  In such   a  situation,   the 
physician  in charge  of the study  and/or  the attending  physician  of the BMT service,  in consultation  
with the laboratory  investigators  performing  the T-cell depletion,  may elect to administer  either  an 
unmodified  or a partially  T-cell depleted  (SBA -) marrow  transplant.  The patient  would  then receive  
drug prophylaxis  against  GvHD.  These  patients  will be statistically  evaluated  as recipients  of T- 
cell depleted  marrow,  but will be analyzed  separately  in evaluation  of the efficacy  of the SBA-E- 
marrow  grafts.  
 
Transplantation  of the T-cell depleted  stem  cells.  
The CD34+T -cell depleted  peripheral  blood  progenitor  cells or the SBA-E- fraction  of the bone  
marrow,  suspended  in a volume  of approximately  20-50 ml will be infused  intravenously  over 15 
minutes  with monitoring  of vital signs.  The patient  is premedicated  as for blood  product  
transfusions.

a. Prophylaxis  against  infections  
Standard  of care guidelines  will be followed  for prophylaxis  against  post transplant  
infections  by opportunistic  organisms,  including  Pneumocystis  jiroveci,  fungal  organisms,  
DNA herpesviruses  and more  specifically  CMV.  
 
b. Prophylaxis  against  menorrhagia  
All post-pubertal  females   will receive  prophylaxis   against  menorrhagia  according  to our 
standard  of care guidelines.  
 
c. Transfusions  
All blood  product  transfusions  will be performed  as per standard  of care and BMT 
guidelines.  
 
d. Nutritional  support  
Nutritional  status  will be carefully  monitored  by the physician,  and high-calorie  parenteral  
alimentation  will be introduced  as needed.  Vitamin  supplements  will be as clinically  
indicated.  
 
Administration  of Donor  Lymphocyte  Infusions  
Calculated  doses  of donor  lymphocytes  suspended  in a volume  of approximately  10-30 ml 
will be infused  intravenously  over 5-10 minutes  with monitoring  of vital signs.  The patient   
is premedicated  as for blood  product  transfusions.  
 
 
10.1 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION

(1) Infectious  disease  markers  will be performed  as per each  department ‟s guidelines  or at the 
discretion  of the treating  attending.  
(2) Biopsy  will be stained  with CD138,  CD20  and kappa/lambda.  Aspirate  will be sent for the 
following  tests:  a. Routine  staining  and cell counts,  b. One heparinized  syringe  with 5ml of 
marrow  for flow cytometry  for routine  myeloma  markers,  c. Two syringes  with EDTA  and 2ml 
of marrow  in each  syringe  for karyotype  and FISH  for chromosomal  abnormalities,  d. An 
additional  3-6ml marrow  in EDTA  will be drawn  for correlative  studies  
(3) Chimerism  at baseline  (pretreatment)  can be either  blood  or bone  marrow.  Additionally,  
baseline  chimerism  may be done  at any time pre-transplant.  For the day+28  time point,  only 
bone  marrow  chimerism  is required.  Chimerism  will be done  at 9 months  only if clinically  
indicated  
(4) Myeloma  analyses  includes:  serum  protein  electrophoresis  (SPEP),  serum  immunofixation  
(IF), quantitative  immunoglobulins,  serum  free light chain  assay,  β-2 microglobulin,  LDH;  24 
hour urine  collection  for total protein,  creatinine  clearance,  urine  protein  electrophoresis  (not 
required  if total protein  is < 10.0 mg/dl),,  urine  immunofixation.   Myeloma   analyses   at  9 
months  only if clinically  indicated  
(5) Patients  with positive  skeletal  surveys  at baseline  will have  repeat  skeletal  surveys  
performed  at 6 months  and 12 months  post transplant  
(6) GvHD evaluations will be performed as per the ABMT service guidelines. GvHD evaluations 
may be conducted  by phone  for remote  patients.  This will be appropriately  documented  in 
EMR.  
 
 
 
11.0   TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Patients  recruited  to this transplantation  trial are individuals  who are either  referred  by physicians  or 
self-referred  for marrow  transplantation  as a potentially  curative  treatment  for their malignancy.  Prior 
to consideration  for transplant,  all patients  undergo  a series  of 1-3 hour consultations  discussing  the 
risks and potential  benefits  of an allogeneic  stem  cell transplantation  and the different  procedures  
which  will be a normal  part of the transplant  course.  The risks and potential  benefits  of the transplant  
procedure,  as well as the participation  in any given  research,  experimental,  or therapeutic  protocol  
are also discussed.  
 
11.1.  Risks  to Related  Peripheral  Blood  Stem  Cell Donors  
 
The risks of short -term treatment  with G-CSF are likely negligible.  However,  administration  of G-CSF 
is frequently  associated  with low grade  fever  and low back pain which  usually  resolves  within  one 
day following  cessation  of G-CSF treatment.  Furthermore,  there  has now been  one recorded  patient  
who developed  acute  splenomegaly  and splenic  rupture  in response  to high dose  G-CSF.  The bone  
pain may require  treatment  with analgesics.  The risks of a leukapheresis  are negligible,  involving  an 
occasional  vasovagal  response  to venipuncture  and  the  minimal   hemodynamic   alterations  
associated  with single  unit phlebotomies.  To protect  against  these  risks,  leukophoreses  are 
conducted  in the Blood  Bank  Donor  Room  with full medical  and nursing  supervision  and support  
systems  to address  adverse  events.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018

For donors  undergoing  bone  marrow  harvest,  the risks for the donor  will mainly  be those  risks 
associated  with general  anesthesia.  The side effects  of the harvest  itself will include  pain at the site 
of harvest,  i.e. posterior  and/or  anterior  superior  iliac crests,  as well as minimal  risks of bleeding  at 
the site. There  have been  no problems  with localized  infections  at the sites in the extensive  
experience  of our service  with marrow  harvests  over the last 20 years.  
 
11.2.  General  Description  of Risks  to Recipients  
 
Infections  and hemorrhage  constitute  major  and continuing  risks throughout  the period  of marrow  
aplasia.  These  are, however,  also the major  risks associated  with the primary  disease.  Certain  
opportunistic  infections  remain  a risk in transplant  patients  beyond  recovery  of circulating  
leukocytes,  for at least 9-12 months  post-transplant,  e.g. Pneumocystis  carinii,  cytomegalovirus  and 
Epstein  Barr virus.  
 
Likely:  
 
Busulfan:  Myelosuppression,  fatigue,  not sleeping  well, anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection.  
 
Melphalan:  Myelosuppression,  fatigue,  not sleeping  well, anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection,  transient  liver dysfunction.  
 
Fludarabine:  Myelosuppression,  tiredness,  not sleeping  well, anorexia,  nausea,  vomiting,  diarrhea,  
mucositis  weight  gain and swelling,  changes  in blood  sodium  level,  alopecia,  needing  transfusions  of 
platelets  and red blood  cells,  fever,  needing  antibiotics  to treat infection,  jaundice  and elevations  of 
liver enzymes.  
 
Reproductive  risks: Sterility.  Male patients  may be offered  sperm  banking  before  admission  for the 
transplant.  Possibilities  of preserving  the ability  to have children  for female  patients  can be 
discussed  with the doctor.  Patients  should  not become  pregnant  or father  a baby  while  on this study  
because  the drugs  in this study  can affect  an unborn  baby.  Women  should  not breast  feed a baby  
while  on this study.  A pregnancy  test is required  of all females  of childbearing  age before  starting  the 
transplant.  
ATG: is a rabbit  protein  that may induce  an immune  response  in humans.  Fever,  chills,  changes  in 
blood  pressure,  rash.  Pre-medications  (Benadryl,  Tylenol  and steroids  before   ATG)   have   been  
shown  to be effective  therapy.  Side effects  are usually  only severe  after the first dose.  
 
Growth  factor  (G-CSF):  bone  pain, headache,  body  ache,  feeling  tired,  swelling  of hands/feet,  
nausea.  These  are generally  mild and will go away  when  the growth  factor  is stopped.  
 
Less  Likely:  
 
Busulfan,   melphalan,   fludarabine:   Late  effects   of  these  three   chemotherapy   agents   include:  
cataracts  and under -activity  of the thyroid  gland.  Both of these  side effects  can be easily  treated.

IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  29 of 46  
  
 
 
 
Busulfan:  Seizures  that are generally  preventable  by phenytoin  therapy  started  24 hours  prior to 
administration  and continued  for 24 hours  post busulfan.  Abnormal  liver function,  pulmonary  fibrosis  
 
Melphalan: Renal  or bladder  dysfunction  (increased  BUN,  creatinine,  necrosis)  may be seen.  
 
Fludarabine:  confusion,  numbness,  loss of vision,  loss of balance,  difficulty  walking  
 
ATG: Prior exposure  to rabbit  proteins  may predispose  subjects  to serious  allergic  reactions  such  as 
a drop in blood  pressure,  hives,  bronchospasm,  or serum  sickness.  Such  reactions  will be treated  
with epinephrine  and anti-histamines.  Serum  sickness  is an immune  disease  usually  appearing  3-10 
days after injection  of a foreign  serum  or serum  protein,  with reactions  such  as hives,  fever,  swollen  
lymph  nodes,  edema,  arthritis,  protein  in the urine,  or severe  inflammation  of the kidney.  In the event  
of a severe  systemic  allergic  reaction,  a trial of an alternative  horse  ATG will be administered.  If a 
similar  reaction  occurs  with the equine  ATG,  no further  ATG will be administered.  
 
Rare  but serious:  
 
Busulfan:  high doses  of Busulfan  can cause  Veno -Occlusive  Disease  (VOD).  Symptoms  include  
jaundice,  liver enlargement  with pain, fluid retention  and increase  risk of bleeding.  This complication  
is managed  by aggressive  supportive  care with monitoring  of fluids  and administration  of diuretics  
and infusions  of plasma  and albumin.  Veno -Occlusive  Disease  in its severe  form can be life 
threatening.  There  is also a medication,  Defibrotide,  which  has shown  to be helpful  in treating  VOD.  
 
Melphalan:  pulmonary  fibrosis,  respiratory  distress  has been  rarely  reported.  Serious  
hypersensitivity  reactions:  Edema,  rash,  anaphylaxis  
 
ATG: renal  toxicity,  managed  by Prednisone.  Drop  in white  blood  cells;  drop in platelet  count  will be 
managed  by transfusion  therapy.  
 
Transplant  related  risks:  
 
Blood  transfusions:  Transfusions  may induce  allergic  reactions.  Small,  subclinical   pulmonary  
emboli  may occur,  but these  rarely  if ever require  any intervention.  Standard  pre-medications  for 
blood  products  may  be used  before  administration  of the marrow  graft.  Fluid overload  can be 
managed  with diuretics.  Allergic  reactions  of variable  severity  can be prevented  or mitigated  by 
premedication  with antipyretics,  antihistamines,  and narcotics.  These  products  may also serve  as 
vectors  of serious  infection  (e.g.,  CMV,  hepatitis,  AIDS).  To circumvent  this, prospective  blood  and 
marrow  donors  will be screened  per AABB  and FAHCT  guidelines.  CMV  antibody  (-) blood  products  
will be used  in CMV( -) individuals,  whenever  possible,  regardless  of the antibody  status of the 
marrow  donor.  All blood  products  are irradiated  (3000r,  137Cs) to  circumvent   the  risk  of  GvHD  
caused  by contaminating  lymphocytes  in the transfused  fractions.  
 
Receiving  peripheral  blood  stem  cells:  The volume  of the T-cell depleted  peripheral  blood  stem  
cells infused  is approximately  30-50 cc. Possible  side effects  include:  changes  in blood  pressure,  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018

fever,  headache,  shortness  of breath,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  bad taste  in the mouth.  Pre- 
medications  are given  to reduce  these  side effects.  
 
Receiving  donor  lymphocyte  infusions:  The volume  of the donor  lymphocyte  infusions  infused  is 
approximately  10-30 cc. Possible  side effects  include:  changes  in blood  pressure,  fever,  headache,  
shortness  of breath,  chills,  sweats,  nausea/vomiting,  bad taste  in the mouth.  Pre-medications  are 
given  to reduce  these  side effects.  
 
Graft -versus -host-disease  (known  as GvHD):  This condition  happens   when   the  transplanted  
donor  cells recognizes  the patient‟s body as foreign  and attacks  it. At least 1-2 out of 10 patients  
receiving  a T cell depleted  transplant  will get mild to moderate  GvHD.  GvHD  can be treated  with 
medications  (either  IV or tablets).  A biopsy  may be necessary  to make  the diagnosis  of GvHD.  
 
Acute  GvHD  usually  occurs  in the first 3 months  and may cause:  skin rashes,  nausea,  vomiting,  
diarrhea,  hepatitis,  increased  risk of infection,  ulceration  of the surfaces  of the oral cavity,  
esophagus,  and intestines,  and suppressed  or delayed  recovery  of the hematopoietic  and immune  
system.  In patients  transplanted  and engrafted  with SBA-E- T-cell depleted  marrow  from HLA 1-3 
allele  disparate  related  donors,  this complication  has been  observed  in fewer  than 20% of patients  
and has rarely  been  severe.  It may be fatal in at least 20-50% of cases  and may also predispose  to 
lethal  infections  which  contribute  to an additional  mortality  of 10-25%.  
 
Chronic  GvHD  can occur  any time after the first 3 months.  Approximately  50% of patients  with 
acute  GvHD  may also develop  chronic  GvHD,  manifested  to varying  degrees  by scleroderma-like 
changes  of the skin, cirrhosis  of the liver, sclerosis  of lacrimal  and salivary  ducts,  chronic  
inflammation  and scarring  of the gastrointestinal  tract with consequent  malabsorption  and diarrhea,  
chronic  bronchitis,  and suppression  of the immune  system.  This can be treated  with standard  or 
protocol -based  experimental  immunosuppression,  but may be refractory.  
 
Severe  graft -versus -host disease:  Rarely,  GvHD  can be severe  or deadly.  Severe  acute  GvHD  
could  involve  a severe  skin rash like a burn,  severe  vomiting  and/or  diarrhea,  liver failure  and 
infections  or bleeding.  Severe  acute  GvHD  will be treated  with intense  immunosuppressive  therapy  
according  to standard  clinical  practice  or other  experimental  protocol.  Severe  chronic  GvHD  could  
involve  similar  symptoms  but may produce  other  symptoms  such as severe  skin changes,  severe  
dry eyes and weight  loss. 
 
Steroids , as treatment  for GvHD:  inability  to sleep,  high blood  sugar,  puffiness  of the face,  changes  
in the skin, high blood  pressure,  increased  risk of infection,  weight  gain, reduced  growth  in children,  
thinning  of the bones  
 
Infections  or bleeding:  Full recovery  of blood  counts  may take months.  Full recovery  of  the 
immune  system  may take months  to a few years.  For this reason  patients  will be at increased  risk of 
infections  and bleeding.  Medications  are given  to reduce  the chance  of those  infections.  Patients  
will receive  treatment  if they do get an infection  and most  infections  can be treated  successfully  with 
antibiotics.  Patients  will stay in the hospital  longer  or be readmitted  if found  to have  an infection.  
Patients  are watched  closely  for bleeding  and given  platelet  transfusions  to prevent   serious  
bleeding,  but minor  bleeding  may occur.

Serious  infections  or bleeding:  Some  infections  are very difficult  to treat,  even with strong  
antibiotics.  Rarely,  serious  infections  can be passed  on by the transfusion  of blood  products.  Serious  
bleeding  can happen  in spite of platelet  transfusions.  Rarely  infections  or bleeding  are lethal.  
 
Potential  sensitization  to murine  proteins:  Mouse  protein  (the anti CD34  antibody  used  in this 
device  is of murine  derivation)  is used  in the CliniMACS  processing  procedure.  Marrow  cells are also 
separated  on bovine  serum  albumin  gradients  and exposed  to sheep  red cells to remove  rosetting  
populations.  It is possible  that patients  may have pre-existing  immunity  to these  proteins  and may be 
at risk for allergic  reactions  during  infusion  of the processed  marrow  and/or  peripheral  blood.  No 
allergic  reactions  have been  noted  with infusions  of cells processed  by the CliniMACS  system  in 
clinical  studies  or from infusion  of cells recovered  by depletion  of SRBC -rosette -positive  cells.  
Precautions  for an allergic  event  will be taken  during  the infusion  of the processed  cells.  
 
Pneumocystis  jiroveci  prophylaxis:  The risk of trimethoprim  and sulfamethoxazole  in the doses  
given  are primarily  hypersensitivity  reactions  and signs  of folate  deficiency.  Any patient  with known  
hypersensitivity  to these  compounds  will not receive  these  drugs.  The risks of parenteral  
pentamidine  are primarily  hypotension  and hypoglycemia  both of which  will be monitored  during  and 
following  administration  of the drug.  Hypokalemia  or hypomagnesemia  associated  with prolonged  
QT syndrome  or Torsade  de pointe  necessitates  strict  electrolyte  monitoring.  The risks of 
aerosolized  pentamidine  are mild bronchospasm  primarily  observed  in (prior)  tobacco  abusers  and 
easily  managed  with bronchodilator  therapy.  
 
Risk of a secondary  cancer  different  from multiple  myeloma  may happen  after chemotherapy.  The 
risk of developing  a secondary  cancer  of the skin, cervix,  etc., which  has been  seen  in other  studies  
of similar  transplants,  is less than 5%. There  is a special  concern  in patients  who receive  a T cell 
depleted  transplants  because  there  is a risk of having  a cancer  of the lymph  nodes  (lymphoma)  
caused  by the Epstein  Barr virus (EBV).  This virus causes   mononucleosis  in healthy   people.  
Treatment  of EBV lymphoma  includes  Donor  Leukocyte  Infusion  (DLI)  and Rituximab.  
 
Graft  Failure:  Bone  marrow  graft may fail to grow.  Past experience  suggests  that this may occur  in 
about  10% of patients.  If graft failure  occurs,  it is unlikely  that bone  marrow  will recover  and a 
second  transplant  with stem  cells from the same  donor  or a different  donor  will be needed.  
 
Progression  of Disease  and Relapse  of Multiple  Myeloma  is a risk even  if the transplant  is 
initially  successful.  Patients  on the relapsed  cohort  may be treated  prophylactically  with Revlimid  
maintenance  therapy  post transplant.  
 
12.0   CRITERIA  FOR  THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
DEFINITIONS  OF DISEASE  STATUS  
 
Patients  at each  data collection  period  are classified  into one of the following  states.  
 
1. Complete  Response  (CR) 
CR requires  all of the following:  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  32 of 46  
  
 
- Absence  of the original  M-protein  in serum  and urine  by routine  electrophoresis  and by 
immunofixation  maintained  for a minimum  of six weeks.  The presence  of new monoclonal  bands  
consistent  with oligoclonal  immune  reconstitution  does not exclude  CR. 
- Less  than 5% plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspirate  and also on trephine  bone  biopsy,  if biopsy  
is performed.  Confirmation  with repeat  bone  marrow  studies  is not needed  if the last bone  marrow  
assessment  was negative.  
- No increase  in size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response).  
 
Patients  in whom  some,  but not all, the criteria  for CR are fulfilled  are classified  as very good  partial  
response  or partial  response  (see below),  providing  the remaining  criteria  satisfy  the requirement  for 
partial  response.  This includes  patients  in whom  routine  electrophoresis  is negative  but in whom  
immunofixation  has not been  performed.  
 
2. Very Good  Partial  Response  (VGPR)  
- Reduction   of  serum   M-protein   on  electrophoresis   by  at  least  90%  with  a  urine   M-protein  
<100mg/24hours,  but detectable  immunofixation.  
 
3. Partial  Response  (PR) 
PR requires  the following:  
- Greater  than or equal  to 50% reduction  in the level of the serum  M-protein,  maintained  for a 
minimum  of six weeks.  
OR 
- Reduction  of urine  M-protein  to less than 200 mg/24  hours,  maintained  for a minimum  of six weeks  
- No increase  in size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response).  
 
For patients  with nonsecretory  myeloma,  free light chain  (FLC)  levels  can be used to determine  a 
partial  response.  A 50% decrease  in the difference  between  kappa  and lambda  FLC levels  denotes  
a PR. If the FLC levels  were  unmeasurable  at baseline,  a 50% reduction  in bone  marrow  plasma  
cells is acceptable  as long as the original  bone  marrow  contained  at least 30% plasma  cells.  All PR 
require  a 50% reduction  in size of any soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
 
Patients  in whom  some,  but not all, the criteria  for PR are fulfilled  are classified  as minimal  response  
(see below),  providing  the remaining  criteria  satisfy  the requirements  for minimal  response.  
 
4. Minimal  Response  (MR)  
Minimal  response  requires  the following:  
- 25-49% reduction  in the level of the serum  M-protein.  
OR 
- Urine  M-protein  which  still exceeds  200 mg/24  hours  
- 25-49% reduction  in the size of soft tissue  plasmacytomas  (by radiography  or clinical  examination).  
- No increase  in the size or number  of lytic bone  lesions  on radiological  investigations,  if performed  
(development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  response)

5. Stable  Disease  (SD) 
Stable  values  (within  25% above  or below  value  at time response  is assessed)  maintained  for at 
least three  months.  
 
6. Relapse 
Relapse  from CR requires  one or more  of the following:  
• Reappearance  of serum  or urine  paraprotein  on immunofixation  or routine  electrophoresis,  
confirmed  by at least two further  consecutive  investigation  with 2-4 weeks  and excluding  
oligoclonal  immune  reconstitution  
• Greater  than or equal  to 5% plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspirate  or on trephine  bone  biopsy  
• Development  of new lytic bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  or definite  increase  in the 
size of residual  bone  lesions.  Development  of a compression  fracture  does not exclude  
continued  response  and may not indicate  progression  
• Development   of  hypercalcemia   (corrected   serum   Ca  >  11.5  mg/dL   or  >  2.8  mmol/L)   not 
attributable  to any other  cause  
 
7. Progressive  Disease  (PD) 
For patients  not in CR, progressive  disease  requires  one or more  of the following:  
• > 25% increase  in the level of the serum  M-protein,  which  must  also be an absolute  increase  of 
at least 0.5 g/dL and confirmed  by at least one repeated  investigation  
• An absolute  increase  in urine  M-protein  of at least 200 mg/24  hours  and confirmed  by at least 
one repeated  investigation  
• > 25% increase  in plasma  cells in a bone  marrow  aspirate  or on trephine  biopsy,  which  must  
also be an absolute  increase  of at least 10% 
• Definite  increase  in the size of existing  bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
• Development  of new bone  lesions  or soft tissue  plasmacytomas  
• Development   of  hypercalcemia   (corrected   serum   Ca  >  11.5  mg/dL   or  >  2.8  mmol/L)   not 
attributable  to any other  cause  
• Development  of  a compression  fracture  does  not  exclude   continued   response  and may  not 
indicated  progression  
 
Definition  of events  in the post-transplant  course  important  for analysis  and treatment  
 
12.1.  Regimen -related  and transplant -related  mortality  
 
Regimen  related  toxicity  (RRT)  refers  to those  toxicities  that can be attributed  directly  to the 
preparative  regimen  (including  chemotherapeutic  agents,  ATG,  and donor  lymphocyte  infusion).  
 
Transplant -related  mortality  (TRM)  includes  the RRT and other  fatal complications  resulting  from 
the allogenic  transplant  such  as graft failure,  GvHD,  hemorrhages,  and infections.  One year post 
TRM  is the primary  endpoint  of this study.  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  34 of 46  
  
 
The grading  for monitoring  the morbidity  and mortality  will be based  on the NCI/CTEP  common  
toxicity  criteria  version  4.0. This will include  assessment  of severity  and duration  of oral mucositis  
and sequelae  specifically  parenteral  opioid  analgesic  use, TPN use, febrile  neutropenia,  hospital  
days and intubation.  
 
12.2.  Immunologic  Reconstitution  
 
Our previously  reported  analyses  have identified  time points  at which  the various   immunologic  
functions  can be expected  to return.  Patients  receiving  T-cell depleted  transplants   from  HLA- 
identical  related  donors  can be monitored  at fewer  time points  without  compromising  our ability  to 
obtain  critical  information.  However,  patients  receiving  transplants  from partially   HLA-matched  
related  donors  will be evaluated  more  frequently,  as graft rej ection,  late graft failures,  more  
pronounced  immune  dysfunction,  and more  patient  to patient  variability  have  been  observed.  
 
Immunophenotyping  of T-cells,  B-cells,  and NK cells,  will be performed  at approximately  3, and 
every  3-6 months  post-transplant  until normal  values  are reached.  
 
T-cell proliferations  in response  to PHA will be performed  at approximately  3 months  post-transplant  
and every  3-6 months  thereafter  until normal  values  are reached.   These  tests  are not required  when  
a patient‟s absolute  lymphocyte  count  is less than 0.5 K/mcL.  
 
Immunoglobulin  levels  will be tested  at 6 months,  9 months  (if clinically  indicated),  12 and 18 
months  post-transplant  and thereafter  as clinically  indicated.  Patients  with normal  total IgG levels  
and PHA response  within  the 25th percentile  of normal  may be re-immunized  with diphtheria  and 
tetanus  toxoid,  killed  polio vaccine,  hepatitis  B vaccine,  as well as the Haemophilus  influenzae  type 
B conjugate  vaccine.  Specific  antibody  production  to tetanus  and Hepatitis  B is then measured.  
 
Antigen -specific   T-cell  immune   reconstitution   will  be  performed   as  described   in  detail   under  
„correlative  studies‟. 
 
12.3 Engraftment  and chimerism  
 
Engraftment  will be documented  by analysis  of T cells and bone  marrow  cells for chimerism  by 
standard  cytogenetic  studies  at 1 month,  100 days,  6 months,  9 months  (if clinically  indicated),  and 
12 months,  18 months,  24 months  (if clinically  indicated)  post transplant  or as needed  thereafter.  T- 
cell chimerism  analysis  is not required  when  a patient‟s absolute  lymphocyte  count  is less than 0.5 
K/mcL.  
 
12.4 Graft  failure  or rejection  
 
Primary  non-engraftment  is diagnosed  when  the patient  fails to achieve  an ANC 500/ l at any time 
in the first 28 days post-transplant.  If the patient's  myeloma  recurs  during  this interval,  the patient  is 
scored  as having  refractory  myeloma.  In such  a situation,  the absence  of donor  hematopoiesis  is not 
evaluable  for graft failure  or rejection.  If host T-cells capable  of specifically  inhibiting  donor  
hematopoietic  progenitor  growth  in vitro are concurrently  detected  during  graft failure,  a presumptive  
diagnosis  of immune  mediated  rejection  is made.  If (1) after achievement  of an ANC 500/mm3, the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  35 of 46  
  
 
ANC declines  to <500/mm3 for more  than 3 consecutive  days in the absence  of relapse,  or, (2) there  
is absence  of donor  cells in the marrow  and/or  blood  as demonstrated  by chimerism  assay  in the 
absence  of relapse,  a diagnosis  of secondary  graft failure  is made.  If, however,  recurrence  of host 
myeloma  is detected  concurrently,  the patient  is not evaluable  for graft failure  or rejection.  
 
Patients  with evidence  of graft failure  without  evidence  of recurrence  of host myeloma  will have  
additional studies drawn to ascertain cause and define relevant histoincompatibilities. These 
analyses  may include  (1) Evaluation  of bone  marrow  aspirates  and biopsies  for residual  or recurrent  
myeloma,  when  indicated,  (2) Culture  and/or  molecular  analyses  of marrow  and blood  for viral 
pathogen s potentially causing graft failure including CMV, HHV6 and parvovirus B 19, (3) 
Immunophenotypic  and genetic  analysis  of circulating  T-cells and NK cells to ascertain  their origin  
and potential  function,  (4) Analysis  of the functional  activity  of residual  circulating  lymphocytes  to 
determine  whether  and to what degree  they exhibit  cytotoxic  or cyto-inhibitory  activity  against  donor  
host or third party  PHA-stimulated  blasts  or clonogenic  hematopoietic  progenitor  cells.  If donor - 
specific  reactivity  is identified,  attempts  will be made  to identify  targeted  specificities  (HLA  or minor  
alloantigens)  whenever  possible.  
 
Patients  who suffer  graft failure  will be considered  for a secondary  transplant.  The need   for 
additional  immunosuppression  or treatment  for viral infection  prior to the secondary  transplant  will be 
determined  by the results  obtained  from chimeric  and viral studies.  
12.5.     Graft -versus -host disease  
Standard  BMT-CTN and IBMTR  systems  clinical  criteria  as defined  by Rowlings,  et al68 will be used  
to establish  and grade  acute  GvHD.  
 
To determine  the severity  of acute  GvHD,  data will be collected  approximately  weekly  to 
characterize  the severity  of symptoms  and signs  caused  by GvHD  and to evaluate  possible  
confounding  factors.  Real time data collection  will include  descriptive  characteristics  of rash and 
estimated  body surface  area involved,  extent  of dermal/epidermal  separation,  identification  of 
concomitant  causes  of increased  bilirubin  other  than GvHD,  presence  or absence  of  nausea,  
vomiting  or anorexia  persistent  after engraftment,  peak  diarrhea  volume  with annotations  concerning  
the presence  after engraftment,  peak diarrhea  volume  with annotations  concerning  the presence  or 
absence  of urinary  mixing  and estimates  of true diarrhea  volume,  presence  or absence  of abdominal  
cramps,  presence  or absence  of frank  stool blood  or melena,  concomitant  causes  of GI symptoms  
other  than GvHD,  biopsy  results,  identification  of any agents  used  for treatment  and autopsy  results.  
 
Patients  will be observed  for acute  and/or  chronic  GvHD.  Graft -versus -host disease  occurring  after 
DLI infusions  will be analyzed  separately.  
 
Patients  with moderate  to severe  acute  GvHD  (grade  II-IV) will be treated  in standard  fashion  with 
high-dose  I.V. methylprednisolone  (1-2mg/kg/day)  or in combination  with other  immunosuppressants  
as per ongoing  trials on GvHD.  Patients  failing  to respond  to steroids  will be  considered   for 
treatment  with experimental  treatments  available  at the time of diagnosis  of GvHD.  
 
 
Chronic  GvHD  will be diagnosed  and graded  according  to the criteria  of Sullivan69 treated  with 
standard  or experimental  immunosuppressive  therapy.  Treatment  will consist  of corticosteroids,

Page  36 of 46  
  
 
cyclosporin  A or azathioprine,  or combinations  of these  agents.  Other  novel  treatments  could  be 
used  if available,  i.e. thalidomide  and psoralen/ultraviolet  A phototherapy  (PUVA).  
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
If at any time the patient  is found  to be ineligible  for the protocol  as designated  in the section  on 
Criteria  for patient/subject  eligibility  (e.g. a change  in diagnosis),  the patient  will be removed  from the 
study.  Also patients  may be removed  from the study  if requested  by the patient.  Management  will 
depend  on where  they are in their treatment  course.  Such  patients  will receive  appropriate   
supportive  care.  The PI may also remove  patients  from the study  for noncompliance.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This is a phase  2 study  designed  to examine  the efficacy  and safety  of chemotherapy  followed  by T- 
cell depleted  transplant  and donor  leukocyte  infusions  for patients  with relapsed  or high-risk multiple  
myeloma.  The primary  objective  is to assess  the overall  and progression  free survival  from the time 
of transplant  in the relapsed  and high-risk groups.  A maximum  of 30 patients  will be accrued  into 
each  group.  The primary  endpoint  of the study  is one-year progression -free survival  from the time of 
transplant.  An event  is defined  as a disease  progression  or death.  The accrual  period  will be 
approximately  three  years  with an additional  24 month  follow  up after the accrual  has been  
completed.  
For the relapsed  multiple  myeloma  cohort,  a single  stage  design  that differentiates  between  one - 
year PFS rates  of 0.30 and 0.54 will be used  to assess  treatment  efficacy.  At the conclusion  of the 
study,  if at least 13/30  patients  were  recorded  progression -free at 1 year,  then the treatment  will be 
declared  a success.  The probability  of declaring  the treatment  a success  is  0.10 when  the one- 
year PFS in the population  is 0.30 and increases  to  0.90 when  the one-year progression -free 
survival  is 0.54.  
 
Recent  data at MSKCC  suggests  that the addition  of immune  gammaglobulin  (IVIG)  added  to the 
incubation  fluid at a concentration  of 1.5 mg IVIG/ml  during  incubation  of the antiCD34  beads  with 
the mobilized  PBSC  results  in a reduction  in the rate of grade  2-4 acute  graft versus  host disease  
(GVHD).   A total of 17 out of the 30 patients  in the relapsed  cohort  were  treated  without  the IVIG 
addition.  
Since  DLI and the lack of IVIG may both increase  a patient‟s risk of GVHD,  it is imperative  to 
understand  the risk that is attributable  to the TCD+DLI  treatment  strategy  and not the change  in 
CD34+  preparation.  Therefore  this cohort  will be expanded  so that the outcomes  can be evaluated  
on patients  who all receive  the IVIG addition.  The outcomes  for the N=17  cohort  who did not receive  
IVIG will be reported  separately.  The stopping  rules below  have  been  extended  to the 47 patients  
enrolled  in the relapsed  arm. 
 
For the high-risk multiple  myeloma  cohort,  a single  stage  design  that differentiates  between  one- 
year PFS rates  of 0.45 and 0.69 will be used  to assess  treatment  efficacy.  At the conclusion  of the 
study,  if at least 18/30  patients  were  recorded  progression -free at 1 year,  then the treatment  will be 
declared  a success.  The probability  of declaring  the treatment  a success is  0.10 when  the one - 
year PFS in the population  is 0.45 and increases  to 0.89  when   the  one-year  progression -free 
survival  is 0.69.

In order  to reduce  patient  risk, the study  design  includes  early termination  in the event  of excessive  
graft failure,  graft versus  host disease,  or early treatment  related  mortality  during  the accrual  period.  
Stopping  rules for excessive  failure  and the corresponding  power  calculations  are applied  to each  
patient  cohort  separately.  The stopping  rules are provided  in the tables  below  and consider  only the 
univariate  failure  probabilities.

At the conclusion  of the study,  Kaplan -Meier  estimates  of overall  and progression -free survival  will 
be computed  over time.  In addition,  the probability  of treatment  related  mortality  and acute  and 
chronic  graft-versus -host disease  will be calculated  using  the cumulative  incidence  function.  
 
Correlative  studies  are undertaken  to explore  the role of four CT antigens  (CT7,  CT10,  MAGE -A3, 
and NY-ESO -1) for disease  progression.  The antigen  expression,  evaluated  by quantitative  PCR,  
will be recorded  at baseline  and multiple  time points  post-baseline  (section  10) and a time- 
dependent  Cox model  will be used  to assess  the association  of each  antigen  with progression  free 
survival.  
 
Finally,  to account  for patients  that relapse  and are put back into remission  through  DLI, the current  
myeloma  free survival  curve  will be computed.  This curve  estimates  the probability  a patient  is alive 
in an original  remission  or in subsequent  remission  after treatment  with DLI at a given  time after 
transplant.70

Study  staff are responsible  for ensuring  that all institutional  requirements  necessary  to enroll  
a participant  to the study  have  been  completed.  See related  Clinical  Research  Policy  and 
Procedure  #401  (Protocol  Participant  Registration).  
15.3 Randomization  
 
This research  study  does not require  a randomization.  
 
16.1 DAT A M ANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A research  study  assistant  (RSA)  will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the RSA  will 
include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  
monitoring,  problem  and problem  resolutions,  and coordination  of the activities  of the protocol  study  
team.  
 
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database.  Source  documentation  will 
be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
 
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  problems  will be brought  to the attention  of the 
study  team  for discussion  and action.  
 
Full sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  team,  at a 
minimum  of two times  per year,  and more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plans  (DSM)  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  cancer  Center  were  
approved  by the National  Cancer  Institute  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  
set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and 
Safety  Monitoring  of Clinical  Trials”  which  can be found  at: 
Http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/r  esearchers/dsm/index.html . The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical  Research.  The MSKCC  Data and Safety  
Monitoring  Plans  can be found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  at: http://mskweb2.mskcc.org/irb/index.htm . 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  trials are monitored  for data,  safety  and 
quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  monitoring,  
compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff education  on clinical  
research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two institutional  
committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.   The 
committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the 
Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials,  report  to the Center‟s 
Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.

During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each protocol  will be assessed  for its level of 
risk and degree  of monitoring  required.   Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  
sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  and the monitoring  
procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.  
17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
Consent  Process:  Participation  in this study  is  voluntary.  All patients  will be required  to sign a 
statement  of informed  consent  which  must  conform  to MSKCC  IRB guidelines  and explain  the risks 
and potential  benefits  of the transplant  procedure.  
 
Alternatives:  Enrollment  in this study  is voluntary.  Alternative  treatment  options  will be presented  to 
the patient  prior to taking  part in this study.  Alternative  treatment  options  may include  getting  a 
transplant  from a volunteer  unrelated  donor,  if one is available;  getting  treatment  for the cancer  with 
either  chemotherapy  or a transplant  without  being  on a study;  taking  part in another  study;  or getting  
no treatment.  
 
Costs:  The patient‟s health  plan/insurance  company  will need  to pay for all of the costs  of treatment  
in this study.  The patient  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care,  all 
hospitalizations  and any transplant  complications.  Pre-authorization  for the transplant  will be cleared  
with the health  plan/insurance  company  prior to admission.  Patients  will not be paid for taking  part in 
this study.  Research  tests will be done  at no cost to the patient.  
Confidentiality:  Every  effort  will be made  to maintain  patient  confidentiality.  Research  and hospital  
records  are confidential.  
17.2 Privacy  
 
MSKCC‟s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  pursuant  
to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of protected  health  
information  will be limited  to the individuals  described  in the Research  Authorization  form.  A 
Research  Authorization  form must  be completed  by the Principal  Investigator  and approved  by the 
IRB and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
17.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
 
Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part of transplant  therapy.  Grade  4 toxicities  will be 
recorded  and reported  as part of the analysis  of study  outcome.  In addition,  the reportable  serious  
adverse  events  (SAEs)  will be defined  according  to current  MSKCC  BMT program  guidelines  which  
is included  as an appendix.  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 10 -051 A(13)  
Approval date: 14 -May-2018  
Page  41 of 46  
  
 
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or subject  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  signs  consent.   SAE reporting  is 
required  for 30-days after the participant ‟s last investigati onal treatment  or intervention.  Any 
events  that occur  after the 30-day period  and that are at least possibly  related  to protocol  
treatment  must  be reported.  
 
If an SAE requires  submission  to the IRB office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 „Reporting  of Serious  
Adverse  Events‟, the SAE report  must  be sent to the IRB within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
The IRB requires  a Clinical  Research  Database  (CRDB)  SAE report  be submitted  
electronically  to the SAE Office  as follows:  
 
For IND/IDE  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other  reports  should  be sent to saemskind@mskcc.org . 
 
For all other  trials:  Reports  that include  a Grade  5 SAE should  be sent to  
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other  reports  should  be sent to sae@mskcc.org . 
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:  
Fields  populated  from CRDB:  
• Subject‟s initials  
• Medical  record  number  
• Disease/histology  (if applicable)  
• Protocol  number  and title 
Data needing  to be entered:

o Indication  if the subject  remains  on the study  
• If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol  and/or  consent  form 
• If the SAE is an Unanticipated  Problem  
The PI‟s signature  and the date it was signed  are required  on the completed  report.  
For IND/IDE  protocols:  
The CRDB  SAE report  should  be completed  as per above  instructions.   If appropriate,  the 
report  will be forwarded  to the FDA by the SAE staff through  the IND Office  
 
 
17.2.1  
 
This protocol  has an IND therefore,  the SAE will also be reported  to the FDA through  the IND Office  
and the report  will include  the FDA assigned  IND number  and name.  
 
 
18.1 INFORMED  CONSENT  PROCEDURES  
 
Before  protocol -specified  procedures  are carried  out, consenting  professionals  will explain   
full details  of the protocol  and study  procedures  as well as the risks involved  to participants  
prior to their inclusion  in the study.  Participants  will also be informed  that they are free to 
withdraw  from the study  at any time.  All participants  must  sign an IRB/PB -approved  consent  
form indicating  their consent  to participate.  This consent  form meets  the requirements  of the 
Code  of Federal  Regulations  and the Institutional  Review  Board/Privacy  Board  of this Center.  
The consent  form will include  the following:  
 
1. The nature  and objectives,  potential  risks and benefits  of the intended  study.  
2. The length  of study  and the likely  follow -up required.  
3. Alternatives  to the proposed  study.  (This  will include  available  standard  and 
investigational  therapies.  In addition,  patients  will be offered  an option  of supportive  
care for therapeutic  studies.)  
4. The name  of the investigator(s)  responsible  for the protocol.  
5. The right of the participant  to accept  or refuse  study  interventions/interactions  and to 
withdraw  from participation  at any time.  
 
Before  any protocol -specific  procedures  can be carried  out, the consenting  professional  will 
fully explain  the aspects  of patient  privacy  concerning  research  specific  information.   In 
addition  to signing  the IRB Informed  Consent,  all patients  must  agree  to the Research  
Authorization  component  of the informed  consent  form.  
 
Each  participant  and consenting  professional  will sign the consent  form.  The participant  must

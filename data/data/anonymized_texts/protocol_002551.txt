2.0 INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW 
2.1 Introduction 
Rhinitis is a condition of the nasal cavity in which the membrane lining the nasal cavity becomes 
irritated and swollen.  Patients typically present with complaints of runny nose, itchy or watery eyes, sneezing, irritated throat and postnasal dischar ge.  Rhinitis may be caused by allergens (such 
as pollen, pet dander, mold or dust), or by othe r triggers (including chemicals, irritants, and 
medications).
1   
 Chronic rhinitis may significantly impact a patie nt’s quality of life by causing fatigue, headache, 
and sleep disturbance, resulting in cognitive impa irment and diminished productivity and thereby 
posing both a personal and financial burden.
2  
 
2.2 Nasal Anatomy 
The nose is a respiratory organ that performs a prominent airflow regulatory role.  Air enters the nasal cavity, where it is warmed to a temperature of approximately 31°C to 34°C, regardless of the outside temperature.  The nose also humidifies th e inspired air to a relative humidity of 90% to 
95%
3.  These functions prevent drying of the distal airways, which allows optimal gas exchange, 
and helps maintain healthy body temperature.  In addition to these heating and humidification roles, 
the nose serves to protect the airway by filtering inhaled particulates.4  
 The nasal cavity is covered with an epithelial lining made of cells which interact to serve 
appropriate functions in the nasal environment.  Cells located in the epithelial lining include ciliated 
cells, goblet cells and seromucous glands.  The serous cell contributes to the seromucous glands 
that moisten membranes, the ciliated cells produce the fine hairs that move foreign substances out 
of the airway and the goblet cell produces a carbohydrate called mucin which attracts water and forms a gelatin-like substance better known as mucus.
5,6    
 
The goblet cell is the most prominent mucus producing cell in the nasal membrane and together 
with the seromucous glands, works to provide the mucus fluid on the nasal surface.  The purpose of 
mucus is to protect the body from substances that can enter through the nasal cavity.  Secretion is 
stimulated by dust or foreign substances that enter th e nasal passage.  As a natural defense it is then 
cleared by movement of the cilia and disposed to the stomach.6   
 
Regulation of the seromucous glands and blood supply occurs through parasympathetic and 
adrenergic stimulation via the vidian nerve, pos terior nasal nerves and other nerves.  In some 
situations, the mucosa may become hyperresponsive to stimuli, and produce excess mucus, 
resulting in rhinorrhea or postnasal discharge.

3.0 RHINITIS DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT 
3.1 Diagnosis  
Patients presenting with r unny or congested nose, watery eyes, irritated throat and/or sneezing 
symptoms are evaluated to understand the types of triggers that may prompt the symptoms 
experienced.  By having patients complete a qua lity of life and symptom questionnaire during the 
history and physical exam, the practitioner will be tter understand the duration, course and suspected 
cause of symptoms.  This questionnaire typically asks patients to describe certain environmental 
factors that may trigger the allergy symptoms.  Re spiratory irritants may help differentiate if the 
symptoms relate to allergic or non-allergic responses.2,7,8  One algorithm for evaluating rhinitis 
patients is presented in Figure 1.1

3.1.1 Transnasal Endoscopy  
Physicians observe the nasal structures by transnasal endoscopy to rule out anatomic 
conditions mimicking rhinitis.  A small scope w ith a camera attached is inserted into each 
nostril to observe the nasal cavity.  Common an atomical obstructions that may cause rhinitis-
like symptoms are nasal polyps, deviated septu m, foreign bodies, nasal tumors and turbinate 
hypertropy.1,2  Treatment of these anatomical causes, if present, may relieve rhinitis 
symptoms.  3.1.2 Allergy Testing  
The most common methods to determine allergy sensitivity are percutaneous skin testing and 
the allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody testing.  These tests can identify 
allergens the patient should avoid.  However, if an allergic cause is eliminated through this 
testing, a diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis could be made.
1,2 
 
3.2 Treatment  
3.2.1 Medical Treatment  
Nasal irrigation (nasal lavage) may reduce symptoms if done multiple times a day with a 
saline rinse. Allergic rhinitis patients usually find relief with use of over-the-counter oral or nasal antihistamines and/or corticosteroid sp rays and may only require administration at 
specific times of the year.
2  Allergen immunotherapy may also be effective in treating allergic 
rhinitis. 
 
Patients with nonallergic rhinitis are less likely to respond to oral antihistamines, but may 
find their symptoms relieved with intranasal an tihistamine, corticosteroid or anticholinergic 
sprays.   
 
Patients whose symptoms are not adequately relieved with conservative treatment usually 
seek further management to alleviate symptoms and may be candidates for nasal surgery.  
3.2.2 Surgical Treatment – Neurectomy  
Vidian neurectomy is a surgical option to relie ve nasal symptoms as the vidian nerve supplies 
autonomic input to nasal mucosa (as well as the palate and the lacrimal gland).  While this 
surgery has been performed for over 50 years, it is known to be highly controversial since 
access to the nerve proves to be technically difficult and complications with numerous surrounding important structures can occur.
9,10  Common procedural side effects include dry 
eyes, nasal dryness or crusting and mild pain , whereas more significant risks may include 
hemorrhage, vision loss and palate/lip/cheek  numbness. In addition, improvement in 
symptoms is often unpredictable. 9  
 An alternative neurectomy target is the posterior nasal nerve (PNN).  The advantage of the PNN over the vidian nerve is its more limited innervation (it primarily stimulates the nasal 
mucosa) and its physical distance from other major nerve structures.  As a result,

 complications associated with PNN surgery are less significant and occur less frequently than 
those described for vidian nerve neurectomy,9 while still providing significant improvement 
in quality of life.11   
 
A recent publication describes the use of a cryosurg ical probe to ablate posterior nasal nerve 
tissue.12  This article details the long-term (1 yea r) results of treatment in a population of 27 
chronic rhinitis patients, of which 48% had alle rgic rhinitis.  Significant improvement in total 
nasal symptom score was seen between baseline score and each follow-up visit.  Post-
procedure adverse events resolved or improved by the 30-day follow-up visit.  Overall, 74% 
of subjects had symptom improvement  by 6 months post-procedure.

4.0 CURRENT USE OF RADIOFREQUENCY ENERGY IN THE NOSE  
Radiofrequency (RF) energy has been used for decades in the fields of otorhinolaryngology, neurosurgery, 
cardiology, urology and general surgery.  
 
ENT surgeons currently use radiofrequency energy da ily in numerous nasal therapies.  Radiofrequency 
turbinate reduction (RFTR), for instance, is a minima lly invasive surgical option that can reduce tissue 
volume in a precise, targeted manner.  This technique uses radiofrequency energy to create heat within the 
submucosal tissue of the turbinate, reducing tissue volume with minimal impact on surrounding tissues.13  
Radiofrequency turbinate reduction differs fundamenta lly from traditional surgical methods by using low-
power radiofrequency energy to provide a relatively quick and painless procedur e for tissue coagulation 
and/or ablation.  
 There have been multiple studies analyzing the safety and outcomes of using radiofrequency energy in the 
RFTR procedure.  In 2009, Hytonen, et al.
14 completed a systematic literature review of the RFTR 
technique and concluded that the techni que is well tolerated and effective. 
 
Numerous studies have demonstrated that radiofrequ ency tissue therapy in th e nasal passage can be safe 
and effective in improving nasal obstruction and in preserving nasal function15.  Kezirian et al.16 reported 
1 minor complication of crusting in 89 adult patie nts treated with radiofrequency ablation of the 
turbinates.  The same authors also reported no mode rate or major complications after RFTR based on a 
review of published literature results.

5.0 STUDY RATIONALE 
Aerin Medical previously conduc ted a small feasibility study (TP220) using the Aerin Medical 
radiofrequency system to treat subjects with chroni c rhinitis.  The InSeca Stylus was used to apply 
radiofrequency energy to the inferior turbinate.  At 6-months postprocedure, 73% of subjects showed 
improvement in their Sino-Nasal Outcomes (SNOT-22) score.  There were no device-related or procedure-related serious adverse events.    The current study is intended to further evaluate the use of the InSeca Stylus for treating rhinitis by 
targeting treatment to the portion of the inferior turbinate mucosa overlying the region of the posterior nasal nerve.

6.0 SUMMARY DEVICE DESCRIPTION 
The Aerin Medical InSeca ARC System (Figure 2) includes two FDA-cleared products: the InSeca ARC 
Stylus (Figure 3), which is a disposable handheld device capable of delivering bipolar radiofrequency 
energy to tissue, and the Aerin Medical Console (F igure 4), a temperature-controlled generator that 
delivers low doses of radiofrequency energy to the Styl us.  The Stylus is attached to the Aerin Medical 
Console via a flexible cable.  The Stylus has received FDA clearance for “the coagulation of soft tissue in 
the nasal airway, to treat nasal airway obstr uction by shrinking submucosal tissue.”   
 The InSeca ARC Stylus consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip.  The tip (Figure 5) comprises two 
rows of electrodes placed on either side of a non-con ductive mold.  A probe located in the center of the 
tip between the two electrode rows contains a thermo couple that constantly measures the temperature of 
the tissue, providing feedback to the generator and allowing the generator to automatically adjust energy 
delivery as necessary.  The stylus tip is temporarily in serted into the nose to deliver low-power RF energy 
to the treatment area.  It generates heat within th e submucosal tissue and creates a coagulation lesion. The 
stylus may be used to treat multiple locations in one or both nostrils of a single patient.  If the straight 
InSeca ARC Stylus cannot access the target treatment area,  the Stylus may be bent using the Oratec Probe 
Bender (Figure 6).  The Stylus should only be manipul ated in the bender one time and should not be bent 
more than 20 degrees.

 7.0 STUDY DESIGN AND ENROLLMENT 
7.1 Study Design and Objectives 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, nonr andomized, nonsignificant risk (NSR) study of the 
Aerin Medical InSeca ARC Stylus.  The primary objective of this study is to evaluate treatment 
outcomes when the InSeca ARC System is used to treat the posterior nasal nerve area of the nasal passageway to improve symptoms in adults diagnosed with chronic rhinitis . 
 
The design encompasses a 2-phase enro llment.  Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled in the first phase.  
Further enrollment will be suspended until a ll initial subjects have completed their 4-week 
evaluation.  Information from these patients will be  used to assure the safet y of the procedure as 
well as the adequacy of treatment settings and treatment locations. 
 
7.2 Subject Population 
The population being targeted for this therapy consis ts of patients who have exhibited symptoms of 
chronic rhinitis for at least six months.  To evaluate the severity of a patient’s rhinitis symptoms 
both before and after the procedure, this stud y will use the 4-item Total Nasal Symptom Scale 
(TNSS).  The maximum TNSS score is 12 and indicates the most severe symptoms.  Aerin Medical has chosen a baseline 12-hour reflective TNSS (a 12- hour rTNSS) score of at least 6 for inclusion 
in the study, with the additional requirements that th e subject have at least moderate (score of 2) 
rhinorrhea symptoms and at least mild (score of 1) congestion.    
 Patients who have anatomic obstructions that may li mit access to the target treatment area or have 
altered posterior nasal anatomy due to prior surger y or injury are excluded from participation.

8.0 STUDY PHASES 
The study will be conducted in four phases as subjects ar e consented, evaluated for eligibility, treated and 
followed until study exit:  
 
Phase 1 - Pre-Screen / Informed Consent Process Phase 2 - Screening / Baseline Evaluation Phase 3 - Enrollment / Study Procedure  
Phase 4 - Follow-up / Study Exit 
 
 
 The different study phases are described in Sections 8.1 through 8.4.  Section 8.5 provides a table of 
required study visits, the visit windows, and the assessments to be done at each visit, as well as a 
description of each assessment type.   
 
8.1 Phase 1:  Pre-Screen and Informed Consent Process 
Patients presenting with symptoms associated with rhinitis will be approached with the study and 
asked if they are willing to volunteer participation.  Patients will initially be  asked about duration of 
symptoms and conservative measures used for th eir condition.  Any known concomitant nasal 
conditions and past nasal surgeries or injuries w ill be discussed to understand if they are potential 
candidates for the study.   
Informed Consent 
Informed consent will be obtained as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Good Clinical Practice 
E6(R2): Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) (March 2018).  
 
A research study member at the approved study s ite will speak with the study candidate about the 
purpose of the study.  Explanation of the study background, study procedure (including risks and benefits), and follow up visit schedule will be reviewed in detail with the patient.  Patients will be given the time they need to read  through the study information and informed consent document and 
ask as many questions as necessary to make them comfortable with the study and the requirements.  For those potential candidates who agree to partic ipate in the study by signing the IRB-approved 
Informed Consent Form (ICF), a baseline evaluation will be conducted.    
8.2 Phase 2:  Screening and Baseline Evaluation 
During the screening/baseline visit in the study clinic , the Investigator or designated research staff 
will perform a formal evaluation of the study candidate for study eligibility, which will include a

 history and physical examination of the nasal area, review of overall medical history, understanding 
of general health and discussion of any conservative measures used for rhinitis.   
 
The following data will be collected:  
• Patient demographics 
• Medical history including prior tests and treatments for rhinitis 
• Current medications and conditions  for which they are prescribed 
• Physical exam and vital signs 
• Reflective TNSS questionnaire (symptom sever ity over the preceding 12 hours as reported 
by the subject) 
• Investigator visual assessment (using an endoscope) of the target treatment area (posterior nasal nerve area) and any anatomy that might hamper necessary device access 
 
Subjects who agree to participate and meet the en rollment criteria must be scheduled to undergo the 
study procedure within 4 weeks  of the baseline visit.   
8.3 Phase 3:  Enrollment and Study Procedure 
Study subjects will be considered enrolled once they arrive at the study clinic to undergo the procedure.  At this time a study subject identif ication number will be assigned along with the study 
subject binder.  The procedure will be performed  in the study clinic.  Subjects will have all 
treatments in a single study procedure session.  
The area to be treated is the portion of the nasal 
cavity mucosa overlying the region of the po sterior nasal nerve (t he posterior middle 
meatus and posterior inferior meatus).  Both nostrils  will be treated at 1, 2 or 3 non-overlapping 
positions (depending on the size of the subject’s target treatment area).       Treatment settings to be used are: 
Temperature ................ 60 °C 
Power ...................... 4 Watts 
Treatment Time ....... 12 secs Cooling Time ............. 0 secs 
 
No repeat ("touch-up") procedures will be pe rmitted during the 52-week follow-up period.   
 
 
NOTE: Device Malfunction or Failure 
If any component of the InSeca System is associated with a malfunction or failure during a study procedure, the sponsor should be contacted immediately for instructions.

Immediate Post-Procedure Care (prior to leaving the clinic) 
Subjects will be asked to mark a vertical line on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS) to represent the 
pain level experienced during the study procedure session.  The score will include the overall pain 
experience from anesthesia delivery to procedure completion.  
 Recommended post-procedure care includes: 
• The physician may apply Aquaphor
® or similar ointment to the treatment area post therapy.   
• The patient should be instructed to: o Avoid manipulation of the treatment site for 24 hours unless necessary for hemostasis. 
o Use over-the-counter saline nasal sprays as appropriate. 
o Avoid forceful nose blowing. If patient needs to blow nose, they should do so gently.    
 
Study subjects should be reminded of their next follow-up visit prior to leaving the clinic.    
8.4 Phase 4:  Follow-Up and Study Exit 
The follow-up period begins after the study pro cedure session.  Subjects will undergo follow-up 
visits at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks,  calculated from the study procedure 
date.  Visits should be scheduled within the vis it windows specified in Table 1.  Requirements for 
each follow-up visit are described in Section 8.5 and shown in Table 1. 
 
Subjects meeting the study requirements as planne d will be exited from the study at the 52-week 
follow up visit.  If a subject reaches the 52-w eek follow-up visit and is experiencing a new or 
ongoing adverse event, the study sponsor should be contacted to discuss the need and/or methods 
for continued surveillance of the event.  
8.5 Types of Assessments 
The following assessments will be obtained from the study subjects at the specified study follow-up 
visits:  
 
Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) – The TNSS is an instrument used to collect patient self-
rated severity of four nasal symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing.  
The FDA cites this as a preferred measure of efficacy in trials of drug treatments for allergic 
rhinitis17 and nonallergic rhinitis18.   The TNSS requires the subject to rate four nasal symptoms 
(rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, nasal itching and sneezing) on the following 4-point scale: 
• 0 = absent symptoms (no sign/symptom is evident) 
• 1 = mild symptom (sign/symptom present, but minimal awareness; easily tolerated)  
• 2 = moderate symptoms (definite awareness of sign/symptom that is bothersome but 
tolerable) 
• 3 = severe symptoms (sign/symptoms that is hard to tolerate; causes interference with 
activities of daily living and/or sleeping) 
 For the purposes of this study, the subject will be  asked to evaluate symptom severity over the 
preceding 12 hours.

 Visual Assessment of Treatment Area – The ta rget posterior nasal nerve area within each 
nostril will be visually assessed at baseline and following the treatment procedure at the time 
points described in Table 1.  The use of an e ndoscope for visual assessment is required.  For 
consistency in reporting across sites, a stud y CRF will outline specific observations to be 
assessed.   
 Video should be captured and archived during th e endoscopic evaluation.  These videos will 
allow for future evaluation or comparison, if  necessary.  If video capture is unavailable, 
representative still photographs may be collected instead. 
 
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Pain Intensity
19 – The Pain VAS will be used to rate pain 
associated with the treatment (i.e., in the treat ment area) immediately following the procedure 
and at each follow-up visit through 12 weeks.  S ubjects will be asked to mark their pain level 
on a 10-cm line anchored by verbal descriptors : 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain imaginable.  
The study staff will measure with a metric ruler from the 0, the beginning of the line, to the 
vertical mark made by the subject.  The r esult, expressed in millimeters, will represent the 
subject’s VAS Pain Score.   
 Study-Specific Quality of Life (QOL) Questionna ire – The QOL questionnaire will be used to 
gain understanding of the impact of chronic rhin itis on the subject’s daily activities, feelings, 
symptoms and medication use.  The QOL will be completed by the subject both prior to the treatment procedure, and at the 12-week, 26-week and 52-week follow-up visits.   
 Subject Satisfaction Survey – The Satisfaction Survey will be used to assess patient acceptance 
of the treatment procedure and results.  Subject s will be asked to complete the Satisfaction 
Survey at the 12-week and 52-week follow-up visits. 
 
Adverse Event Evaluation – Subjects will be ask ed about possible side effects or adverse 
experiences related to the study procedure.  All events will be documented on the Adverse 
Event Log and Adverse Event Case Report Form.  Anticipated observations related to the study 
procedure will be tabulated but will not be cate gorized as adverse even ts unless they require 
mitigation by the treating physician or are great er in severity, duration or degree of incidence 
than anticipated.  Refer to Table 2 for a listing of anticipated observations as well as anticipated 
frequency, severity and duration.  Medications  – Updates to current medications and any new or changed medications will be 
requested at each follow-up visit.  The medication log will be updated to reflect any changes.  In addition, any medications required as a result of intervention related to the study procedure 
will be documented and corre lated with the Adverse Event Case Report Form.    
 
Table 1 outlines the assessments to be performed at  each required visit and specifies the required 
visit windows.

9.0 SUBJECT REIMBURSEMENT 
Subjects may be reimbursed for their time and travel a nd any expenses associated with each study visit, as 
allowed by study site policies.  Subjects will not be reimbursed for those scheduled study visits that they 
do not attend.   
  10.0 STUDY WITHDRAWAL 
Subjects may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons: 
• Voluntary withdrawal – meaning that the subject voluntarily chooses not to further participate in 
the study 
• *Lost to follow-up – meaning that the subject is more than one month late (beyond the late visit 
window) to a study visit and 3 documented attemp ts to contact the subject are unsuccessful.  A 
subject who misses a study visit but attends a subsequent visit will no longer be  considered lost to 
follow-up. 
• *In the physician’s opinion, it is not in the best interest of the subject to continue study participation. 
• Subject death.    
*Where possible, subjects will be followed for safety to study completion.  Safety follow-up will include a review of adverse events (AEs).  A safety follow-up assessment may be performed either via a phone or email contact or a physician visit.   
 
Any study subject who does not attend a scheduled follow-up visit should be contacted by site personnel to determine the reason for the missed appointment (s).  The reason for the missed visit should be 
determined and documented in the subject’s study records.  All subjects enrolled (including those 
withdrawn or lost to follow-up) shall be accounted for with appropriate documentation. 
 
 
11.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatme nt phase or during the follow-up phase.  Adverse 
events occurring after the baseline ass essment but before the treatment procedure will be documented in 
the subject’s medical record but will not count as related to the study device or procedure.   
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corr esponding subject’s CRF.  Each adverse event will be 
judged by the Investigator as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the study device and/or study procedure.  In addition, the Investigator will identif y the date of onset, severity and duration of the AE.  
All adverse events will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained.  If a subject reaches 
the 52-week follow-up visit and is experiencing a new or ongoing adverse event, the study sponsor should 
be contacted to discuss the need and/or methods for continued surveillance of the event. 
The Investigator must submit to the Sponsor a report of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Serious 
Adverse Device Effect (SADE) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.

In addition, the Investigator will report adverse events to the reviewing IRB / EC (as applicable)  
according to the local reporting requirements.   12.0 RISK – BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 
12.1 Potential Risks 
Potential risks associated with the use of the InSeca ARC System do not differ from those of the commonly used devices and procedures to treat chr onic rhinitis discussed previously, but due to the 
non-surgical nature of the therap y, small treatment area, low-power  delivery and lack of need for 
general anesthesia, the overall risk to the patie nt may be less than from other procedures such as 
vidian neurectomy, septoplasty and/or functional rhinoplasty.   
 
Potential risks associated with th e use of the InSeca System and/or  the associated local anesthetics 
are outlined below.  Subjects will be monitored closel y as part of this study to allow for detection of 
symptoms, should they be present.  This, in turn, s hould allow for early treatment or intervention, if 
necessary.  
 
The following are adverse events or side effect s that may occur as a result of the treatment:  
• Infection 
• Bleeding (other than intra-treatment at treatme nt sites and greater than anticipated by the 
investigator) 
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
• Sensory changes at treatment site  
• Dry eye 
• External swelling of nose 
• Vasovagal response secondary to the procedure 
• Change in external shap e or appearance of nose 
 
The following two tables list anticipated observations  that are expected in  and around the treatment 
area.  Table 2 provides the incidence (reported as  percentage of treated nostrils) observed in 
Clinical Study TP258, the nasal valve pivotal study.  Table 3 provides the incidence observed in Clinical Study TP220, the rhinitis feasibility study.  Anticipated observations will be assessed and recorded at study visits if they occur but, being anticipated as a result of the procedure, will not be 
considered adverse events unless they require mitigation by the treating physician or are greater in severity, duration or degree of incidence than antic ipated.  If one of these types of observations is 
deemed to be an adverse event, it should be recorded on the study Adverse Event CRF.

 12.2 Potential Benefit 
Potential benefit, associated with the use of th e InSeca System, is to offer a safe, minimally 
invasive treatment method to alleviate the symptoms of chronic rhinitis.   
 
12.3 Minimization of Anticipated Risks 
Risks associated with the InSeca ARC System are mi nimized by design.  In addition, risks will be 
minimized through the use of an Investigator with a high degree of experience in nasal surgical and 
minimally invasive procedures.  The Investigator will receive sponsor-led training in proper use of 
the device prior to study initiation and as warranted throughout the study.  The sponsor will monitor 
the study for any trends that would indicate a safety issue.    
12.4 Potential Risks to Patient Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to study-
related activities beyond those of routine clini cal care.  This risk will be minimized by not 
collecting personally identifying information on Ca se Report Forms (CRFs) or other study-related 
documentation to be provided to the study sponsor.

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
13.1 Study Design 
This study is a prospective, multicenter, nonr andomized, nonsignificant risk (NSR) study of the 
Aerin Medical InSeca ARC Stylus when used to treat tissue in the posterior nasal nerve area to improve symptoms in those diagnosed with chr onic rhinitis.  Each subject serves as their own 
control for comparing baseline condition with postintervention condition.  The design encompasses a 2-phase enro llment.  Up to 10 subjects will be enrolled in the first phase.  
Further enrollment will be suspended until a ll initial subjects have completed their 4-week 
evaluation.  Information from these patients will be  used to assure the safet y of the procedure as 
well as the adequacy of treatment settings and treat ment locations.  The standard deviation of the 
change in TNSS score will be used to gauge the appropriateness of the assumption of standard deviation used for study sample size estimation.   
 
13.2 Study Hypothesis 
The primary endpoint of the study is change in mean rTNSS score from baseline to the 12-week 
evaluation.  Improvement in the rTNSS score is represented by a decrease from baseline in the 12-point score.  The minimum clinically important di fference (MCID) for change in mean TNSS score 
derived from anchor-based methodologies has b een shown to be 0.23 - 0.28 units and by 
distribution-based methodology the MCID was 0.59 units.
20  A less rigorous expert panel-based 
estimate of the MCID was 30% of the maximum score of 12, which is 3.6 units.21  The evidence-
based thresholds for MCID have been recommended to supersede the panel-based method.22,23 An 
MCID of 1 unit, or 2 to 4 times the more rigorous ly derived MCIDs, was set for this study.   
 
The hypothesis is that the impr ovement (decrease) in rTNSS mean score, measured as change from 
baseline at 12 weeks (12 weeks - b aseline), exceeds the MCID (1 unit). 
 
13.3 Sample Size Estimate 
Sample size estimation was based on a paired t-test for change from baseline at 12 weeks using the following assumptions: 
• Significance level α = 0.05 (one-sided) 
• Power = 90% 
• MCID = 1-point decrease in mean change score = the minimum clinically important 
difference 
• µ
d = -2-point decrease in mean change score = the minimum expected observed 
difference 
• SD = 2 = the expected standard deviation of the observed mean difference • 10% dropout and nonevaluable. 
The minimum number of subjects to achieve 90% power is 36 (G-Power, paired t-test).

 The overall planned study sample size is 50 subjects.  Fifty subjects allows for the possibility that 
findings from the review of the phase-1 initial subj ects, with respect to the planned protocol 
treatment parameters, leads to significant protocol modifications to the procedure parameters for 
the remainder of the subjects.  Significant modifications would exclude the initial subjects from the 
primary endpoint analysis, but a sufficient number of subjects would remain for analysis of the 
primary study hypothesis.    The sample size estimate will be re-evaluated after the standard deviation of the mean change for the phase-1 initial subjects has been obtained.  If the observed standard deviation is larger than the 
assumed standard deviation, the sample size may be  recalculated to assure adequate study size to 
evaluate the study hypothesis.  This evaluation will not be an efficacy evaluation and will not be 
used to halt the study based on an early determination of success or to decrease the planned sample 
size.  
13.4 Definition of Populations 
Enrolled Population – all subjects enrolled in the study. 
 
Evaluable Population – all subjects that are enrolled in the study and have received the study 
procedure.  If a protocol revision is required af ter review of the initial subjects that substantially 
alters the treatment settings, a subgroup of the evaluable population will be defined to include only those subjects enrolled and treated under the revi sed protocol (revised protocol population).  
Results will be summarized for the evaluable popula tion, the initial protocol population, and the 
revised protocol population (used for primary endpoint analysis).  Safety Population – all subjects that  have received the study procedure 
 
13.5 Missing Data 
All efforts will be made to collect all data points in  this study.  The study hypothesis will be tested 
using all available data for the subjects in the evaluable patient population.  If the primary endpoint is not available for all such subjects, then sens itivity analysis will be performed to assess the 
potential effect of missing data on the study conclusion.  The sensitivity analysis will be performed by imputing all missing data points for the primary endpoint as no (0) improvement.  If the study conclusion is upheld using this type of worst-case scenario, no other analysis will be performed.  However, if the conclusion using imputed data is  different, a multiple imputation approach may be 
used to gain further insight to the results. 
 
13.6 Multicenter Study - Pooling 
All study data will be pooled across study sites to  facilitate hypothesis testing in accordance with 
the sample size estimation and power analysis (Secti on 13.3).  Pooling is generally justified because 
the study will be conducted such that: 1) the same  protocol will be used at each site; 2) site 
investigators and personnel will receive uniform training; and 3) central data management and 
monitoring will be consistent and a pplied with equal rigor at all sites.  Primary endpoint results, 
demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by site and evaluated for 
comparability among study sites.

 13.7 Subject Disposition 
A detailed description of subject disposition w ill be provided using a CONSORT diagram and 
summaries of subjects falling in various subgroups of interest, such as, enrolled but not treated, 
discontinued, deaths, and withdrawals.  Follow-up by visit will be presented, showing theoretical, 
expected, and actual follow-up visits. 
 
13.8 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be  summarized using frequencies and percentages 
for categorical factors and mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for 
continuous factors. 
 
13.9 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analysis 
The mean change in the rTNSS score from baseline to 12 weeks will be tested using a paired t-test for a significant decrease greater than the MCID under the one-sided null (H
0) and alternative (H A) 
hypotheses:  
H0: µd ≥ -1 
HA: µd < -1 
where µ d = the mean change of the paired differe nces of the 12-week score - the baseline 
score.  
A p-value for the test statistic ≤0.05 will indicate that the mean d ecrease is statistically significantly 
greater than 1 point.  The upper limit of the one-sided 95% confidence interval on the mean decrease will also be calculated.  
13.10 Other Efficacy Outcome Measures 
13.10.1  Responder Rate 
Subjects will be considered to have responded to treatment if they show a decrease of at least 
1 point in the rTNSS score at 12 weeks compar ed to baseline score.  An overall responder 
rate of at least 55% is expected for the study.  
13.10.2  rTNSS scores over time

Adverse Events 
Adverse Event (AE) – any untoward medical occurrence in a subject (ISO 14155).   
NOTE:  This definition does not imply that there is a relationship between the adverse event and the 
device under investigation. 
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – an adverse event that (ISO 14155): 
• led to a death, 
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject,  
• resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, 
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, 
• required hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalization, 
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to pr event permanent impairment to body structure or 
function, 
• led to fetal distress, fetal death, a congenital abnormality, or birth defect.  
 Adverse Device Effect (ADE) – any untoward and unintended response to a medical device (ISO 14155) 
NOTE: This includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the instructions for use or the deployment of the device.  This defin ition also includes any event that is a result of user 
error. 
 
Serious Adverse Device Effect (SADE) – an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of the 
consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event or that might have led to any of these consequences 
if suitable action had not been taken or intervention ha d not been made or if circumstances had been less 
opportune (ISO 14155). 
 
Anticipated Adverse Device Effect (AADE)  – an adverse device effect which by its nature, incidence, 
severity or outcome has been previo usly identified in the previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application   
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) – any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-
threatening problem or death caused by, or associated w ith, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was 
not previously identified in nature, severity, or de gree of incidence in the investigational plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects (21CFR812.3.s and ISO 14155). 
NOTE: The occurrence of a diagnostic or elective su rgical procedure for a pre-existing condition, 
unless the condition becomes more severe or increases in  frequency, would not be considered 
procedure or device-related.

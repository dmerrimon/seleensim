 1. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS FO R STUDY 204653  
Rationale  
Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a subset of enzymes that methylate 
arginine residues in various cellular proteins including splicing factors, transcription 
factors, and histone tails.  One of these PRMTs, PRMT5, is aberrantly upregulated in  
malignant cells compared to wild type, and overexpression of PRMT5 in vitro  is 
sufficient for fibroblast transformation.  Clinically, upregulation of PRMT5 confers poor 
prognosis in a number of tumor types including breast cancer and glioma.  In preclinic al 
models, PRMT5 inhibition has been associated with potential benefit in multiple human 
malignancies. The study drug, GSK3326595, is an inhibitor of PRMT5 that potently 
inhibits tumor growth in vitro  and in vivo  in animal models.  This first time in human  
(FTIH), open -label, dose escalation study will assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of GSK3326595 in subjects 
with advanced or recurrent solid tumors, as well as clinical activity in subjects w ith a 
subset of solid tumors and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma  (NHL) .  The study  will also assess 
a tablet formulation of GSK3326595, and clinical activity of GSK3326595 in 
combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with a subset of solid tumors .

 Part 3 (Combination with Pembrolizumab)  
Objectives  Endpoints  
Overall Design  
This is an open -label, repeat -dose, multicenter, three -part study to establish the 
maximally tolerated dose (MTD)/  recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) (based on safety 
and tolerability) and preliminary clinic al efficacy of orally -administered GSK3326595 , 
administered as a single agent  in subjects with solid tumors and non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma , or administered in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select 
solid tumors . 
Part 1 is a dose -escalation phas e to identify the MTD/RP2D based on the safety, PK, and 
PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK3326595 , and to preliminarily 
identify whether or not there is an effect of fed versus fasted state, and of tablet versus 
capsule formulation, on t he PK of GSK3326595 .  This Part will be conducted in adult 
subjects with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors.  
Disease -specific expansion cohorts (Part  2) are planned to further explore clinical 
activity of GSK3326595 in subjects with select solid tumors and non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas.  Based on pre -clinical data, as well as clinical data that emerged during Part 
1, enrollment will be limited to subjects with triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC), 
metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary system  (mTCC) , Grade IV 
anaplastic astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]), non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL) , adenoid cys tic carcinoma (ACC), hormone receptor -positive adenocarcinoma of 
the breast (ER+BC) , human papillomavirus (HPV) positive solid tumors of any 
histology (including cervical cancer and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
[HNSCC]) , and p53 -wild type n on-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of any histological 
subtype ; additional cohorts may be added based on emerging pre -clinical data and 
clinical responses identified during Part  1 or Part  2 of the study.

. 
This Protocol Amendment 8 is the follow up of this decision with the primary intent to 
update study  language related to stopping recruitment into the Part 2 ACC tablet cohort, 
and therefore stopping any further recruitment in the study, updating the end of study  
definition with final analysis plan (Section  5.5), and clarifying study treatment access for 
subjects continuing to derive clinical benefit from study drug as per  Investigator 
judgement post final analysis  (Section  4.1). 
Part 3 is a dose determination study to evaluate the safety, PK/PD profile, and clinical 
activity of orally -administered GSK3326595 at daily doses of 100  mg, 200 mg and 
300 mg, in combination with pembrolizumab administered at the approved dose.  
Enrollment in Part 3 will be limited to subjects with NSCLC, mTCC, melanoma, 
HNSCC that have failed to respond  to treatment with prior programmed cell death 
protein -1 (PD -1) or p rogrammed death -ligand 1 ( PD-L1) directed therapy. In addition 
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix patients that have progressed on or after PD -1 or 
PD-L1 directed therapy OR are PD -1/PD -L1 treatment naïve will be enrolled in Part 3.  
 
 
. 
Final Last Subject Last visit will be defined as last subject ’s treatment discontinuation 
(including 30-day safety follow up).  
The end of this study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subjec t under going 
the stud y. 
A final data -cut off (DCO) , closure of the study database and final analysis will occur 
when all subjects  have either died, discontinued treatment (including 30 -day safety 
follow up) , withdrawn consent, or have consented to continue with treatment as defined 
in this amendment (Protocol Amendment 8 ). 
When Protocol  Amendment  8 is implemented at a site, the collection of data for all 
enrolled subjects  who no longer receive study treatment will stop entirely. Subjects  still 
on treatment at the  time of the final DCO date may continue to receive study treatment 
for as long as they continue to deriv e clinical benefit from study treatment as assessed by 
the Investigator and do not meet any protocol -defined study treatment stopping criteria  
(maximum  until the end of availability of study drug which is anticipated to be Q3 
2023) ; subjects  may also choose to discontinue study treatment at any time. Subjects  in 
survival follow -up at the time of the final DCO date will be considered to have 
completed the study.  
Subjects  who continue study treatment following  Protocol Amendment 8  will receive 
follow -up care in accordance with standard local clinical practice. Assessments will 
revert to the standard of care at a subject’s  particular study site with recommendations 
for local safety laboratory monitoring of GSK 33265 95. Only SAEs, AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation, overdoses, pregnancies, and pre -defined ocular and bone AEs 
(AESIs) will be reported directly to the Sponsor via a paper proces s. In addition,

 • Ocular assessments will be required and reported via a paper process to the 
Sponsor only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation . 
• Bone  (DEXA) assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
and reported via a paper process to the Sponsor only if reporting criteria is met 
for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation . 
Treatment Arms and Duration  
All subjects in the study will receive  the investigational agent.  Part 1 (including the 
PK/PD expansion , relative bioavailabil ity and food effect cohort s) will have a single 
arm.  Part 2 will incorporate multiple disease -specific arms.  Part 3 will incorporate 
multiple arms comprising a fixed  dose of pembrolizumab and three dose levels of 
GSK3326595.  In Part 1 and Part 2, s ubjects may continue treatment in the study until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. In Part 3, subjects 
may remain on GSK3326595 until t hese criteria are met; however, pembrolizumab will 
only be administered for a maximum of 24 months.  The duration of study will depend 
on recruitment rates and the timing of subjects’ duration on study (withdrawal rates due 
to toxicity or progression), wit h an approximate duration of 8 years.  
Type and Number of Subjects  
Part 1: It is estimated that 66 subjects will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohort of 
the study, including around 42 subjects to identify the MTD , approximately 12 
additional subjects in the PK/PD/metabolite/biomarker expansion cohort(s) , and 
approximately 12 subjects  but no more than 24 subjects  in the food effect  and relative 
bioavailability  sub-study .  The study population will be adults, with hi stologically - or 
cytologically -confirmed metastatic or non -resectable solid malignancies.   
Part 2: It is estimated that up to 316 subjects will be enrolled in the disease -specific 
expansion cohorts of the study.  Cohorts will include  adult subjects with a diagnosis of 
one of the following diseases:  
• Triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC)

Part 3: It is estimated that approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled in Part 3 , all with 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, melanoma, mTCC, or HNSCC that have failed to 
respond to treatment (e.g., SD , with subsequent documen ted progression as per iRECIST,  
or PD as best response) with prior PD -1 or PD -L1 directed therapy. In addition,  
squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix patients that have progressed on or after  PD-1 or 
PD-L1 directed therapy or are PD-1/PD -L1 treatment naïve will be enrolled in Part 3 . 
These subjects will be divided evenly between three cohorts, each receiving a different 
dose of GSK3326595 in combination with a single dose of pembrolizumab.  
 
 
 
Analysis  
Part 1: A modified toxicity probability  interval  (mTPI) method will be used to make 
dose escalation decisions.  Dose decisions, including dose increments, will be based on 
the totality of clinical safety assessment including dose -limiting toxicities, clinical, and 
laboratory safety data.  All d ata will be pooled and descriptive analyses summarized and 
listed by cohort at study conclusion. No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested. 
Analyses will be descriptive and exploratory.  
Part 2: The primary goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specif ic efficacy in subjects with 
TNBC, mTCC , recurrent GBM, NHL (which will be divided into two cohorts: TP53  
mutated and TP53  wild-type) , ACC, ER+BC, HPV -positive solid tumors  and NSCLC .  
Except for the ACC cohort s, this portion of the study will employ a Bayesian design that 
allows the trial to be frequently monitored with the constraint of both Type I and Type II 
error rates . The ACC cohort s will use a Simon’s optimal two stage design.  For all tumors 
except GBM, the prim ary endpoint  will be defined as o verall response rate  (ORR), per 
standard evaluation criteria.  Bayesian hierarchical modeling will be used to investigate 
the clinical activity of GSK3326595 in the TNBC, mTCC, and NHL  cohorts.  
Hierarchical modeling allows information about the treatment effect in one cohort to be 
‘borrowed’ when estimating the treatment effect in another cohort.  For the GBM cohort, 
the prima ry endpoint  will be defined as the six -month PFS rate. The NSCLC cohort is 
intended to explore the clinical activity in the p53 wild -type NSCLC population using a 
Simon’s optimal two -stage design to define the interim futility analysis.  The results of 
the interim futility analysis (performed after 10 evaluabl e subjects) will be used to 
inform further development in this population. For all cohorts, c linical activity will be 
monitored through interim analyses.  
A secondary goal of Part 2 is to test the hypothesis that clinical response to 
GSK3326595 in NHL subje cts is influenced by tumor p53 status (wild type versus 
mutant).  
Part 3:  No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested in this cohort. Analyses will be 
descriptive and exploratory .

 2. INTRODUCTION  
GSK3326595 is a potent, selective, reversible inhibitor of the protein arginine 
methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)/Methylosome protein 50 (MEP50) complex that is being 
tested as an oral treatment for human subjects with cancer.  
2.1. Study Rationale  
Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are a subset of enzymes that methy late 
arginines in proteins that contain regions rich in glycine and arginine residues (GAR 
motifs). PRMT5 methylates arginines in proteins involved in various cellular proteins 
including splicing factors, transcription factors, kinases and others [ Karkhanis , 2011].  
PRMT5 also methylates histone arginine residues ( Histone 3 Arginine 8 [ H3R8 ], 
Histone 2A arginine 3 [ H2AR3 ] and Histone 4 arginine 3 ,  [H4R3 ]), and these histone 
marks are associated with transcriptional silencing of tumor suppressor genes such as 
RB1 and ST7 [Wang , 2008; Pal, 2007].  
Additionally, symmetric dimethylation of H2AR3 has been implicated in the silencing of 
differentiation genes in embryonic stem cells [ Tee, 2010]. PRMT5 plays a critical role in 
the cell -cycle and pro -apoptotic effects of p53 via two mechanisms: direct inhibition of 
p53 activity via methylation of arginine residues on p53 itself, as w ell as increased 
ubiquitylation (and subsequent degradation) of p53 via differential splicing of MDM4, a 
p53 ubiquitin ligase.  Finally, PRMT5 plays a role in cellular signaling through the 
methylation of epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) and phosph oinositol -3 kinase 
(PI3K) [ Hsu, 2011; Wei, 2012].  
Increasing evidence  suggests that PRMT5 is involved in tumorigenesis. PRMT5 protein 
is overexpressed in a number of cancer types, including lymphoma, glioma, breast and 
lung cancer and PRMT5 overexpression alone is sufficient to transform normal 
fibroblasts [ Pal, 2007; Ibrahim , 2014; Powers , 2011; Yan, 2014].  Knockdown of 
PRMT5 often leads to a decrease in cell growth and survival in canc er cell lines. In 
breast cancer, high PRMT5 expression, together with high programmed cell death 4  
(PDCD4 ) levels predict overall poor survival [ Powers , 201 1]. High expression of 
PRMT5 in glioma is associated with high tumor grade and overall poor survival and 
PRMT5 knockdown provides a survival benefit in an orthotopic glioblastoma model 
[Yan, 2014]. Increased PRMT5 expression and activity contribute to silencing of several 
tumor suppressor genes in glioma cell lines.

 Nevertheless, p53 is not the only mechanism by which PRMT5 has its effect on 
lymphoma cells, as several p53 -mutant cell lines were also highly sensitive to treatment 
with GSK3326595.  For instance, cyclin D1, the oncogene that is translocated in the vast 
majority of MCL patients, associate s with PRMT5 and through a cdk4 -dependent 
mechanism increases PRMT5 activity [ Aggarwal , 2010]. PRMT5 mediates the 
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 29 
 suppression of key genes that negatively regulate deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 
replication allowing for cyclin D1 -dependent neoplastic growth. PRMT5 knockdown 
inhibit s cyclin D1 -dependent cell transformation causing death of tumor cells.  Thus, 
because other gene pathways (apart from p53) that are important for lymphomagenesis 
are regulated by PRMT5, subjects with lymphoma will be enrolled in Part 2 irrespective 
of p53  status and the response to therapy with GSK3326595 will be compared between 
cohorts.  
Adenoid cystic carcinoma ( ACC ) is a tumor arising from salivary glands that is 
clinically distinct from squamous cell tumors of the head and neck.  While typically 
charac terized by a long overall survi val (OS) , it nevertheless portends frequent 
metastatic progression and steadily progressive disease [Wysocki , 2016] .  To date, there 
are no approved therapies for metastatic or unresectable ACC, as response rates to 
traditional chemotherapy are typically poor and novel targeted therapies have been 
unable to improve on this [Dillon , 2017; Goncalves , 2017; Locati , 2016]  .  Epigenetic 
agents have recently found favour in ACC therapeutic trials, as recurrent mutations in 
transcriptional mediators (including myb and NOTCH) have been identified in a subset 
of ACC tumor samples  [Ferrarotto , 2016] .  As inactivating p53 mutations are rare in 
ACC samples, any agent (such as GSK3326595) that increases p53 activity may yield 
therapeutic benefit in this population.  
HPV is a DNA virus that has been associated with numerous squamous cell carcinomas 
when mucocutaneous squamous cells are infected with high -risk strains of the virus.  
Tumorigenesis is mediated via viral oncogenes, incl uding E6 and E7, which lead to 
degradation and/or inhibition of endogenous tumor suppressors.  This effect phenocopies 
inactivating mutations in these tumor suppressors.  Critically, viral oncogene expression 
is dependent on host mRNA -processing machinery (i.e., the spliceosome)  [Graham , 
2017 ].  In the absence of viral oncogene expression, the endogenous tumor suppressors 
would be expected to resume expression, potentially leading to reduction in tumor size.  
GSK3326595 may be expected to provide therapeutic benefit in HPV -infected solid 
tumors in multiple ways: either by reducing viral oncogene expression via effects on 
mRNA splicing of viral oncogen es, or else by direct upregulation of p53 via other 
PRMT5 -dependent processes as described above.  As HPV induces tumors via a 
common mechanism irrespective of the cell type of origin (e.g., cervical, head/neck, etc), 
PRMT5 inhibition may yield clinical be nefit in multiple HPV -infected tumor types.  
Recently, immunotherapy has emerged as a significant field for novel therapies in 
oncology.  These agents act via modulation of the acquired immune system in order to 
drive recognition and destruction of tumors [Gandhi , 2018] . Pembrolizumab, a 
humanized Immunoglobulin G4 ( IgG4 ) against the Programmed Cell Death  protein -1 
(PD-1) protein, has been approved as an  option for patients with a variety of solid 
tumors and hematological malignancies, including lung, head and neck, melanoma, 
bladder, and cervical cancers [KEYTRUDA , Prescribing Information (PI), 2019; 
KEYTRUDA , Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), 2019] .  Treatment with 
pembrolizumab is characteri zed by responses that exhibit significant durability 
[KEYTRUDA , PI, 2019; KEYTRUDA , SPC, 2019] .  However, not all patients respond 
to pembrolizumab therapy, and wild -type p53 has emerged as a potential biomarker for 
lack of response  [Carlisle , 2018] .  Given the preclinical activity of GSK3326595 
observed in many pembrolizumab -sensitive tumor types, the unmet medical need of the 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 30 
 pembrolizumab -treated patients who fail to r espond to their therapy, and the potential 
p53-modulating effects of GSK3326595, PRMT5 inhibition may yield clinical benefit 
when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.   
GSK3326595 in combination with Pembrolizumab will be explore d in subjects with 
NSCLC, mTCC, melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) 
and with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix . 
Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer related mortality in women 
worldwide ( Torre , 2015) , third in US ( Siegel , 2020 ) and HPV is the driver behind 97% 
of invasive cervical cancer (Walboomers , 1999) .  Response rates associated with ﬁrst -
line treatment of recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer ranged from 19% to 36% for 
cisplatin alone o r in combination with paclitaxel respectively ( Moore , 2004)  to 
approximately 50% for bevacizumab containing regimens ( Tewari , 2017 ).  Median OS 
values ranged from 8.8 to 9.7 months for cisplatin alone or in combination with 
paclitaxel respectively ( Moore , 2004) to 16.8 months for bevacizumab -containing 
regimens ( Tewari , 2017) . Responses to second -line treatments for recurrent/metastatic 
cervical cancer are limited. In June 2018, pembrolizumab received accelerated approval 
in the US for the treatment of patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancers 
expressing programmed death ligand (PD -L1) post ch emotherapy showing ORR of 
14.3% in Combined Percentage Score (CPS)≥1% population ( KEYTRUDA  
(pembrolizumab) [package insert] ). Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck & Co; June 2019 ). 
In addition , Pembrolizumab approval in microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or 
mismatch repair deficient solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment 
and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options is appropriate  for selected 
cervical cancer patients.  
A number of approaches are currently under clinical exploration including a combination 
of immune oncology agents (Checkmate 358, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) or  a combination of 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy (Keynote 826, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Based on preliminary 
data from HPV positive cohort of study 204653,  some tumor shrinkage was seen in 
cervical cancer patients. A proposed inclusion of cervical cancer patients that have 
progressed on or after  PD-1 or PD -L1 directed therapy or are PD -1/PD -L1 treatment 
naïve is based on hypothesis that GSK3326595 may augment pembrolizumab activity in 
this population when compared to pembrolizumab alone. It is anticipated that patients 
with CPS<1% and CPS≥1% may obtain benefit from treatment, given this novel 
combination approach and patients will be enrolled irrespective of PD -L1 status.  
In summary, r elapsed metastatic solid malignancies (including those under investigation 
in this stud y), and virtually all relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies are 
incurable diseases which will ultimately prove fatal.  In particular, recurrent  urinary tract 
cancer and GBM portend a particularly grim prognosis with an overall survival typically 
measured in months.  At this time, there is no standard of care for these diseases, and as 
such these patients often consider investigational agents in an attempt to provide some 
clinical benefit.  A wealth of data, including genetics, biochemistry, and cellu lar biology, 
implicate PRMT5 in a multitude of human malignancies including those investigated in 
this study. This study is the first in humans to investigate inhibition of PRMT5 in an 
attempt to treat and ameliorate malignancy in this population with a hi gh degree of 
unmet medical need.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
This is an open -label, repeat -dose, multicenter, three -part study to establish the 
MTD/RP2D (based on the profile of safety and tolerability) and preliminary clinical 
efficacy of orally -administered GSK3326595 , administered as a single agent  in subjects 
with solid tumors and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma , or administered in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with select solid tumors.  
Part 1 is a dose -escalation phase to identify the MTD/RP2D based on the safety, PK, and 
PD profiles observed after oral administration of GSK3326595 , and to preliminarily 
identify whether or not there is an effect of fed versus fasted state , and of tablet  versus 
capsule formulation , on the PK of GSK3326595 .  This Part will be conducted in adult 
subjects with relapsed and/or refractory solid tumors.  
Disease -specific expansion cohorts (Part  2) are planned to  further explore clinical 
activity of GSK3326595 in subjects with select solid tumors and non -Hodgkin’s 
lymphomas.  Based on pre -clinical data, as well as clinical data from Part  1 of the study, 
enrollment in Part 2 will be limited to subjects with triple -negative breast cancer 
(TNBC), metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary system  (mTCC) , Grade IV 
anaplastic astrocytoma (glioblastoma multiforme [GBM]), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(NHL)  (all sub -types recruited to Protocol Amendments 1 -4, and indol ent subtypes  of  
NHL recruited to Protocol Amendment 5 onwards ), adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), 
hormone receptor -positive adenocarcinoma of the breast (ER+BC), human 
papillomavirus (HPV) -positive solid tumors of any histology , and p53-wild type non-
small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC)  of any histological subtype . Additional cohorts may be 
added , via future protocol amendment, based on pre -clinical data and clinical responses

This Protocol Amendment 8 is the follow up of this decision with the primary intent to 
update  study language  related to stopping recruitment into the Part 2 ACC tablet cohort, 
and therefore stopping any further recruitment in the study, updating the end of st udy 
definition with final analysis plan (Section 5.5), and clarifying study treatment access for 
subjects continuing to derive clinical benefit from  study drug as per Investigator 
judgement post final analysis . 
Part 3 is a dose  determination  study to  evaluate  the safety, PK/PD profile, and clinical 
activity of orally -administered GSK3326595 at daily doses of 100  mg, 200  mg and 
300 mg, in combination w ith pembrolizumab  administered at the approved dose .  
Enrollment in Part 3 will be limited to subjects with NSCLC, mTCC, melanoma, and 
HNSCC that have failed to respond to treatment  with prior PD -1 or PD -L1 directed 
therapy . In addition , squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix patients that have progressed 
on or after  PD-1 or PD -L1 directed therapy or are PD-1/PD -L1 treatment naïve will be 
enrolled in Part 3.    
 
. 
Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is 
provided in the accompanying Study Reference Manual (SRM).  The SRM will provide 
the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information that does not 
impact subject safety.  
Final Last Subject Last visit will be defined as last subject ’s tre atment discontinuation 
(including 30 -day safety follow up).  
The end of this study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last subject  undergoing 
the study.  
A final data -cut off (DCO) , closure of the study database  and final analysis will occur 
when all subjects  have either died, discontinued treatment (including 30 -day safety

 follow up),  withdrawn consent, or have consented to continue with treatment as defined 
in this amendment (Protocol Amendment 8) . 
When  Protocol  Amendment 8  is imp lemented at a site, the collection of data for all 
enrolled subjects  who no longer receive study treatment will stop entirely. Subjects  still 
on treatment at the time of the final DCO date may continue to receive study treatment 
for as long as they continu e to derive clinical benefit from study treatment as assessed  by 
the Investigator and do not meet any protocol -defined study treatment stopping criteria  
(maximum until the end of availability of study drug which is anticipated to be Q3 
2023) ; subjects  may also choose to discontinue study treatment at any time. Subjects  in 
survival  follow -up at the time of the final DCO date will be considered to have 
completed th e study.  
Subjects who continue study treatment following Protocol Amendment 8  will receive 
follow -up care in accordance with standard local clinical practice. Assessments will 
revert to the standard of care at a subject’s particular study site with recommendations 
for local safety labora tory monitoring of GSK3326595 . Only SAEs, AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation, overdoses, pregnancies, and pre -defined ocular and bone AEs 
(AESIs) will be reported directly to the Sponsor via a paper process . In addition,  
• Ocular assessments will be required  and reported via a paper process to the 
Sponsor only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation .   
• Bone (DEXA) assessments  will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
and reported via a paper process to the Sponsor  only if reporting criteria is met 
for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation . 
4.2. Part 1: Dose Escalation  
The primary objective of Part 1 is to identify the MTD of GSK3326595 when 
administered orally in subjects with solid tumors. As described in Section 4.7, dosing 
will start at 12.5 mg once daily and escalate until the MTD is reached.  In Part 1, any 
subject who prematurely discontinues therapy during the DLT observation period for 
reasons other than a DLT will be replaced by additional subject(s) assig ned to the same 
dose level.  
 
. Subjects will also be enrolled at or about the RP2D 
into a food effect and relative bioavailability sub-study (Section 4.2.6 ) to evaluate the 
effects of food and GSK3326595 formulation on GSK3326595 pharmacokinetics.  
Dose escalation will be conducted in two stages: dose exploration (Section 4.2.2 ) and 
MTD confirmation (Section 4.2.3 ). Details common to both stages, including DLT 
definitions and dose increments, are described in Section 4.2.4 . 
4.2.1.  Type and Number of Subjects  (Part 1)  
It is estimated that up to 66 subjects will be enrolled into the dose escalation cohort of 
the study, including approximately  42 subjects to identify the MTD, approximately 
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 38 
 12 subjects in the PK/PD/metabolite/biomarker expansion cohort(s) , and ap proximately 
12 subjects but no more than 24 subjects  in the food effect and relative bioavailability 
sub-study . The study population will be adults, with histologically - or cytologically -
confirmed solid malignancies as described in Section 5.1. 
4.2.2.  Initial Dose Exploration (accelerated titration)  
In order to minimize the number of subjects enrolled at sub -optimal doses, an 
accelerated titration design will be implemented until the first evidence of a non disease -
related ≥ Grade 2 toxicity, with the exception of toxicities listed in Section 4.2.4.2 .  One 
subject at each dose level will be enrolled, starting at the dose described in Section 4.7.  
If the subject enrolled at the first dose level experiences a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), 
then lower doses (i.e., Dose Level -1) will be explored and re -escalation may be 
attempted based on saf ety and tolerability data.  Accelerated titration will continue until 
a subject experiences a non -disease -related ≥ Grade 2 toxicity, then the implementation 
of the MTD confirmation stage (Section 4.2.3 ) will be triggered.  Each subject must 
complete the 21 -day DLT evaluation period, and the available safety data must be 
reviewed before a decision is made on whether to proceed to the next dose level.  If a 
subject fails to receive more than 80% of the planned doses within the 21 -day DLT 
evaluation period for reasons other than toxicity, the subject will be replaced.  
Guidelines for selecting the next dose level are described in Section 4.2.4.2 . Additional 
subjects may be enrolled at previously cleared dose levels if safety and PK analysis 
suggest this is warranted for better understanding the safety and PK profile.  Safety 
assessments from these subjects will be included in the MTD determination.  
4.2.3.  Determining the MTD  
Starting with the first cohort exhibiting a non disease -related ≥ Grade 2 toxicity (except 
for those listed in Section 4.2.4.2 ), a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) 
design will be implemented ( Figure 4-1) [Ji, 2010].  Cohorts will be recruited in blocks 
of three subjects.  The maximum number of subjects assigned  to any single dose will be 
at the discretion of the Sponsor in consultation with the investigators.  
The design assumes (i) approximately 38 subjects will complete the DLT evaluation 
period and (ii) the true underlying toxicity rate for GSK3326595 falls wi thin the range 
from 25% to 35% and centered at 30%.  The monitoring rules guiding dose escalation 
are provided in Figure 4-1.  Columns provide the num bers of subjects treated at the 
current dose level, and rows provide the corresponding numbers of subjects experiencing 
toxicity.  The entries of the table are dose -finding decisions (i.e., E, S, and D) 
representing escalating the dose, staying at the same  dose, and de -escalating the dose.  In 
addition, decision U means that the current dose level is unacceptable because of high 
toxicity and should be excluded from the trial.  For example, when one of three subjects 
experiences toxicity, the decision can be  located at row 1 and column 3, which is S – to 
stay at the current dose level.  Consequently , the next cohort of subjects will be treated at 
the same dose level currently being used.  If zero of three subjects experiences toxicity, 
the decision is at row 0 and column 3, which is E – to escalate.  Thus, the next cohort of 
subjects will be treated at the next -higher dose level.  If three of three subjects 
experiences toxicity, the decision is DU – to de -escalate to the next -lower dose level and 
exclude the c urrent dose from the trial, because the high toxicity level is unacceptable.

 During dose escalation, when 2 or more subjects are enrolled in a cohort, no two subjects 
may start treatment on the same day . This staggered dosing start is not required for 
subjects enrolling at previously cleared doses or for subjects enrolled in Part 2 of the 
study.

4.2.3.1.  Reverting to Accelerated Dose Titration  
Subsequent coh orts may revert to one subject per cohort in either of the following 
scenarios:  
• Two additional subjects are added at the dose where the non -disease -related 
≥ Grade 2 toxicity is seen in the initial subject, and no non disease -related 
Grade  2 or higher tox icity is seen in either of the two new subjects.  
• All subjects treated at next higher dose level do not have a non -disease -related 
Grade 2 or higher toxicity.  
However, the dose escalation may continue with multiple subjects per cohort per the 
clinical judgment of the Medical Monitor in consultation with the investigators. The 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 decision on the number of subjects will be documented in writing together with the dose  
escalation decision and the rationale.  
4.2.4.  Dose Escalation Decisions and Determination of MTD  
4.2.4.1.  Dose -Limiting Toxicity  
An event is considered to be a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) if the event occurs within the 
first 21 days of treatment and meets the criteria l isted in Table 1, unless it can be clearly 
established that the event is unrelated to treatment.  
Table 1 Dose -Limiting Toxicity Criteria  
Toxicity  DLT Definition  
Hematologic  • Grade 3 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <1000/mm3) for 
5 days or Grade 4 neutropenia of any duration  
• Grade 3 or greater febrile neutropenia  
• Grade 4 or greater anemia of any duration  
• Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets <25,000/mm3), or Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia with bleeding  
Non-hematologic  • Alanine aminotransferase  (ALT) >3x upper limit of normal (ULN) + bilirubin 
2xULN (>35% direct) or ALT between 3 -5 X ULN with bilirubin < 2xULN 
but with hepatitis symptomsa or rash (See Section 5.4.5  for Liver Stopping 
Criteria)  
• Grade 3 nausea, vomiting or diarrhea that does not improve within 72h 
despite appropriate supportive treatment(s)  
• Grade 4 or greater nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea  
• Grade 3 hypertensionb (uncontrolled despite addition of up to 
2 antihypertensive medications)  
• Grade 4 or greater hypertension  
• Grade 3 or greater clinically sig nificant non -hematologic toxicity per  National 
Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (NCI-
CTCAE ), v4 except toxicities listed in Section 4.2.4.2 . 
Other  • Inability to receive at least 80% of scheduled doses in the DLT observation 
period due to toxicityc 
• Grade 2 or higher toxicity that occurs beyond 21 days which in the judgment 
of the investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Medical Monitor is 
considered to be a DLT  
Toxicity Grading based on NCI -CTCAE v4  
a. New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to hypersensitivity (such as fever, 
rash or eosinophilia)  
b. Grade 3 hypertension adequately controlled by antihypertensive medication(s) is not considered to be a DLT.  
c. Subjects unable to receive at least 80%  of scheduled doses for reasons other than toxicity (e.g., acute 
illness, disease progression) will not be evaluable for DLT purposes and will be replaced in the cohort  
Table 1 provides a list of protocol -defined DLTs; it does not provide guidelines for 
management of these toxicities.  In appropriate clinical circumstances, resumed dosing 
after a DLT (at a reduced d ose level) may be considered after discussion between the 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 41 
 investigator, medical monitor, and GSK medical governance (as necessary). For 
management of liver toxicity, please refer to Section 5.4.5 .  For management of cardiac 
toxicity, see Section 5.4.6 .  For management of all other toxicities, s ee Appendix 2 . 
4.2.4.2.  Non-Limiting Toxicities  
The following toxicities have been deemed to be non -serious for the purposes of this 
study. These toxicities will not be taken into account for dose escalation decisions 
unless, in the opinion of the investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor, they represent a 
dose-limiting toxicity. For all other toxicities and their management, see Appendix 2 . 
• Grade 2 or less:  
o Fatigue  
o Rash  
o Alopecia  
• Grade 3 or less nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea controlled within 24h  
• Electrolyte imbalance or other laboratory abnormalities controlled within 24h  
4.2.4.3.  Maximum Dose Increment  
Built -in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing subjects to undue risk of 
toxicity. The maximum allowable dose increment will be determined ba sed on the prior 
dose level data.  The permitted dose increments are a protocol -defined maximum; a 
smaller increment may always be used based on the decision of the investigators and 
medical monitor (Section 4.2.4.5 ). Planned dose levels are detailed in Section 4.2.4.4 . 
For each individual dose  escalation step:  
If no grade  2 non -hematologic non disease -related toxicity (except those listed in 
Section 4.2.4.2 ) is observed at the current dose, the dose increment will be no more than 
100% of the current dose.  
If one or more grade >  2 non -hematologic non disease -related toxicity (except those 
listed in Section 4.2.4.2 ), grade >  2 anemia or thrombocytopenia, or DLT is observed, the 
dose increment to the immediate next dose level will be no more t han 50% of the current 
dose.  
4.2.4.4.  Planned Dose Levels  
Projected daily dose levels are 12.5  mg, 25  mg, 50  mg, 100  mg, 200  mg, 400 mg , 
600 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg .  BID dosing may divide this total daily dose into two 
equal doses, administered twice daily.  Additional doses (either lower than 12.5  mg, 
higher than 1200 mg, or intermediate doses between those listed above) and schedules 
may be explored based on emerging safety, PK, and PD data.   
4.2.4.5.  Dose Escalation Decisions  
The GSK medical monitor, in joint discus sion with the participating investigators, will be 
responsible for determining whether dose escalation during Part 1 should continue as 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 42 
 recommended by the mTPI approach.  Prior to the dose escalation decision, the medical 
monitor, clinical scientist, safet y physician, clinical pharmacologist, and investigators 
will review critical safety  data defined in the Dose Escalation Plan , including  data on all 
adverse events including non -DLT toxicities, laboratory assessments and other safety 
evaluations, as well as  PK and PD data.  The quality review of critical safety data will be 
described in the Dose Escalation Plan, which  includes ongoing study monitoring visits 
along with data review of the clinical database. 
The dose -escalation decision and rationale for each c ohort will be discussed with 
investigators during teleconference(s) and documented in writing with copies maintained 
at each study site and in the master study files at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).  
4.2.4.6.  Alternative Dosing Schedules  
Alterations may be made to the sche dule of administration and/or PK/PD sampling 
schedule based on the results of emerging PK and safety data.   
Schedules that incorporate a recovery period may be explored (e.g., 3 weeks on, 1 week 
off). This approach will be considered if the safety and PK data suggest that a therapeutic 
exposure cannot be achieved using the initial schedule without excessive toxicity. The 
starting dose for the alternate schedule will be the highest completed dose level (at or 
below MTD) with the initial schedule. Escalation  can then proceed as described in 
Section 4.2.3 . 
Schedules that use a different daily regimen (e.g., twice daily [BID] dosing) may also be 
explored . This approach will be considered if the safety, PK, and PD data suggest that a 
sufficient therapeutic exposure cannot be achieved using the initial schedule. If a shorter 
recovery period is used, the initial dose level will be 50% of the highest completed dose 
level (at or below MTD) with the initial schedule. Escalation can then proceed as 
described using in Section 4.2.3 . If BID dosing is to be utilized, study events will occur 
as detailed in Table 11 and Table 12. 
The dosing schedule may also be adjusted to expand a prior dose cohort to further 
evaluate safety, pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic findings at a given dose level, 
or to add cohorts to evaluate addi tional dose levels. The study procedures for these 
additional subject(s) or cohort(s) will be the same as that described for other study 
subjects.  
Any changes to the dosing schedule may be made only after review of all available data 
and clearance by the G SK medical monitor.  Any planned changes will apply to a cohort 
of subjects and not an individual subject.  Changes will be communicated to the site in 
writing along with justification and data supporting the change.  A modified SRM, 
including updated Time  and Events Table, will be provided to the sites prior to initiation 
of the alternative regimen.  
4.2.4.7.  Intra -subject Dose Escalation  
In Part 1, intra -subject dose escalations may be considered on a case -by-case basis, 
provided that the subject has completed at least the DLT observation period without 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 43 
 ≥ Grade 2 non disease -related toxicity in the first 21 days of therapy, that all subjec ts at 
the next highest dose level have completed the DLT observation period, and that prior 
approval has been obtained from the GSK Medical Monitor. Subjects may be dose -
escalated to the highest cleared dose.  Individual subjects may dose -escalate multiple  
times provided that the above criteria are met at each intra -subject dose escalation step.  
Safety assessments from these subjects will be included in the MTD determination.  
Subjects approved for intra -subject dose escalation will initiate daily dosing fr om Day 1 
of the higher dose (i.e., no dose interruption from Day 2 until Day 4) and will require 
additional PK sampling on Day 15 at the higher dose, as specified in Time and Events 
table (see Section 8.1).  Additional safety assessments may be specified at the time of 
dose escalation or schedule modification based on the safety profile in previous subjects 
at the higher dose level. Intra -subject dose  escalations or schedule modification will be 
discussed with investigators and approved by the GSK Medical Monitor and safety 
monitoring required will be specified in writing.  
4.2.4.8.  Completion of Dose Escalation and Determination of MTD/RP2D  
The dose escalation portion of Part 1 is expected to be completed when approximately 42 
subjects enrolled in the dose escalation and dose confirmation stages have completed the 
DLT evaluation period.  The RP2D will be the MTD or a lower dose that provides 
adequate PK exposure  and biologic activity with superior tolerability.  The identification 
of MTD may not be necessary if a clear RP2D emerges without reaching the MTD.  The 
final determination of RP2D will be based on the mTPI suggested dose level, or the 
biologically active  dose (e.g., clinical response), the safety profile, and available PK and 
PD data generated from all subjects in Part  1.  If necessary, alternate schedules can be 
explored to determine additional biologically active doses even after a RP2D is defined.  
Subjects may be enrolled at previously completed dose levels for the purpose of 
obtaining additional safety, PK, PD, metabolite, or biomarker data.  Paired fresh biopsies 
(pre- and post -dose) may be required in these subjects based on the need to obtain tumor 
PD data.  In addition, a reduced PK schedule may be used in subjects enrolled to obtain 
additional PK/PD data.  
4.2.5.  PK/PD, Metabolite, and Biomarker Expansion Cohort(s)  
Any dose level at or near the MTD/RP2D in Part 1 may be expanded up to 12 subjects in 
order to collect additional data on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK).  More than one dose 
level may be selected for expansion (e.g., to establish a dose -response curve for PD or 
other biomarkers), based on emerging data.  Clinical samples from this/these cohort( s) 
will also be collected for analysis of pharmacodynamics (PD), metabolite profiling, and 
biomarkers.  Subjects may be enrolled into this cohort even after MTD/RP2D has been 
identified and Part 2 of the study (Section 4.3) has been initiated.  
Refer to Section 8.1, Time and Events Table ( Table 10), which highlights the additional 
sampling requirements for this cohort.  In addition to the safety and PK evaluations 
necessary for all subj ects in Part 1, blood and urine will be collected at time points 
specified in Section 8.1 (Table 10) for PD, biomarker, and metabolite profiling.  Pre -dose 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 44 
 and post -dose tumor biopsies will be required from subjects in this/these cohort(s).  
Subjects consenting to pre - and post -dose biopsies will  be prioritized to enrol lment in 
these cohorts. 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) (FDG -
PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan (PET/CT scan) will be required for all subjects in 
this cohort, as described in Section 8.6.3 .   
 
 
4.2.6.  Food Effect and Relative Bioavailability Sub-Study  
Part 1 will include a sub -study that will be an open -label, randomized, single  dose, three 
period, cross over study to investigate the effect of a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the 
bioavailability of GSK3326595 , and compare two formulations of GSK3326595 (capsule 
versus  tablet) . The dose of GSK3326595 will be 300  mg once a day ( QD) (refer  to 
Section  4.3.2 ).  GSK 3326595  dosing will be separated  by at least 48 hours  between each 
period . Up to 12 subjects in the United States may be enrolled in the sub-study. A subject 
requiring dose reduction or discontinuation from study before  completion of the sub-
study  will be replaced by a new subject . Depending on the data from the initial 12 
subjects, up to  an additional 12 patients may be enrolled in this sub -study. All subjects  
enrolled to the sub-study , on completion of their participation in this segment  of the 
study, will continue on a daily dosing schedule until discontinuation criteria are met, as 
described in Section 5.4.  Further details will be provided in the SRM.  The sub -study will 
be open to adults, with histologically - or cytologically -confirmed solid malignancies as 
described for Part 1 in Section 5.1. 
The high -fat (approximately 50% of the total caloric content of the meal), high -calorie  
meal (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) will be the representative example  given by 
the 2002 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance [ FDA , 2002].  Additional 
details of the required meal will be provided in the SRM.  
Subjects enrolled in the sub -study will be assigned to one of two sequences, as described 
in Table 2; equal numbers will be assigned to each sequence . The schedule of visits for 
subjects enrolled in the sub -study is detailed in Table 13 in Section 8.1.  Upon 
completion of the sub -study, all subjects will c ontinue to undergo scheduled assessments 
as described in Table 9.  Additional details, including the process of sequence 
assignment, will be provided in the SRM.

 45 
 hours after administration of the morning dose. Subjects should be administered the drug 
product as a capsu le or tablet (as indicated) with 200 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. Water 
can be allowed, as desired, except for one hour before and after drug administration. All 
subjects will receive standardized meals at approximately 4 - and 9 - hours post dose. 
Addition al details of the meals will be provided in the SRM.   
Fed: Following an overnight fast (at least 8 hours), subjects should start the 
recommended high fat, high calorie breakfast 30 minutes prior to administration of the 
GSK3326595 . Study subjects should ea t this meal in 30 minutes or less; however, 
GSK3326595  should be administered 30 minutes after start of the meal. The 
GSK3326595  should be administered as a tablet with 2 00 mL (8 fluid ounces) of water. 
No food should be allowed for at least 2 hours post -dose. Water can be allowed , as 
desired , except for one hour before and after drug administration. All subjects will 
receive standardized  meals at approximately 4 - and 9 - hours post dose .  Further details of 
the meals will be provided in the SRM.  
Any subject who experiences vomiting within 3  hours of dosing will be removed from 
the statistical analysis of PK comparability between tablet/capsule and tablet 
(fasted)/tablet (fed ), and additional subjects will be enrolled to ensure 12 subjects 
compl ete all three periods .   
As described in Section 8.2.2 , the Day 4 ( Period 2) visit may be performed on Day 4 or 
Day 5.  The Day 8 (Period 3) visit (capsule administered in a fasting state) may be 
performed ± 1 day .  Continuous daily dosing with GS K3326595  will only commence 
once the sub ject has completed the Period 3 visit, irrespective of whether that visit occurs 
± 1 day . 
If the GSK3326595 tablet bioavailability is comparable to that of the GSK3326595 
capsules, all new and ongoing subjects may be  switched from cap sules to tablets for the 
remainder of the study , once they have been notified by the Sponsor .  
 
4.3. Part 2: Disease -Specific Expansion Cohort(s)  
Once the RP2D ha s been determined, subjects will be enrolled in disease -specific 
expansion cohorts at the RP2D in order to better characterize the clinical activity and 
safety profile of GSK3326595.  Expansion cohorts will enroll subjects with TNBC, 
mTCC , recurrent GBM, NH L (all subtypes recruited to Protocol Amendments 1 -4 and 
indolent  subtypes of NHL recruited to Protocol Amendment 5 onwards , which will be 
analyzed based on TP53 status : p53 mutant and p53 wild -type) , ACC  (which will be 
separated into two separate cohorts: one dosed with GSK3326595 capsules, and a second 
dosed with GSK3326595 tablets  [this tablet cohort will enroll subjects who have not 
received any systemic therapy for their locally advanced or metastatic  ACC] ), ER+BC, 
HPV -positive solid tumors of any histology , and p53 wild -type NSCLC  of any 
histological subtype .  Other tumor types may be added via protocol amendment, based 
on additional pre -clinical data and/or clinical responses observed during Part 1 or Part  2 
of the study.    
 
 
  
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 46 
 Subjects in Part 2 will start with a continuous daily dosing schedule unless safety, PK or 
PD data necessitate a different dosing schedule. The final dose and regimen for Part 2 
will be decided upon completion of dose escalation in Part 1.   Dose reduction and/or 
scheduled interruptions will be permitted based on tolerability and toxicity.  
Plasma samples for PK evaluation will be collected, at reduced frequency compared to 
Part 1, in all subjects.  Plasma samples an d other clinical samples (e.g. lymph node or 
bone marrow biopsies) will be collected pre - and post - study drug treatment as defined in 
the Time and Events Table in Section 8.1 for the PD evaluations. The timing of samples 
may be altered and/or extra samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure 
thorough PK and PD monitoring.   For example, the timing of PK and PD monitoring may 
be moved earlier or later in the evaluation schedule based on emerging preclinical or 
clinical data that suggests a more optimal time frame to monitor biologic activity.  
4.3.1.  Type and Number of Subjects (Part 2)  
It is estimated that up to 316 subjects will be enrolled i n the disease -specific expansion 
cohorts of the study.  Cohorts will initially be limited to the following diseases (see 
Section 5.1 for all require d disease characteristics); however, additional tumor -specific 
cohort(s) may be added based upon emerging pre -clinical and clinical data from Part  1 or 
Part 2 of the study:  
• Triple -negative breast cancer (TNBC)  
• Metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary system  (mTCC)  
• Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)  
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) – all subtypes recruited to Protocol Amendments 
1-4 and indolent  subtypes of NHL recruited to Protocol Amendment 5 onwards, 
without mutations in the TP53 gene (p53 wild -type, NHL[ -]) 
• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma all subtypes recruited to Protocol Amendments 1 -4 and 
indolent  subtypes of NHL recruited to Protocol Amendment 5 onwards, with 
mutations in the TP53 gene (p53 mutant, NHL[+])  
• Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) , dosed with GSK3326 595 capsule formulation  
• Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) , dosed with GSK3326595 tablet formulation , in a 
population that is systemic therapy -naïve .  
• Hormone receptor -positive adenocarcinoma of the breast (ER+BC)  
• Human papillomavirus (HPV) -positive solid tumors of any histology  
• p53 wild -type n on-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of any histological subtype  
In Part 2, subjects will not be replaced if they prematurely discontinue therapy.  
Initially, the NHL cohorts enrolled subjects irrespective of histological  subtype.  
However, in December 2019 it was noted that of the subjects enrolled with high -grade 
and other aggressive subtypes of diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL), including 
double - and triple -hit lymphomas, there were zero objective responses out of 1 4 subjects 
dosed.  Conversely, clinical benefit was observed in subjects with more indolent subtypes 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 47 
 (including complete/partial responses in were observed in subjects with FL and 
transformed follicular lymphoma  (tFL), and stable disease for several disease 
assessments was observed in subjects with MCL). Theref ore, Protocol Amendment 5 
limit ed further enrollment to this population to subjects with more indolent disease who 
may receive more benefit from treatment with GSK3326595 monotherapy.  
4.3.2.  R2PD Dose Selection  
Subjects will start dosing on Day 1 with the dose and schedule selected as the RP2D in 
Part 1 of the study.  
At a 21 March 2018 investigator meeting, 400 m g once daily ( QD) was selected as the 
RP2D, based on safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and  PD.  Dose reductions and 
scheduled interruptions are permitted for toxicity and tolerability as described in Table 3.  
At that meeting, it was also determined that if emerging data demonstrated that 400 mg 
QD proved intolerable for a majority of subjects, that the starting dose for all subjects 
enrolled from that time forward may be reduced (e.g., to Dose level [DL]-1). The final 
dose selection will take into account all available clinical data, as well as a PK/PD model 
to predict the optimal dose with minimal cytopenia s. 
Table 3 RP2D and Planned Dose Reduction  
RP2D  400 mg QD  
DL-1 300 mg QD  
DL-2 200 mg QD  
DL-3 200 mg QD, administered for 3 weeks, 
followed by a 1-week  rest period  
Note: These dose levels may be adjusted on a case -by-case basis after discussion with the 
GSK medical monitor . 
Subsequent evaluation of safety and tolerability data  was performed, using data from the 
04 February 20 19 data cut included in the IB for GSK3326595 [GlaxoSmithKline 
Document Number  2017N314773_03 ].  As of that date, 71 subjects had been treated at 
the 400 mg RP2D in the 204653 study.  Of those 71 subjects, 33 (46%) required at least 
one dose reduction.  Of the 33 subjects requiring dose reduction, the majority (23 subjects 
[70%]) remained on 300 mg for  their duration on study.  Overall, only 10 subjects (14% 
of the total number treated at 400 mg) required more than one dose reduction (i.e., to 
doses below 300 mg).   
Clinical activity was observed in Part 1, in subjects with ACC who were treated at doses  
of 300 mg and below.  Of the three patients who exhibited confirmed partial responses, 
two were started at a dose of 200 mg QD and remained at that dose throughout their time 
on study.  The third responder began treatment with GSK3326595 at 400 mg QD, but  
dose reduced to 300 mg QD after the first month on treatment.

 All new subjects enrolled , following approval of Protocol Amendment 4 ( food effect and 
relative bioavailability sub -study in Part 1, and all dose expansion  cohorts in Part 2 ), will 
start on 300 mg QD  (i.e., at Dose level -1 [DL-1] in Table 3).  In all cohorts, dose 
reduction for toxicity will be permitted, as described in Table 3. 
4.3.3.  Statistical Design  
Continued recruitment into each disease -specific expansion cohort is determined using 
the rules described in this section.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3.3.1.  GBM Cohort  
In Part 2, the GBM cohort will employ a Bayesian adaptive design that allows the study 
to be frequently monitored with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates . The 
first interim analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 10 evaluable subjects who 
have had at least three  post-baseline assessments, have progressed or died, or have 
permanently discontinued fr om study treatment . Up to 28 subjects may be enrolled in the 
GBM cohort; f or details of the design and decision rules, refer to Section  11.3.  
4.3.3.2.  mTCC, TNBC, and NHL Cohorts  
For m TCC, TNBC and NHL cohorts,  a “basket” Bayesian hierarchical modeling design 
that allows the trial to be frequently monitored with the constraint of both Type I and 
Type II error rates  will be used .  Clinical response will be defined as ORR, per standard 
evaluation criteria (see Section 14.4 for defini tions of response assessments and criteria).  
Bayesian hierarchical modeling will be used to investigate the clinical activity of 
GSK3326595 in the four tumor -specific cohorts of subjects.  Hierarchical modeling 
allows information about the treatment effec t in one cohort to be ‘borrowed’ when 
estimating the treatment effect in another cohort [ Berry , 2013].   
Clinical activity will be monitored through frequent interim analyses.  The first interim 
analysis will be conducted when about 40 evaluable subjects are enrolled across the four 
tumor -specific cohorts  (mTCC, TNBC , p53 WT NHL , and p53 mutant NHL)  at a dose 
level based on RP2D or at least 10 evaluable subjects are available in any cohort.  
Subjects treated at the RP2D in Part 1, with disease subtypes under study in Part 2, will 
be incorpo rated into clinical activity analysis provided that they are evaluable.  Each 
subsequent interim analysis can be conducted after every five additional subjects become 
evaluable.  The timing of subsequent interim analyses will be based on the enrol lment 
rate into each of the cohorts with the expected duration of Part 2 of the trial to be 104 
weeks.  A subject is evaluable for the interim futility analysis if they  have  either 
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 49 
 progressed or d ied, withdr awn from the study treatment, or are ongoing and have 
completed at least two post baseline disease assessment s. 
Decisions are based on whether the posterior probability that the ORR exceeds its 
corresponding historical control is sufficiently low compared to fixed statistical 
thresholds. If this posterior probability is sufficiently low within a given cohort ( 0.15), 
then enrollment may be halted early for futility. At the final analysis and after the study 
has been closed, if the posterior probability is sufficiently high ( 0.87), then the d ose will 
be declared efficacious for that cohort. Separate from model estimates, the observed ORR 
will also be reported for each cohort.  
Enrollment into each disease -specific cohort will continue during the conduct of each 
interim analysis subsequent to th e decision of whether or not to declare futility.  The total 
number may be increased up to a total of 32 evaluable subjects for the TNBC cohort, up 
to a total of 25 evaluable subjects for each of the two NHL cohorts, and up to 40 
evaluable subjects for the  mTCC  cohort, depending on the results observed; a separate 
decision will be made for each disease cohort.  Enrollment into each tumor specific 
cohorts can only be terminated for futility (i.e., lack of clinical activity), notwithstanding 
the provisions of  Section 5.5; otherwise enrol lment will continue to the planned 
maximum sample size in each cohort.  Inference stemming from the Bayesian 
hierarchical model of GSK3326595 efficacy in subjects harboring these four tumor types 
are intended to inform decision making.  Actual decisions wil l depend on the totality of 
the data.  
Subjects enrolled in Part 1 may be included in the Part 2 efficacy analysis provided that 
they were treated at the RP2D and have a disease under study in Part 2 . 
The decision to terminate a disease -specific cohort will  not depend solely on the results 
of the statistical model but will take all factors into account, including the results of the 
model, safety, tolerability, PK, and PD data.  In some cases (e.g., under -representation of 
a given predictive biomarker in the subjects treated at the time of interim analysis), 
additional subjects in a cohort may be enrolled even if the model suggests a low 
likelihood of activity in that tumor type.  
4.3.3.3.  ACC Cohort s (Capsule and Tablet Formulation)  
The Simon’s optimal two stage design  will be utilized for the ACC cohort s.  Up to 38 
subjects  in the capsule cohort will be enrolled , and up to 50 subjects in the tablet cohort 
will be enrolled . One interim analysis will be performed in each cohort after at least the 
first 10 treated subjects  for the capsule cohort and the first 17 treated subjects for the 
tablet cohort become  evaluable (i.e. who have had at least three post -baseline 
assessments, have progressed or died, or have permanently discontinued from study 
treatment ). Please refer to Section  11.5 for details of the design and decision rules.  
4.3.3.4.  Hormone Receptor -Positive Breast Cancer Cohort  
The ER+BC cohort will employ a Bayesian adaptive design that allows the study to be 
frequently monitored with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates . The first 
interim futility analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 10 evaluable subje cts who 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 50 
 have had at least two post -baseline assessments, have progressed or died, or have 
permanently discontinued from study treatment . If the cohort does not meet the futility 
criteria, then up to 25 additional subjects may be enrolled in this cohort; fo r details of the 
design and decision rules, refer to Section  11.6. 
4.3.3.5.  HPV-Positive Solid Tumor Cohort  
The HPV -positive  cohort will employ a Bayesian a daptive design that allows the study to 
be frequently monitored with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates . The 
first interim futility analysis will be conducted after a minimum of 10 evaluable subjects 
who have had at least two post-baseline assessments, have progressed or died, or have 
permanently discontinued from study treatment . If the cohort does not meet the futility 
criteria , then u p to 18 additional subjects may be enrolled in th is cohort; f or details of the 
design an d decision rules, refer to Section  11.7. 
4.3.3.6.  NSCLC Cohort  
The p53 wild -type NSCLC cohort will be used to estimate the clinical activity for 
GSK3326595 for this population. The analysis will be performed on a minimum of 10 
and maximum of 15 evaluable subjects with confirmed p53 wild -type status. The 
additional 5 subjects are intended to account for any discrepancies between local p53 
testing and central, comp rehensive testing to ensure a minimum of 10 evaluable p53 
wild-type subjects. Only those evaluable subjects whose central test results confirm p53 
wild-type status will be included in the analysis. A subject is evaluable for analysis if 
they have either pr ogressed or died, withdrawn from the study treatment, or are ongoing 
and have completed at least two post -baseline disease assessments. A Simon’s optimal 
two stage design will be utilized as a framework for the analysis of this cohort, where one 
interim an alysis will be performed after at least the first 10 treated subjects become 
evaluable. Please refer to Section  11.5 for details of the design and de cision rules.  
4.4. Part 3: GSK3326595 + Pembrolizumab Combination Study  
[Active in a ll regions, except France ] 
The primary objective of Part 3 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK3326595 
when administered in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select solid 
tumors.  As described in Section  4.4.4 , three cohorts will be evaluated .  All subjects will 
receive pembrolizumab at the ap proved dose  (200 mg IV every 3 weeks  [q3w] ), in 
combination with GSK3326595 dosed orally at 100 mg QD, 200 mg QD, or 300 mg QD.   
 
 
 
All available data from Part 3, including safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK, and PD will be 
used to select a dose of GSK3326595 to be administered with pembrolizumab in future 
studies.  In order to collect PD data, pre - and on -study  biopsies will be required for all 
subjects.  Subjects will receive GSK3326595 at the assigned dose as monotherapy for 
14 days, at which time the on -study biopsy will be collected.  Subjects will then 
commence therapy with pembrolizumab administered every 3 weeks .  Safety will be

TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 51 
 assessed continuously .  Cohort(s) may be closed to further enrolment based on toxicity 
emerging a t any time on study, as described in Section  4.4.4 . 
4.4.1.  Type and Number of Subjects (Part 3)  
The study population will be adults, with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 
melanoma, mTCC, or HNSCC that have failed to respond to treatment  (e.g., SD , with 
subsequent documented progress ion as per iRECIST , or PD as best response) with prior 
PD-1 or PD -L1 directed therapy.  Subjects who initially responded (e.g., i PR or iCR) to 
these therapies, then subsequently progressed, will not be eligible for participation in 
Part 3.  In addition , squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix patients  that have progressed 
on or after  PD-1 or PD -L1 directed therapy or are PD -1/PD -L1 treatment naïve will be 
enrolled in Part 3 . For full details of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section  5.1. 
Overall, approximately  30 subjects will be enrolled in Part 3.  These subjects will be 
divided evenly between three  cohorts, each receiving a different dose of GSK3326595 in 
combination with a single dose of pembrolizumab.   For details of subject enrolment , 
please refer to  Section 4.4.4  and to  the SRM.    
  
 
 
4.4.2.  Treatment Arms and Duration  
All subjects in Part 3 will receive GSK3326595 in combination with pembrolizumab .  
Subjects may continue therapy with GSK3326595  until progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or withdrawal of consent.   Subjects may continue therapy with pembrolizumab 
until progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent , for a maximum of 
24 months.  
4.4.3.  Dose Selection  
Subjects will be assigned  prior to first dose to receive either 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300  mg 
of GSK3326595 administered once daily , based on the dose escalation schema described 
in Section 4.4.4 .  All subjects will receive pembrolizumab at the approved dose (200 mg 
IV every 3 weeks).  Subjects may dose -interrupt and/or dose -reduce GSK3326595 and/or 
dose interruption of pembrolizumab for toxicity as described in Section 14.2. There will 
be no intra -subject dose escalation .  Subjects who require dose interruption  of 
GSK3326595 and/or pembrolizumab , and/or dose reduction of GSK3326595  for toxicity 
may continue on pr otocol at the lower dose  or delayed schedule . 
4.4.4.  Cohort  Design  
Overall, approximately  10 subjects per dose level may be enrolled.  Allowing for late 
screen failures and early (non -AE related) withdrawals/discontinuations, up to 6 subjects  
may be enrolled to deliver a minimum of 5 evaluable subjects  for each dose decision 
meeting .  Each subject must complete the 35 -day DLT evaluation period, and the 
available safety data must be reviewed before a decision is made on whether to proceed 
to the next dose level. If a subject fails to receive more than 80% of the planned doses of 
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 52 
 GSK3326595 or full first cycle of pembrolizumab within the 35 -day DLT evaluation 
period for reasons other than toxicity, the subject will be replaced. Refer to Table 15 for 
the schedule of activities for subjects enrolled in Part 3.  Dosing will commence in the 
100 mg cohort .  Safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis  by, at a minimum, the GSK 
medical monitor  and GSK Global Safety representative.  
Figure 4-2 Part 3 Schema  
 
 
 
 
Enrollme nt into Part 3 will occur in two stages at each dose level. The target sample size 
for each stage is 5 subjects, however, an additional  subject may be enrolled  at stage 1 and 
stage 2 of each dose leve l, to deliver a minimum of 5 subjects per stage and at l east 10 
subjects per dose level .  Hence, it is possible that six subjects may be dosed in stage 1 or 
stage 2, resulting in 11 total subjects at any one dose level.  At the analysis of each stage, 
the full number of subjects dosed will be included, i.e. if 6 subjects are dosed in stage 1, 
data from all 6 subjects will be used to make the decision to either stop or continue 
enrolment at the current dose level.  
Five (or six)  subjects may be enrolled immediately  at the 100 mg dose level  (stage 1) .  
Planned analys is of the cohort safety data will take place in a dose decision meeting  (see 
Section  4.4.4.1 ) after all subjects dosed in stage 1  complete 35 d ays of study treatment 
(i.e., 5  weeks of GSK3326595, as well as the first cycle of pembrolizumab treatment) or 
discontinue prior to 35 days  Figure 4-2; A).  It is recommended that the cohort stop 
enrolling for safety reasons  if the following criterion is met:  
• 3 or more subjects out of the first 5  or 6 enrolled experience a toxicity (at any 
time on -study) as described in Section 4.4.4.1  
If the safety stopping criteria (as defined in Section 4.4.4.1 ) are not triggered by the first 
5 (or 6)  subjects, enrollment may continue, with continuous evaluation of safety after 
each subject enrolled. The additional 5 subjects may all be enrolled imme diately  at the 
same dose level .  The cohort will be recommended to stop for safety and higher dose 
cohorts will not be opened  (Figure 4-2; B) if the following criterion is met:  
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 53 
 • 4 or more subjects in the 100 mg dose level  (i.e. 10 or 11 subjects)  experience a 
toxicity (at any time on -study) described in Section 4.4.4.1  
Once 10  (or 11)  subjects at the 100 mg dose level have completed at least 35 days of 
study treatment ( Figure 4-2; B), the safety data from the cohort will be reviewed in a dose 
decision meeting, in accordance with the Dose Escalation Plan.  All safety events from all 
Part 3 subjects on treatment  will be reviewed prior to dose escalation.  Upon the 
agreement at the dose decision meeting , the 200 mg cohort may open.  
Five (or six)  subjects may be enrolled in the 200 mg cohort immediately  (stage 1) , and 
evaluation and further enrolment will proceed as described above for the 100 mg cohort  
(Figure 4-2; C).  Once all 10  (or 11)  subjects have been enrolled in the 200 mg cohort 
(Figure 4-2; D), then all available safety data will be reviewed in a dose decision meeting 
prior to making a decision about opening the 300 mg cohort.  
Five (or six)  subjects may be enrolled in the 300 mg cohort, and evaluation and further 
enrolment will proceed as the 100 mg and 200 mg cohorts ( Figure 4-2; E).  
Approximately  10 (or 11)  subjects may be enrolled in the 300 mg cohort.  
If, at any time, more than 4 subjects per cohort at a lower dose meet the stopping criteria 
described in Section  4.4.4.1 , then further enrolment in higher dose cohort(s) may be 
terminated upon review of all available safety data (Figure 4-2; F).  In the event that a 
dose cohort is closed to further enrolment, subjects already enrolled in Part 3 may 
continue to receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
withdrawal of consent as described in Section 4.4.2 . 
4.4.4.1.  Safety Stopping Criteria  
As described above, all available safety data will be reviewed in dose decision meetings :  
after the first 5  (or 6)  subjects in each cohort complete 35 days of study treatment , or 
discontinue prior to 35 days  (Figure 4-2; A, C, and E); and after all 10 (or 11) subjects in 
each cohort complete 35 days of study treatment, or disc ontinue prior to 35 days ( Figure 
4-2; B and D).  Dose decision meetings will be attended by the GSK medical monitor, 
GSK clinical scientist, GSK safety p hysician, GSK clinical pharmacologist, and the 
Investigators .  Agreement to proceed with dosing in the cohort , or to open the next cohort 
to enrolment , will be made in accordance with the Dose Escalation Plan .  Safety data will 
also be reviewed on an ongoi ng basis  (Figure 4-2; F).   
The number of subjects with adverse events meeting one or more of  the following 
criteria, emerging at any time during study treatment, will be defined .  In all cases, “drug -
related” may  pertain to either GSK3326595 or pembrolizumab alone, or the two 
administered in combination : 
• Any drug-related Grade 4 non -hematological toxicity  
• Any drug-related Grade 4 hematological toxicity , or any drug -related Grade 3 
hematological toxicity  that does not recover to Grade 2 or better within 1  week of 
interrupting therapy . 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 54 
 • Any drug-related hepatic toxicity that meets liver stopping criteria as defined in 
Section 5.4.5  
• Any drug -related Grade 2 or greater toxicity that , in the opinion of the 
Investigator and Medical Monitor , should limit further enrolment into the study  
• Inability to receive at least 80% of s cheduled doses in the DLT observation period 
due to drug-related  toxicity.  
If it is clearly established that the event is unrelated to treatment, the event will not meet 
the above  criteria.  Grade 4 toxicities that are known to occur with pembrolizumab 
therapy and are controlled within 2 weeks using the recommended supportive measures 
(refer to Section 14.2.2  and Section 14.2.3 ) do not meet the above criteria  (though could 
be considered cause for stopping based on the clinical judgement of the Investigator(s) 
and Medical Monitor).  These kno wn toxicities will be evaluated during dose decision 
meetings, to assess for parameters that include increases in frequency or severity.     
Subjects who are unable to receive at least 80% of scheduled doses during the 35 -day 
DLT observation period  for reas ons other than drug-related toxicity (e.g. acute illness, 
disease progression) will not be evaluable for DLT purposes and will be replaced in the 
cohort.  
The safety stopping criteria were chosen to align with an mTPI -2 [Guo, 2017]  design 
with a target toxicity rate of 40%, considering the longer watch period for observing 
adverse events. This will allow for higher accumulation of events and renders the 
traditional design too conservative for the purpose of this study. The safety st opping 
criteria were confirmed via simulation of the operating characteristics of the model 
(provided in  Section 11.10.4 ).  If the decision is made t o close enrolment at a particular 
dose, then further enrolment in higher -dose cohorts may also be terminated at that time.   
4.4.5.  Statistical Design  
No formal statistical hypothesis will be tested in this cohort. Analyses will be descriptive 
and exploratory.  
4.5. Type and Number of Subjects  (Overall)  
All subjects enrolled in this study will have a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory cancer 
for which no standard therapy is expected to provide a significant response.  It is 
estimated that a maximum of 412 subjects will be enrolled in the study, divided as 
follows:  As planned, approximately  42 subjects will be enrolled in the dose escalation 
phase of Part 1.  In addition, approximately 12 subjects will be enrolled in the 
PK/PD/biomarker/metabolite cohort(s)  and approximately 12 subjects  but no more than 
24 subjects  will be enrolled in the food effect and relative bioavailability cohort .  An 
additional 316 subjects may be enrolled in the disease -specific efficacy cohorts of Part 2.  
Approximately  30 subjects may be enrolled in Part 3.  Further details of the type and 
number of subjects are available in Section 4.2.1 , Section  4.3.1 , and  Section  4.4.1 .

 4.6. Design Justification  
Given the high unmet medical need of relapsed/refractory advanced solid tumors and 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, this three -part Phase I study (204653) is proposed.  The study 
compri ses a dose -escalation part , followed by a series of cohorts to determine preliminary 
efficacy  in selected tumor types, as well as a dose -finding study of GSK3326595 plus 
pembrolizumab to identify a starting dose  of GSK3326595  for future study(s) . 
4.6.1.  Part 1  
Part 1 is a conventional dose -escalation study using the mTPI approach, a well -validated 
method to identify the MTD/RP2D of a given compound.  While preliminary efficacy 
data will be collected as part of the course of this Part, it will not be a primary en dpoint.  
In addition to identification of MTD/RP2D, blood and urine collections will be 
performed to characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of GSK3326595 as well as to 
partially characterize the biomarker profile of GSK3326595 treatment.  
4.6.2.  Additional Ph armacodynamic, Metabolic & Biomarker Profiling  
All subjects in Part 1 will be evaluated for pharmacodynamic data.   
 (  has been identified and validated as a pharmacodynamic 
biomarker of PRMT5 inhibition in multiple preclinical in vitro  and in vivo  studies.  
Analysis of  will provide valuable information regarding target engagement by 
GSK3326595.  
A cohort of subjects in Part 1, treated at or close to the MTD, will be evaluated more 
extensively for metabolic and biomarker profiling (Section 4.2.5 ).  This cohort wi ll 
provide samples for biomarker, pharmacodynamic, and metabolite assessment.  Analysis 
of human samples will provide first -hand information on metabolism and disposition of 
GSK3326595 in humans.  
 
 
.   
4.6.3.  Food Effect and Relative Bioavailability  Profiling  
A subset of subjects in Part  1, treated at 300 mg, will be evaluated more extensively to 
preliminarily evaluate the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of GSK3326595 
(Section 4.2.6 ).  A relative  assessment of bioavailability  between capsules and tablets 
will also be conducted in this group.  This cohort will provide data that can be used to 
modify dosing instructions for subjects in this and future studies (e.g., GSK3326595 may 
be taken without r espect to food, or GSK3326595 must be taken on an empty stomach) .  
It will also  be used to support development of GSK3326595 tablet formulation . If the 
GSK3326595 tablet bioavailabil ity is comparable  to that of the GSK3326595 capsules, 
then any newly enrol led or ongoing subjects in any of the  cohorts may be allowed to 
move over from the capsules to the tablets , once they have been  notifi ed by the Sponsor.

 4.6.4.  Part 2  
Part 2 is a disease -specific preliminary study of efficacy, examining the effect of 
GSK3326595 on tumor growth (as measured by ORR  [mTCC, TNBC, ACC, ER+BC, 
HPV -positive solid tumor, NSCLC and NHL cohorts] or six -month PFS rate [GBM 
cohort] ).  Interim analyses and rules for stopping for futility are described in Section 11 
and in the Report and Analysis Plan (RAP).  
4.6.5.  Part 3  [Active in a ll regions, except France]  
Part 3 is a dose -escalation  study using a continuous assessment approach, a well-
validated method to identify safety and toxicity of a given regimen.  While efficacy, PK, 
and PD will be collected in the course of this part, these will not be primary endpoints.  
However, all available data will be used to identify a recommended dos e for further 
evaluation in future clinical studies.

  204653  
 80 
 13. History of optic nerve neuropathy or neuritis.  
5.3. Screening/Baseline/Run -in Failures  
Screen failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical trial but 
are never subsequently enrolled. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure 
subjects, meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements, and respond to queries from Regulatory authorities, a minimal set of screen 
failure inform ation is required including Demography, Screen Failure details, Eligibility 
Criteria, and any Serious Adverse Events.  
5.4. Withdrawal/Stopping Criteria  
5.4.1.  Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects will receive study treatment until disease progression, death or unacceptable 
adverse event, including meeting stopping criteria for liver chemistry, hematologic/non -
hematologic toxicity, or corrected QT interval duration  (QTc) prolongation, as defined in 
Section 5.4.5  through Section 5.4.7 . 
In addition , study treatment may be permanently discontinued for any of the following 
reasons:  
• deviation(s) from the protocol  
• request of the subject or proxy  
• investigator’s discretion  
• subject is lost to follow -up 
• study is closed or terminated.  
• study  drug is no longer available  
Note that discontinuation from study treatment does NOT equal complete withdrawal 
from the study (all efforts should be made to keep subjects  with a diagnosis of ACC  who 
withdraw from treatment on study for survival follow -up). 
Subjects in Part 3  may be treated past progression as described in Section 14.4.4 . 
Subjects in Parts 1 and 2 with equivocal progression or with rising tumor markers in the 
absence of radiographic progression may continue on study therapy provided that safety 
related stopping criteria are not met .  
Subjects in Parts 1 and 2 with progressive disease  (PD) may remain on study on a case -
by-case basis (e.g., as long as the Investigator and the GSK  Medical Monitor concur that 
the subject  could continue to receive benefit, the subject is not experiencing serious 
toxicity, and there is no alternative treatment that is likely to benefit the subject) .  
Discussion b etween the Investigator and the Medical Monitor  must occur in order for a 
subject to continue study treatment once PD has been confirmed .  Subjects who continue 
on study beyond confirmed progression should continue to undergo all assessments 
described in t he Time and Events Table. Subjects who demonstrate continued progression 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 81 
 at subsequent scheduled scans may be required to discontinue therapy at the discretion of 
the Investigator and the Medical Monitor . 
For subjects in all Parts of the study, t he primary reason study treatment was permanently 
discontinued must be documented in the subject’s medical records and electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
If the subject voluntarily discontinues from treatment due to toxicity, ‘adverse event’ will 
be reco rded as the primary reason for permanent discontinuation on the eCRF.  
Once a subject has permanently discontinued from study treatment, the subject will not 
be allowed to be retreated.  
All subjects who discontinue from study treatment will have safety as sessments at the 
time of discontinuation and during post study treatment follow -up as specified in Time 
and Events Tables (see Section 8.1).   
Any s ubject in  the ACC tablet cohort  who has not yet shown objective radiological 
disease progression at treatment discontinuation should be continued to be followed as 
per RECIST 1.1 for radiological progression.  
All subjects who permanently discontinue study treatment will be followed for survival 
and new anti -cancer therapy (including radiotherapy) every 6 months until death  or 
termination of the study by the sponsor. If subjects are unable or unwilling to attend 
clinic visits during follow -up, the investigat or should inform the subject of modified 
follow -up options (eg, telephone call, email, contact with a relative or treating physician, 
or information from medical records).  
Note: following Protocol Amendment 7, survival follow -up should only be conducted fo r 
subjects with a diagnosis of ACC.   
Following P rotocol Amendment 8  implementation, all recruited subjects  who no longer 
receive study treatment will be considered to have completed the study  and only subjects  
still deriving benefit from GSK3326595 as assessed by the Investigator may continue to 
receive study treatment.  
5.4.2.  Lost to Follow -up 
A subject will be considered potentially lost to follow -up if he fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be con tacted by study sites.  
The following actions must be taken in relation to a subject who fails to attend the clinic 
for a required study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the subject and re -schedule the missed visit as 
soon as possible.  
• The site must  counsel the subject on the importance of maintaining the assigned 
visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the subject wishes to and/or should 
continue in the study.  
• In cases where the subject is deemed ‘lost to follow up’, the investigator or 
designe e must make every effort to regain contact with the subject (where 
possible, 3 telephone calls and if necessary a certified letter to the subject’s last 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 82 
 known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts 
should be documented in the subject’s medical record.  
Efforts to reach the subject should continue until the end of the study. Should the subject 
continue to be unreachable  at the end of the study , only then will he/she be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study with a primary r eason of “Lost to Follow -up”.  
5.4.3.  Withdrawal from the study  
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral or 
administrative reasons, as des cribed above.  
If a subject withdraws consent, the investigator/site staff must specifically ask if they are 
withdrawing consent to:  
• Further participation in the study including any further follow -up (eg, survival 
calls, consultation of medical records for  vital status ) 
• Further participation in study assessments excluding  survival follow -up 
[relevant for Part 2 and Part 3 subjects only] (eg, survival calls , consultation 
of medical records for vital status ) 
• The use of option al and/or mandatory biological samples that have not already 
been analysed  (remaining unanalyzed samples must be destroyed)  
The investigator must document consent withdrawal in the site study records and CRF.  
If the subject has actively withdrawn consent to the processing of their personal data, the 
vital status of the subject can be obtained by site personnel from publicly available 
resources, where it is possible to do so under applicable local laws.  
Following P rotocol Amendment 8  implementation, all recrui ted subjects  who no longer 
receive study treatment will stop entirely and only subjects  still deriving benefit from 
GSK3326595 as assessed by the Investigator may continue to receive study treatment. At 
the point of discontinuation of study treatment  (including 30 -day safety follow up) , 
subjects  will be considered to have completed the study.  If a subject withdraws consent, 
the investigator / site staff  must document consent withdrawal in the site study records.  
5.4.4.  End of Survival Follow -up  
In Part 2  or Part 3 (whichever is latest) , unless a disease cohort is closed early, survival 
follow -up will continue in each cohort until approximately 70% of the total number of 
subjects have progressed or died.  At such time, the cohort will be closed and any fur ther 
follow -up on subjects enrolled in that cohort will cease. Subjects with radiologically 
confirmed lack of disease progression who are still receiving GSK3326595 at the time of 
study completion may continue treatment through a separate mechanism (e.g., roll-over 
protocol).  
Note: following Protocol Amendment 7, survival follow -up will only be conducted for 
subjects  in Part 1 and Part 2 with a diagnosis of ACC .  Survival follow -up with continue 
until approximately 70% of ACC subjects  have died.

 Following Protocol Amendment 8 implementation, all recruited subjects  who no longer 
receive study treatment will stop entirely and only subjects  still deriving benefit from 
GSK3326595 as assessed by the Investigator may continue to receive study treatment . 
5.4.5.  Liver Chem istry Stopping Criteria  
Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure 
subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety guidance [ www.fda.gov , 2009 ]).  
See Figure 5-1 and Figure 5-2 for liver stopping criteria for subjects without and with 
liver metastases, respectively.

Liver Safety Required Actions and Follow up Assessments Section can be found in 
Appendix 6 . 
5.4.5.1.  Study Treatment Restart or Rechallenge  
If subject meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge subject with 
study treatment unless:  
• GSK Medical Governance approval is granted  
• Ethics and/or institutional review board (IRB) approval is obtained, if required, 
and 
• Separate consent for treatment restart/rechallenge is signed by the subject  
Refer to Appendix 7  for full guidance.  
5.4.6.  QTc Stopping Criteria  
If a subject meets the corrected QT (QTc) interval duration criteria below, study 
treatment(s) will be withheld.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 85 
 • QTcF interval ≥ 500 msec OR interva l increase from baseline  60 msec: 
GSK3326595 will be discontinued unless the benefits of therapy outweigh the 
risk of rechallenge in the opinion of the investigator, the GSK Medical Monitor, 
as well as the GSK medical governance. In this situation, recha llenge may be 
permitted (see Appendix 2  for rechallenge guidelines).  
NOTE:  In order to determine whether QT interval meets stopping criteria, the QT 
interval duration criteria should be based on the average QTc value of triplicate 
electrocardiograms (ECGs) , includ ing manual over -read. Routine ECG monitor does not 
require triplica te measurement.  However , if an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT 
interval, obtain 2 additional ECGs over a brief period (e.g., within approximately 10 
minutes of the abnormal ECG, if possible, and approximately 10 minutes apart from each 
other), and then us e the averaged QTc values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the 
subjects should have study treatment discontinued.  
The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF; defined as [QT/(RR1/3)]). 
• For eligibility and w ithdrawal, QTcF will be used for all subjects.  
• For purposes of data analysis, QTcF  will be used.  
5.4.7.  Other Stopping Criteria  
Stopping criteria for hematologic toxicities are detailed in Table 24. To monitor for 
hematologic toxicity, CBCs will be drawn weekly for the first three weeks of study, and 
then every three weeks, as described in the Time and Events table.  Subjects who develop 
Grade 2 or greater ane mia or thrombocytopenia may be monitored more frequently, as 
clinically indicated.  Please see Appendix 2  for suggested management of hematologic 
toxicity.  
Safety will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the Safety Review Team (SRT) which 
will be compromised of, at a minimum, a GSK me dical monitor, GSK Global Safety 
representative, and GSK clinical study representative (including a representative from 
Biostatistics). Deaths, SAEs, and Grade 3/4 adverse events will be carefully evaluated for 
the possibility of causality.  
If clinically s ignificant adverse events or toxicities are observed in more than one third of 
the subjects, and/or if deaths related to study drug are observed, enrollment may be 
terminated and/or a lower -dose cohort may be opened or expanded.  
5.5. Subject and Study Completio n 
In Part 1 , a subject who is not treated with the RP2D will be considered to have 
completed the study if:  
• they complete screening assessments, at least 21 days of study treatment and the 
post-treatment follow -up visit, or  
• they discontinue study treatment for progression or reasons listed in Section 5.4. 
A subject who is treated at RP2D will be considered to have comp leted the study if:  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 86 
 • they discontinue study treatment for reasons listed in Section 5.4, or 
• they die while receiving study treatment, or  
• are receivin g ongoing study treatment at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to 
close the study /perform the final analysis.  
In Part 2 and Part 3, a subject will be considered to have completed the study if:  
• they withdraw consent to any further study participation  
• they die while on study treatment or during the survival follow -up 
• they are ongoing on study at the time of the Sponsor’s decision to close the 
study/perform the final analysis.  
The end of the study is defined as the completion of all cohorts as defined in Sect ion 5.4, 
or termination of the study at any time by the Sponsor.  
Subjects who have not died and are no longer being followed for survival are cons idered 
to have discontinued the study. The End of Study eCRF should only be completed when a 
subject is no longer being followed. The study may be considered completed for purposes 
of a final analysis when 70% of subjects  enrolled in Part 2 or Part 3 (whichever is latest) 
have progressed or died.  
Final Last Subject Last Visit will be defined as patient’s treatment discontinuation 
(including 30 -day safety follow up).   
Following Protocol Amendment 8, the end of this study is defined as the date of the la st 
visit of the last subject undergoing the study.  
A final DCO , closure of the study database  and final analysis will occur when all subjects  
have either died, discontinued treatment (including 30 -day safety follow up),  withdrawn 
consent, or have consented to continue with treatment as defined in this amendment . 
When the Protocol Amendment 8 is implemented at a site, the collection of data for all 
enrolled subject s who no longer receive study treatment will stop entirely . Those subjects  
still benefiting from GSK3326595 in the opinion of their treating Investigator may 
continue to receive study treatment  until the end of availability of study drug which is 
anticipated to be Q3 2023 . 
6. STUDY TREATMENT  
6.1. GSK3326595  and Pembrolizumab  
The term ‘study treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe GSK3326595 (or 
GSK3326595 plus pembrolizumab for subjects in Part 3) received by the subject as per 
the protocol design. Post Protocol Amendment 8 implementation, stu dy drug 
GSK3326595 will be provided until the end of availability of study treatment , which is 
anticipated to be Q3 2023.

 88 
 Pembrolizumab  will either be provided to the sites in cartons co ntaining vials  by GSK or  
will be  sourced locally by the sites themselves.  When provided by GSK, the contents of 
the label will be in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.  
6.4. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability  
No special preparatio n of study treatment is required  for GSK3326595 .  Refer to 
pembrolizumab prescribing information [ KEYTRUDA  PI, 2019] for relevant 
instructions.  
• Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only 
authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study 
treatments must be stored in a secure environmentally controlled and monitored 
(manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions 
with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. Please refer to 
guidance in the Study Reference Manual with regard to storage of IP and 
temperature excursion management.  
• The investigator, i nstitution, or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and 
record maintenance (e.g., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
• Further guidance and informatio n for final disposition of unused study treatment 
are provided in the SRM.  
Precaution will be taken to avoid direct contact with the study treatment. A Material 
Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) describing occupational hazards and recommended handling 
precautions for GSK3326595 will be provided to the investigator. In the case of 
unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor or GSK study 
contact.  
Limited exposure and precautionary action (example: wearing gloves, washing hands 
post exposur e) should be taken by site staff dispensing GSK3326595.  
6.5. Compliance with Study Treatment Administration  
At each visit, an evaluation of subject compliance with taken medication will be 
performed. The investigator will make every effort to bring non -complian t subjects into 
compliance.  
Compliance with GSK3326595 will be assessed through querying the subject during the 
site visits and documented in the source documents and CRF. A record of the number of 
GSK3326595 capsules /tablets  dispensed to and taken by eac h subject must be maintained 
and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records.  Treatment start and stop 
dates, including dates for treatment delays and/or dose reductions will also be recorded in 
the CRF.  
Following Protocol Amendment 8 implementation, refer to SRM for dispensing of study 
treatment and drug accountability.

 Pembrolizumab will be administered intravenously at site under medical supervision of 
an investigator or designee. The date and time of administration will be documente d in 
the source documents and reported in the CRF.  
6.6. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose  
For this study, any dose of GSK3326595 greater than the protocol -specified dose within a 
24 hour time period (± 4 hours) will be considered an overdose.  
GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose.  
In the event of an overdose the investigator (or treating physician) should:  
• Contact the Medical Monitor immediately  
• Closely monitor the subject for AEs/SAEs and laboratory abnormalities until 
GSK3326595 can n o longer be detected systemically (at least 28 days)  
• Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 3 days from the date of the last 
dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a 
case-by-case basis)  
• Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the 
overdosing in the CRF.  
Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator 
in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the subject.  
Post Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, overdoses are required to be reported to 
GSK via a paper process . 
An overdose of pembrolizumab is defined as 1000  mg (5 times the dose) of 
pembrolizumab. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the 
appropriate supportive clinical care be instituted as dictated by the participant’s clinical 
status.   
6.7. Treatment after the End of the Study  
Post study treatment will not be provided as part of the protocol. Upon discontinuation 
from assigned study treatment,  subjects may receive additional (non protocol) therapy at 
the discretion of the treating physician. New therapy should be documented on the CRF. 
Every effort should be made to complete the required withdrawal and follow up 
evaluations prior to initiating further therapy or dosing of an investigational agent (see 
Section 8.1 for follow -up assessments and procedures).  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post -
study care of the subject’s medical condition, whether or  not GSK is providing specific 
post-study treatment.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 Subjects receiving GSK3326595 at the time of DCO  date may continue to receive 
GSK3326595  under  Protocol  Amendment 8 ; GSK3326595 will be provided until the end 
of availability of study treatment , which is  anticipated to be Q3 of 2023.  
After the final DCO s ubjects  may continue to receive  GSK3326595 for as long as they 
derive clinical benefit from study treatment as assessed  by the Investigator and do not 
meet any protocol -defined study treatment stopping criteria  (maximum until the end of 
availability of study drug which is anticipated to be Q3 2023);  subjects  may choose to 
discontinue study treatment at any time.  
7. MEDICATION, LIFESTYL E, AND DIETARY 
RESTRICTIONS  
7.1. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapie s 
Subjects will be instructed to inform the investigator prior to starting any new 
medications from the Screening Visit until the end of the study (Final Study Visit). Any 
concomitant medication(s), including herbal preparations, taken during the study wil l be 
recorded in the eCRF. The minimum requirement is that drug name, route of 
administration, dose and frequency of dosing, along with start and stop dates of 
administration should be recorded. Additionally, a complete list of all prior cancer 
therapies w ill be recorded in the eCRF.  
Questions regarding concomitant medications should be directed to the GSK Medical 
Monitor for clarification.  
If future changes are made to the list of permitted/prohibited medications, formal 
documentation will be provided by G SK and stored in the study file. Any such changes 
will be communicated to the investigative sites in the form of a letter.  
7.1.1.  Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies  
Subjects should receive full supportive care during the study, including transfusions of  
blood and blood products, and treatment with erythropoietin, antibiotics, antiemetics, 
antidiarrheals, and analgesics, and other care as deemed appropriate, and in accordance 
with their institutional guidelines.  
Colony -stimulating factors like filgrastim  and pegfilgrastim may be used in Month 2 and 
beyond as clinically indicated.  The only caveat is that subjects should not receive those 
medications listed as prohibited in Section 7.1.2.1 . 
Bisphosphonates and denosumab will be allowed if subjects have been on a stable dose 
for at least three months prior to receiving the first dose of GSK3326595.  
7.1.2.  Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies  
7.1.2.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Subjects should not receive other anti -cancer therapy [including chemotherapy, 
immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy, or hormonal therapy (other 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 91 
 than leuprolide,  other LHRH agonists/antagonists, or corticosteroids)] while on treatment 
in this study. Other anti -cancer therapy should not be administered unless one of the 
following occurs: documented disease progression; unacceptable or unmanageable 
toxicity; subject is withdrawn from the study at the i nvestigator’s discretion or consent is 
withdrawn; or no further clinical benefit is anticipated which requires permanent 
discontinuation of study drug.  
NOTE : with the exception of other systemic anti -cancer therapies, any medication 
(including antibacterials, antifungals, or antivirals) which are necessary for the health, 
well-being, and standard clinical care of oncology patients are exempt from the 
restrictions below.  
No in vitro  CYP phenotyping data are available for GSK3326595.  In the absen ce of 
these data, strong and moderate  inhibitors or inducers of CYP isoenzymes should not be 
co-administered with GSK3326595.  Any questions regarding co -administration of 
medications should be directed to the GSK medical monitor.  
GSK3326595 was found to b e a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P -gp) efflux transporters  in 
bidirectional permeability assays using Continuous cell of heterogeneous human 
epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco -2) and m adine -darby canine kidney  
(MDCK) -II monolayers.  GSK33265 95 should not be co -administered with strong and 
moderate  inhibitors of either  P-gp.  Such inhibitors include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and 
ketoconazole.  In addition, GSK3326595 is a substrate of MATE2 -K, OAT3 and OCT2 
uptake transporters; therefore, GSK33 26595 should not be co -administered with strong 
and moderate inhibitors or inducers of MATE2 -K, OAT3 and OCT2 . Such inhibitors 
include , but are not limited to,  cimetidine, probenecid, pyrimethamine,  metformin  and 
benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) .  
Any questions regarding co -administration of medications should be directed to the GSK 
medical monitor.  
7.1.2.2.  Prohibited Non -Drug Therapies  
Non-drug anti -cancer therapies (e.g., radiation therapy, surgery, and/or tumor 
embolization) will not be permitted from the sc reening visit through the post -study 
follow -up visit.  
NOTE : Subjects may receive focal palliative treatment (e.g., radiotherapy or 
radiofrequency ablation; limited to non -target lesions only) and/or surgical intervention 
(for example to address pain manag ement) during this study.  Any proposed focal therapy 
must be approved by the investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor prior to intervention.  
Subjects will abstain from using herbal preparations/medications throughout the study 
until the final study visit.  
Herbal products include, but are not limited to: St. John’s Wort, kava, ephedra (ma 
huang), gingko biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, 
ginseng, and marijuana.

 7.1.3.  Cautionary Medications  
The intrinsic clearance of the GSK3326595 molec ule is low in hepatocytes and liver 
microsomes from humans.  Its elimination half -life in plasma ranges from 3 hours to 6 
hours.  Its bioavailability following oral administration notably varies among species, 
from 17% in the mouse to 69% in the rat and to  90% in the dog.   
GSK3326595  is not an in vitro  inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 . GSK3326595 inhibited  CYP3A4  in vitro at concentrations much 
higher than clinically relevant.    
 risk have been identified as a CYP1A2 inducer. Co -administration of 
GSK3326595 and substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, melatonin, 
ramelteon, tasimelteon, ti zanidine) should be avoided in order to prevent inadvertent 
under -exposure to these agents. As noted in Section 7.1.2.1 , GSK3326595 is a substrate 
for P -gp.  Other P-gp substrates include medications such as 3 -hydroxy -3-methylglutaryl -
coenzyme A (HMG -CoA) reductase inhib itors (statins) and digoxin, which may have a 
narrow therapeutic index.  While co -administration of P -gp substrates with GSK3326595 
is not prohibited, they should be used with caution and additional monitoring for adverse 
effects should be utilized.   
Thou gh QT prolongation was not identified in pre -clinical animal studies of 
GSK3326595, the following medications have the potential to induce a prolonged QT 
and have been associated with torsades de pointes. Co -administration of GSK3326595 
and the following m edications is not prohibited, but they should be used with caution and 
with additional monitoring (e.g., more frequent electrocardiograms) as clinically 
appropriate from the time of the first dose of GSK3326595 until discontinuation from the 
study.

7.2. Dietary Restrictions  
• GSK3326595 will be administered under fasting conditions, with no food or 
antacids for 1  h before and 2  h after each dose.  Requirements for fasting before 
and after dosing may be modified based on available pharmacokinetics (PK), 
pharmacodynamics (PD) and safety data. Fasting will consist of avoiding  the 
oral ingestion of calorie -containing products; however, ingestion of water is 
permitted.  Subjects  will be instructed to record the time and date of study 
treatments and meals in relation to dosing in the supplied GSK dosing diary.  
Subjects will absta in from ingesting alcohol, tobacco products, caffeine - or xanthine -
containing products (e.g., coffee, tea, cola drinks, chocolate) for 24 hours prior to the start 
of dosing until collection of the final PK and or PD sample on Day 16. In addition, 
subjects should also abstain from ingesting these products prior to clinic visits on days 
scheduled for periodic PK and PD sample collection throughout the study.  
Subjects should abstain from consumption of Seville oranges, grapefruit, grapefruit 
hybrids or grapefr uit juice and/or pomelos, exotic citrus fruits, from one day prior to the 
first dose of study treatment until the last dose of study drug.  
• On serial PK sampling days, subjects should fast overnight (i.e., nothing by 
mouth apart from water and other medicat ions for at least 8 hours) and should 
continue fasting until at least 2 hours after administration of the morning dose.  
Fasting is required for 1 hour before and 2 hours after administration of  the 
evening dose for subjects in BID cohorts.  
If a subject vom its after taking study drug, the subject should be instructed not to retake 
the dose and should take the next scheduled dose.  
For subjects in the food effect sub -study, the administration on the ‘fed’ days will be 
performed as described in Section 4.2.6 .  All other days will be administered as described 
above.  
7.3. Lifestyle Restrictions  
7.3.1.  Female Subjects  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must not become pregnant and so must be 
sexually inactive by abstinence or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of < 1%.  
These allowed methods of contraception are only effective when used consistently, 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 94 
 correctly and in accordance with the product label. The investigator is responsible for 
ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use these methods of contraception.   
The chosen form(s) of contraception must be used consistently and properly from at least 
28 days prior to receiving study drug until at least 5 days plus one menstrual cycle after 
the last dose of GSK3326595  and for at least 4 months after the last dose of 
pembrolizumab or in accordance with local prescribing information if longer . (Part 3 
subjects only) . 
Abstinence  
Sexual inactivity by abstinence must be consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle 
of the subject and will continue to be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse on a long 
term and persistent basis. Periodic abstin ence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
Contraceptive Methods with a Failure Rate of  1% 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) that meets the <1%  failure 
rate as stated in the product label.  
• Hormonal means of birth control that meet the standard operating procedure 
(SOP) effectiveness criteria including a <1% rate of failure per year, as stated in 
the product label.  Such methods may include: contr aceptive subdermal 
implants, oral combination contraceptives, injectable progestogen, contraceptive 
vaginal ring, or percutaneous contraceptive patches.  
• Male partner sterilization (vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia) prior 
to the female subject's entry into the study, and this male is the sole partner for 
that subject. For this definition, “documented” refers to the outcome of the 
investigator's/designee’s medical examination of the subject or review of the 
subject's medical history for study eligi bility, as obtained via a verbal interview 
with the subject or from the subject’s medical records.  
7.3.2.  Male Subjects  
Male subjects with female partners of childbearing potential must comply with the 
following contraception requirements from the time of first d ose of study medication 
until at least at least 5 half -lives plus 90 days (approximately 95 days ) have elapsed after 
the last dose of GSK3326595:  
• Vasectomy with documentation of azoospermia.   
• Male condom plus partner use of one of the contraceptive option s below:  
• Contraceptive subdermal implant  
• Intrauterine device or intrauterine system  
• Oral Contraceptive, either combined or progestogen alone [Hatcher , 2011] 
Injectable progestogen [ Hatcher , 2011]  
• Contraceptive vaginal ring [ Hatcher , 2011]  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 95 
 • Percutaneous contraceptive patches [ Hatcher , 2011]  
This is an all -inclusive list of those methods that meet the following GSK definition of 
highly effective: having a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and 
corre ctly and, when applicable, in accordance with the product label. For non -product 
methods (e.g., male sterility), the investigator determines what is consistent and correct 
use. The GSK definition is based on the definition provided by the ICH [ ICH (M3) R2 , 
2009].  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that subjects understand how to properly use 
these methods of contraception.  
8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
Protocol waivers or exemptions are  not allowed with the exception of immediate safety 
concerns. Therefore, adherence to the study design requirements, including those 
specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for study conduct.  
This section lists the procedures and parameters of each planned study assessment.  The 
exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Time and Events Table Section 8.1.  
The following points must be noted:  
• If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, THEN the assessments 
should occur in the following order:  
1. 12-lead ECG  
2. vital signs  
3. blood draws.   
• Note: The timing of the assessments shoul d allow the blood draw to occur at the 
exact nominal time.  
• The timing and number of planned study assessments, including safety, 
pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic/biomarker or other assessments, may be 
altered during the course of the study based on newly a vailable data (e.g., to 
obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations) to ensure 
appropriate monitoring.  
• The change in timing or addition of time points for any planned study 
assessments must be documented in a Note to File which is approve d by the 
relevant GSK study team member and then archived in the study sponsor and 
site study files, but this will not require a protocol amendment.  
• The IRB/ Independent ethics committee (IEC) will be informed of any safety 
issues that require alteration of the safety monitoring scheme or amendment of 
the Informed Consent Form.  
Subjects  who continue to receive study treatment after the DCO date of the final analyses 
will be monitored and receive follow -up care in accordance with standard local clinical 
practice. Assessments will revert to the standard of care at a subject’s particular si te with 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 recommendation for local laboratory safety monitoring  (refer to SRM) . The  following 
assessments will be  required and  reported directly to the Sponsor via a paper process  up 
to 30 days after last dose of study treatment (refer to SRM and see Section  6.7): 
• SAEs  
• AEs leading to treatment discontinuation  
• AESIs (Pre -defined Ocular and Bone AEs)  
• Overdose  
• Pregnancy  
• Bone ( DEXA ) assessments  will be performed at the discretion of the investigator and 
reported  only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation.  
• Ophthalmic Assessments , will be required and reported only if reporting criteria is 
met for SAEs, A ESIs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation ; approximately 
every 6 months and at the end of the study treatment (if >8 weeks from previous 
assessment)  
Any SAE or AESI that is ongoing at the time of this data cut -off must be followed up to 
resolution unless the event is considered by the investigator unlikely to resolve, or the 
subject is lost to follow -up. GSK retains the right to request additional information for 
any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.

 1. If test performed within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment, testing at screening may not be required. Discuss with Medical Monitor if unclear  
2. See Section 8.3.1  for components of full and limited physical examinations  
3. See Appendix 3  for definition of ECOG performance status  
4. On serial PK days (Day 1 and Day 15), ECGs will be obtained at or about the time of PK sample co llection, as described in the SRM. On other days, ECGs will be obtained pre -
dose.  
5. If possible, DEXA to be performed on same machine for particular subject  
6. Only if EOT is > 8 weeks from prior DEXA  
7. Refer to Section 8.3.5  (Table 16) for complete listing of protocol -required laboratory assessments.  Clinical labs performed during screening within 72 hours of first dose do not 
need to be repeated on Day 1.  Folate and selected vitamins to be drawn at Screening, Week 4, Week 8, every 8 weeks  thereafter and at EOT. If a subject’s  folate or selected 
vitamins result(s) remain borderline or low at EOT visit, further testing may be requested until no longer deemed necessary i n the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
8. Refer to Section 8.3.7  for description of components of ocular assessment.  If a subject’s  ocular result(s) remain abnormal at EOT visit, further testing may be requested until no 
longer deemed necessary i n the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
9. On serial PK days (Day 1 and Day 15), subjects should fast from 8 hours prior to dose until 2 hours after dose.  On all other  days, GSK3326595 should be administered on an 
empty stomach at approximate ly the same time of day (± 4  h), with no food for 1 hour before and 2 hours after each dose. On serial PK days and for two days prior (Days 13 
through 16), subjects should attempt to take GSK3326595 within a 1  hour window (i.e., 23 -25 hours after the last dose).  
10. At each visit, the investigator should specifically ask the subject  about any changes in vision since their last visit/contact ( Section 9.2.2 ).  The investigator should document the 
response, consider if there are any reported events which meet the definition of an AE or SAEs, and intervene as clinically a ppropriate following discussion with the Medical 
Monitor if necessary.  
11. PK samples followin g Day 1 dose will be collected at Pre-dose (within 1 hour prior to dosing), 15m±5m, 30m±5m, 1h±5m, 1.5h±5m, 2h±5m, 3h±5m, 4h±10m, 6h±10m, 8h±15m, 
12h±2h, 24h2h (Day 2), and 48h2h (Day 3 ; prior to next dose ), post -dose. PK samples following Day 15 dose wi ll be collected at Pre -dose, (within 1 hour prior to dosing), 
30m±5m, 1h±5m, 2h±5m, 3h±5m, 4h±10m, 6h±10m, 8h±15m, 12h±2h, 24h 2h (Day 16, prior to next dose)  post dose. PK samples on days of subsequent visits should be 
collected within 1 hour Pre -dose . 
12. On Day 1, PD plasma samples should be collected within 1 hour Pre -dose.  PD plasma samples on Day 8 and Day 15 should be collected 6h post -dose 3 hours.  Samples should 
be collected and separated per the SRM.  
13. Plasma for circulating biomarker analysis will be collected pre -dose on Day 1 and 6h post dose 3 hours on Days 8 and 15.  
14. Refer to Section 8.2.1  for discussion of baseline biopsies.  Remaining biopsies are optional unless mandated for individual subject(s) (Section  4.2.5 ).  If a biopsy is required for PD 
analysis, fresh biopsies must be provided at screening, on Day 15, and at the end -of-study visit.  
15. Informed consent for optional substudies (e.g. genetics research) must be obtai ned before collecting any samples.  Appendix 8  describes requirements for genetic research.  
16. CT should be performed with oral and I V contrast.  CR or PR should be confirmed as per RECIST 1.1 criteria; see Section 14.4.1 . 
17. After week 32, scan frequencies are reduced.  See Section 8.2.2  for details.  
18. Repeat scans required at end of treatment (EOT) visit only if the last radiographic assessment was more than 8 weeks prior to  the subject’s withdrawal from study and progressive 
disease has not been documented . 
19. MRI Brain required at screening and then as clinically indicated thereafter ; subjects with untreated CNS lesions should have brain MRI performed at each disease assessment.  If 
MRI is contraindicated for an individual subject, then an equivalent study (e.g., contrast -enhanced MRI of the head) may be performed instead . 
20. Survival Follow -Up via telephone, email or other form of communication, every 6 months.   Following Protocol A mendment 7, survival follow -up should only be conducted for 
subjects with a diagnosis of ACC .  Follow -up will continue until approximately 70% of subjects  with a diagnosis of ACC  have died.   See Section 5.4 for further details .

7. Thyroid function testing including TSH, free T3, and free T4 are to be drawn at Screening, Week 4 or 6, then every 8 weeks st arting at Week 8 and EOT. Refer to Section 
8.3.5 (Table 16) for complete listing of protocol -required laboratory assessments. Folate and selected vitamins to be drawn at Screening, Week 4, Week 8, every 8 weeks 
thereafter and at EOT. If a subject’s folate or selected vitamins result(s) remain borderline or low at EOT visit, further te sting may be requested until no longer deemed 
necessary in the opinion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
8. Refer to Section 8.3.7  for description of components of ocular assessment.  If a subject’s ocular result(s) remain abnormal at EOT visit, further te sting may be requested until 
no longer deemed necessary in the opin ion of the Investigator and Medical Monitor.  
9. On serial PK days (Day 1 and Day 15), subjects should fast from 8 hours prior to dose until 2 hours after dose.  On all other  days, GSK3326595 should be administered on 
an empty stomach at approximately the sam e time of day (± 4  h), with no food for 1 hour before and 2 hours after each dose  
10. At each visit, the investigator should specifically ask the subject about any changes in vision since their last visit/contac t (Section 9.2.2 ).  The investigator should document 
the response, consider if there are any reported events which meet the definition of an AE or SAEs, and intervene as clinical ly appropriate follow ing discussion with the 
Medical Monitor if necessary.  
11. Plasma PK samples on Day 1 will be collected at Predose (within 1 hour prior to dosing), 30m±5m, 1h±5m, 2h±5m, 4h±10m, 6h±10m, 8h±15m, 12h±2h, 24h 2h (Day 2  
prior to next dose) post dose. Additional PK samples will be collected at the following time points: on Day 15 within 1 hr be fore dosing and between 1 and 3 hrs post dose, on 
Day 15 between 5 and 8 hrs post dose (in the NSCLC and ACC tablet cohorts only),  and at subsequent scheduled visits within 1 hr before dosing.  
12. Refer to Section 8.2.1  for discussion of baseline biopsies. Fresh screening biopsy s hould be taken within 14 days prior to the first dose. Paired biopsy to be taken on Day 15 
after 14 days of GSK3326595 dosing. EOT biopsy to be obtained as able for all subjects.  Subjects in GBM expansion cohort may  submit archival tumor sample at screeni ng.  
Day 15 and EOT biopsy not required for GBM cohort.  The fresh biopsy will be used to determine p53 status if no archival sample is available

 8.2. Screening and Critical Baseline Assessments  
Cardiovascular medical history/risk factors (as detailed in the CRF) will be assessed at 
screening.  
The following demographic parameters will be captured: year of birth, sex, race and 
ethnicity.  
Medical/medication/family history will be assessed as related to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria listed in Section 5.  Medical, surgical, and treatment history including date of first 
diagnosis, best response to prior systemic therapy, histology, and current sites  of disease 
will be taken as part of the medical history and disease status. Details concerning 
concomitant medication will be recorded starting from screening through post -study 
follow -up. At a minimum, the drug name, route of administration, dose and fre quency of 
dosing, along with start and stop dates should be recorded.  Investigators will be required 
to provide details of prior response assessments, including the dates of evaluation, size of 
target lesions used for determination of response, and change s in management made in 
response to these assessments, for at least two prior lines of therapy (if available) as part 
of the medical history.  
Procedures conducted as part of the subject’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood 
count, imaging studies, etc .) and obtained prior to signing of informed consent may be 
utilized for Screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the protocol -
defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the study.  
Investigators may be requested to perfo rm additional safety tests during the course of the 
study based on newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring. Appropriate 
local regulatory and ethical approvals should be obtained before any additional testing is 
performed.  
For subjects enrolled in the Part 2 ACC cohort, pre -study baseline scans should be 
provided in order to measure kinetics of tumor growth prior to therapy with 
GSK3326595.  Additional details regarding the number and quality of scans will be 
provided in the SRM.  
8.2.1.  Critica l Baseline Assessments  
The following are required at baseline:  
• Imaging/efficacy:  
• Part 1: All subjects should undergo contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis (and/or other areas as indicated by the subject’s underlying 
disease) as well as an MRI of the brain.  
NOTE:  Although CT scan is preferred, MRI may be used as an alternative 
method of baseline disease assessment for abdomen/pelvis, especially for those 
subjects where a CT scan is contraindicated due to allergy to contrast, provided 
that th e method used to document baseline status is used consistently throughout 
study treatment to facilitate direct comparison. An unenhanced CT of the chest 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 114 
 can replace the enhanced CT of the chest, but MRI of the chest is not 
recommended.  
• Part 2, solid tumor cohorts , and Part 3 : All subjects should undergo contrast -
enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (and/or other areas as indicated 
by the subject’s underlying disease) as well as an MRI of the brain .  If MRI of 
the brain is contraindicated, then an equivalent scan (e.g., contrast -enhanced CT 
of the brain) may be performed instead.  
• Part 2, GBM cohort: All subjects should undergo MRI of the brain .  Refer to the 
Imaging Acquisition Guidelines (IAG) for scanning guidelines  
• Part 2, NHL cohorts: All baseline (and subsequent) scanning should be 
performed as clinically indicated based on the NHL subtype and the 
manifestation of the subject’s disease.  For subjects with measurable tumors, 
contrast -enhanced CT of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be 
performed.  If PET/CT is used to assess disease, the CT component must be 
performed to diagnostic quality (including the required anatomical coverage and 
use of IV and oral contrast).  Other modalities (e.g ., medical photography for 
cutaneous T -cell lymphoma  (TCL) or bone marrow biopsy) may be used after 
discussion with the medical monitor.  
• Disease characteristics (as available):  
• The results of any mutational analysis of tumor or other associated tissue (e. g., 
cytology, circulating tumor cells, cf -DNA), including p53 status (if available) .  
• For P art 2 NHL p53 status and NSCLC p53 WT status is required prior to dosing  
• The size(s) and location(s) of target lesion(s) used for response characterization 
for at le ast two prior lines of therapy, as well as a description of the dates of 
service and changes made to management  
• Tumor biopsies:  
• All subjects in Part 1 (dose escalation and, the PK/PD/biomarker/metabolite 
cohort/s), as well as all subjects in Part s 2 and 3 , must  submit an archival tumor 
specimen in addition to any fresh biopsies required in individual cohorts (see 
below).  The archival specimen will be used for retrospective testing for 
potential markers of sensitivity and/or resistance (e.g., p53).  If arch ival 
specimen is not available, a fresh biopsy must  be performed. Further details 
regarding processing will be provided in the SRM.  
• NOTE: All NHL subjects in Part 2 must have a local p53 mutational analysis 
result prior to dosing  unless the subject’s tumor has previously been 
demonstrated to harbor a p53 mutation. If local p53 status was not determined, 
analysis may be performed on archival tissue, but if archival tissue is not 
available, a fresh biopsy must be performed.  NHL subj ects with neither archival 
tumor sample nor accessible tumor for fresh biopsy will not be permitted to 
enroll.  Further details will be provided in the SRM.   The intent is to accrue 10 
subjects each of WT and mutant p53. As the sub -cohorts are filled, it m ay 
become necessary to delay enrollment until p53 status is formally designated.  In 
case one NHL cohort reaches futility at any Interim Analysis, further enrolment 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 115 
 into the other NHL cohort will require central confirmation. NOTE:  All 
NSCLC subjects in P art 2 must have a local genomic p53 mutational analysis 
result prior to dosing .  If local p53 status was not determined, an archival sample 
or a fresh biopsy must be provided . 
• Individual subjects in the dose escalation portion of Part 1 may be required to 
provide paired biopsies for PD evaluation as described in Section  4.2.5  and 
Section 8.6.2 .  For these subjects, a fresh baseline tumor biopsy is required and 
should be obtained within 14 days of the first dose of GSK3326595.  Further 
details will be provided in the SRM.  
• In the Part 1 PD/biomarker/metabolite expansion cohort(s), a fresh baseline tumor 
biopsy is required from all subjects and should be obtained within 14 days prior 
to the first dose of GSK3326595.  Further details will be provided in the SRM.  
• In Part 2, in addition to an archival tumor biopsy, a fresh baseline tumor biopsy is 
required from all subjects (except those in the GBM cohort) and should be 
obtained within 14 days prior to the first dose of GSK3326595.  If tumor tissue 
is not accessible, discussion w ith the GSK medical monitor is required and the 
medical monitor must assent to subject participation; in this circumstance, the 
paired biopsy on Day 15 would not be required.  Further details will be provided 
in the SRM.  
• In Part 3, in addition to an archiv al tumor biopsy, a mandatory fresh baseline 
tumor biopsy is required from all subjects and should be obtained within 14 days 
prior to the  first dose of GS K3326595.  The paired on -treatment biopsy should 
be taken on D15 (W3D1) prior to administration of pembrolizumab  (see 
Section  8.2.2 ).  
8.2.2.  Visit Windows  
Screening (baseline to pre -dose ): All assessments including b aseline imaging (e.g., CT, 
MRI, or PET/CT)  should be performed within 14 days prior to  first dose. Note for 
females, pregnancy testing should be performed within 7 days prior to first dose. Also, 
clinical labs performed during screening within 72 hours of first dose do not need to be 
repeated on D ay 1.  
Week 1:  Visits for Week 1 Days 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be performed on the day indicated. 
For subjects in the food effect/relative bioavailability sub -study, the Day 4 visit may be 
performed on Day 4 or Day 5.  
Week 2 to Week 8:  Based on subject and clinic schedule, assessments can be ± 2 days.  
The only exception to this window is the Day 8 visit for subjects in the food 
effect/relative bioavailability  sub-study, for whom this assessment must be performed 
± 1 day. 
The Week 3 Day  1 (Day 15) PK and PD sample  collection s are timed to permit 
evaluation of GSK3326595 PK and PD parameters at steady -state dosing.  If a subject is 
not receiving drug on Week 3 Day 1  (Day 15) , either as a consequence of a planned drug 
holiday or due to toxicity,  or has not been receiving drug for 14  days such that they are at 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 116 
 steady state,  then these PK/PD collection s should be rescheduled for a later timepoint 
when the subject is again being d osed at steady state, and the alternate collection date 
noted in the eCRF . 
For subjects in Part 3, the preferred order of procedures on Day 15 is: Administration of 
GSK3326595, on -study tumor biopsy, followed by administration of pembrolizumab.  
However, t his order may be varied based on clinic schedules and other factors. If 
pembrolizumab is administered prior to the on -study biopsy, the biopsy should be 
collected within 24 hours of pembrolizumab administration.  
The disease assessment at week 8 should be p erformed ± 2 days. After the fourth 
scheduled scan for disease assessment (i.e., week 32 for solid tumors/GBM and week 48 
for NHL), the frequency of scheduled scans will be reduced to every 16 weeks for 
subjects with solid tumors/GBM and every 24 weeks for  subjects with NHL.  For 
subjects enrolled in the PK/PD/Biomarker/Metabolite cohort, the required 18FDG -
PET/CT scan at Week 6 may be performed ± 7 days.  
Every 4 -week, 8 -week, 12 -week  and 26 -week  visits after Week 8 until Week 52:  After 
the first disease as sessment has been completed, the clinic visits can be scheduled  5 
days.  
In Part 3, all subsequent disease assessments (after the first assessment) may be 
performed  1 week to align with clinic visits for administration of pembrolizumab.  
Every 4 -week, 8-week , 12-week  and 2 6-week  visits after Week 52:  After week 52, the 
every 4 -week visits will no longer be required  at the discretion of the investigator; any 
procedures or tests originally required every 4 weeks (q4w) should be performed every 8 
weeks  (q8w) instead .  For the every 8 - and 12 -week visits, clinic visits can be scheduled 
 7 days.    
Discontinuation visit : should be within 30 days from last dose of study drug. If a subject 
is unable to return to the clinic due to hospitalization, site staffs ar e encouraged to 
telephone the subject for assessment of adverse events.  
8.3. Safety  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are listed in the Time and Events Table 
(Section 8.1).  Additional time points for safety tests may be added during the course of 
the study based on newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring.  
Note that this section details the procedures used to evaluate for safety and toxicity for 
this study. For management of toxicity and management/reporting of any suspected 
Adverse Events, refer to Section 9, Appendix 9 , and Appendix 2 . 
Post Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, subjects  who continue to receive study 
treatment after the DCO date of the final analyses will be monitored and receive 
follow -up care in accordance with standard local clinical practice  with recommendations 
provided for local safety laboratory monitoring for GSK33 26595 given the absence of a 
label to define standard of care  (refer to SRM) . Only pre -specified additional safety  
assessments wi ll be required  (refer to Section 8).

 8.3.1.  Physical Exams  
A complete physical examination will include assessments of the head, eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, skin, thyroid, neurological system, lungs, cardiovascular system, abdomen (liv er 
and spleen), lymph nodes and extremities. Height must be recorded at the screening visit.  
Weight will also be measured and recorded at the screening visit and at each subsequent 
visit.  
A brief physical examination will include assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular 
system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).  Weight will also be measured and recorded at 
the screening visit and at each subsequent visit.  
Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses  
8.3.2.  Performance Status  
The performance status will be assessed using the ECOG scale ( Appendix 3 ) as specified 
in the Time and Events Table (Section 8.1). 
8.3.3.  Vital Signs  
• Vital sign measurements to be measured , in a consistent fashion, per institutional 
standard (e.g., in a seated or semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest ), will include 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate.  
• In case of an abnormal first reading, three readings of blood pressure and pulse rate 
should be taken and averaged to give the measur ement to be recorded in the CRF.  
• Vital signs will be measured more frequently if warranted by clinical condition of the 
subject.  On days where vital signs are measured multiple times, temperature does 
not need to be repeated unless clinically indicated.  
Refer to the Study Reference Manual (SRM) for details regarding measurement of vital 
signs.  
8.3.4.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Section 8.1 indicates the visit s at which ECGs must be obtained.  At each time point, a 
single 12-lead ECG will be obtained during the study using an ECG machine that 
automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF intervals.  
On serial PK days (Days 1 and 15) , ECGs will be obtained at multiple time points as 
described in the SRM.  On all other indicated visits, ECGs will be obtained prior to 
dosing.  Refer to Section 5.4.6  for QTcF calculations, to Appendix 2  for management 
strategies for QTcF prolongation, and to Section 5.4.6  for QTc withdrawal criteria.  
Local  ECG may be read centrally at chosen timepoints.

 8.3.5.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
All protocol requir ed laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 16, must be conducted 
in accordance with the Laboratory Manual, and Protocol Time and Events Schedule. 
Laboratory requisition forms must be completed , and samples must be clearly labelled 
with the subject number, protocol number, site/centre number, and visit date. Details for 
the preparation and shipment of samples will be provided by the laboratory and are 
detailed in the SRM. Reference ranges for all  safety parameters will be provided to the 
site by the laboratory responsible for the assessments.  The results of each test must be 
entered into the CRF.  
If additional non -protocol specified laboratory assessments are performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory and result in a change in subject management or are

NOTE: Details of Liver  Chemistry Stopping Criteria and Required Actions and Follow -Up 
Assessments after liver stopping or monitoring event are given in Section 5.4.5  and Section 14.6 
From the first dose of GSK3326595 until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, 
all laboratory tests with abnormal values that are considered clinically significant should 
be repeated as clinically indicated until the values return to normal (per institutional 
guidelines) or back to the pre -study baseline.  If such values do not return to normal 
within a period judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified 
and the sponsor notified.  
8.3.6.  Bone Mineral Density  
In order to assess the clinical bone safety of GSK3326595, dual energy x -ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed on all patients at baseline and every 
8 weeks thereafter (Section 8.1). This evaluation has been deemed most relevant as it is 
the clinical gold standard to detect any unexpected cha nges in bone mineral density 
(BMD), which may suggest an increased risk of fracture.  
For consistency in the assessment, DEXA scans should be performed on the same 
machine for all evaluations on a particular subject when possible.   For more details, 
please refer to the SRM.  
Locally collected DEXA scans may be read centrally.  
Post Protocol Amendment 8 implementation, bone assessments  (DEXA)  will be 
performed at the discretion of the  investigator . The data will be collected via a paper 
process  and submitted to the Sponsor  only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation . Locally collected data will not be read 
centrally . 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 8.3.7.  Ophthalmic Assessment  
Study sites must establish a close collaboration with an appropriately qualified eye -care 
specialist (ophthalmologist/optometrist) who in conjunction with the Investigator will be 
responsible for carrying out the schedule of ophthalmic assessments, and managing / 
referring any subject  who develops visual symptom s and/or signs potentially associated 
with GSK3326595 exposure.  
Management of subjects  with potential treatment -related changes in vision must be 
performed in close collaboration with the Investigator, appropriately qualified eye -care 
specialist, and the G SK Medical Monitor.  
Subjects  will have listed below assessments performed by a qualified eye -care specialist 
at screening/baseline, then every 6 months and at EOT. The assessments may be 
expedited in the event that a subject develops any new or evolving op hthalmic symptoms 
and/or signs in the interval period between assessments. If an abnormal result is recorded 
at the EOT visit, additional assessment will be required as deemed necessary by the 
Investigator, appropriately qualified eye -care specialist  and the GSK Medical Monitor.  
• Full comprehensive exam with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at distance 
for each eye  
• Humphrey Visual field assessment (or equivalent  as agreed with the Sponsor ) 
• Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic nerve  retina l nerve fibre layer  
(RNFL) with ganglion complex analysis  
• OCT of the macula  
• Assessment of color vision by Ishihara method  
Primary outputs of the Humphrey Visual Field and OCT assessments will be held 
centrally by GSK in the event that central or independen t evaluation of these is deemed 
beneficial to support on -going safety evaluation.  
Additional examinations, if deemed necessary, may be performed at the discretion of the 
treating eye -care specialist, and in discussion with the Investigator and Medical Monitor. 
Further details can be found in the Ocular Manual.  
Post Protocol Amendment 8 , ophthalmic assessments will be continued approximately 
every 6 months and at the end of the study treatment (if >8 weeks from the previous 
assessment ). The data will be collected via a paper process  and submitted to the Sponsor 
only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation . Locally collected data will not be read centrally.  
8.3.8.  Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female sub jects and female partners of male subjects will be 
collected after the start of dosing and until 90 days post -last dose.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 122 
 If a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 2 4 hours  of 
learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 10 . 
8.4. Pharmacokinetics  
8.4.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Blood samples  (approximately 2 mL each) for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis of 
GSK3326595 will be collected at the time points indicated in Table 9, Table 13, Table 14 
and Table 15.  Blood samples (approximately 2 mL each) for PK analysis of 
pembrolizumab will be collected at the time points indicated in Table 15.  
The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded.  The timing of 
PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points 
to ensure thor ough PK monitoring.  Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis should 
be collected at the time of a SAE whenever possible. 
Plasma or serum analysis will be performed as described in the Study Reference Manual 
(SRM).   Concentrations of GSK3 326595 or pembro lizumab will be determined using the 
currently approved bioanalytical methodology. Raw data will be archived at the 
bioanalytical site (detailed in the SRM).  
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage and shipping procedures are 
provided in  the SRM.  
Once the plasma has been analyzed for GSK3326595  any remaining plasma may be 
analyzed for other compound -related metabolites and the results reported under a 
separate GSK protocol . 
8.4.2.  Urine Sample Collection  
Urine samples for quantitative analysis of GSK3326595 will be collected after single 
dose and at steady state.  The actual date and time of each urine sample collection will be 
recorded.  
Details of PK urine sample processing, storage and shipping procedures are provided in 
the SRM.  
Once the urin e has been analyzed for GSK3326595  any remaining urine may be analyzed 
for other compound -related metabolites and the results reported under a separate GSK 
protocol . 
8.5. Metabolite Analysis  
8.5.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Subjects enrolled in the PK/PD/Biomarker/Metab olite cohort(s) (Section 4.2.5 ) will have 
blood drawn for PK evaluation on the same schedule as all other subjects participating in 
Part 1. Each col lection will require additional volume; approximately 5 mL of whole 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 123 
 blood will be collected at each timepoint from all subjects in the expansion cohorts. 
Samples will be prepared for shipment according to the SRM and processed/separated at 
the clinical sit e. 
8.5.2.  Urine Sample Collection  
Urine samples will be collected from subjects in the PK/PD/Biomarker/Metabolite 
expansion cohort(s) (Section 4.2.5 ) into plastic bottles over the time period specified in 
the Time and Events Table for analysis of GSK3326595 and any metabolite(s). Details of 
the urine sample processing, storage and shipping procedures are provided in the SRM.  
8.5.3.  Sample Analysis  
Plasma and/or whole blood analysis for circulating biomarkers and metabolites will be 
performed as described in the SRM.  
Plasma and urine samples will be analyzed for GSK3326595 and its metabolites and the 
results reported under a separate report . 
8.6. Pharmacodynamics/Bioma rkers  
All subjects in Part 1 (both dose escalation and the PK/PD expansion cohort) will have 
limited PD sampling performed.   and other biomarkers may be assessed in blood 
or tumor to determine the effects of GSK3326595. Change from baseline levels will be 
measured. In addition, in the PK/PD expansion cohort only, whole blood samples may be 
utilized for the identification and/or validation of a gene signature panel indicative of 
modulation in response to GSK3326595.  Changes in the gene levels from baseline will 
be assessed.  This signature may serve as a novel PD biomarker of PRMT5 inhibition by 
GSK3326595.  The PD outcome may be correlated to clinical outcome.  
All subjects i n Parts 2 and 3 will have PD sampling performed.   and other 
biomarkers may be assessed in blood or tumor to determine the effects of GSK3326595. 
Change from baseline levels will be measured. Whole blood samples may be utilized for 
the identification a nd/or validation of a gene signature panel indicative of modulation in 
response to GSK3326595.  Changes in the gene levels from baseline will be assessed.  
This signature may serve as a novel PD biomarker of PRMT5 inhibition by 
GSK3326595.  PD studies may also help us to better understand the mechanism of action 
for GSK3326595 and inform future rational combinations.  The PD outcome may be 
correlated to clinical outcome.  
8.6.1.  Blood Sample Collection  
Plasma samples from all subjects in Part 1 will be collected a s described in Section 8.4.1 .  
An aliquot from the PK sample will be separated and stored for the purpose of assessing 
pharmacodynamic biomarkers ac cording to the SRM.  
Whole blood and plasma samples will be collected during the PK/PD expansion cohorts , 
Part 2, and Part 3 as described in the Time and Events table (Section 8.1) and the SRM.   
Additionally, s erum will be collected during Parts 2 and 3.   Plasma or serum that is 
CCI
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 124 
 initially collected for the purpose of PK assessments may be utilized for biomarker 
assessments when there is remaining sample.  
8.6.2.  Tumor Biopsy Collection  
All subjects will be asked to submit an archival tumor biopsy at baseline in order to 
conduct retrospective tests for the identification and/or validation of known and novel 
biomarkers. If archival specimen is not available,  a fresh biopsy may be performed. In 
addition, subjects enrolled in PK/PD expansion cohort(s) must submit fresh tumor 
biopsies collected pre - and post -dose in addition to the archival tumor biopsy  as 
described in the Time and Events table (Section 8.1) and the SRM.   Unscheduled tumor 
biopsies may be collected based on emerging data (e.g., to evaluate PD in a subject with 
clinical response).  
 
 
 
 
. 
In addition, patients enrolled in part 3 are requested to provide results from any PD -L1 
test p erformed, including information on the antibody used and, preferably, the vendor or 
institution that performed the test. Also , PD-L1 testing will be done centrally.  
8.6.3.  Assessments for 18FDG -PET/CT  
All subjects enrolled in the PK/PD/Biomarker/Metabolite expans ion cohort(s) (Section 
4.2.5 ) will have 18FDG PET/CT assessments performed at baseline and on treatment as 
outlined in the Time and Events table.  A dditional scans may be performed at different 
timepoints based on emerging data during the study.  
Additional details will be provided in the SRM. Additional analysis may be conducted by 
an independent central reviewer. Instructions for submission of data are provided in the 
SRM.  
8.7. Efficacy  
Post Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, no new efficacy assessments will be 
performed as part of the study . 
8.7.1.  Subjects with Solid Tumors  (Part 1 and Part 2)  
The overall response rate  is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed 
complete response (CR)  or confirmed partial response (PR), as per RECIST 1.1.   
• Lesion assessment method and timing, evaluation of disease, disease progression 
and response criteria will be conducted according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST  1.1) [ Eisenhauer , 2009] as outlined below 
and in Section  14.4.1 .  
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 125 
 • Disease assessment modalities may include imaging (e.g., computed tomography 
[CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) and physical examination (as 
indicated for palpable/superficial les ions). Contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis is preferred, but other modalities may be used (e.g., in the 
case of contrast allergy) as described in Section 8.2.1 . 
• The baseline disease assessment will be completed within 2 weeks prior to the 
first dose of GSK3326595, then every 8 weeks thereafter and at the final study 
visit.  See the Time and Events Table (Section  8.1) for the schedule of 
assessments of anti -cancer activity.  
• Assessments must be performed on a calendar schedule (Day 1 being the day of 
the first study treatment a dministration) and should not be affected by dose 
interruptions/delays.  
• For post -baseline assessments, a window of 7 days  is permitted to allow for 
flexible scheduling.  If the last radiographic assessment was more than 8 weeks 
prior to the subject’s wit hdrawal from study and progressive disease has not 
been documented, a disease assessment should be obtained at the time of 
withdrawal from study treatment.  
• Subjects whose disease responds (either complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR]) should have  a confirmatory disease assessment performed at 
least 4 weeks after the date of assessment during which the response was 
demonstrated.  
• To ensure comparability between the baseline and subsequent assessments for 
each subject, the same method of assessment and the same technique will be 
used when assessing response.  
• Any subject  in the ACC tablet cohort  who has not yet shown objective 
radiological disease progression at treatment discontinuation should continue to 
be followed as per RECIST 1.1 for radiological progression , unless consent has 
been withdrawn.  
8.7.2.  Subjects with GBM  
Response will be assessed by the investigator every 8 weeks, as outlined in the Time and 
Events Table ( Table 14), using standardized Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) W orking Group Criteria, as detailed in Section 14.4.2 . 
8.7.3.  Subjects with Non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma  
Response will be assessed by the investigator every 12 weeks, as outlined in the Time 
and Events Table ( Table 14), using standardized Lugano  Criteria, as described in Section 
14.4.3 . 
8.7.4.  Subjects in Part 3  
The overall response rate is defined as the percentage of subjects with a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR), as per iRECIST  guidelines , 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 126 
 as described in Section 14.4.4  [Seymour , 2017] .  These guidelines  will be used in the 
assessment of response/progression to account for the unique tumor kinetics observed 
with immunotherapeutic agents , which may manifest as an increase in tumor burden then 
later is followed by regression suggesting the apparent observed neoplastic growth 
representing transient lymphocyte infiltration. Thus, participants with disease progression 
by RECIST version 1.1 gui delines are required to have a confirmatory disease assessment 
no sooner than 4 weeks after the date disease progression was declared in order to 
confirm disease progression by iRECIST  guidelines  [Seymour , 2017] . The visit level 
responses and treatment -based decisions will incorporate iRECIST  guidelines [Seymour , 
2017] . 
8.8. Pharmacogenetic Analysis  
An important objective of the clinical study is pharmacogenetic (PGx) research. 
Participation in PGx is optional but all subjects who are eligible for the clinical study will 
be given the opportunity to participate. Su bjects may decline participation without effect 
on their medical care or care during the clinical study. A separate consent signature is 
required for PGx research.  
Subjects who provide consent will have a blood sample taken for analysis. The 
presence/absen ce of genetic variations in host DNA from blood will be analyzed to 
determine their relationship with response (safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and 
efficacy) to treatment with GSK3326595.  
Information regarding pharmacogenetic research is included in Appendix 8 . In approving 
the clinical protocol, the independent ethics committee/institutional review board 
(IEC/IRB) (and, where required, the applicable regulatory agency) also approve the P Gx 
assessments unless otherwise indicated. Where permitted by regulatory authorities, 
approval of the PGx assessments can occur after approval is obtained for the rest of the 
study. If so, then the written approval will clearly indicate approval of the PGx  
assessments is being deferred and the study, except for PGx assessments, can be initiated. 
When PGx assessments are not approved, then the approval for the rest of the study will 
clearly indicate this and therefore, PGx assessments will not be conducted.  
8.9. Immunogenicity  Analysis  (Part 3)  
Blood samples (approximately 2  mL) for immunogenicity analysis of pembrolizumab 
will be collected at the time points indicated in Table 15. The timing and number of 
planned immunogenicity samples may be altered during the course of the study, based on 
newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring. Serum will be used to 
assess the presence of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) . The analysis for the presence of anti -
pembrolizumab antibodies will be performed contingent on availability of a validated 
assay, and if considered clinically relevant. The actual date and time of each blood 
sample collection will be recorded. Details of blood sample collection (including volume 
to be collected), processing, storage, and shipping procedures are provided in the SRM.   
In the event of a hypersensitivity reaction that is either  1) clinically -significant in the 
opinion of the investigator, or 2) leads to the participant withdrawing from study 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 127 
 treatment, blood samples may be taken from the participant for immunogenicity testin g at 
the time of the event , and at further timepoints s pecified in the SRM .  
Results of ADA testing may be reported separately at the end of the study.

 8.11.  Patient Reported Outcomes  
Planned time points for all assessments related to PROs are listed in the Time and Events 
Table (Table 14) and will apply to the ACC tablet cohort in Part 2 of the study only.   
PROs will be available on a rolling basis as they are available and data collection tools 
are implemented, with select P ROs not being completed in the study when unavailable in 
specific languages.  
Cancer can have a profound impact on patients’ health related quality of life (HRQ oL); 
both the symptoms of the disease as well as the tolerability profile of treatments impact 
HRQoL. The patient -reported outcomes (PRO) in this study ( Table 17) aim to measure 
changes in symptoms, physical functioning , and symptomatic side effects, tolerability , 
and HRQ oL.  
Completion of PRO Questionnaires  
PRO questionnaires are to be administered at the beginning of the visits specified in 
Section 8.11 in the order presented in the electronic device.  To avoid biasing responses, 
the subjects should not be told the results of diagnostic tests prior to completing the 
questionnaires.  Adequate time must be allowed to complete all items on the 
questionnaire s, and if necessary, the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing 
items.

 9. ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S: 
DATA COLLECTION, REP ORTING, AND FOLLOW -UP 
9.1. Definition of AE/SAE  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 9 . The severity of adverse 
events will be graded utilizing the NCI -CTCAE v4. Additional details regarding 
management of specific AEs or SAEs are described in Appendix 9 . 
The investigator and their designees are responsible for detecting, documenting and 
reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE.  
9.1.1.  Cardiovascular/Death events  
For any cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 9  and all deaths, whether or not they 
are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will 
be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular 
(including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardi ovascular death.  
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 132 
 The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms. The CV information should be 
recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one w eek of receipt of a 
CV Event data query prompting its completion.  
The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is 
reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within  one 
week of when the deat h is reported.  
9.1.2.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) for GSK3326595 are ocular events and bone -
related events. These AESIs are pre -defined and are derived from the Osteopenia / 
Osteoporosis Standardised MedDRA Query ( SMQ) and the Optic Nerve Disorders SMQ 
(see SRM for listing of terms for reporting). Post P rotocol Amendment 8  implementation,  
AESIs will be reported directly to the Sponsor via a paper process.  The severity of all 
AESIs will be graded utilizing the NCI-CTCAE v4 for Adverse Events.  
9.1.3.  Other Sentinel E vents  
Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis), or 
other safety assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, that are felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator are to be recorded as an AE or SAE, 
in accordance with the definitions provided.  
In addition, an associated AE or SAE is to be recorded for any laboratory test result or 
other safety assessment that led to an intervention, including permanent discontinuation 
of study treatment, dose reduction, and/or dose interruption/delay.  
Any new primary cancer must be reported as a SAE.  
9.2. Time period and Frequen cy for collecting AE and SAE 
Information  
• Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol -mandated 
procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK 
product will be recorded from the time a subject consents t o participate in the 
study up to and including any follow -up contact.  
• AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment until the follow -up 
contact (see Section 8.2.2 ), at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events 
Table (Section 8.1). 
• Medical o ccurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after 
obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History/Current 
Medical Conditions section of the CRF.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 133 
 • All SAEs will be recorded and reported to GSK within 24 hours of the 
investigator/site staff becoming aware of them, as indicated in Appendix 9 . 
• Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study 
subjects. However, if the investigator learns of any AEs or SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a subject h as been discharged from the study, and he/she 
considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study 
participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK.  
• Post P rotocol Amendment 8  implementation , for those subjects who continue to 
receive study treatment  after DCO date of final analyses, the S ponsor  will 
continue to collect safety information including SAEs , AESIs and AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation via a paper process  for up to 30 days after last dose of 
study treatment.  
NOTE: The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs 
plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports to GSK are provided in 
Appendix 9 . 
9.2.1.  Method of Detecting Unsolicited AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended 
and non -leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include:  
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?”  
• “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since 
your last visit/contact?”  
9.2.2.  Metho d of Detecting Solicited AEs and SAEs  
Vision Symptom Review : 
• “Have you had any changes in  your vision  since your last visit/contact ?” 
9.2.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
subject  at subsequent visits/contacts.  All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special interest 
(as defined in Section  9.1) will be followed until resolution, until the conditi on stabilizes, 
until the event is otherwise explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up (as defined 
in Section 5.4). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 9 . 
9.2.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK or designee of SAEs related to study 
treatment is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the 
safety of subjects and the safety of a product under clinical investigation are me t.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653

 GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation.  GSK will 
comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety rep orting to the 
regulatory authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and investigators.  
Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions according to local regulatory requirement s and GSK policy and are forwarded 
to investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with 
the IB and w ill notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
10. DATA MANAGEMENT  
For this study subject data will be entered into GSK defined CRFs, transmitted 
electronically to GSK or designee and combined with data provided from other sources in 
a validated data system. When the Protocol Amendment 8  is implemented at a site, the 
collection of data for all enrolled subjects  who no longer receive study treatment will stop 
entirely.  Those subjects  still benefiting from GSK3326595 in the opinion of the ir treating 
Investigator may continue to receive study treatment  under  Protocol Amendment 8 . In the 
portion of the study  continuing treatment under Protocol Amendment 8 , only SAEs, AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation, overdoses, pregnancies, and pre-defined ocular and 
bone AEs (AESIs) will be reported directly to the Sponsor  via paper process . In addition,  
• Ocular assessments will be required and reported via a paper process to the 
Sponsor only if reporting criteria is met for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation .   
• Bone  (DEXA)  assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator 
and reported via a paper process to the Sponsor only if reporting criteria is met 
for SAEs, AESIs, or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation . 
Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable GSK 
standards and data cleaning procedures to ensure the integrity of the data, e.g., removing 
errors and inconsistencies in the data.  
Adverse events and concomita nt medications terms will be coded using MedDRA 
(Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities)  and an internal validated medication 
dictionary, GSKDrug.  
CRFs (including queries and audit trails) will be retained by GSK  or designee , and copies 
will be sent  to the investigator to maintain as the investigator copy. S ubject initials will 
not be collected or transmitted to GSK according to GSK policy.

 11. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND DATA 
ANALYSES  
11.1.  Hypotheses  
In Part 1, the primary endpoints of this study are safe ty and tolerability; the MTD and 
RP2D will also be determined. No formal statistical hypotheses will be tested. The 
primary focus will be on determining the recommended dose for further exploration, the 
safety profile, and the PK of GSK3326595 in subjects with advanced solid malignancies. 
Analyses will be descriptive and exploratory.  
The primary goal of Part 2 is to evaluate disease -specific clinical activity in subjects with 
select solid tumors  and NHL.   The cohort s will be terminated for futility based on  interim 
analysis described in Section 11.9.6 . 
• For TNBC  and ER+BC , efficacy is defined as a clinically meaningful 
response rate (defined as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR 
or PR) of 25% relative to a 10% historical control response rate.  
• For mTCC , efficacy is defined as a clinically meaningful response rate 
(defined as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR or PR) of  30% 
relative to a 15% historical control response rate.  
• For recurrent GBM, efficacy is defined as a clinically meaningful 
improvement in the rate of subjects who remain progression -free at six 
months (defined as a 35% six -month PFS rate relative to a 17% historical six -
month PFS rate).  
• For ACC and HPV -positive solid tumors, efficacy is defined as a clinically 
meaningful response rate (defined as the percentage of subjects that have 
achieved a CR or PR) of 30% relative to a 10% historical control response 
rate. 
• For NHL (both p53 wild -type and p53 mutant cohorts), efficacy is defined as 
a clinically meaningful response rate (defined as the percentage of subjects 
that have achieved a CR or PR) of 30% relative to a 10% historical control 
response rate.  
• For NSCLC, efficacy is defined as a clinically meaningful response rate 
(defined as the percentage of subjects that have achieved a CR or PR) of 30% 
relative to a 10% historical control response rate. An interim futility analysis 
will be used to determine the scope of further development in this cohort.  
The primary goal of Part 3 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK3326595 in 
combination with pembrolizumab in solid tumors. No formal statistical hypotheses will 
be tested.  
 
 
11.2.  mTPI Method  
The mTPI design [ Ji, 2010] is an extension of the toxicity probability interval method [ Ji, 
2007] and employs a simple beta -binomial hierarchic model. Decision rules are based on 
CCI
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 136 
 calculating the unit probability mass (UPM) of three intervals corresponding to under 
dosing, proper dosing, and overdosing in terms of toxicity. Specifically, the und er dosing 
interval is defined as (0, pT – ε1), the overdosing interval as ( pT + ε2, 1), and the proper 
dosing interval as ( pT – ε1, pT + ε2), where ε 1 and ε 2 are small fractions, such as 0.05, to 
account for the uncertainty around the true target toxicity.  A sensitivity analysis reported 
by Ji et al [ Ji, 2010] showed that the mTPI design is robust to the specification of ε 
values. In addition, ε 1 and ε 2 could take different values to reflect physician preference 
and the nature of the disease. For advanced diseases with few treatment options, higher 
toxicity rates might be considered acceptable, implying a specification of ε 2 > ε1. For 
less-advanced diseases, the two  ε values could be identical or ε 1 > ε2. The three dosing 
intervals are associated with three different dose -escalation decisions. The under dosing 
interval corresponds to a dose escalation (E), overdosing corresponds to a dose de -
escalation (D), and prope r dosing corresponds to staying at the current dose (S). Given an 
interval and a probability distribution, the UPM of that interval is defined as the 
probability of the interval divided by the length of the interval. The mTPI design 
calculates the UPMs for  the three dosing intervals, and the one with the largest UPM 
implies the corresponding dose -finding decision. That decision provides the dose level to 
be used for future subjects. For example, if the under dosing interval has the largest 
UPM, decision E, to escalate, will be executed, and the next cohort of subjects will be 
treated at the next -higher dose level. Ji et al [ Ji, 2010] show that the decision based on the  
UPM is optimal in that it minimizes a subsequent expected loss. Under the mTPI design, 
a trial is terminated when either the lowest dose is above the MTD or a prespecified 
maximum sample size is reached.  
11.3.  Bayesian Predictive Adaptive Design for GBM Cohort  
A Bayesian predictive adaptive design  [Lee, 2008] that allows the trial to be monitored 
more frequently at multiple stages will employed for GBM cohort in Part 2 of the study. 
The criteria will be based on a historically unimportant six month PFS rate of 17% versus 
a six month PFS rate of interest of 35%. The six mon th PFS rate is defined as the 
proportion  of the subjects who are progression free and still alive at six months from the 
start of treatment.  Bayesian statistics will be employed to calculate the posterior  
probability that the six month PFS  rate 35% and 17% at interim assuming a Beta prior 
for the Binomial distributed data.  Predictive probability calculates the probability that 
the six month PFS  rate 35% or 17% given the responses have already been observed.  
A weak prior Beta (0.0 3, 0.07) is used, which is equivalent to the information present in 
0.1 subject. The first interim analysis may be conducted when at least 10 evaluable 
subjects are available for GBM  cohort at a given dose. The evaluable subjects for GBM 
cohort is defined as the GBM subjects who have had three post baseline disease 
assessments  or have progressed or have died or have withdrawn from study treatment due 
to any reason. Futility interim analysis decision rules for the 10th to 27th evaluable 
subjects, specifying the num ber of subjects who have not progressed six months after 
receiving the first dose of GSK3326595 needed for continuing enrol lment or stopping for 
futility when total sample size is up to 27 is presented in Table 18.  These rules are 
intended as a guideline.  Actual decisions will depend on the totality of the data.

The enrollment for GBM  cohort may be stopped due to futility if the predictive 
probability that the 6 month PFS  rate 17% (historical control) is small (e.g., less than a 
2% chance for a total sample size of 28 subjects).  Enrollment may also be stopped due to 
futility if the equivalent of all the evaluable subjects are progressed or off study treatment 
before 6 months from the first dose in the first 10 enrolled evaluable subjects in GBM  
cohort or less than 1 subject who is not progressed still on treatment at month 6 are 
observed in the first 1 3 evaluable subjects.  For example, when there are 10 evaluable 
subjects available at the time of interim analysis with all subjects progressed before 
month 6 , then the c ohort may be stop for futility.   Otherwise, the enro llment of the 
respective cohort will continue to the target sample size.  
When the total sample size in a treatment arm is 28 and at least 8 subjects who are not 
progressed before 6 months from first dose and still on treatment at month 6 out of 28 
subjects are observed, we can claim null hypothesis is rejected.  
11.4.  Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling  
To further investigate clinical activity across the pre -specified cohorts, an adaptive design 
utilizing a Bayesian hierarchical model will be employed for the m TCC, TNBC, p53 WT 
NHL and p53 mutant NHL cohorts in Part 2. Multiple interim evaluations of the 
accumulating data to determine if one or more cohorts should discontinue enrollment 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 138 
 early due to futility will be incorporated. Interim and final evaluations will be based on a 
hierarchical model that borrows information in a limited way from cohorts that 
demonstrate similar treatment effects based on the accumulated trial data. Traditional 
estimates based on independent analyses will also be provided. j is the true response rate 
for cohort j, where j = 1,…, 4 and indexes the four cohorts. C j is the histor ical control 
response rate for the jth cohort. The historical controls vary by cohort and are provided in 
Table 21. The study is powered to detect a high clinically meaningful response rate and is 
based on the cohort model assessment of whether there is sufficiently high probability 
that j exceeds C j. The posterior probability that the ORR for a given cohort is greater 
than C j will be computed according to the following comparison:  
P (π j > C j | current data) for the j -th cohort  
If this posterior probability is sufficiently low within a given cohort, then  this will 
provide insufficient evidence to suggest that the ORR is greater than its respective 
historical control. Conversely, if a sufficiently high posterior probability is observed, this 
will provide evidence that the ORR is greater than the historical  control, and the dose will 
be declared efficacious in that cohort. Thresholds for decision making are defined in 
Section 4.3.3 . 
Full details regarding the hierarchical modeling framework are in Appendix 11 . 
11.5.  Simon’s Two Stage Design for ACC Cohort s  
Simon's optimal two -stage design ( Simon , 1989) will be used for  both ACC cohort s 
(tablet and capsule formulation) . For both cohorts, t he null hypothesis that the true 
response rate is 10% will be tested against a one -sided alternative  of 30% .  
For the capsule cohort, i n the first stage, 10 subjects will be accrued. If there are 1 or 
fewer responders in these 10 subjects, the cohort will be stopped early for futility. The 
maximum  number of subjects to be enrolled for this cohort is 38. The null hypothesis will 
be rejected if 8 or more responders are observed in 38 patients. This design yields a type I 
error rate of 0.023 and power of 80.8% when the true response rate is 30%.  
For the tablet c ohort, in the first stage, 17 subjects will be accrued. If there are 2 or fewer 
responders in these 17 subjects, the cohort will be stopped early for futility. This rule is 
intended as a guideline, development decisions will depend on the totality of the d ata. 
The maximum number of subjects to be enrolled for this cohort is 50. The null hypothesis 
will be rejected if 10 or more responders are observed in 50 patients. This design yields a 
type I error of 0.02 and power of 89.9% when the true response rate is  30%.   
11.6.  Bayesian Predictive Adaptive Design for ER+BC Cohort  
The ER+BC cohort will employ the Bayesian design that allows the trial to be monitored 
frequently with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates. The evaluation is 
designed to exclude a 10% overall response rate (ORR) representing best available 
therapy in favour of a 25% ORR. A close to non -informative prior will be used. Let p 
denote the response rate, the prior distribution used is p ~ Beta (0.02 5, 0.075). The cohort 
will be stopped early due to futility if the predictive probability of success is less than 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 139 
 8%. The success is defined as posterior probability of ORR > 10% at the end of the 
cohort is larger than 80 %. The first interim analysis will be performed when at least 10 
subjects become evaluable. The max sample size is 35 subjects, and the design will have 
type I error of 0. 10 and power of 8 2%. 
The decision rules, specifying the number of subjects with a clinical response needed for 
continuin g enrolment or, stopping for futility, are displayed in Table 19. The 
methodology is based on the predictive probability of success if enrolment continues to 
maximum number of subject s [Lee, 2008].  The interim analysis will be for futility only, 
i.e., the dose expansion cohort will not stop early for effi cacy.

 11.7.  Bayesian Predictive Adaptive Design for HPV+ Cohort  
The HPV+  cohort will employ the Bayesian design that allows the trial to be monitored 
frequently with the constraint of both Type I and Type II error rates. The evaluation is 
designed to exclude a 10% overall response rate (ORR) representing best available 
therapy in favo ur of a 30% ORR. A close to non -informative prior will be used. Let p 
denote the response rate, the prior distribution used is p ~ Beta (0.03, 0.07). The cohort 
will be stopped early due to futility if the predictive probability of success is less than 
1%. The success is defined as posterior probability of ORR > 10% at the end of the 
cohort is larger than 87.6%. The first interim analysis will be performed when at least 10 
subjects become evaluable. The max sample size is 28 subjects, and the design will ha ve 
type I error of 0.05 and power of 87%.  
The decision rules, specifying the number of subjects with a clinical response needed for 
continuing enrolment or, stopping for futility, are displayed in Table 20. The 
methodology is based on the predictive probability of success if enrolment continues to 
maximum number of subjects  [Lee, 2008].  The interim analysis will be for futility only, 
i.e., the dose expansion cohort will not stop early for efficacy.

 11.8.  Statistical Design for NSCLC cohort  
The Part 2 NSCLC cohort is intended to explore the clinical activity in the p53 wild -type 
NSCLC population. Simon’s optimal two -stage design ( Simon , 1989) will be used as a 
basis for analysis of the NSCLC cohort. The null hypothesis that the true response rate is 
10% will be tested against a one -sided alternative. ORR will be assessed  for the 10 
subjects that are confirmed with p53 wild -type.  
In the first stage, 10 subjects will be accrued. If there are 1 or fewer responders in the first 
10 subjects, the cohort will be stopped for futility. If 2 or more responses are observed, 
further expansion of the p53 wild -type NSCLC cohort may be triggered via protocol 
amendment or as a part of another study. If the cohort were to expand to 29 subjects, the 
null hypothesis would be rejected if 6 or more responders are observed. This design 
yields a  type I error rate of 0.047 and power of 80.5% when the true response rate is 30%.  
11.9.  Sample Size Considerations  
11.9.1.  Sample Size Assumptions  
The sample size for each part of the trial was chosen to adequately characterize the 
safety, clinical activity, PK, and ph armacodynamic marker data according to the 
objectives of each part of the study.   
The study will enrol a maximum of  approximately 412 subjects with tumor types that 
may include TNBC, mTCC , GBM, ACC, ER+BC, HPV+ , NHL  and NSCLC .  
In Part 1 approximately 42 subjects will complete the DLT evaluation period.  In 
addition, up to 12 subjects will be enrolled at or near the MTD/RP2D in the 
PK/PD/Biomarker/Metabolite expansion cohort(s) (Section 4.2.5 ) and approximately 12 
subjects in the food and formulation effect sub -study (Section 4.2.6). 
In Part 2, a maximum of 32 subjects, 40 subjects, 38 subjects, 50 subjects, 35 subjects, 28 
subjects , 28 subjects and 15 subjects will be enrolled in TNBC, mTCC , ACC  (capsule), 
ACC (tablet) , ER+BC, HPV+ solid tumor,  GBM  and NSCLC cohorts, respectively. A 
maximum of 25 subject will be enrolled in each of the NHL[+] and NHL[ -] cohorts. If all 
cohorts enroll the maximum number of subjects, this will result in no more than 316 
subjects total.  
In Part 3 approximately 10 subjects will be  enrolled into each of three cohorts: 
GSK3326595 100mg + pembrolizumab, GSK3326595 200mg + pembrolizumab, and 
GSK3326595 300mg + pembrolizumab.  
To determine the maximum sample size for GBM cohort,  Bayesian predictive adaptive 
design will be used for testin g hypotheses and sample size determination:  
H0: 6 months PFS rate ≤17%  
HA: 6 months PFS rate ≥35%  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 142 
 When maximum sample size is 28, the design will have a Type I error ( ) of 0.0 86 and 
80% power.   
Enrollment into specific cohorts may be halted early based o n results from interim 
analyses incorporating emerging response data. Res ponse data from a minimum of 
10 subjects will be required in a cohort before it may discontinue enrollment for futility. 
In addition, at the final analysis and after the study has bee n closed, a minimum of 
5 subjects will be required in a cohort in order to meet statistical success at the final 
analysis. See Section 11.9.6  for more details.  Data from evaluable subjects treated in the 
dose escalation part may be used for futility analysis if the subject is from the same 
population and treated at RP2D.   
Simulation studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Bayesian 
Hierarchical design under various assumptions for the distribution of true ORRs across 
the TNBC, mTCC , and NHL  cohorts. Operating characteristics including power, type I 
error, estimation of the ORR, and the probability of halting enrollment at inter im analyses 
were assessed.  
When the treatment effects are similar across TNBC, mTCC , and NHL  histologies, the 
design maintains power 88% to 97% and type I error rate ≤0. 1. Estimation efficiencies 
due to borrowing result in very good operating characteristi cs in these situations, even in 
histologies with low sample sizes.  Table 21 provides similar operating characteristics for 
scenarios where not all histologies align in terms of efficacy performance.  
11.9.2.  Sample Size Sensitivity  
No sample size sensitivity assessments will be performed.  
11.9.3.  Sample Size Re -estimation or Adjustment  
No sample size re -estimation will be performed.  
11.9.4.  Data Analysis Considerations  
Data will be listed and summarized according to GSK reporting standards, where 
applicable. Complete details will be documented in the RAP. Any deviations from, or 
additions to, the original  analysis plan described in this protocol will be documented in 
the RAP and final study report.  
In the dose escalation cohorts, the dose will be escalated based on all available data, 
including biomarker and PK data and the safety profile of prior cohorts.   The DLT 
information on all subjects enrolled in the trial are used to update the estimated dose -
toxicity relationship and provide supportive information in addition to the mTPI design in 
the next escalation/de -escalation decision; the mTPI approach is ex pected to be used as 
the primary criteria for dose escalation . 
The expansion phases are designed to evaluate preliminary clinical activity.  A futility 
assessment will be conducted and enrollment into a disease -specific cohort may be 
paused in order to eva luate accumulating data including safety, clinical responses, and 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 143 
 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. Response may also be stratified by p53 
status and other mutational and gene expression data, as described in the RAP.  
Subjects enrolled in Part 1 wi ll be included in a Part 2 disease specific cohort analyses if 
the subjects w ere treated at the Part 2 dose and has the same disease as required for the 
cohort.  
11.9.5.  Analysis Populations  
The All Treated Population  is defined as all subjects who receive at least one dose of 
GSK3326595. Safety and anti -cancer activity will be evaluated based on this analysis 
population.  
The All Evaluable Population  is defined as subjects who have had two post baseline 
disease assessments, have progressed or died, or permanently discontinued from the 
study treatment for mTCC, TNBC, ER+BC, HPV+ , NHL and NSCLC cohorts. It is 
defined as subjects who have had three post baseline diseas e assessments, have 
progressed or died, or permanently discontinued from the study treatment for ACC (both 
capsule and tablet)  and GBM cohort s.  
The PK Population  will consist of all subjects from the All Treated Population for whom 
a PK sample is obtained  and analyzed.  
Pharmacodynamic Population:  The PD Population is defined as subjects in the All 
Treated Subjects Population for whom paired and evaluable tumor biopsies (pre - and on -
treatment time points) or plasma were obtained and analyzed for biomarkers.  
Additional analysis populations may be defined in the RAP.  
11.9.6.  Interim Futility Analysis  
Interim data will be evaluated to monitor efficacy and safety. For the GBM cohort, a  
planned interim analysis for futility will be performed when at least 10 evaluable subjects 
have been enrolled in this expansion cohort.  Enrollment may be stopped early for 
toxicity or lack of efficacy, should various criteria occur based on accrued data.  The 
design criterion for early stop for futility based on Bayesian Predictive Adaptive Design 
is described in Section 11.3. For TNBC, mTCC , and NHL  cohorts, the decision criteria 
for early stop for futility based on Bayesian Hierarchical model are described below. The 
decision will be made for each individual disease -specific cohort. For the ACC capsule 
cohort, one interim futility analysis will be performed when first treated 10 subjects 
become evaluable. If there are 1 or fewer responders in these 10 subjects, the cohort will 
be stopped early for futility. For the ACC tablet cohort, one interim futility analysis will 
be performed when the first 17 treated subjects become ev aluable. If there are 2 or fewer 
responders in these 17 subjects, the cohort will be stopped early for futility. This rule is 
intended as a guideline, development decisions will depend on the totality of the data. For 
ER+BC cohort, the first interim analys is will be conducted when at least 10 subjects 
become evaluable. The details about interim decision rules are specified in Section 11.6. 
For HPV+ c ohort, the first interim analysis will be conducted when at least 10 subjects 
become evaluable. T he details about interim decision rules are specified in Section 11.7.

 For the NSCLC cohort, one interim futility analysis will be performed when first treated 
10 p53 wild -type subjects become evaluable. If there are 1 or fewer responders in these 
10 subjects, the cohort will be stopped early for futility.  
For TNBC, mTCC , and NHL  cohort s, the therapeutic effect will be declared insufficient, 
and termination of enrollment will be recommended, if a minimum of 10 subjects become 
evaluable and the posterior probabil ity that the confirmed ORR is greater than its 
corresponding historical control (C j) is sufficiently low (<15%) based on the hierarchical 
model. That is,  
P (π j > C j | current data) < 15%, for the j -th cohort , j=1,..4  
However, as described in Section 4.3.3 , the decision to terminate a given cohort will not 
be made based on the statistical model alone and will require review of all available data , 
including safety/tolerability, PK, PD, and biomarker data.  Operating characteristics 
associated with declaring early futility are provided for multiple scenarios in Table 21. 
For the Part 3 GSK3326595 + pembrolizumab combination cohorts, planned analyses 
will take place after the first 5 subjects  in each cohort complete 35 days of study 
treatment or discontinue prior to 35 days. The details of this design can be found in 
Section 4.4. The operating characteristics of the stopping criteria for the Part 3 
GSK3326595 + pembrolizu mab combination cohorts have been examined and can be 
found  detailed in Section 11.10.4 . 
Additional interim analyses may also be conducted to share key results at medical 
conferences, if deemed appropriate.  
11.9.7.  Final Analysis  
Following Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, the final a nalysis of the study will be 
performed  following the  DCO as defined in Section  5.5. 
11.10.  Key Elements of Analysis Plan  
As it is anticipated that accrual will be spread thinly across centers and summaries of data 
by center would be unlikely to be informative, data from all partic ipating centers will be 
pooled prior to analysis.  
All data up to the time of study completion/withdrawal from study will be included in the 
analysis, regardless of duration of treatment.  
As the duration of treatment for a given subject will depend on effic acy and tolerability, 
the duration of follow -up will vary between subjects. Consequently , there will be no 
imputation for missing data.  
All data will be summarized and listed.

 11.10.1.  Primary Analyses  
As the primary endpoints of Part 1 of this study are safety an d tolerability, the primary 
analyses will be descriptive in nature. Safety endpoints are described in Section 5.4. 
The primary aim of Part 2 is to demonstrate clinically meaningful response rates in each 
of the disease cohorts . Bayesian predictive adaptive designs will be used to evaluate the 
GBM, ER+BC and HPV+ cohorts, independently, as described in Section 11.3, Section  
11.6, and  Section  11.7, respectively. Bayesian -based hierarchical modeling  will be used 
for the mTCC, TNBC, p53 WT NHL and p53 mutant NHL cohorts , as described in 
Section  11.4. For the NHL cohort, subgroup analyses may also be performed for specific 
indolent  histological subtypes ( e.g., follicular lymphoma [FL], transformed FL [tFL], and 
mantle cell lymphoma [MCL]  subtypes only). Simon’s Two Stage designs will be used 
for both the capsule and tablet formulation cohorts for ACC, as detailed in Section 11.5.  
The primary aim of the NSCLC p53 wild -type cohort is to evaluate the potential of 
GSK3326595 as a treatment for this population. A Simon’s two -stage design will be used 
as a basis for this cohort, where the results of the interim futility analysis will help 
determine the scope of any further development of this cohort, as detailed in Section 
11.8. 
The primary aim of Part 3 is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK3326595 in 
combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with select solid tumors. The primary 
analyses will be exploratory in nature.   
The All Treated Population will consist of all subjects receiving at least one dose of study 
drug and will be used for the analysis of safety and efficacy data. Complete details of the 
analyses will be provided in the RAP.  
11.10.2.  Secondary Analyses  
11.10.2.1.  Safety Analyses  
Safety endpoints are described in Section 5.4. 
The All Treated Population will be used for the analysis of safety data. All serially 
collected safety endpoints (e.g., laboratory tests, vital si gns, electrocardiogram [ECGs]) 
will be summarized according to the scheduled, nominal visit at which they were 
collected and across all on -treatment time points using a “worst -case” analysis. Complete 
details of the safety analyses will be provided in the RAP.  
11.10.2.1.1.  Extent of Exposure  
The number of subjects administered study treatment will be summarized according to 
the duration of therapy  
11.10.2.1.2.  Adverse Events  
AEs will be coded using the standard MedDRA and grouped by system organ class.  AEs 
will be graded by the inv estigator according to the NCI -CTCAE v4 . 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 146 
 Events will be summarized by frequency and proportion of total subjects, by system 
organ class and preferred term.  Separate summaries will be given for all AEs, treatment -
related AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to disco ntinuation of study treatment and dose 
modification.  AEs, if listed in the NCI -CTCAE v 4, will be summarized by the 
maximum grade.   
Dose -limiting toxicities will be listed for each subject and summarized by dose cohort for 
Part 1 subjects.  
AEs of special  interest will be outlined in the RAP.  
The incidence of deaths and the primary cause of death will be summarized.  
11.10.2.1.3.  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Hematology and clinical chemistry data will be summarized using frequencies and 
proportions according to NCI -CTCAE v4 .  Laboratory test results outside the reference 
ranges that do not have an associated NCI -CTCAE criterion will be summarized using 
proportions.  Further details will be provided in the RAP.  
11.10.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
11.10.2.2.1.  Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
PK ana lyses will be the responsibility of GSK. The plasma concentrations for individual 
subjects will be determined using a validated analytical method for GSK3326595. 
Individual plasma concentrations of GSK3326595 will be listed and summarized.  
For subjects par ticipating in serial sampling, plasma GSK3326595 concentration -time 
data will be analyzed by non -compartmental methods with Phoenix WinNonlin. The 
following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined, as data permit:  
• maximum observed plasma concentrati on (Cmax)  
• time to Cmax (tmax)  
• area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC(0 -t), AUC(0 -∞) and 
AUC(0 -)) 
• apparent terminal phase half -life (t½).  
• oral apparent clearance  following oral dosing  (CL/F)  
• time invariance (TI) and accumulation ratio (AR) as calculated by the following 
equations:  
 
 
Sparse plasma concentration -time data from Part 2 may be combined with serial data and 
further analyzed using a population approach. A nonlinear mixed effects model may be 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 147 
 used to determine population pharmacokine tic parameters and identify important 
covariates (e.g., age, weight, or disease related covariates). Further details of population 
PK analysis will be described in the RAP; results of such an analysis may be included in 
a report separate from the clinical study report.  
In a subset of subjects, GSK3326595 concentrations may be determined in urine samples 
to determine urinary recovery of unchanged drug and renal clearance.  
11.10.2.2.2.  Statistical analysis of pharmacokinetic parameters  
Plasma concentration -time data will be listed by dose, age group, and summarized using 
descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum) by planned relative 
assessment time. Mean and/ or median values will be plotted over time. Individual 
plasma and urinary (if available) pha rmacokinetic parameter values as well as a 
descriptive summary (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, geometric 
mean, and the standard deviation, coefficient of variance percent  (CV% ) and 95% 
confidence interval of log -transformed parameters [if applicable]) by dose cohort will be 
reported.  
Cmax and AUC (AUC(0 -∞), single dose, and AUC(0 -), steady state) will be plotted as a 
function of the dose administered. If more than 2 dose cohorts are required to reach MTD 
(or the recommended dose based  on available safety, PK and response data),  dose 
proportionality of AUC and Cmax for GSK3326595 following single dose administration 
and AUC(0 -) and Cmax following repeat dose administration will be assessed 
graphically and using the power model as descr ibed below:  
log (pharmacokinetic parameter) = a + b * log(dose)  
where a is the intercept and b is the slope.  
The power model will be fitted by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) using 
Statistical analysis system  (SAS) Proc Mixed. Both the intercept and s lope will be fitted 
as fixed effects. If there is sufficient data, the model may also be fit with the intercept 
and/or slope as random effects depending on the ability of the model to converge and on 
estimation of variance -covariance matrix. The mean slope  and corresponding 90% 
confidence interval will be estimated from the power model.  
11.10.2.2.3.  Food Effect and Relative Bioavailability Sub-Study  
Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters AUC(0 -∞), and Cmax will be log -transformed and 
analyzed separately using a mixed -effects model with fixed -effect term for fed status (fed 
or fasted) /formulation (tablet or capsule) , and subject as a random effect. Point estimates 
and their associated 90% CIs will be constructed for the differences between fed and in 
fasted state , between table t and capsule. For the relative bioavailability analysis, tablets 
are the test formulation and capsules are the reference . The point estimates and their 
associated 90% CIs were then back  transformed to provide point estimates and 90% CIs 
for the ratios of fed/fasted  and tablet/capsule . Non -parametric methods such as the 
Hodges and Lehmann estimator will be used to estimate the median differences between 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 148 
 the fed treatments and the fasted state treatments for tmax  and t½ . An associated 90% CI 
for the median d ifferences will be constructed.  
Based on the US FDA guidance on food -effect bioavailability studies, the absence of a 
food-effect will be established if the 90% CI of the ratio for Cmax and AUC, based on 
log-transformed data, is within the 80 to 125% equiv alence limit. Recommendation on 
the clinical significance of the effect of food will be based on the magnitude of the 
change and our understanding of the exposure -clinical response relationship.  
For the evaluation of food effect, tmax at fed and fasted st atus will be presented by 
subject and dose cohort in tabular and graphical form.  
11.10.2.3.  Efficacy Analysis  
The confirmed overall response rate  (ORR) is defined as the percentage of subjects 
with a confirmed complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) at any time as per 
disease -specific criteria (Section 14.4). Subjects with unknown or missing response will 
be treated as non -responders, i.e. these subjects  will be included in the denominator when 
calculating the percentage. Exact methods for calculated confidence intervals will be 
given in the RAP.  
The number and types of responses, as outlined in RECIST 1.1 (for subjects with solid 
tumors), RANO (for subje cts with GBM), and Lugano (for subjects with NHL), will be 
listed and summarized separately, as appropriate.  
The observed confirmed ORR will be reported at the interim and final analysis for each 
cohort specified in Part 2 treated at RP2D. The estimates along with 95% confidence 
interval (CI) based on a normal approximation will be provided. Bayesian inference 
based on summary statistics from the posterior distributions of each ORR will be reported 
at interim and final analyses. The posterior mean and pos terior 2.5% and 97.5% 
percentiles of the ORR will be calculated for each cohort. In addition, the posterior 
probability that the ORR exceeds its corresponding historical control will be reported for 
each cohort.  
Progression -free survival rate (PFSR) is calculated from the start of treatment until the 
date of progression or death from any cause. The PFSRs at 6 months were estimated by 
the Kaplan -Meier method. These rates estimated the proportion of patients who did not 
progress and were alive at month 6. The 95% confidence intervals for the PFSR at month 
6 will be estimated using Greenwood's estimate of the standard error (SE) and a linear 
transformation of the progression -free survival function.  
Duration of response is defined as the time from first docum ented evidence of CR or PR 
until the first documented sign of disease progression or death , for the subset of subjects 
with a confirmed CR or PR . Duration of response will be summarized descriptively for 
each cohort, if data warrant, using Kaplan -Meier med ians and quartiles. Details on rules 
for censoring will be provided in the RAP.  
For the ACC tablet cohort, duration of response will be a nalyzed  as determined by the 
Investigator assessment . 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 149 
 For the analysis of Progression -free survival  (PFS), if the subject received subsequent 
anti-cancer therapy prior to the date of documented events, PFS will be censored at the 
last adequate assessment (e.g. assessment where visit level response is CR, PR, or stable 
disease [SD]) prior to the initiation of therapy.  Progressive disease (PD) will also be 
defined per standard criteria.  Otherwise, if the subject does not have a documented date 
of events, PFS will be censored at the date of the last adequate assessment. Further details 
on rules for censoring will be pro vided in the RAP.  PFS will be summarized by cohort 
specified in Part 2, if data warrant, using Kaplan -Meier quantile estimates along with 2 -
sided 95% CIs at the time of final analysis.  
For the analysis of overall survival (OS), the last date of known cont act will be used for 
those subjects who have not died at the time of analysis; such subjects will be considered 
censored. Further details on rules for censoring will be provided in the RAP. OS will be 
summarized by cohort specified in Part 2, if data warra nt, using Kaplan -Meier quantile 
estimates along with 2 -sided 95% CIs at the time of final analysis.

 11.10.4.  Simulations and Design Operating Characteristics  
11.10.4.1.  Simulation Description  
Extensive simulations have been conducted to develop and understand the performance 
of the adaptive design; the hierarchical model including clustering mechanism, interim 
monitoring, and decision criteria.  
11.10.4.2.  Software Details  
Simulations were conducted by the software provided by Berry Cons ultants. For each 
assumed scenario, 500 sets of trials were simulated. Posterior distributions were 
estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using 50,000 iterations for each 
analysis, discarding the first 2,000 iterations for each analysis as burn -in. 
11.10.4.3.  Trial Sample Size and Simulation Scenarios  
Sample size requirements for halting enro llment at interim analyses for simulations is 
based on the number of subjects enrolled; while in practice, they will be based on the 
number of subjects with available res ponse data. This discrepancy is due to software 
feasibility but should not have a significant impact on operating characteristics of the 
design. Simulations assumed interim analyses occurred every 4 weeks, with the first 
interim analysis occurring once 40 subjects have been enrolled. The time from subject 
entry until the response assessment was performed is assumed to be 24 weeks. The 
maximum length of time for each study is 120 weeks ±6 weeks (roughly 2.5 years).  
Although actual enrollment may vary, predic ted enrollment during a 2 -year time period is 
incorporated into the simulations. Cohort, projected enrollment and the historical control 
and clinically meaningful response rates used in simulations are shown in Table 21.

Due to the ‘borrowing’ nature of the model, the design is evaluated across a variety of 
scenarios for the distribution of true ORRs across the four cohorts. These are shown in 
Table 21. 
The “All Positive ” scenario assumes all cohorts are responsive at the defined clinically 
meaningful RR levels. The “Null” case assumes all cohorts are nonresponsive at the 
historical control RRs. The “All Moderate” scenario assumes all cohorts show moderate 
RR levels in  between the historical control and clinically meaningful RR levels. The 
other three scenarios consider various situations where cohorts are either responsive (at 
the clinically meaningful RR level) or  not (at the historical control RR level).  
11.10.4.4.  Operation Characteristics  
Power and type I error rate are examined across scenarios for the distribution of assumed 
true ORRs for each c ohort. The power is the probability of declaring efficacy within an 
individua l cohort when the true underlying ORR is greater than its corresponding 
historical control. Type 1 error rate is the probability of declaring efficacy within an 
individual cohort when the true underlying response rate is equal to the historical control.  
The power and type I error rate are dependent upon the sample sizes and response rates 
across the distribution of cohorts. When the treatment effects are the same across all 
cohorts (either all responsive or all non -responsive), estimation efficiencies, due to 
borrowing, result in very good operating characteristics, even in cohorts with low sample 
sizes. The type I error rate is controlled to ≤0.08 across all cohorts (All Null scenario). 
The design maintains power 90% to 97% for all four cohorts (All Great s cenario). Also, 
the design exhibits reasonable power to detect a moderate level of activity (All moderate 
scenario).  
When the treatment effects vary across cohorts, the amount of appropriate borrowing also 
varies, impacting the operating characteristics. H owever, under all scenarios, the design 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 152 
 maintains at least 80% power for the positive cohorts. The ‘ 2 null, 2 pos itive’ and ‘ 3 null, 
1 positive’ cases investigate design performance where at least half of the cohorts are not 
responsive. In this situation, the type I error rate is inflated between 0.1 and 0.1 3 the 
power is at least 8 1% for the positive cohorts. Generally, improvement in the overall 
distribution of treatment effects tends to coincide with slight increases in type I error rate 
and moderate inc reases in power.  
Overall type I error rate, the probability of claiming efficacy in at least one group under 
the null hypothesis is 0.23.  
11.10.4.5.  Stopping Early  
Table 21 also presents the proportion of trials that halt enrol lment early for futility across 
simulation scenarios. Since the study requires at least ten subjects in a particular cohort 
prior to stop ping early for futility, the ability for a cohort to stop early is largely 
dependent upon the projected maximum sample size and enrollment rate per cohort. The 
overall distribution of treatment effects across cohorts also impacts the likelihood of 
halting enrollment early.  
When the expected 2 -year enrollment is greater than 20, non -responsive cohorts stop 
early for futility between 26% and 47% of the time. Across simulation scenarios, 
responsive cohorts generally do not stop early for futility.  
11.10.4.6.  Mean Proport ion of Correct Decisions  
To evaluate the design performance in correctly evaluating all four cohorts, Table 21 
listed the probabilities of making a correct decision on concluding efficacy on all the 
cohorts whose true underlying ORR is greater than historical control (pick all positive 
cohorts). In th e scenarios where there are positive cohorts, there are 73% to 83% chance 
that all the positive cohorts will be picked.  
11.10.4.7.  Operating characteristics of the safety stopping rule in Part 3 
(GSK3326595 in combination with pembrolizumab)  
Simulations were used to  evaluate the design performance of the safety stopping rules 
planned for the Part 3 dose determination. In these simulations, we simulate 50,000 
independent trials and evaluate the performance of the model  on average.  
Recall that each higher dose cohort is dependent on the result of the previous cohort(s). 
For example, if cohort 1 is not completed, cohorts 2 and 3 will not begin. Thus, in order 
to complete cohort 3, cohorts 1 and 2 must have also been deemed safe with respect to 
our safety stopping criter ia. 
Table 22 details the scenarios we have evaluated as well as the average number of 
subjects dosed in each cohort, and the percentage of simulated trials that completed that 
dose level , assuming that 5 s ubjects were dosed during each stage resulting in 10 subjects 
total per dose level . Table 23 details the same scenarios under the assumption that we 
over-enroll by 1 subject, e. g. dosing 6 subjects in stage 1 and 5 subjects in stage 2  (or 
vice versa) , resulting in 11 subjects total per dose level.   Figure 11-1 graphically 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 153 
 represents the operating characteristics of our safety stopping rules for each cohort , 
assuming that we enroll 10 subjects in each dose level . Cohorts 1, 2 and 3 are shown in 
separ ate plots arranged horizontally. Each line of the plot corresponds to a different 
scenario detailed in  Table 22. The scenarios considered range from ver y low toxicity  to 
very high toxicity.  In low toxicity scenarios, the cohorts are likely to fully enroll, and as 
toxicity increases, cohorts are more likely to stop early for safety. For example, scenario 
1 represents a low toxicity scenario and 84. 8% of t he time, our simulations fully enrolled 
the final cohort (dose level 3).  A similar plot is shown for the case where 11 subjects are 
enrolled per dose level ( Figure 11-2).  In the case where we have 11 subjects per dose 
level, we see a higher percentage of trials that do not complete dose level 3.  This is 
expected, since these trials are larger, and thus have more chances to stop for safety 
reasons.

 12. STUDY GOVERNANCE CON SIDERATIONS  
12.1.  Posting of Information on Publicly Available Clinical Trial 
Registers  
Study information from this protocol will be posted on publicly available clinical trial 
registers before enrollment of subjects begins.  
12.2.  Regulatory and Ethical Considerations, Including the 
Informed Consent Process  
The study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requi rements, 
and with GSK policy.  
The study will also be conducted in accordance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
all applicable subject privacy requirements, and the guiding principles of the current 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki. This includes , but is not limited to, the following:  
• IRB/IEC review and favorable opinion/approval of the study protocol and 
amendments as applicable  
• Obtaining signed informed consent  
• Investigator reporting requirements (e.g. reporting of AEs/SAEs/protocol 
deviations to IRB/IEC)  
• GSK will provide full details of the above procedures, either verbally, in writing, 
or both.  
• Signed informed consent must be obtained for each subject prior to participation 
in the study  
• The IEC/IRB, and where applicable the regulatory authorit y, approve the clinical 
protocol and all optional assessments, including genetic research.  
• Optional assessments (including those in a separate protocol and/or under separate 
informed consent) and the clinical protocol should be concurrently submitted for 
approval unless regulation requires separate submission.  
• Approval of the optional assessments may occur after approval is granted for the 
clinical protocol where required by regulatory authorities. In this situation, 
written approval of the clinical proto col should state that approval of optional 
assessments is being deferred and the study, with the exception of the optional 
assessments, can be initiated.  
12.3.  Quality Control (Study Monitoring)  
• In accordance with applicable regulations including GCP, and GSK procedures, 
GSK monitors will contact the site prior to the start of the study to review with 
the site staff the protocol, study requirements, and their responsibilities to satisfy 
regulatory , ethical, and GSK requirements.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 156 
 • When reviewing data collection procedures, the discussion will also include 
identification, agreement and documentation of data items for which the eCRF  
will serve as the source document.  
GSK will monitor the study and sit e activity to verify that the:  
• Data are authentic, accurate, and complete.  
• Safety and rights of subjects are being protected.  
• Study is conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any 
other study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regu latory requirements.  
The investigator and the head of the medical institution (where applicable) agrees to 
allow the monitor direct access to all relevant documents  
12.4.  Quality Assurance  
• To ensure compliance with GCP and all applicable regulatory requirements,  GSK 
may conduct a quality assurance assessment and/or audit of the site records, and 
the regulatory agencies may conduct a regulatory inspection at any time during 
or after completion of the study.  
• In the event of an assessment, audit or inspection, the investigator (and institution) 
must agree to grant the advisor(s), auditor(s), and inspector(s) direct access to all 
relevant documents and to allocate their time and the time of their staff to 
discuss the conduct of the study, any findings/relevant issues  and to implement 
any corrective and/or preventative actions to address any findings/issues 
identified.  
12.5.  Study and Site Closure  
• Upon completion or premature discontinuation of the study, the GSK monitor will 
conduct site closure activities with the investig ator or site staff, as appropriate, 
in accordance with applicable regulations including GCP and GSK Standard 
Operating Procedures.  
• GSK reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study at any time for reasons including, but no t limited to, safety or ethical 
issues or severe non -compliance. For multicenter studies, this can occur at one 
or more or at all sites.  
• If GSK determines such action is needed, GSK will discuss the reasons for taking 
such action with the investigator or the head of the medical institution (where 
applicable). When feasible, GSK will provide advance notification to the 
investigator or the head of the medical institution, where applicable, of the 
impending action.  
• If the study is suspended or prematurely dis continued for safety reasons, GSK 
will promptly inform all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where 
applicable) and/or institution(s) conducting the study. GSK will also promptly 
inform the relevant regulatory authorities of the suspension o r premature 
discontinuation of the study and the reason(s) for the action.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 157 
 • If required by applicable regulations, the investigator or the head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide 
the reason for the su spension or premature discontinuation.  
12.6.  Records Retention  
• Following closure of the study, the investigator or the head of the medical 
institution (where applicable) must maintain all site study records (except for 
those required by local regulations to be m aintained elsewhere), in a safe and 
secure location.  
• The records must be maintained to allow easy and timely retrieval, when needed 
(e.g., for a GSK audit or regulatory inspection) and must be available for review 
in conjunction with assessment of the fac ility, supporting systems, and relevant 
site staff.  
• Where permitted by local laws/regulations or institutional policy, some or all of 
these records can be maintained in a format other than hard copy (e.g., 
microfiche, scanned, electronic); however, cautio n needs to be exercised before 
such action is taken.  
• The investigator must ensure that all reproductions are legible and are a true and 
accurate copy of the original and meet accessibility and retrieval standards, 
including re -generating a hard copy, if r equired. Furthermore, the investigator 
must ensure there is an acceptable back -up of these reproductions and that an 
acceptable quality control process exists for making these reproductions.  
• GSK will inform the investigator of the time period for retaining  these records to 
comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. The minimum retention 
time will meet the strictest standard applicable to that site for the study, as 
dictated by any institutional requirements or local laws or regulations, GSK 
standar ds/procedures, and/or institutional requirements.  
• The investigator must notify GSK of any changes in the archival arrangements, 
including, but not limited to, archival at an off -site facility or transfer of 
ownership of the records in the event the investigator is no longer associated 
with the site.  
12.7.  Provision of Study Results to Investigators, Posting of 
Information on Publically Available Clinical Trials Registers 
and Publication  
Where required by applicable regulatory requirements, an investigator signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study report. The investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the 
opportunity to review the complete study results at a GSK  site or other mutually -
agreeable location.  
GSK will also provide the investigator with the full summary of the study results. The 
investigator is encouraged to share the summary results with the study subjects, as 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 14.2.  Appendix 2: Guidelines for Management of Toxicity  
The following dose modification criteria should provide guidance for, but  not act as a 
replacement for sound clinical judgment. The investigator should use clinical judgment to 
determine which drug may be contributing to the toxicity necessitating dose adjustment 
and make the appropriate change for that drug. Dose modifications  should be made after 
discussion with the GSK medical monitor.   For management of suspected pembrolizumab 
toxicity in Part 3, please refer to Section 14.2.2 , Section 14.2.3 , or to the pembrolizumab 
prescribing information.

Thrombocytopenia  Grade 1 & 2 (platelet 
count above 50,000)  Continue dosing at same dose level with 
weekly or more frequent monitoring as 
necessary  
Grade 3 (platelet 
count between 
25,000 -50,000)  For subjects with solid tumors, temporarily 
interrupt study medication.  For subjects 
with non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma, consider 
interruption of study medication.  
After discussion with medical monitor and 
using sound clinical judgement, continue 
at same dose or adjust dose (e.g. 
consider reduced daily dosing or dosing 
on alternate days). Monitor complete 
blood count (CBC)  at least twice a week, 
more frequently if necessary  
Grade 4 (platelet 
count below 25,000)  Interrupt study medication and monitor 
CBC every 2 -3 days.  
1. If platelet counts recover to Grade 2 
and are steady for at least 2 CBC 
measurements at least 3 days apart, 
or rising, discuss with the medical 
monitor. Base d on clinical 
judgement, resume treatment at the 
same or previously cleared lower 
dose.  
2. Platelet transfusion is allowed based 
on institutional guidelines.  If platelet 
transfusions are required, hold drug 
until platelet counts recover to 
Grade 2, and are steady for at least 
2 CBC measurements at least 3 
days apart, or rising. Using clinical 
judgement and after consultation 
with the medical monitor,  consider

AEs as defined in Section 4.2.4.2 . 
14.2.2.  Management of Immune -Related Events, Part 3 pembrolizumab 
combination  
AEs associated with immunotherapy treatment may be immune -mediated . These 
immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose, several months after 
the last dose of treatment, or during the treatment course and may affect more than one 
body system simultaneously . Therefore, early recognition of and initiation of treatment 
for these events is critical to reduce potential complications. Refer to pembrolizumab 
documents [KEYTRUDA , PI, 2019; KEYTRUDA , SPC, 2019 ] for additional 
information regarding the background and the management of other AEs or potential 
safety -related issues. The investigator may consult the GSK Medical Monitor on s tudy 
treatment modifications (i.e., holds or discontinuation) or on the management of AEs.  
For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm the etiology or exclude other 
causes . Additional procedures or tests such as, but not limited to, bronchos copy, 
endoscopy, or skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation . Based on the 
severity of irAEs, withhold or permanently discontinue treatment and administer 
corticosteroids . Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs 
associat ed with immunotherapies are provided in  Section 14.2.3 . 
Before administration of study treatment, investigators are to review a participant’s AEs, 
concomitant medications, and clinical evaluation results, e.g., vital signs, laboratory 
results, ECOG PS, physical examination findings, responses, as outlined in the Time and 
Events table ( Table 15), to monitor for new or worsening irAEs and ensure that continued 
dosing is appropriate.  
Table 25 Dose Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines for Immune -
Related AEs  
General inst ructions : 
• Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less 
and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 177 
 • For situations where immunotherapy treatment has been withheld, treatment 
can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid 
has been tapered. Immunotherapy treatment should be permanently 
discontinued if AE does not resolve within  12 weeks of last dose or 
corticosteroids cannot be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per 
day within 12 weeks.  
• For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated 
first followed by oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive t reatment should be 
initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids .

14.2.3.  Dose Modification and Toxicity Management of Infusion -
Reactions Related to Immunotherapy Treatment, Part 3  
Infusion reactions are a well -documented AE associated with the administration of mAb. 
Infusion reactions typically develop within 30 minutes to 2 hours after initiation of drug 
infusion, although symptoms may be delayed for up to 48 hours. The incidence of 
infusion reactions varies by mAb agent, and there are multiple mechanisms known to 
lead to infusion -related reactions including both IgE -dependent anaphylactic and non -IgE 
dependent anaphylactoid hypersen sitivities. Cytokine release syndrome, and when 
severe, cytokine “storm”, has been identified as a sequela of the immune system 
activation associated with infusion reactions.  
Infusion reactions may affect any organ system in the body; most are mild in seve rity, 
although severe and even fatal reactions occur. As a group, infusion reactions (including 
both cytokine -mediated and allergic) usually occur during or within a few hours of drug 
infusion. Occasionally, a reaction may occur 1 to 2 days after administr ation . The NCI -
CTCAE for grading adverse reactions during chemotherapy administration has a scale for 
grading the severity of infusion reactions and separate grading scales for allergic 
reactions and anaphylaxis . While use of these separate grading scales may be useful for 
classifying the nature of an infusion reaction for research purposes, they are less useful 
for clinical care, since it may not be obvious if the participant is having an allergic 
infusion reaction or a non -allergic infusion reaction.   
Clinically, an infusion reaction may present with flushing, itching, urticaria, and/or 
angioedema,  cough, sudden nasal congestion, shortness of breath, chest 
tightness, wheeze, sensation of throat closure or choking, and/or change in voice quality,  
faintness, tachycardia (or less often bradycardia), hypotension, hypertension and/or loss 
of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, and/or diarrhea, sense of 
impending doom, tunnel vision, dizziness, and/or seizure, severe back, chest, and p elvic

infusion reactions.  
To better understand the underlying eti ology of these events, serum tryptase, C -reactive 
protein (CRP), ferritin, and a cytokine panel should be drawn during the occurrence of an 
infusion reaction/CRS of any grade as outlined in Table 26. The serum tryptase, CRP and  
ferritin panels should be performed at the investigator’s designated local laboratory . The 
serum cytokine panel will be performed at a GSK designated laboratory . These data will 
aid in the classifying (albeit retrospectively) the etiology of the AE .

 14.4.  Appendix 4: Guidelines for Assessment of Disease, Disease 
Progression, and Response Criteria  
14.4.1.  Response Criteria for Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 [Eisenhauer, 
2009])  
14.4.1.1.  Assessment Guidelines  
Please note the following:  
• The same diagnostic method, including use of contrast when applicable, must be 
used throughout the study to evaluate a lesion. Contrast agents must be used in 
accordance with t he Image Acquisition Guidelines.  
• All measurements should be taken and recorded in millimeters (mm), using a 
ruler or calipers.  
• Ultrasound is not a suitable modality of disease assessment.  If new lesions are 
identified by ultrasound, confirmation by CT or MRI is required.  
• Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) -PET is generally not suitable for ongoing assessments 
of disease.  However FDG -PET can be useful in confirming new sites of disease 
where a positive FDG -PET scans correlates with the new site of disease present 
on CT/MRI or when a baseline FDG -PET was previously negative for the site of 
the new lesion. FDG -PET may also be used in lieu of a standard bone scan 
providing coverage allows interrogation of all likely sites of bone disease and 
FDG -PET is performed at all a ssessments.  
• If PET/CT is performed then the CT component can only be used for standard 
response assessments if performed to diagnostic quality, which includes the 
required anatomical coverage and prescribed use of contrast.  The method of 
assessment should  be noted as CT on the CRF.  
Clinical Examination:  Clinically detected lesions will only be considered measurable 
when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules) [ Eisenhauer , 2009].   
CT and MRI:  Contrast enhanced CT with 5mm contiguous slices is recommended.  
Minimum size of a measurable baseline lesion should be twice the slice thickness, with a 
minimum lesion size of 10 mm when the slice thickness is 5 mm. MRI is acceptable, but 
when used, the technical specification of the scanning sequences should be optim ised for 
the evaluation of the type and site of disease and lesions must be measured in the same 
anatomic plane by use of the same imaging examinations.  Whenever possible the same 
scanner should be used [ Eisenhauer , 2009].  
X-ray: In general, X -ray should not be used for target lesion measurements owing to 
poor lesion definition.  Lesions on chest X -ray may be considered measurable if they are 
clearly  defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however chest CT is preferred over chest 
X-ray [Eisenhauer , 2009].  
Brain Scan:   If brain scans are required , then contrast enhanced MRI is preferable to 
contrast enhanced CT.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 188 
 Bone Scan (typically bone scintigraphy) :  If a bone scan is performed and a new 
lesion(s) is equivocal, then correlative imaging (i.e., X -ray, CT, or MRI) is required to 
demonstrate malign ant characteristics of the lesion(s).   
Note:  PET [FDG or fluoride] may be used in lieu of a standard bone scan providing 
coverage allows interrogation of all likely sites of bone disease and PET is performed at 
all assessments.  
14.4.1.2.  Guidelines for Evaluation of Disease  
14.4.1.2.1.  Measurable and Non -measurable Definitions  
Measurable lesion  
A non -nodal lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest 
dimension) of  
• 10 mm with MRI or CT when the scan slice thickness is no greater than 5mm.  If 
the slice thickness is greater than 5mm, the minimum size of a measurable lesion 
must be at least double the slice thickness (e.g., if the slice thickness is 10 mm, a 
measurable lesion must be 20 mm).  
• 10 mm caliper/ruler measurement by clinical exam or medical photography.  
• 20 mm by chest x -ray. 
Additionally lymph nodes can be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable if  
• 15mm in the short axis when assessed by CT or MRI (slice thickness recomm ended 
to be no more than 5mm).  At baseline and follow -up, only the short axis will be 
measured [ Eisenhauer , 2009].  
Non-measurable lesion  
All other lesions including lesions too small to be considered measurable (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 mm and <15 mm short axis) as 
well as truly non -measurable lesions, which include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or per icardial effusions , inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement 
of the skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques [ Eisenhauer , 2009].  
Measurable disease : The presence of at least one measurable lesion.  Palpable lesions 
that are not measurable by radiologic or photographic evaluations may not be utilized as 
the only measurable lesion.  
Non-Measurable only disease : The presence of only non -measurable lesions.  
14.4.1.3.  Baseline Documentation of Target and Non -Target Lesions  
• All baseline lesion assessments must be performed within (28) days of 
randomization.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 189 
 • Lymph nodes that have a short axis of <10mm are considered non -pathological 
and should not be recorded or followed.  
• Pathological lymph nodes with <15mm and but 10mm short axis are considered 
non-measurable.  
• Pathological lymph nodes with 15mm short axis are considered measurable and 
can be selected as target lesions, however lymph nodes should not be selected as 
target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available.   
• Measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions, and 
recorded and measured at baseline. These lesions should be selected on the basis 
of their s ize (lesions with the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate 
repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  
Note:  Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases should not be selected as 
target lesions when other suitable target lesions are available.  
Note : Measurable lesions that have been previously irradiated and have not been shown 
to be progressing following irradiation should not be considered as target lesions.  
• Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesi ons, with identifiable soft tissue 
components, that can be evaluated by CT or MRI can be considered measurable.   
Bone scans, FDG -PET scans or X -rays are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions.  
• All other lesions (or sites of dis ease) should be identified as non -target and should 
also be recorded at baseline. Non -target lesions will be group by organ. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of 
each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
14.4.1.4.  Response  Criteria  
14.4.1.4.1.  Evaluation of target lesions  
Definitions for assessment of response for target lesion(s) are as follows:  
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes must be <10mm in the short axis.  
• Partial Response  (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum of the diameters (e.g. 
percent change from baseline).  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient  
increase to qualify for progressive disease.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as a reference, the smallest sum of diameters recorded 
since the treatment started (e.g. percent change fr om nadir, where nadir is 
defined as the smallest sum of diameters recorded since treatment start). In 
addition, the sum must have an absolute increase from nadir of 5mm.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 190 
 • Not Applicable (NA): No target lesions at baseline.  
• Not Evaluable (NE): Cannot be clas sified by one of the five preceding definitions.  
Note:  
• If lymph nodes are documented as target lesions the short axis is added into the 
sum of the diameters (e.g. sum of diameters is the sum of the longest diameters 
for non -nodal lesions and the short axis  for nodal lesions).  When lymph nodes 
decrease to non -pathological size (short axis <10mm) they should still have a 
measurement reported in order not to overstate progression.  
• If at a given assessment time point all target lesions identified at baseline a re not 
assessed, sum of the diameters cannot be calculated for purposes of assessing 
CR, PR, or SD, or for use as the nadir for future assessments.  However, the sum 
of the diameters of the assessed lesions and the percent change from nadir 
should be calcu lated to ensure that progression has not been documented.  If an 
assessment of PD cannot be made, the response assessment should be NE.  
• All lesions (nodal and non -nodal) should have their measurements recorded even 
when very small (e.g. 2 mm).  If lesions are present but too small to measure, 5 
mm should be recorded and should contribute to the sum of the diameters, 
unless it is likely that the lesion has disappeared in which case 0 mm should be 
reported.  
• If a lesion disappears and reappears at a subsequent  time point it should continue 
to be measured.  The response at the time when the lesion reappears will depend 
upon the status of the other lesions.  For example, if the disease had reached a 
CR status then PD would be documented at the time of reappearanc e.  However, 
if the response status was PR or SD, the diameter of the reappearing lesion 
should be added to the remaining diameters and response determined based on 
percent change from baseline and percent change from nadir.  
14.4.1.4.2.  Evaluation of non -target lesion s 
Definitions for assessment of response for non -target lesions are as follows:  
• Complete Response (CR):  The disappearance of all non -target lesions. All lymph 
nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline must be non -pathological (e.g. 
<10 mm short ax is). 
• Non-CR/Non -PD:  The persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) or lymph 
nodes identified as a site of disease at baseline ≥ 10 mm short axis.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions.  
• Not Applicable (NA):  N o non -target lesions at baseline.  
• Not Evaluable (NE):  Cannot be classified by one of the four preceding 
definitions.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 191 
 Note:  
• In the presence of measurable disease, progression on the basis of solely non -target 
disease requires substantial worsening such that even in the presence of SD or PR in 
target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit 
discontinuation of therapy.  
• In the presence of non -measurable only disease consideration should be given to 
whether or not the increase in  overall disease burden is comparable in magnitude to 
the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  
• Sites of non -target lesions, which are not assessed at a particular timepoint based on 
the assessment schedule, should be exclud ed from the response determination (e.g. 
non-target response does not have to be "Not Evaluable").  
14.4.1.4.3.  New lesions  
New malignancies denoting disease progression must be unequivocal.  Lesions identified 
in follow -up in an anatomical location not scanned at bas eline are considered new 
lesions.  
Any equivocal new lesions should continue to be followed.  Treatment can continue at 
the discretion of the investigator until the next scheduled assessment.  If at the next 
assessment the new lesion is considered to be une quivocal, progression should be 
documented.  
14.4.1.4.4.  Evaluation of overall response  
Table 28 presents the overall response at an individual time point for all possible 
combinations of tumor responses in target and non -target lesions with or without the 
appearance of new lesions for subjects with measurable disease at baseline.

Note:  Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
classified as having "symptomatic deterioration." Objective response status is determined  
by evaluations of disease burden. Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.   
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue. When the evaluati on of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that 
the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the CR.  
14.4.1.4.5.  Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence and will be determined programmatically by GSK 
based on the investigators assessment of response at each time point.  
• To be assigne d a status of SD, follow -up disease assessment must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after first dose at a minimum interval of 49 days (based 
on the expected 56  7 day window)  
• If the minimum time for SD is not met, best response will depend on the 
subsequent assessments.  For example if an assessment of PD follows the 
assessment of SD and SD does not meet the minimum time requirement the best 
response will be PD.  Alternatively, subjects lost to follow -up after an SD 
assessment not meeting the minim um time criteria will be considered not 
evaluable.  
14.4.1.4.6.  Confirmation Criteria  
• To be assigned a status of PR or CR, a confirmatory disease assessment should be 
performed no less than 4 weeks (28 days) after the criteria for response are first 
met. 
14.4.2.  Response Crite ria for GBM  
This study employs response criteria from the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology 
(RANO) Working Group [ Wen , 2010].  
All measurable and non -measurable  lesions should be assessed using the same techniques 
as at baseline.  Ideally, subjects should be imaged on the same MRI scanner, or at least 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 193 
 with the same magnet strength, for the duration of the study to reduce difficulties in 
interpreting changes.  
Meas urable disease is defined as bidimensionally contrast enhancing lesions with clearly 
defined margins by CT or MRI scan, with two perpendicular diameters of at least 10 mm, 
visible on two or more axial slices that are preferably, at most, 5 mm apart with 0 -mm 
skip. As with RECIST version 1.1, in the event the MRI is performed with thicker slices, 
the size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In the 
event there are interslice gaps, this also needs to be considered in det ermining the size of 
measurable lesions at baseline. Measurement of tumor around a cyst or surgical cavity 
represents a particularly difficult challenge. In general, such lesions should be considered 
non-measurable unless there is a nodular component measu ring ≥10 mm in diameter. The 
cystic or surgical cavity should not be measured in determining response.  
Non-measurable disease is defined as either unidimensionally measurable lesions, masses 
with margins not clearly defined, or lesions with maximal perpen dicular diameters less 
than 10 mm.  
Radiographic response should be determined in comparison to the tumor measurements 
obtained at pretreatment baseline for determination of response, the smallest tumor 
measurements at either pretreatment baseline or after  initiation of therapy should be used 
for determination of progression.   
• Complete response (CR): Complete disappearance of all enhancing measurable 
and non -measurable disease on contrast enhanced MRI scan sustained for at 
least 4 weeks, no new lesions, an d stable or improved nonenhancing 
(T2/FLAIR) lesions. In addition, subject must be off steroids or only on 
physiologic replacement doses.  In the absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks 
later, this response will be considered only stable disease.  
• Partial resp onse (PR): Greater than or equal to a 50% reduction, compared to 
baseline, in the sum of products of the perpendicular diameters for all 
measurable lesions for at least 4 weeks, no progression of non -measurable 
disease, no new lesions, and stable or improv ed nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) 
lesions.  In addition, subject must be on a corticosteroid dose not greater than the 
dose at the time of baseline scan and be stable or improving clinically.  In the 
absence of a confirming scan 4 weeks later, this response will be considered 
only stable disease.  
• Progressive Disease (PD): Greater than or equal to a 25% increase in sum of the 
products of perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions (compared with 
baseline if no decrease) on stable or increasing doses of corticoster oids, OR a 
significant increase in T2/FLAIR nonenhancing lesions on stable or increasing 
doses of corticosteroids compared with baseline scan or best response after 
initiation of therapy, not due to comorbid events, OR the appearance of any new 
lesions, OR  clear progression of non -measurable lesions, OR definite clinical 
deterioration not attributable to other causes apart from tumor, or to decrease in 
corticosteroid dose.  Failure to return for evaluation as a result of death or 
deteriorating condition sho uld also be considered as progression.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 194 
 • Stable disease (SD): If subject does not qualify for CR, PR, or PD and has stable 
nonenhancing (T2/FLAIR) lesions on same or lower doses of corticosteroids 
compared with baseline scan and clinically stable status.  I n the event that the 
corticosteroid dose was increased for new symptoms and signs without 
confirmation of disease progression on neuroimaging and subsequent follow -up 
imaging shows that this increase in corticosteroid dose was required because of 
disease p rogression, the last scan considered to show stable disease will be the 
scan obtained when the corticosteroid dose was equivalent to the baseline dose.  
Increase in corticosteroid dose alone, in the absence of clinical deterioration related to 
tumor, will n ot be used as a determinant of progression. Subjects with stable imaging 
studies whose corticosteroid dose was increased for reasons other than clinical 
deterioration related to tumor do not qualify for stable disease or progression. They 
should be observe d closely. If their corticosteroid dose can be reduced back to baseline, 
they will be considered as having stable disease; if further clinical deterioration related to 
tumor becomes apparent, they will be considered to have progression. The date of 
progres sion should be the first time point at which corticosteroid increase was necessary.  
The definition of clinical deterioration is left to the discretion of the treating physician, 
but it is recommended that a decline in the Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)  from 
100 or 90 to 70 or less, a decline in KPS of at least 20 from 80 or less, or a decline in 
KPS from any baseline to 50 or less, for at least 7 days, be considered neurologic 
deterioration unless attributable to comorbid events or changes in corticoste roid dose. 
Similarly, a decline in the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group and world health 
organization (WHO) performance scores from 0 or 1 to 2 or 2 to 3 would be considered 
neurologic deterioration.   
Subjects with non -measurable enhancing disease whose  lesions have significantly 
increased in size and become measurable (minimal bidirectional diameter of ≥ 10 mm 
and visible on at least two axial slices that are preferably, at most, 5 mm apart with 0 -mm 
skip) will also be considered to have experienced pro gression. The transition from a non -
measurable lesion to a measurable lesion resulting in progression can theoretically occur 
with relatively small increases in tumor size (e.g., a 9 X 9mm lesion [non -measurable] 
increasing to a 10 X 11mm lesion [measurabl e]). Ideally, the change should be significant 
(>5 mm increase in maximal diameter or ≥ 25% increase in sum of the products of 
perpendicular diameters of enhancing lesions).   
In general, if there is doubt about whether the lesion has progressed, continued  treatment 
and close follow -up evaluation will help clarify whether there is true progression.  If 
there is uncertainty regarding whether there is progression, the subject may continue on 
treatment and remain under close observation (e.g., evaluated at 4 -week intervals). If 
subsequent evaluations suggest that the subject is in fact experiencing progression, then 
the date of progression should be the time point at which this issue was first raised.

a: A score of 3 in many patients indicates a good prognosis with standard intervention, especially if at

may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid underintervention). 
Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest domina nt nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal 
lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from 
disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal 
areas. Non -nodal lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not 
selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered  not 
measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as 
dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still 
considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease that 
would be difficult to follow quantitatively with measurement, including pleural effusions, ascites, 
bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, abdominal masses, and other lesions that cannot be confirmed 
and followed by imagin g. In Waldeyer's ring or in extranodal sites (eg, GI tract, liver, bone 
marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response,

14.4.4.  iRECIST Guidelines  
iRECIST is based on RECIST 1.1, but adapted to account for the unique tumor response 
seen with immunotherapeutic drugs.  iRECIST will be used to assess tumor response and 
progression, and make treatment decisions.  When clinically stable, participants should 
not be discontinued until progression is con firmed according to the rules described 
below.  This allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic PD takes into 
account the observation that some participants can have a transient tumor flare in the first 
few months after the start of immunot herapy, and then experience subsequent disease 
response.  These data will be captured in the clinical database.  
Clinical stability is defined as meeting all of the following:  
• Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of 
disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status  
• No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, 
radiation, or other palliative care  
Any participant deemed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study treatment 
at site -assessed radiologic evidence of PD.  It is strongly preferred to obtain the repeat 
tumor imaging, when feasible, for confirmation of PD by iRECIST. The tumor 
assessment should be repeated at least 4 weeks and up to 8 weeks later to confirm PD by 
iRECIST.  Imag es should continue to be sent in to the central imaging vendor for 
potential central review.  
If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per iRECIST and the participant continues to be 
clinically stable, study treatment may continue and follow the regular imagin g schedule.  
If PD is confirmed, participants will be discontinued from study treatment.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 202 
 If a participant has confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined below, study 
treatment should be discontinued; however, if the participant is achieving a cli nically 
meaningful benefit , as assessed by the Investigator and confirmed by the Medical 
Monitor , continuation of study treatment may be considered  upon agreement of all 
parties .  In this case, if study treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be 
performed following the intervals as outlined in Section 8.1 and submitted to the central 
imaging vendor.  
Description of the iRECIST Process for Assessment of Disease Progression  
Assessment at Screening and Prior to RECIST 1.1 Progression  
Until radiographic disease progression based on RECIST 1.1, there is no distinc t 
iRECIST assessment.  
Assessment and Decision at RECIST 1.1 Progression  
For participants who show evidence of radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 the investigator 
will decide whether to continue a participant on study treatment until repeat imaging is 
obtained ( using iRECIST for participant management (see Table 30 and Figure 14-1).  
This decision should be based on the participant’s overall clinical condition (See 
discussion of clinical stability above).  
Tumor flare may manifest as any factor causing radiographic pro gression per RECIST 
1.1, including:  
• Increase in the sum of diameters of target lesion(s) identified at baseline to ≥20% 
and ≥5  mm from nadir  
o Note:  the iRECIST publication uses the terminology “sum of 
measurements”, but “sum of diameters” will be used in th is protocol, 
consistent with the original RECIST 1.1 terminology.  
• Unequivocal progression of non -target lesion(s) identified at baseline  
• Development of new lesion(s)  
iRECIST defines response categories, including iUPD (unconfirmed progressive disease) 
and iCPD (confirmed progressive disease).  For purposes of iRECIST assessment, the 
first visit showing progression according to RECIST 1.1 will be assigned a visit (overall) 
response of iUPD, regardless of which factors caused the progression.  
At this visit, t arget and non -target lesions identified at baseline by RECIST 1.1 will be 
assessed as usual.  
New lesions will be classified as measurable or non -measurable, using the same size 
thresholds and rules as for baseline lesion assessment in RECIST 1.1.  From mea surable 
new lesions, up to 5 lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be selected as New Lesions – 
Target.  The sum of diameters of these lesions will be calculated and kept distinct from 
the sum of diameters for target lesions at baseline.  All other new le sions will be followed 
qualitatively as New Lesions – Non-target.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 203 
 Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging  
At the confirmatory imaging visit assessment, the participant will be classified as 
progression confirmed (with an overall response of iCPD), or as sho wing persistent 
unconfirmed progression (with an overall response of iUPD), or as showing disease 
stability or response (iSD/iPR/iCR).  Timing of confirmatory imaging is described in 
Section 8.1. 
Confirmation of Progression  
Progression is considered confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY  of 
the following occurs:  
• Any of the factors that were the basis for the initial iUPD show worsening  
o For target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of 
≥5 mm, compared to any prior iUPD time point  
o For non -target lesions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall, 
compared to a prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the 
“unequivocal” standard of RECIST 1.1  
o For new lesions, worsening is any of these:  
▪ An increase in the new lesion sum of diameters by ≥5  mm from a prior 
iUPD time point  
▪ Visible growth of new non -target lesions  
▪ The appearance of add itional new lesions  
• Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by RECIST 1.1  
Persistent iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if:  
• None of the progression -confirming factors identified above occurs AND  
• The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial 
PD threshold (by RECIST 1.1)  
Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from the imaging 
on which iUPD is seen.  This may correspond to the nex t visit in the original visit 
schedule.  The assessment of the subsequent confirmation imaging proceeds in an 
identical manner, with possible outcomes of iCPD, iUPD, and iSD/iPR/iCR.  
Resolution of iUPD  
Progression is considered not confirmed, and the overa ll response becomes iSD/iPR/iCR, 
if: 
• None of the progression -confirming factors identified above occurs, AND  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 204 
 • The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) is not above the initial PD 
threshold.  
The response is classified as iSD or iPR (depen ding on the sum of diameters of the target 
lesions), or iCR if all lesions resolve.  
In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudo -progression, and the level of 
suspicion for progression is “reset.”  This means that the next visit that shows 
radiographic progression, whenever it occurs, is again classified as iUPD by iRECIST, 
and the confirmation process is repeated before a response of iCPD can be assigned.  
Management Following the Confirmatory Imaging  
If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per i RECIST, as assessed by the investigator, and 
the participant continues to be clinically stable, study treatment may continue and follow 
the regular imaging schedule.  If PD is confirmed, participants will be discontinued from 
study treatment.  
NOTE:  If a pa rticipant has confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined above, 
but the participant is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, continuation of study 
treatment may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor.  In this case, if 
study t reatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following 
the intervals as outlined in the Time and Events Tables  and submitted to the central 
imaging vendor.  
Detection of Progression at Visits after Pseudo -Progression Resolves  
After resolution of pseudo -progression (i.e., achievement of iSD/iPR/iCR), iUPD is 
indicated by any of the following events:  
• Target lesions  
o Sum of diameters reaches the PD threshold (≥20% and ≥5  mm increase 
from nadir) either for the first time, or after resolut ion of previous 
pseudo -progression.  The nadir is always the smallest sum of diameters 
seen during the entire trial, either before or after an instance of pseudo -
progression.  
• Non-target lesions  
o If non -target lesions have never shown unequivocal progression , doing so 
for the first -time results in iUPD.  
o If non -target lesions have shown previous unequivocal progression, and 
this progression has not resolved, iUPD results from any significant 
further growth of non -target lesions.  
• New lesions  
o New lesions appear for the first time  
o Additional new lesions appear  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 205 
 o Previously identified new target lesions show an increase of ≥  5 mm in the 
new lesion sum of diameters, from the nadir value of that sum  
o Previously identified non -target lesions show any significant growth  
If any of the events above occur, the overall response for that visit is iUPD, and the 
iUPD evaluation process (see Assessment at the Confirmatory Imaging above) is 
repeated.  Progression must be confirmed before iCPD can occur.  
The decision process is iden tical to the iUPD confirmation process for the initial PD, 
with one exception:  if new lesions occurred at a prior instance of iUPD, and at the 
confirmatory imaging the burden of new lesions has increased from its smallest 
value (for new target lesions, th e sum of diameters is ≥5 mm increased from its 
nadir), then iUPD cannot resolve to iSD or iPR.  It will remain iUPD until either a 
decrease in the new lesion burden allows resolution to iSD or iPR, or until a 
confirmatory factor causes iCPD.

1. Serum bilirubin fractionatio n should be performed if testing is available. If serum bilirubin fractionation is not 
immediately available, discontinue study treatment for that subject if ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN. 
Additionally, if serum bilirubin fractionation testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary 
bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.  
2. All events of ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN  (>35% direct bilirubin) or ALT  3xULN and INR>1.5, if 
INR measured which may indicate severe liver injury (possible ‘Hy’s Law’), must be reported as an SAE 
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis) ; INR measurement is not required and the 
threshold value stated will not apply to subjects receiving anticoagulants  
3. New or worsening symptoms believed to be related to liver injury (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, or jaundice) or believed to be related to  hypersensitivity (such as fever, 
rash or eosinophilia)  
4. Includes: Hepatitis A IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM); 
Hepatitis C RNA ; Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;  Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or i f

 14.7.  Appendix 7: Liver Safety – Study Treatment Restart or 
Rechallenge Guidelines  
Drug restart may be considered for a subject exhibiting compelling benefit for a critical 
medicine following drug -induced liver injury, if there is favorable benefit: risk ratio and 
no alternative medicine available.  
If subject meets liver chemistry stopping criteria do not restart/rechallenge subject with 
study treatment unless:  
• GSK Medical Governance approval is granted  (as described below),  
• Ethics and/or IRB approval is obtained, if required, and  
• Separate consent for tre atment restart/rechallenge is signed by the subject  
If GSK Medical Governance approval to restart/rechallenge subject with study treatment 
is not  granted , then subject must permanently discontinue study treatment and may 
continue in the study for protocol -specified follow up assessments  
Background Information on Drug Restart/Rechallenge  
Rechallenge Following Liver Stopping Events that are Possibly Related to Study 
Treatment  
Following drug -induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% 
mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [Andrade , 2009]. Clinical outcomes 
vary by drug, with nearly 50% fatality with halothane re -administered within one month 
of initial injury. However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatality.   
Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcom e include:  
• Hypersensitivity [ Andrade , 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, 
eosinophilia)  
• jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver in jury (direct bilirubin >35% of 
total)  
• subject currently  exhibits severe liver injury defined by: ALT 3xULN, bilirubin 
2xULN (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR1.5 
• serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenges 
[Papay , 2009; Hunt , 2010]  
• evidence of drug -related preclinical li ability (e.g. reactive metabolites; 
mitochondrial impairment) [ Hunt , 2010]  
 
Rechallenge refers to resuming study treatment following drug induced liver injury 
(DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI this should only be 
considered for a subject for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical 
or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a 
benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favourable.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 214 
 Approval by GSK for rechallenge with study treatment can be considered where:  
• Investigator requests consideration of rechallenge with study treatment for a 
subject who is receivin g compelling benefit with study treatment that exceeds 
risk, and no effective alternative therapy is available.   
• Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval for rechallenge with 
study treatment must be obtained, as required.    
• If the rechalle nge is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, the subject 
must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of 
study treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe 
liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the 
rechallenge with study treatment.  Documentation of informed consent must be 
recorded in the study chart.   
• Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK.  
• Subject s approved by GSK Medical Governance for rechallenge with study 
treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry tests until 
stable liver chemistries have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory 
monitoring may resume as per proto col. 
• If after study treatment rechallenge, subject meets protocol -defined liver 
chemistry stopping criteria, study treatment should be permanently discontinued.  
• GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board 
as required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following study treatment 
rechallenge.  
• GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as per Section 9. 
Restart Fo llowing Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events NOT Related to 
Study Treatment  
Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver stopping events in which there 
is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. biliary obstruction, 
pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, there  should be no 
evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hypersensitivity, and the study treatment should not be 
associated with human leukocyte antigen  (HLA) markers of liver injury.  
Approval by GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where:  
• Investigator requests consideration for study treatment restart if liver chemistries 
have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hypotension and liver 
chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and ALT 
<3xULN).  
• Restart r isk factors (e.g., fever, rash, eosinophilia, or hypersensitivity, alcoholic 
hepatitis, possible study treatment -induced liver injury or study treatment has an 
HLA genetic marker associated with liver injury (e.g., lapatinib, abacavir, 
amoxicillin/clavulan ate) are reviewed and excluded  
• Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of study treatment 
restart must be obtained, as required.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL

 • If restart of study treatment is approved by GSK Medical Governance in writing, 
the subject must be provided wi th a clear description of the possible benefits and 
risks of study treatment administration, including the possibility of recurrent, 
more severe liver injury or death.   
• The subject must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study 
treatment restart.  Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the 
study chart.   
• Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK.  
• Subjects approved by GSK Medical Governance for restarting study treatment 
must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver 
chemistries have been demonstrated and then laboratory monitoring may resume 
as per protocol.  
• If after study treatment re -start, subject meets protocol -defined liver chemistry 
stopping criteria, fol low usual stopping criteria instructions.  
• GSK Medical Monitor, and the Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board 
as required, must be informed of the subject’s outcome following study treatment 
restart.  
• GSK to be notified of any adverse events, as pe r Appendix 9 .

 14.8.  Appendix 8: Genetic Research  
Genetic Research Objectives and Analyses  
The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate the relationship between genetic 
variants and response to medicine, including GSK3326595 or any concomitant 
medicines.  
US Food and Drug Administration states  that an in vitro  companion diagnostic device 
(IVD) could be essential for the safe and effective use o f a corresponding therapeutic 
product to:  
• Identify subjects who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic 
product;  
• Identify subjects likely to be at increased risk for serious adverse reactions as a 
result of treatment with a particular ther apeutic product;  
• Monitor response to treatment for the purpose of adjusting treatment (e.g. 
schedule, dose, discontinuation) to achieve improved safety or effectiveness  
Global regulatory requirements for IVD companion diagnostic tests are evolving.  If a 
DNA-based IVD companion diagnostic device might be needed to identify subjects who 
are appropriate for the GSK medicinal product(s) under investigation in this protocol, 
then GSK should collect and retain DNA samples from subjects who carry the genetic 
variant of interest as well as DNA samples from subjects who do not carry the genetic 
variants of interest to validate the performance of the companion diagnostic.  Any IVD 
companion diagnostic research objectives should be described in subject informed 
consen t forms.  
Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of 
the study. Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or 
examination of a large number of genetic variants throughout the genome (whole  genome 
analyses). Genetic analyses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to 
understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analyses may be performed using data 
from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives . 
Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analysis methods will be used. A detailed 
description of any planned analyses will be documented in the RAP prior to initiation of 
the analysis. Planned analyses and results of genetic investigations will be rep orted either 
as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as 
appropriate.  
Study Population  
Any subject who is enrolled in the study can participate in genetic research. Any subject 
who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the 
genetic research.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 217 
 Study Assessments and Procedures  
A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during 
clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori  hypothesis  has been 
identified, may enable future genetic analyses to be conducted to help understand 
variability in disease and medicine response.  
• A 6 ml blood sample will be taken for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A 
Blood sample is collected at the base line visit, after the subject has been randomized 
and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and 
shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA 
from the blood sample may undergo quality c ontrol analyses to confirm the integrity 
of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the 
sample may be destroyed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a 
duplicate sample is required due to an inability to  utilize the original sample.  
The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same study specific number used to 
label other samples and data in the study.  This number can be traced or linked back to 
the subject by the investigator or site staff. Co ded samples do not carry personal 
identifiers (such as name or social security number).  
Samples will be stored securely and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last subject 
completes the study, or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those work ing 
with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study 
for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be 
used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the G SK medicinal 
product.  
Subjects can request their sample to be destroyed at any time.  
Informed Consent  
Subjects who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the 
study. Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to any  blood being taken.  
Subject Withdrawal from Study  
If a subject who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the 
clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a 
choice of one of the follow ing options concerning the genetic sample, if already 
collected:  
• Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample 
is retained  
• Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA 
sample  
If a sub ject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for any 
reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 218 
 destruction within the timeframe specified by GSK and maintain the documentation in 
the site study records .  
Genotype data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and 
may be analyzed during the study or stored for future analysis.  
• If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genotype data has not been 
analyzed, it will not be analyzed or used for future research.  
• Genetic data that has been analyzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue 
to be stored and used, as appropriate.  
Screen and Baseline Failures  
If a sample for genetic research has bee n collected and it is determined that the subject 
does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study, then the investigator should 
instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destroyed. No forms are required to 
complete this process  as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample 
reconciliation process. In this instance a sample destruction form will not be available to 
include in the site files.  
Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data  
GSK m ay summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or 
separately and may publish the results in scientific journals.  
GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific 
understanding in alignment with the i nformed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, 
family members, insurers, or employers of individual genotyping results that are not 
known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study, unless 
required by law. This is due to the f act that the information generated from genetic 
studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific 
validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory 
may not meet regulatory req uirements for inclusion in clinical care.

 14.9.  Appendix 9: Definition of and Procedures for Recording, 
Evaluating, Follow -Up, and Reporting of Adverse Events  
14.9.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
Adverse Event Definition:  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or 
not considered related to the medicinal product.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal labora tory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.  
 
Events meeting  AE definition include:  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or 
urinalysis) or other safety  assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital 
signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be 
clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent  pre-existing condition including either 
an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even 
though it may have been present prior to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symp toms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless this is an intentio nal overdose taken with possible 
suicidal/self -harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae).  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not 
be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical 
sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the 
definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE  or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" also constitutes an AE 
or SAE.  
 
 
Events NOT  meeting definition of an AE include:  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 220 
 • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by 
the investigator to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disor der being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
subject’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occu r (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
14.9.2.  Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
If an event is no t an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, 
death due to progression of disease, etc).  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence 
that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life -threatening  
NOTE:  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
NOTE:  
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication pro longs hospitalization or fulfills any 
other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condi tion that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 221 
 d. Results in disability/incapacity  
NOTE:  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or 
prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substanti al disruption  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not 
be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be 
considered serious.  
• Examples of such ev ents are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse  
g. Is associated with liver injury and impaired liver function defined as:  
• ALT  3xULN and total bilirubin*  2xULN (>35% direct), or 
• ALT  3xULN and INR** > 1.5.  
* Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if 
unavailable, mea sure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. If fractionation is unavailable and 
ALT  3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as 
an SAE.  
** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be 
recorded on the SAE form.  
Refer to Appendix 3  for the required liver chemistry follow -up instructions  
14.9.3.  Definition of Cardiovascular Events  
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:  
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the CRF for 
the following AEs and SAEs:  
• Myocardial infarction/unstable angina  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 222 
 • Congestive heart failure  
• Arrhythmias  
• Valvulopathy  
• Pulmonary hypertension  
• Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack  
• Peripheral arterial thromboembolism  
• Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism  
• Revascularization  
 
14.9.4.  Recording of AEs and SAEs  
AEs and SAE Recording:  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
relative to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding an AE/SAE in 
the CRF  
• Post Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, SAEs , AESIs , AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation and overdoses (as defined in Section 14.9.1 ) will be 
recorded via a paper process  and provided to GSK  (refer to SRM)  
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s 
medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK, AE/SAE CRF page.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested by GSK. In this instance, all subject identifiers, with the exception of 
the subject number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to 
submission to GSK.  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other c linical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be 
documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  
• Subject -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires and the 
collection of AE data are independent components of the study.  
• Responses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire 
will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures 
detailed by the scale’s developer.  
• The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey t o designate a 
cause -effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate.

 223 
 The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and will assign it to one of the following categories  in accordance 
with the  National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.0:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicate d.  
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)1  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting 
self-care ADL2  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
1. Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothe s, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
2 Self care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment 
and the occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying diseases, concomitant 
therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study 
treatment will b e considered and investigated.  
• The investigator will also consult the Investigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE the investigator must  document in the medical no tes that 
he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very 
important that t he investigator always make an assessment of causality for 
every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK.  
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 224 
 information, amending the SAE data collection to ol accordingly.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of 
supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as 
requested by GSK to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of 
the AE or SAE.  
• The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests 
or investigations, histopathologica l examinations or consultation with other 
health care professionals.  
• If a subject dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the investigator will provide GSK with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings, including histopath ology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within the designated 
reporting time frames.  
14.9.6.  Reporting of SAEs to GSK  
SAE reporting to GSK via electronic data collection tool  
• Primary mechanism for reporting SAEs to GSK will be the electronic data 
collection tool . Post Protocol Amendment 8  implementation, SAEs will be 
collected via paper proces s and submitted to GSK  (refer to SRM) . 
• If the electronic system is unavailable for greater than 24 hours, the site will use 
the paper SAE data collection tool and e -mail it to the Medical Monitor  
• Site will enter the serious adverse event data into the electronic system as soon as 
it becomes available.  
• After the study is c ompleted at a given site, the electronic data collection tool 
(e.g., InForm system) will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or 
changes to existing data  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study subject or receives updated 
data o n a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has 
been taken off -line, the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or 
to the Medical Monitor by telephone.  
• Contacts for SAE receipt can be found at the beginning of this p rotocol on the 
Sponsor/Medical Monitor Contact Information page.

 14.10.  Appendix 10: Collection of Pregnancy Information  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject, who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study  
• Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to GSK 
within 2 4 hours  of learning of a subject's pregnancy.  
• Subject will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow up information on mother and infant , which will 
be forwarded to GSK. Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 
6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date.  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or in dication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or 
SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be re ported as 
such.  
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy which is considered 
reasonably related to the study treatment by the investigator, will be reported to 
GSK as described in Appendix 9 . While the investigator is not obligated to 
actively seek this information in former study participants, he or she may learn 
of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating  will discontinue study 
medication  
For male study subjects:  
• Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner 
of a male study subject who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate 
form and submit it to GSK within 2 4 hours of learning of the partner’s 
pregnancy  
• Partner will also be fo llowed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK.  
• Generally, follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• Post Protocol Amendment 8 , pregnancy information will be collected up to 90 
days after last dose of study treatment  via paper proces s and submitted  to GSK  
(refer to SRM) .

 14.11.  Appendix 11: Details of Bayesian Hierarchical Model  
Yi is the response indicator for the ith subject, and j = P(Y i =1 | j i = j) is the true response 
rate for cohort j. In the logic scale, θj  is the mean log odds treatment effect of response:

Basic Hierarchical Model  
A basic hierarchical model structure is described here and is incorporated within the 
clustered hierarchical model framework used in this study. Borrowing occurs to the 
extent indicated by the data using a hierarchical normal model on the treatment effects:  
θj  N(,2). 
Were only this basic hierarchical model used for analysis, the prior distributions would 
be: 
 N(0,1.82)  and  2  IG(0.5,0.125),  
where IG( ,) is the inverse gamma distribution defined by:  
) () , | (1/
  
=+−
xex fx
 
This distribution is non -informative in the sense that its parameters are analogous to 
having a single observation. The variance component  is a key parameter that plays a 
role in the degree of borrowing amo ng cohorts. Small values of  result in a greater 
degree of borrowing while large values of  correspond to less borrowing. The 
distribution of  is based on the variability of the observations, and the observed between 
cohort variation is an important component of the model’s performance. The effects of 
any particular prior distribution for  can be assessed via simulations in evaluating a 
design’ s operating characteristics, type I error rate and statistical power.  
Clustered Hierarchical Model  
A clustered hierarchical model considers the possibility that “clusters” exist among the 
collection of histologies. A therapy may be effective for some histo logies but not for 
others. Histologies within the same cluster have greater influence on each other than they 
do on histologies in other clusters. On the other hand, histologies in different clusters are 
conditionally independent given any particular confi guration of clusters. There is 
borrowing at the cluster level and borrowing across histologies within a particular cluster. 
Borrowing across clusters depends only on similarities between clusters and not of 
individual histologies.  
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 227 
 The number of clusters is  unknown in advance but information will be gleaned from the 
data using Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPM). The full prior is constructed in 2 stages. In 
the first stage, the histologies are assigned to particular clusters, with the number of 
clusters unspec ified. Conditional on this particular clustering, the hierarchical model is fit 
within each cluster. A difference from the basic hierarchical model is in the parameter . 
Each cluster has its own . And the prior distribution on  is now different:  
2  IG(3,0.5).  
Without the clustering, an informative prior on  that places high probability on small 
values of  could yield conclusions similar to simple pooling across histologies. This is 
not desirable. Instead its preferred to preserve the integrity of indi vidual histologies to the 
extent that they give dissimilar results. With the clustering, a prior such as the one 
selected above meets this desideratum. When  is small, as evinced by the data, 
histologies will only be placed in the same cluster if the data  for those histologies are 
sufficiently similar to other histologies in the cluster. When  is large, the histologies will 
be assigned to separate clusters and response rates estimated separately. This clustering 
approach provides further protection agains t borrowing between dissimilar histologies 
while enhancing the borrowing between similar histologies.  
The prior distribution in a DPM is governed by the parameter . When  is small, the 
prior favors large clusters. As  tends to zero, the prior tends to p lace all its mass on a 
single cluster containing all the histologies. As  increases, the prior places more mass on 
clustering with a large number of clusters. As  becomes large, the prior places all of its 
mass on having a separate cluster for each histology (thus, no borrowing across 
histologies). A value of = 0 corresponds to the usual hierarchical model with no 
clustering, while a very large treats all the his tologies separately. Common values of  
might be between 0.5 and 5. We have selected = 2 for the final model. This value has 
been used for the final algorithm and the operating characteristics including type I error 
and power.  
The key aspect of the cluste ring portion of the prior involves which histologies are 
clustered together. This is accomplished by creating a sequence of bins (in theory there 
are infinitely many bins, but the number of bins actually used cannot exceed the number 
of histologies). Thus imagine a sequence of bins C1,C2,C3,… with associated 
probabilities p C1,pC2,pC3 and so forth. In the prior, each histology is placed in a bin 
according to the p Ck probabilities. Thus, if one p Ck is near 1, then all histologies will be 
likely to randomly fa ll in the same bin. If all the p Ck values are small, it will be likely that 
all the histologies will randomly fall in separate bins. Histologies that fall within the same 
bin are defined as being in the same cluster. More details may be found in Escobar 
[Escobar , 1995] or Neal [ Neal , 2000].  
The p Ck probabilities are determined through a stick breaking process [ Sethuraman , 
1994]. Let p C1~Beta(1,α). This leaves 1 -pC1 probability to be allocated to the remaining 
bins. Let p C2 be a Beta(1,α) proportion of that remaining mass, so p C2Beta(1,α)*[1 -
pC1]. There is now 1 -pC1-pC2 mass unallocated. Let p C3 be a Beta(1,α) proportion of the 
remaining mass, so p C3Beta(1,α)*[1 -pC1-pC2] and so on for p C4, pC5, and so forth. This 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 228 
 process generates an infinite sequence of p Ck values, but generally the first few contain 
most of the probability. In terms of the posterior distribution, only the bins which contain 
the histologies are of interest, and thus only 9 of the infinite bins will actually be used.  
The role of α can be seen from this construction. If α is very small, then the Beta(1,α) 
proportions will tend to be close to 1. Thus, the first  pC1 is quite likely to be near 1, and 
thus all the histologies will tend to lie in the first bin. If α is very large, all the Beta(1,α) 
values will tend to be small, and thus each p Ck will tend to be small. This creates a 
situation where each histology is  likely to be in a separate bin. Our proposed value of α=2 
avoids these forced extremes and allows the data to drive the posterior distribution. After 
the histologies have been assigned to bins in the prior, histologies within the same bin 
will tend to hav e more similar data than histologies in separate bins. Thus, in the 
posterior distribution, histologies with similar data are viewed as more likely to be from 
the same bin (and hence the same cluster). Histologies with very different data, in 
contrast, wil l have high posterior probability of being in separate bins/clusters, and thus 
will be estimated separately.  
The posterior distribution also can be thought of in 2 stages, the first being a posterior 
distribution on the clustering, and then conditional on the clustering the posterior 
distribution from the hierarchical model. Conditional on the clustering, borrowing 
happens within clusters, but not across clusters. In situations where the clustering is 
uncertain (always in practice), one will see a proportio nal amount of borrowing between 
histologies, proportional on the posterior probability of the histologies within the same 
cluster. The aim of the clustering is to identify situations where the drug generally works 
for some histologies and generally does no t work for others, so that these two disparate 
effects are not averaged together through the borrowing.

 14.12.  Appendix 12:  COVID -19 APPENDIX: RECOMMENDED 
MEASURES  
Overall Rationale for this Appendix  
COVID -19 pandemic may impact the conduct of clinical studies. Challenges may arise 
from quarantines, site closures, travel limitations interruptions to the supply chain for the 
investigational product or other considerations if site personnel or study part icipants 
become infected with COVID -19. These challenges may lead to difficulties in meeting 
protocol -specified procedures, including administering or using the investigational 
product or adhering to protocol -mandated visits and laboratory/diagnostic testi ng.  
 
This protocol appendix outlines measures that may be applicable for any site impacted by 
the COVID -19 pandemic. The purpose of the appendix is to provide information on the 
measures to be taken to protect participants’ safety, welfare and rights, and  promote data 
integrity.  
These measures will remain in place until the site is able to resume normal working 
activities . 
Study Procedures During COVID -19 Pandemic  
During the special circumstances caused by the current COVID -19 pandemic, you should 
consider  specific public health guidance, the impact of any travel restrictions 
implemented by local/regional health authorities and local institutions, and individual 
benefit /risk when making enrollment and treatment decisions for trial participants.  
  
Every eff ort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified assessments for participants 
on study intervention including follow up , however when not possible, for the duration of 
these special circumstances, the following measures may be implemented for enrolled 
participants  where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow . 
• Clinical investigators should document in site files and in participant notes/Electronic 
Heath Records as appropriate how restrictions related to COVID -19 led to the 
change s in study conduct and duration of those changes , and indicate which trial 
participants were impacted and how those trial participants were impacted (as per the 
current local COVID -19 related regulatory guidance).  
 
• Missing protocol required data/visits du e to COVID -19 must be noted in participant 
notes and recorded as a COVID -19-related  protocol deviation.  
 
Protocol Defined Procedures/Visits:  
• Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home healthcare 
allow, home healthcare may t ake place at a location other than the clinical trial site to 
perform study assessments, which may include collection of blood and urine samples, 
measurement of vital signs and weight, and preparation and administration of study 
drug (at the discretion of the Investigator  , based on safety and tolerability ). It is the 
responsibility of the investigator to inform GSK or delegate  when this occurs and to 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 230 
 document in  source notes . The participant should be informed of the plan and any 
potential risks associated  with this approach and sign a revised Informed Consent 
Form if required. IRB/Ethics committee should be informed and/or approve of this 
change in approach and the process documented in study files.  
 
• Remote visits may be performed at the participant’s home  by qualified study 
personnel or at a local medical facility, unless the Investigator deems that a site visit 
is necessary.  
 
• Additional unscheduled safety assessments such as routine blood sampling may be 
performed at the discretion of the Investigator inc luding in the participant’s home, if 
deemed necessary.  
 
• Biological samples may be collected at a different location, other than the study site 
(e.g., at participant’s home) by qualified study personnel or at a local medical facility 
according to standard operating procedures and applicable regulations. Biological 
samples should not be collected if they cannot be processed in a timely manner or 
appropriately  stored until the intended use.  
 
• Where applicable country and local regulations for telemedicine allow : If visits to a 
site/home are not feasible, then the medical evaluation of the subject may take place 
by telemedicine which will use secure video conferences, phone calls, and a web 
portal and/or mobile application as a way of communicating with and monitoring the 
participant’s progress.  
 
• The study investigator is responsible for ensuring that the identification, management, 
and reporting of AEs and SAEs are completed in accordance with the protocol and 
applicable regulations. AEs are first reported by participants to the investigator/ site 
staff or may be identified by the s ite staff  during interactions with the participants via 
telemedicine encounters. In addition, mobile nurses may identify AEs as well and 
report them to the investigator for evaluat ion. Additionally, AEs may be identified 
from lab reports, imaging or ECG reports, and other records. As determined by the 
investigator, the appropriate medical intervention, therapeutic intervention, and/or 
support measures are instituted, as necessary.  
 
• The participant should be informed of the plan and any potential risks associated with 
the virtual medium and sign a revised Informed Consent Form if required. IRB/Ethics 
committee should be informed and/or approve of this change in approach and the 
proce ss documented in study files.  
 
Note : If the Investigator wishes to conduct a trial visit at a location that has not been 
previously assessed by GSK, it is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an 
adequate alternate location and to notify GSK of the  alternate location. The 
investigator should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, is 
well-equipped to perform study procedures and covered by an adequate insurance. 
Furthermore, the investigator should have sufficient oversight t o ensure that the staff 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 231 
 at the alternate location are trained to perform study procedures .  
 
Study Intervention(s)  
• If despite best efforts it is not possible to administer the dose of study intervention as 
defined in the protocol (see Section 6 Study Interventions and Concomitant 
Therapy), the subject may still continue in the trial at PI discretion – advice of the 
Medical Monitor may be sought as appropr iate. 
 
• If allowed by country regulation/ethics, then for patients on part 1 or part 2  
GSK3326595  can be shipped direct -to-patient (DTP) from the investigational site to 
the participant’s home address. The process for th is shipment must be agreed with 
GSK who will provide the relevant documentation and links to courier sites required 
to ensure shipments are adequately temperature controlled (if required) throughout 
transportation.  
Any study subjects in part 3 who cannot a ttend a clinical site will not be able to 
receive Pembrolizumab at home and therefore may continue on GSK 3326595 study 
medication sent to their home or withdraw from the study whichever the investigator 
and study subject decides . No special procedures for the safe handling of 
GSK3326595 study drug are required.  
 
• The Principal Investigator assumes Good Clinical Practice (GCP) responsibilities for 
IMP handling and the medical control for dispensing to patients. Site Staff should 
document the dispensing in the  Dispensing/Accountability Logs adding a comment 
that this was a DTP dispensing.  
 
• Compliance with study intervention administration will be verified through 
observation by study staff or trained home healthcare professionals . 
 
• In some cases, trial participants who no longer have access to investigational product 
or the investigational site may need additional safety monitoring (e.g., on withdrawal 
of an active investigational treatment).  
Data Management/Monitoring:  
• Diary cards may be transmitted fro m and to the investigator by secure electronic 
mail and or conventional mail. If copies/scans of completed diaries are sent to the 
investigator by electronic mail, the participant should be instructed to maintain 
the original documents and to return them t o the site when a visit to the site will 
be allowed .  
 
• PROs may be completed by a telephone interview between site staff and subject if 
the subject cannot attend the site to complete the questionnaires on the electronic 
tablet.  
 
• If on -site monitoring is no longer permitted, GSK will consider remote Source 
Data Verification/Source Document Review (SDV/SDR) where permitted by the 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 232 
 clinical site/institution. Remote SDV/SDR will be proposed to study sites to meet 
a patient and/or criti cal quality need, e.g., to assess participant safety or to ensure 
data integrity. In case of remote SDV/SDR, GSK will work with the site to 
ensure subject privacy.  
 
• eCRF/CRF Final or Interim Sign off Process: The Principal Investigator (PI) is 
responsible  for ensuring that the data within the eCRF casebook and any other 
data sources utilized during the study for each study participant is complete and 
consistent with source documents throughout the study (ICH GCP 4.9.1 4.9.2). 
The PI may sign/re -sign the eC RF from any computer/location by accessing 
InForm (or other eDC platform) using his/her unique eCRF log -in credentials. 
The PI may delegate this activity to another medically qualified and trained sub -
investigator and this must be documented on the Delegat ion of Responsibilities 
(DoR) Log. It is recommended that the PI identifies a sub -investigator as a back -
up for eCRF signatures. The sub -investigator must be appropriately trained on 
the protocol and eCRF requirements (with training documented), and the Do R 
log updated accordingly.  
 
• Essential Document Sign Off Process: If an investigator is unable to print and 
sign essential documents such as Protocol /Amendment signature page then 
Email approval can be accepted by replying to the relevant email that is se nt by 
GSK .

 14.13.  Appendix 13 : Country Specific Amendment (France)  
Rationale for amendment  
As per Health Authority request in France dated 16 June 2021 relating to the inclusion of  
cardiac monitoring (encompassing echocardiogram (ECHO) and troponin levels 
measurements) in the Protocol for Study 204653, the Sponsor has included, via this 
Country Specific Protocol Amendment (CSPA), limited to France, the requested 
measures in order to allow continued access to the study drug, for the remaining active 
study su bjects in France, which is one (1) subject. No more subjects will be enrolled in 
France until further notice.  
Serial cardiac troponin levels and echocardiograms were originally included as safety 
assessments from the commencement of Study 204653 (until Pro tocol Amendment 5) to 
assess potential effects of GSK3326595 on myocardial tissue in response to pre -clinical 
findings observed in 4 - and 13 - week toxicology studies in rat animal models. For more 
information, see latest Investigator Brochure Version 5.0 d ata cut off 04 February 2021.  
No clinically significant cardiotoxic events have been observed by the Sponsor with 
270 subjects treated in Study 204653, as of the data cut -off date of 04 February 2021. The 
GSK Safety Review Team reviewed the serial cardiac troponin levels, echocardiograms 
and adverse event (AE) reports, and did not identify any events related to study drug and 
consistent with cardiomyopathy, cardiac valve abnormalities, or associated toxicities. The 
study data were also reviewed by the Spons or Integrated Cardiac Safety Panel, which 
includes internal and external cardiologists, who endorsed discontinuing from Protocol 
Amendment 5 serial echocardiogram and troponin monitoring, this decision was 
reviewed and confirmed in July 2021.  
Study Assess ments and Procedures  
Echocardiogram  
For the ongoing subject on study drug, ECHOs will be performed at the next planned 
visit, and at the end of treatment visit.  Additional ECHO assessments should be 
performed as clinically indicated.  The ECHO assessment should include at a minimum 
evaluation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and evaluation of both right and 
left-sided valvular function and morphology.  Blood pressure and weight should be 
measured and recorded at the time (or as close to the tim e as clinically feasible) of the 
ECHO.  
Refer to the Study Reference Manual (SRM) for details regarding the measurement of 
blood pressure.  
Troponins  
For the ongoing subject on study drug, troponin will be collected at the next planned 
visit, then every 8 we eks (±5 days) thereafter, and at the end of the treatment visit. Either 
troponin T or I may be assessed at a local laboratory. The same local laboratory test 
TMF-14123404  CONFIDENTIAL   
  204653  
 234 
 (troponin I or troponin T) should be used consistently for an individual subject 
throughout the st udy.  
Withdrawal and Stopping criteria  
LVEF Stopping Criteria  
Subjects with symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction during treatment with 
GSK3326595 should interrupt the investigational agent and have repeat echocardiogram 
performed.   
Subjects with a >10 % decrease (from baseline) in LVEF to below the institutional LLN 
should discontinue treatment with GSK3326595.  Ejection fraction should be monitored 
every 4 weeks for a total of 16 weeks or until resolution.  If recovery occurs 
(LVEF  >institutional LLN a nd symptom resolution) within 4 weeks, treatment with 
GSK3326595 may be restarted at a reduced dose in consultation with the GSK Medical 
Monitor.  
Subjects with symptoms of left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction without an 
accompanying decrease in LVEF b y echocardiogram should have a full evaluation 
performed as appropriate (e.g., cardiology consult, additional workup for 
swelling/shortness of breath) and symptoms should resolve to <Grade 2 prior to 
discussion of restarting GSK3326595 at the same or reduc ed dose with the GSK Medical 
Monitor.  
Copies of all echocardiograms may be required by GSK for review.  Any cardiology 
consultations performed on subjects who experience a >10% decrease in LVEF from 
baseline and whose cardiac ejection fraction is <institution’s LLN will be required by 
GSK for review.   
Valvular Toxicity Stopping Criteria  
Subjects who have a new asymptomatic, moderate regurgitation or stenosis by 
echocardiogram (Grade 2 mitral/tricuspid/aortic valvular toxicity per NCI -CTCAE v4) 
should temporarily discontinue GSK3326595 and have  a repeat evaluation by ECHO 
within 1 week.  ECHO should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks for 4 weeks or until valve 
recovery to baseline.  
• If the valve recovers to baseline any time during the next 4 weeks after consultation

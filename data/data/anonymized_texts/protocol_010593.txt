2 Background and Specific Aims  
 
 
2.1 Background  
Lower extremity fractures comprise the majority of orthopedic surgery emergency room admissions at 
major medical centers across the country. Whether due to blunt or high energy mechanisms, femur and tibia 
fractures often necessitate surgical intervention a nd prolonged hospital stays due to the need for medical 
clearance, surgery, physical therapy, pain control and discharge planning. Pain management directly impacts 
a patient’s ability to mobilize with physical therapy, their desire to go home or to a rehab ilitation facility, and 
their need for narcotic medications which have deleterious side effects such as delirium and addiction. 
However, given the unpredictable and “non -elective” nature of fracture care there is little infrastructure in 
place to optimize outcomes for fracture patients with regards to pain control and its sequela.  
 
A multitude of Level 1 evidence in arthroplasty research has demonstrated that multimodal analgesia pre 
and post -operatively combined with intra -operative surgical site injectio n (SSI) leads to reduced post -
operative pain, narcotic requirements, and length of stay in addition to increased mobility and patient 
satisfaction scores1–3.  As a result, the standard of practice in arthroplasty has been to use regimented pain 
protocols including SSI to improve patient outcomes4. While pain control is recognized as one of the single 
most important factors that impacts a patient’s hospital stay and outcomes, there is a dearth of Level 1 
rese arch on multimodal pain control in the Orthopedic trauma literature.  
 
Recent studies have found support for the use of surgical site injections in patients with femoral fracture 
treated with plate fixation, intramedullary nail or arthroplasty. In a random ized control trial, Koehler et al 
studied patients with femur fractures in all anatomic regions and randomly assigned them to either receive a 
surgical site injection (SSI) and routine pro re nata (PRN) post -op pain medication or only PRN pain 
medication5. Post -operatively, a visual analog score was employed to assess pain and narcotic

administration which showed a statistically significant difference in pain scores and narcotic usage 
administration between the two groups on post -operative day one, with th ose who received SSI having less 
pain and narcotic usage. What remains to be seen is how these interventions impact rehabilitation and 
narcotic usage in the long -term.  
 
After sustaining hip or other lower extremity fractures, roughly 50% of patients experi ence persistent pain 
at the fracture site. Their perception of this pain and the limitations that they suffer because of it may be 
influenced by their perioperative pain control and expectations regarding their pain and ability to ret urn to 
normal living6. The goal of this study is to not only impact the acute use of narcotics during the inpatient 
admission but to impact the long term outcome of fracture pain on long -term functional outcomes for these 
patients.  
 
At our institution pre -op fracture  pain management was  not standardiz edand had been  a combination of 
morphine, fentanyl, dilaudid, and oxycodone given in the emergency and in -patient setting.  Post -operatively, 
oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -325mg and 10 -325mg were  given for moderate and severe pain every four 
hours respectively with a dose of oxycodone -acetaminophen 5 -325 for breakthrough pain. Adjuncts to these 
medications such as acetaminophen, tramadol, ketorolac, ofrimev, gabapentin, pregabalin were  given 
inconsistently and often not at all. Starting November 2018 our institu tion began a new post -op pain 
medication protocol. In this study a standardized regimen of pain medication will be given to all patients 
who are enrolled  to eliminate this as a potential confounder . The ultimate goal of this study is to diminish 
the use of  post -op narcotics and reduce post -operative pain through the use of an intra -operative SSI. 
 
Rationale for Drug Selection  and Route of Administration  
 
In the proposed study, the drugs bupivacaine  (marcaine ), morphine sulfate (duramorph), and ketorolac 
(toradol) will be used as a surgical site injection pain “cocktail” as is standard practice in total joint surgery1–
4,7–10. Orthopedic pain injection cocktail regimens normally  include a  local amide anesthetic, a NSAID, and an 
opiate for multimodal therapy (see table 1, taken from Elmallah et al)10. Occasionally steroid s, antibiotics 
and other fillers are given. Most commonly ropivacaine or bupivacaine are given as the local anesthetic, 
morphine sulfate is given as an opiate, and ketorolac is given as the NSAID. Injection s are  given via tissue 
infiltration  or intramuscula r injection  and described as  “peri -incisional”,  “periarticular”, “extra -articular”, 
and/ or “perifracture” injections1–4,7–13. In all cases, the injection is placed in the soft tissue around the 
relevant zone of injury. In published studies and in common practice, p atients receive  surgical site  injections 
in the deep tissues including the muscle, synovium, capsule, and periosteum, and into the superficial tissues.  
 
As this replicates the  standard of care in arthroplasty, this method of injection to the tissue surrounding the 
fracture site does not significantly increase risk to subjects. The proposed study follows the same injection 
methods as  Koehler et al.  where no adverse events were noted from administration. While there is a 
potential for inadvertent intra -neural or intravascular injection, the injection will be  administered away 
from blood vessels and nerves and under direct visualization to the soft -tissue surro unding the fracture 
(predominately muscle) and incision. We do not anticipate patients suffering any major complications from 
receiving the injection . 
 
As for the choice of drugs, at our institution, a peri -incisional analgesic cocktail is  injected before closure  of 
all total hip and knee replacements4,9. This consists of 40ml 0.25% marcaine, 5mg mo rphine (5ml), and 30 
mg ketorolac  (1ml) .  In an RCT, Koehler et al demonstrated the efficacy of a perifracture cocktail containing 
400 mg of 0.75% ropivacaine (53.33 mL), 0.6 mg of 1 -mg/mL epinephrine (0.6 mL), and 5 mg of 0. 5-mg/mL 
morphine sulfate (10 mL) for pain control  in femur fracture patients5. In a study by Kang et al., a multimodal 
periarticular injection was given to hip fracture patients using a  100-mL cocktail of 300 mg  ropivacaine (40 
mL) , 10 mg morphine sulfate (10 mL ), 30 mg  ketorolac (1 mL ), and 300 mg 1:1000 epinephrine (0.3 mL )12. 
In a study by Jung et al, multimodal periarticular inject ions were given fo r high tibial osteotomies using a  50-

mL pe riarticular injection cocktail of 200 mg bupivacaine (20 mL ), 10 mg morphine sulfate (10 mL ), and 200 
mg 1:100,00 0 epinephrine (0.2 mL )13. In a total joint  study by Busch, patients received ropivacaine, 
ketorolac, epimorphine, and epinephrine2.  
 
The FDA -approved indications for bupivacaine (marcaine), morphine sulfate (duramorph), and ketorolac 
(toradol) injection  include infiltration and/or intramuscular injection for pain control.  Dosing for marcaine  
infiltration  is 0.25% concentration up to 175mg  with a further instruction stating “s tandard textbooks 
should be consulted to determine the accepted procedures and techniques for the  administration of 
marcaine” . Ketorolac tromethamine is approved for  intramuscular (IM) administration as: 15 mg  in 1 mL 
(1.5%),  30 mg in 1 mL (3%) , and 60 mg in 2 mL (3%) in sterile solution . Morphine sulfate  is approved for  
intramuscular dosing up to 10 mg per 70kg every 4 hours.  The peri -incisional injection of these medications 
is a common prescribed  procedure  as illustrated in numerous books and studies1,7,10 –12.  
2.2 Specific Aims  
 
AIM 1:  To determine if SSI given to during lower extremity  fracture surgery reduces post -operative pain. 
This will be evaluated through the randomizing patients who either receive general or spinal anesthesia in to 
two separa te groups, injection or control, and monitoring their pain scores afterwards both in the hospital 
and outpatient settings.  (The type of anesthesia will be determined by the treating anesthesiologist;  it is not 
an experimental variable.)  
 
AIM 2: To determine if SSI given during lower extremity  fracture surgery significantly changes  post -
operative narcotic usage. Using the same groups as above, this will be evaluated through the measurement 
of narcotic usage both in the immediate post -operative period  and for 2 weeks after surgery.  
 
AIM  3: To determine if SSI given during lower extremity  fracture surgery alters  post -operative function, 
length of stay, and complications after surgery.  This will be measured through rehabilitation 
documentation, dischar ge documentation, chart review, and patient interviews.  
2.3 Statistical Hypotheses  
 
We hypothesize that SSI given at the time of surgery will reduce post -operative pain and narcotic usage not 
only during the patients’ inpatient  hospital stay but also as an out patient. Furthermore, SSI will improve 
post -operative function, shorten length, of stay, and reduce complications not limited to but including deep 
venous thrombosis, delirium, and narcotic dependency. Failing to reject the null hypothesis would signify 
that SSI has no clinically relevant impact on post -operative outcomes in hip fracture surgery.  
2.4 Objectives and Purpose  
The ultimate goal of this study is to determine how effective SSI is in reducing post -operative pain in patients 
with lower extremity long bone fractures and to determine how that reduction in post -operative pain impacts 
a patient’s hospital stay in the short term and their use of narcotics during the treatment period.  Primary 
outcomes measures will be reported and observed pai n scores and narcotic use. VAS and  APS -POQ will be 
used to measure pain scores.  While it is expected that the greatest benefit of the SSI will be seen in the first 
day or two after surgery it is possible that there will be in an overall reduction in long -term narcotic use. 
Secondarily, function/rehabilitation, length of stay, and complications may be impacted by the intervention.

3.1 Description of Study Design  
The researchers will use NYU admission records, emergency room records, orthopedic consult records, and 
immediate care records to identify patients eligible for participation in the study. Orthopedic residents and 
authorized researchers will consent and enroll patients pre -operatively.  
 
Subjects with a qualifying frac ture will be randomized to either the SSI or control group. Subjects in the SSI 
group will receive a peri -incisional  injection of 40cc 0.25% bupivacaine (m arcaine ), 5 mg morphine sulfate 
(duramorph ) (1 mg/cc, 5 cc total), and 30 mg of ketorolac (30 mg/cc, 1 cc total) into soft-tissue  and 
musculature surrounding the fracture site and 0.25% Bupivacaine (Marcaine) 10 mL into the subcutaneous 
tissue surrounding the surgical incision. The control group will receive no injection . The injection will be 
administere d by the subjects NYU orthopedic surgeon, all of whom are familiar with the technique.  The patient 
will be blinded to if a medication  is being injected. Subjects will not receive ketorolac if they have kidney 
disease or a history of allergy to NSAIDS or as pirin. The dose of ketorolac will be reduced to 15 mg (30 mg/cc, 
0.5cc total) in subjects older than 65 years of age, in subjects with a history of peptic ulcer disease, a CrCl of 
30 to 50 ml/min, or subjects with diabetes.  These modifications  are recommen ded by the manufacturer and 
are used in standard practice. A sub group analysis will be done on patients who receive this lower dosage to 
see if it has an impact on the data.   
 
After initial recruitment, subjects’ pain will be assessed via visual analog sc ale (VAS) by nurs ing staff on a q4h 
basis. A standardized regimen of pain medication will be given to all subjects who are enrolled.  Pre-
operatively subjects will receive a cetaminophen  1gm  oral (every 6 -8 hours, not to exceed 4gm daily)  and 
meloxicam 15mg oral once daily.  Post-operatively, subjects will receive  acetaminophen  1gm  oral (every 6 -8 
hours, not to exceed 4gm daily) , ketorolac 30mg inj ection , once daily in AM, starting POD 1(15mg  for patients 
>65 years of age and/or renal impairment) , and pregabalin (Lyrica) 50mg  oral every 8 hours  (held for 
sedation) . Ice PRN for mild pain, tramadol 50mg oral every 8 hours PRN for moderate pain, and tramadol 
100mg oral every 8 hours  PRN  for severe  pain. Oxycodone 5mg oral every 6 hours PRN will be given for 
breakthrough pain.  
 
Physical therapy records with regards to ambulation distance and exercise endurance will be examined. Daily 
assessments of pain via VAS will obtained by the nursing staff as per standard protocol. APS -POQ form will be 
given on POD1.  
 
After discharge subjects will receive a 7-10 day  prescription for acetaminophen 1000mg every 8 hours , 
meloxicam 15mg oral once daily, and t ramadol 50mg oral, every 4 -6 hours, PRN (12 tablets to be  dispensed) . 
Subjects will call the provider to request refills as needed.

After discharge the research staff will call the subjects up to every other day for the first week, twice in the 
second week, once weekly for the third and 4th weeks and then mont hly after discharge to ascertain pain 
level, reported narcotic usage, and functional status. Research staff will verify documented narcotic refills 
through epic and pharmacy records. Four to  eight weeks after injury subjects will complete a SMFA as well 
as another APS -POQ form over the phone with a trained interviewer.

4.3 Vulnerable Subjects  
No vuln erable populations will be intentionally solicited. It is possible that employees, economically 
disadvantaged persons and students will be solicited in the course of enrollment however no one will be 
specifically recruited for these reasons and no one with  ties to the NYU Orthopedics department or NYU School 
of Medicine will be eligible for participation.  
4.4 Recruitment and Consent  
 
This study will utilize EPIC to identify subjects  and redcap  to manage and store relevant data . EPIC will be 
used to identify patients who have been admitted with the injury types described above and who meet the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. The PHI that will be seen will include their name, diagnosis , medical record 
number, age, and telephone number. This is the minimum necessary to identify patients over time and to 
determine if they are eligible for the study.   Approved study team members will handle recruitment efforts. 
Patients confidentiality will be maintained as all study team members  will have gone through CITI training  
and data will be keep in a secure manner as detailed below.  This recruitment search will be done daily.  
 
All orthopedic surgeons at NYU will be notified of the study  prior to initiation. If the treating physician has a 
patient who is recruited and consented they will be notified via sendsafe email.  
 
There will be no recruitment materials used in the study. All recruitment will be done face to face.   
 
If a subject requests information regarding opting out of further recrui tment for all research, subjects will be 
directed to contact research -contact -optout@nyumc.org or 1 -855-777 -7858.  
 
Process of Consent  
The consent for participation will be collected during the hospital stay on day one by a study team member . 
The study team member may or may not be a part of the patients care team . Due the rapid nature of trauma 
surgery, patients will have a few hours fro m the time of recruitment to the time of surgery to decide if they 
want to participate in the study.  This will be done in privacy in the patient’s hospital room or other private 
location such as a patient conference room.  Extensive discussion of risks an d possible benefits of participation 
will be provided to the participants and their families. Consent forms will be IRB -approved and the participant

will be asked to read and review the document. The investigator will explain the research study to the 
part icipant and answer any questions that may arise. All participants will receive a verbal explanation in terms 
suited to their comprehension of the purposes, procedures, and potential risks of the study and of their rights 
as research participants. Participa nts will have the opportunity to carefully review the written consent form 
and ask questions prior to signing. The participants will have the opportunity to discuss the study with their 
surrogates or think about it prior to agreeing to participate. The par ticipant will sign the informed consent 
document prior to any procedures being done specifically for the study. The participants may withdraw 
consent at any time throughout the course of the trial. A copy of the signed informed consent document will 
be giv en to the participants for their records. The rights and welfare of the participants will be protected by 
emphasizing to them that the quality of their medical care will not be adversely affected if they decline to 
participate in this study.   
 
A website ( https://nyuorthoresearch.com/ ) has been created to assist study team members with subject 
enrollment and consent form access. The website will be updated every six months. Only IRB -approved study 
documents will be uploaded on the website. The IRB-approved study team members may use this website to 
download a pdf version of the consent form, which can then be printed and signed by the study subject.  The 
website will altogether be used as a tool for IRB -approved st udy team members to access clean study 
documents.  A link on the website will also direct the study team member to a redcap survey  that will link 
directly to the redcap project  to allow for direct entry of the patient’s information for the study. After ente ring 
the patient  information into the redcap survey, the study team member will not be able to re -download the 
patient’s protected health information from the website and no subject protected health information will be 
stored on the website. This process i s necessary to allow for IRB -approved study team members to enroll 
subjects while appropriately limiting access to the protected health information in the redcap project as 
outlined in this protocol.  Please see section 10.5 for further information on secur ity of the website.  
 
After obtaining consent, the IRB -approved study team members will either place the consent in a locked 
research box available at the participating hospitals locked resident room or place it in the locked office of the 
PI. Signed consents placed in a secure  research lockbox will be collected by IRB -approved study team 
members and placed in the locked  office  of the PI.  
 
Ultimately, a  copy of the signed informed consent document will be stored in the subject’s research record. 
The consent process, including th e name of the individual obtaining consent, will be thoroughly documented 
in the subject’s research record.  
 
 
Subject Capacity  
All subjects will be assessed for capacity to give informed consent  by the study team member, all of whom are 
physicians . Capaci ty will be assessed through the subjects’ ability to express understanding of the information 
presented to them, their ability to express a choice, their appreciation of how this is relevant to them, and 
reasoning about how the study might impact them and others. As specific for capacity testin g, the  patient must 
be able to answer  the following questions:  
 
• Understanding: "Can you tell me in your own words what I just said about the study?”  
• Expressing a choice: "Based on what we've just discussed about the s tudy, what would you choose?"  
• Appreciation: "Regardless of what your choice is, do you think that it is possible the medication can 
benefit you?" and "Regardless of what your choice is, do you think it is possible the medication can 
harm you?"  
• Reasoning: " How could participating in the study affect you?”  
 
Additionally, the study team member will assess mental status by asking the patient for their full name, 
location, and the date. This is a standard practice to ensure a patient is alert and oriented to per son place and

time . Capacity testing and the mental status exam will help to reduce the risk of influencing a patient whose 
judgement may be altered due to opiates or emotional stressors from trauma . As listed in exclusion criteria, 
those with dementia will be excluded from the study.  
 
All study team members will be physicians, trained in obtaining informed consent.  
 
Subject/Representative Comprehension  
The subject themselves will have to clearly st ate back the basic goals of the study (i.e. to look at the effect of 
different medications on bone healing) and state that they are willing to participate. This may be done in 
English or in their primary language with an interpreter.  
 
 
 
4.5 Duration of Study Particip ation  
The study will be open for 4 years after beginning enrollment.  
4.6 Total Number of Participants  and Sites  
Recruitment will end when approximately 400 participants are enrolled. It is expected that approximately 
400 participants will be enrolled in order to produce  300-350  evaluable participants.  There were 350 
procedures done on patients matching the inclusion and exclusion criteria in the last year.  Based on the 
simplicity of the intervention and historical enrollment for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery, we 
anticipate at least 25% participation . 
 
4.7 Participant Withdrawal or Termination  
 
Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request. An investigator 
may terminate participation in the study if:  
• Any clinical adverse event (AE), laboratory abnormality, or other medical condition or situation 
occurs such that continued participation in t he study would not be in the best interest of the participant  
• The participant meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously recognized) 
that precludes further study participation  
 
4.8 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
 
This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. 
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the PI will promptly inform the IRB and will provide 
the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
1. Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants  
a. Clinical criteria that would meet such risks include, but are not limited to: permanent nerve 
damage, tissue necrosis, or wound healing complications that are directly related to the injection  
2. Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping  
a. If patients receiving the injection require substantially less oral narcotic medication  than those 
in the control group, such that continuing to withhold the medication was not in their best 
interest, the study may be discontinued.  
3. Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements

5 Risks and Benefits  
5.1 Potential Risks  
 
There is no current standard of care in terms of trauma patients receiving these injections. At some 
institutions it is commonplace to give intra -operative injections for pain control. At NYU it is not standard 
practice  for trauma surgery however this same cocktail of medication s is given routinely during surge ry to 
patients undergoing arthroplasty (i.e. total hip and total knee replacement) . At this time based on NYU practice 
there is no risk of being in the control group and not receiving an injection. The risks of receiving and injection 
are related to the in jection site and medication type.  
 
Marcaine is characteristic of those associated with other amide -type local  anesthetics. A major cause of 
adverse reactions to this group of drugs is excessive plasma levels,  which may be due to overdosage, 
unintentional intravascular injection, or slow metabolic degradation . In this circumstance cardiac arrhythmia,  
respiratory distress,  restlessness , anxiety, and seizure may occur. These risks, however, are minimal as the 
dosage given in this study is the lowest effective  dose and the technique of administration minimizes such an 
outcome.  
 
Ketorola c is an NSAID and carries  a risk GI distress and  renal damage . NSAID use will be diminished in patients 
with poor renal function as described.  Post -operative labs are ordered as  the standard of care and will allow 
physicians on the treatment team to identify any renal compromise.  
 
Morphine sulfate (duramorph) is a narcotic medication which carries a risk of constipation, respiratory 
distress , sedation, and dependence if given in  excess or if given over a prolonged period of time. In this study 
duramorph will be given once, limiting the likelihood of any complication.  
 
Patients are also monitored constantly during surgery by anesthesia and afterwards by physicians and nurse s 
to identify complications.  These medications are  given during surgery using  the lowest effective dose for the 
shortest duration consistent  with patient treatment goals  in order to minimize risk.  
 
An injection  of these medications  given into a blood vessel can cause unintended systemic effects as described 
above and an  injection given into a nerve can cause temporary numbness or weakness. Injection s will  be 
performed by trained surgeon under direct visualization  to prevent nerve da mage  and withdraw -inject 
method  will be used  to prevent intravascular injection.   
 
All oral and IV medications given after surgery are standard of care and pose no new risk to patients as they 
would already be receiving them.  The only change in this study  is adhering to this regimen whereas in practice 
some medications might get missed.   
 
The potential risks to the research subjects also include possible a loss of confidentiality of sensitive 
information collected for this study.  The risk of loss of confidentiality of the data is negligible under rigorous 
application of appropriate procedures for data security.

5.2 Potential Benefits  
Some subjects may experience better pain control, improved satisfaction, decreased need for narcotics and 
decreased side  effects. If the study is not inconclusive, the study’s results may benefit future patients by 
helping to confirm the benefits of multimodal regimens in the setting of orthopaedic trauma patients, 
furthering the case for them to become the standard of care  for peri - and postoperative pain control.  
 
6 Statistical Analysis  
6.1 General Approach  
As treated Sample . The primary analyses will follow the as -treated principle in order to evaluate the true 
outcome of the intervention as experienced by the patient who is bl inded to the intervention.  
 
Missing Data .  It is anticipated that the data for some subjects will be incomplete for various reasons:    missed 
clinic visits, refusal to answer a sensitive question on a questionnaire,  onset of illness,   loss -to-follow -up,  etc.  
All occurrences of incomplete data will be investigated to carefully document the reasons for the missing data.   
 
Sensitivity Analyses .  To evaluate the robustness of the main results to reasonable perturbations of the 
methods and assumptions used ,  competing statistical methods (those not used in the main analyses) will be 
relegated to serving as a guide to our confidence in the main results.   
 
6.2 Analysis of Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints:  
amount (mg) of narcotics (oral morphine mg equivalents) used  
duration of narcotic use  
patien t reported pain scores  
 
Secondary Endpoints:  
length of stay  
progress with physical therapy: distance ambulated, range of motion, exercises done  
reported long -term narcotic use at home/SAR  
discharge locatio n: home, acute rehab, skilled nursing facility  
documented narcotic refills  
falls  
adverse events  
 
 
The analysis of narcotic Use, VAS, APS -POQ, and SMFA scores will rely on a univariate repeated -measures 
analysis of variance model for mean score.  This model  is in the class of models commonly known as a unirep -
ANOVA models.  It assumes that the mean score is a function of elapsed time and the treatment regimen 
assigned.  This model takes into account the fact that the subject’s repeated measures are correlate d.  The 
fitted model will provide statistical estimates of the mean levels, the treatment -effect differences between 
mean levels, the standard deviation, the intra -class correlation coefficient,  95% CIs,  standard errors (SE), and 
statistical hypothesis t ests.   The estimates of means will be used to compute summary criteria such as area 
under the curve (AUC) for each regimen.  All estimates reported will be presented their 95% CIs.

All endpoints will be evaluated as fits the data set with graphical figur es such as scatter plots, box -and-whisker 
plots, and frequency histograms to visualize the distribution of these outcomes and their relationships to 
covariates and treatment assignment. When appropriate descriptive graphi cal and tabular methods, and  
Kapla n-Meier curves will also be estimated and presented in a graphical figure.  
 
6.2.1  Baseline Descriptive Statistics  
The following patient data will be recorded: age, gender, height, weight, date of admission, date of discharge, 
injury time, injury type, laterality , surgical approach, implants used, duration of surgery, time to union, 
contamination , ASA, comorbidities (smoking, cardiac history, diabetes, etc.), CBC ( WBC, PCV, HGB, RBC, 
indices, platelet count, differential), and medications.  
 
6.3 Sample Size  
In order t o have a sufficient N to power the study a minimum of 200 subjects per anesthesia group  will be 
recruited ( =0.05, =0.2). If the difference in the morphine equivalent consumption, is found to be 15mg daily 
with a standard deviation between the groups of 25mg, we will need 90 subjects per group in order to reject 
the null hypothesis with the probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of 
this null hypothesis is 0.05.   To allow for within group analyses and acco mmodate for the poor follow -up rate 
in fracture patients  we will need 4 00 patients.  
 
6.4 Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures  
As per standard of care, an anesthesiologist will determine if subject s receive general or spinal anesthesia. 
Within these groups subject s will randomized to receive a SSI or no intervention. Randomization will be 
done via redcap automated c omputer randomization After randomization the surgical team will be informed 
which group the patient has been randomized into.  
6.5 Breaking the Study Blind/Participant Code  
If there is any adverse event  related to the drug this will be disclosed to the patient . 
7 Assessment of Safety  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or worsens in severity 
during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  
Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures ar e considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the inv estigator to be of clinical significance  
 
7.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal  
Study number:  i18-01019   Page 19 
Version: 10 -21-20   
   
CONFIDENTIAL

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospital stay  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major 
clinical significance. They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes noted above. For exa mple, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result in in -
patient hospitalization, or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would 
typically be considered serious.  
 
All adverse events that do not meet a ny of the criteria fo r serious will  be regarded as non -serious adverse 
events .  
7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1  Severity of Event  
 
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severity.  
 
1. Mild  – Events require  minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily activities.  
2. Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
3. Severe  – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  
 
7.2.2  Relationship to Study Agent  
 
The clinician’s assessment of an AE's r elationship to study agent (drug, biologic, device) is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported in the study. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observ ation is an AE, the event will  be reported. All AEs must have their 
relationship to study agent assessed.. For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the 
participant will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. 
The deg ree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
1. Definitely Related  – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal l aboratory test result, occurs 
in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals.  
2. Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of ot her factors is 
unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time 
after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent  disease or other drugs or 
chemicals, and follows a clini cally reasonable response on withdrawal ).  
3. Possibly Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event occurred within a 
reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, other factors may have contributed 
to the event (e.g., the participant’s clinical conditio n, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate 
only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be 
upgraded to “probably related” or  “defin itely related,” as appropriate.

Interventional Template Version: 28 APR 2017  
4. Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose  temporal 
relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., the  event did not occur 
within a reasonable time after administration of the trial me dication) and in  which other drugs or chemicals 
or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., the  participant’s clinical condition,  other 
concomitant treatments).  
5. Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study drug administration, a nd/or evidence  exists that 
the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative,  definitive etiolo gy 
documented by the clinician.  
 
Dr. Philipp Leucht  will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will 
be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk 
information previously described for the study agent.  All reportable events that probably to definitely 
related to the study agent will b e reported within 5 days.  All nonreportable events will be tabulated and 
submitted at the time of continuation . 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
 
The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during  study visits and 
interviews of a study participant presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs 
including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAEs will be captured on the appropriate 
RF. Information to be c ollected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, 
relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), 
and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs o ccurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the participant is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not  reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. UPs will be recorded in the data collection system throughout 
the study.  
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be do cumented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at 
each level of severity to be performed. AEs characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset 
and duration of each episode.  
 
The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is 
obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of study participation. At each 
study visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last vis it. Events will be 
followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.   
 
All unresolved adverse events will be followed by the investigator until the events are resolved, the subject 
is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise e xplained.  At the last scheduled visit, the investigator 
will instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the subject’s personal 
physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.  The investiga tor will notify the 
study sponsor of any death or adverse event occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor will also be 
notified if the investigator sh ould become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in 
a subsequently conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.

7.4 Safety Oversight   
 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the saf ety of the study at his/her site.  This 
safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan . Dr. Phi lipp 
Leuc ht,, a trained Orthopedic  trauma surgeon , will systematically review the study data and events to ensure 
that the data is collected properly and the subjects are safe. He will review t he information gathered from

8 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
 
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a 
clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source 
documents.  Examples of these or iginal documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing 
records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptio ns certified after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, 
subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments 
involved in the clinical trial.  
 
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study.  All data requested 
on the CRF must be recorded.  All missing data must be explained.  If a space on the CRF is left blank because 
the procedure  was not done or the question was not asked, write “N/D”.  If the item is not applicable to the 
individual case, write “N/A”.  All entries will be printed legibly in black ink.  
 
Access to study records will be limited to IRB -approved members of the study team. The investigator will 
permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB/EC, the sponsor, government regulatory 
bodies, and University compliance and quality assurance groups of all study related documents (e.g. source 
documents, reg ulatory documents, data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure 
the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, 
etc.).

all documents and records required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, 
medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy recor ds for the participants in this study. The 
clinical study site will permit access to such records.  
 
At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as 
dictated by local IRB and Institutional regulatio ns. 
 
Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will be 
transmitted to and stored at NYU Langone Medical Center . This will not include the participant’s contact or 
identifying information. Rathe r, individual participants and their research data will be identified by a unique 
study identification number  with a key to this data being help by the PI.  The study data entry and study 
management systems used by clinical sites and by NYU Langone Medical  Center  research staff will be 
secured and password protected  in REDCap . At the end of the study, all study databases will be de -identified 
and archived at the NYU Langone Medical Center . 
 
10 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
10.1 Data Collection and Management Res ponsibilities  
 
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the site PI. All 
electronic data will be kept in NYU approved REDCap form. All paper data will be kept in a secure locked file 
drawer in the PIs office.  
 
The PI will be  responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data 
reported.  All source documents will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation 
of data. Black ink is required to ensure clarity of reproduced copies. When making changes or corrections, 
the original entry will be crossed out with a single line, and then initial ed and date d.  
 
10.2 Study Records Retention  
 
Study documents  will be retained for the longer of 3 years after close -out, 5 years after final 
reporting/publication, or 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application  is approved for the drug

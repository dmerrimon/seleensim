2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Clinicaltrials.gov compliance  
The FDA has approved all imaging scanners . This study has been registered on 
clinicaltri als.gov ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
2.2 Rationale  
  Fluorine -18 Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F FDG) PET/CT is established as a powerful imaging 
tool for cancer detection and monitoring response to therapy. However, not all cancers 
are identified reliably due to variable rate s of glucose metabolism. Whole -body MRI 
(WBMRI) emerges currently as an excellent modality for morphological characterization 
of soft tissue and skeletal lesions. Sodium Fluorine -18 (18F NaF ) was used in the 1970’s 
for bone scanning and can be used as a sk eletal tracer in current PET/CT scanners. The 
direct comparison of combined 18F NaF /18F FDG PET/CT and WBMRI for skeletal 
metastases detection was not attempted to date. However, such an approach has the 
potential to improve cancer diagnosis, staging, prog nosis, and therapy monitoring. The 
combination of these technologies may also allow for improved screening or earlier 
cancer detection. Expanding on our prospective data from a preliminary pilot phase trial 
(10 subjects) comparing WBMRI , separate 18F NaF  PET/CT and separate 18F FDG 
PET/CT, as well as on the pilot trial (56 participants at Stanford) of the combined 18F 
NaF/18F FDG PET/CT , we will now attempt a  prospective study comparing these 
imaging modalities against themselves and against conventional 99mTc MDP bone 
scintigraphy.  
2.3 Preliminary results  
To date we have prospectively evaluated in a pilot phase trial (Sep 2007 – Oct 2008) 10 
patients with cancer diagnosis, referred for 99mTc MDP bone scanning. There were 5  men 
and 5 women, 47  - 81 year -old (average: 61.5 ± 12), recruited for further imaging with 
18F NaF PET/CT, 18F FDG PET/CT and WBMRI. All 4 scans were performed within 1 
month  for each participant . Lesions detected with each test were tabulated and results 
were compared . The image quality a nd evaluation of extent of disease was superior by 
18F NaF PET/CT over 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy in all patients with skeletal lesions and 
Version 9    June 28, 201 7       CONFIDENTIAL    Page 8 of 20 over 18F FDG PET/CT in 3 of the patients with skeletal metastases. 18F NaF PET/CT 
showed osseous metastases where 18F FDG PET/CT was negative in another 3 
participants.  Extra -skeletal metastases were identified by 18F FDG PET/CT in 6 
participants. WBMRI with the combination of IDEAL, STIR and DWI pulse sequences 
showed less lesions than 18F NaF PET/CT in 5 patients, same n umber of lesions in 2 
patients and more lesions in 1 patient. When compared to 18F FDG, WBMRI showed 
fewer lesions in 3 patients and same lesions in 6 patients. Our pilot phase prospective trial 
demonstrated superior image quality and evaluation of skeleta l disease extent with 18F 
NaF PET/CT over 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy and 18F FDG PET/CT, as well as the 
feasibility of multi -sequence WBMRI.  In addition,  18F FDG PET /CT provided valuable 
soft tissue information that can change disease management. Further evalu ation of these 
findings using the recently introduced PET/MRI scanners is warranted .  
 
In another prospective trial we demonstrated the non -inferiority of the combined 18F 
NaF/18F FDG PET/CT  when compared to separate 18F NaF PET/CT and 18F FDG 
PET/CT scans  for evaluation of cancer patients. This strategy of combining 2 PET 
radiopharmaceuticals in a single scan opens the possibility for improved patient care and 
reduction in h ealthcare costs due to a reduction in the  number of scans  being conducted . 
 
In anot her 30 patients we have shown superior evaluation of skeletal disease extent with 
the combined 18F NaF/18F FDG PET/CT and the WBMRI compared to 99mTc-MDP 
scintigraphy. Further, PET/CT and WBMRI detected extra -skeletal disease that may 
change the management  of these patients. A combination of 18F NaF/18F FDG PET and 
WBMRI may provide the most accurate staging of patients with breast and prostate 
cancers.  
 
The recent introduction of hybrid PET/MRI scanners in clinical practice showed 
promising initial result s for several clinical scenarios. More than a decade ago, 
multimodality imaging was introduced into clinical routine with the development of the 
PET/CT. Since then, PET/CT has been widely accepted in clinical imaging and has 
emerged as one of the main canc er imaging modalities. With the recent development of 
combined PET/MRI systems for clinical use, a promising new hybrid imaging modality 
is now becoming increasingly available. The combination of functional information 
delivered by PET with the morphologic  and functional imaging of MR imaging (e.g., 
diffusion -weighted imaging, dynamic contrast -enhanced MR imaging and MR 
spectroscopy) offers exciting possibilities for clinical applications as well as basic 
research. However, the differences between CT and MR  imaging are fundamental. This 
also leads to distinct differences between PET/CT and PET/MRI not only regarding 
image interpretation but also concerning data acquisition, data processing and image 
reconstruction. PET/MRI is expected to show advantages over  PET/CT in clinical 
applications in which MRI is known to be superior to CT due to its high intrinsic soft 
tissue contrast. Two of these clinical indications are breast and prostate cancers.  
 
80 subjects were enrolled to compare 18F NaF/18F FDG PET/MRI and  the   
to 99mTc-MDP scintigraphy.  Our results indicate that the ability  of 18F NaF/18F FDG 
PET/MRI to identify more skeletal lesions than 99mTc-MDP BS, and to additionally 
Version 9    June 28, 201 7       CONFIDENTIAL    Page 9 of 20 identify extra -skeletal disease,  represent s a beneficial alternative to the single m odalities 
performed separately.  18F NaF/18F FDG PET/MRI is a promising approach for evaluation 
of skeletal and extra -skeletal lesions in a selected population of breast and prostate cancer 
patients.  However, the current duration of exam (4 min/bed) is too long for some of the 
elderly patients. Therefore, we are now shortening the WBMRI protocol from 4 min/bed 
to 2:30 min/bed, reducing the total time from approximately 45 min/scan to 20 -25 
min/scan . We plan to enroll and have funding 50 additional subjects ( 25/year) to further 
evaluate the combined 18F NaF/18F FDG  PET/MRI  as a reliable bone scanning modality . 
 
2.4 Study Design  
We intend to perform a prospective trial to determine the role of the combined 18F 
NaF/18F FDG PET/MRI  in the evaluation of skeletal m etastases in patients with breast  
and prostate cancers. This study will be a comparative stu dy that will investigate different 
types of bone scanning techniques. Patients will undergo preliminary evaluations to 
ensure eligibility, receive and sign informed  consent, be enrolled in the trial, and then 
undergo the combined 18F NaF /18F FDG PET/ MRI . Patients will be followed clinically 
by 12 -months post scan evaluation.  
 
Patients who present to the Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging C linic for a 99mTc 
MDP b one scan as part of their routine disease work -up/standard of care will be asked to 
participate in this study. If agreeable, written informed consent will be obtained by a 
member of the research team after explaining the risks, benefits, and procedures of the 
study.  We will follow Stanford guidelines for screening patients for renal function prior 
to PETMRI if  they are getting contrast . All scans will be performed within a 1 -month 
timeframe. Blind interpretation of the  combined 18F NaF /18F FDG PET/MRI  will be 
performed by Nuclear Medicine and Radiology readers. A direct comparison for each 
detected lesion will be performed among the imaging modalities.  
 
We will attempt to recruit patients who are referred for a 99mTc MDP bone scan for 
detection of skeletal m etastases. In a typical year, approximately 3,500 99mTc bone scans 
are performed in our Clinic, 90% (3,150) of them with referral for osseous metastases 
identification. We plan to recruit 40 patients per year  for 2 consecutive years . Cancers 
with highest p otential to metastasize to the skeleton (breast  and prostate cancers)  will be 
considered.  
 
All age ranges of adult population (>18 -year-old) will be recruited. Both men and women 
will be recruited. All ethnic background will be recruited. No healthy volun teers will be 
recruited. Pregnant women will be excluded because of the risk posed by unnecessary 
radiation to the fetus. Patients with metallic implants (prosthesis, ICD, pacemakers) will 
be excluded since these are contraindications for MRI.  
 
The subject s will be paid $15 0 to participate in this protocol. No costs will be charged to 
the subjects.

5. IMAGING SPECIFICS   
5.1 Modality or Modalities to be used  
PET/ MRI  
5.2 Details of Imaging (i.e. dynamic, static, number of scans, etc.)  
Whole -body (head to toes) PET/MRI  images will be obtained using a GE SIGNA scanner 
(GE Healt hcare). The PET emission scan is corrected using segm ented attenuation data 
of the MRI  scan. The PET images are reconstructed with a standard iterative algorithm 
(OSEM, two iterative steps, 28 subsets) using GE software release 5.0. All images are 
reformat ted into axial, coronal, and sagittal views and viewed with the software provided 
by the manufacturer (AW, GE Medical Systems).  
 
PET/MRI  images will be acquired in 3D mode at 45 -60 minutes after injection of 4 mCi 
of 18F FDG and 1 mCi of 18F NaF, using 7 -10 bed positions, 2 :30 minutes/bed.  
 
5.3 Details of processing/analysis  
The PET/MRI  scans will be interpreted by 2 ABNM certified Nuclear Medicine 
physicians (Andrei Iagaru, Guido Davidzon ) and 2 ABR certified Radiologists ( Andreas 
Loening , Shreyas Vasanaw ala) with significant clinical experience, blinded to the 
subjects’ medical history and the results of other imaging modalities. The outcomes of 
the imaging methods will be analyzed and compared against each other. Consensus read 
will be obtained for each scan. Characterization of lesions as true positive, true negative, 
false positive or false negative will be done through a combination of clinical follow up, 
imaging follow -up and/or histopathology findings (when possible).  For purposes of this 
study, the investigators will document an overall diagnosis of the findings for each scan 
on a 5 point scale to permit a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (1=benign, 
2=likely benign, 3=uncertain, 4=likely malignant, 5=malignant).  If the diagnosis is 
positive for metastases on any of the scans, the investigator will identify the number of 
lesions and locations of positivity, and record this information.

8.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Risks associated with Participation  
 
The administration of the radioactive substanc e will feel like a slight pinprick if given by 
intravenous injection. Patients who are claustrophobic may feel some anxiety while 
positioned in the scanner. Also, some patients find it uncomfortable to hold one position 
for more than a few minutes. The sub jects will not feel anything related to the 
radioactivity of the substance in their body. Because the radioactivity is very short -lived, 
the radiation exposure is low. The substance amount is so small that it does not affect the 
normal processes of the bod y.  
 
The average effective patient dose from whole -body 18F-FDG PET  examinations is about 
25 mSv independent of the acquisition protocol preferred (Brix G, Lechel U, Glatting G, 
Ziegler SI, Munzing W, Muller SP, Beyer T.Radiation exposure of patients under going 
whole -body dual -modality 18F -FDG PET/CT examinations. J Nucl Med. 2005 
Apr;46(4):608 -13). The bladder wall receives an average of 440 mrad/mCi (s.e. 76) in ten 
subjects who voided at 2 hr after administration of tracer. If these subjects had voided a t 
1 hr, the bladder -wall dose would have been reduced to 220 mrad/mCi. The brain 
received an average of 81 mrad/mCi in eight subjects. The doses to other organs, 
calculated from published dog biodistribution data, are between 50 and 85 mrad/mCi 
except for spleen and heart, which both received 160 mrad/mCi (Jones SC, Alavi A, 
Christman D, Montanez I, Wolf AP, Reivich M. The radiation dosimetry of 2 [F -
18]fluoro -2-deoxy -D-glucose in man. J Nucl Med. 1982 Jul;23(7):613 -7). 
 
Fluorine ions are a normal body cons tituent. The amount of fluorine ions in Sodium 
Fluoride F 18 Injection at the indicated dose has minimal effect on normal human 
physiology. When F -18 injection was approved for marketing in 1972, no adverse 
reactions were noted in over 400 patient studies reported in the medical literature. In a 
1999 review of the published literature, publicly available reference sources and adverse 
drug reaction reporting systems indicated that adverse reactions have not been reported  
for F -18 injection. Fluorine -18 ions decay with a physical half -life of 109.7 minutes.  
Ninety -seven percent (97%) of the decay results in emission of a positron with a 
maximum energy of 0.635 MeV, and 3% of the decay results in electron capture with 
subsequent emission of characteristic X -rays of oxygen.  The bone and bone marrow are 
considered the target and critical organs. These estimates were calculated based on 
human data and using the data published by the International Commission on 
Radiological Protection for Sodium Fluoride F -18 inje ction.  
 
Side effects of the MRI contrast agent injection include mild headache, nausea and local 
pain. Rarely (less than 1% of the time) low blood pressure and lightheadedness occurs. 
This can be treated immediately with intravenous fluids. Very rarely (le ss than one in one 
thousand), patients are allergic to the contrast agent. These effects are most commonly 
hives and itchy eyes, but more severe reactions have been seen which result in shortness 
of breath.  
Version 9    June 28, 201 7       CONFIDENTIAL    Page 14 of 20 8.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
We do not anticipate hazardous situations for the subjects as a result of this protocol. 
However, procedures will be in place for verification of correct radiopharmaceutical dose 
and route of administration (i.e., each dose will be double checked for dosimetry and 
quality by a  researcher and technologist). The study Principal Investigator (PI) or his 
designee will report unanticipated AEs related to the Stanford CCTO Safety Coordinator 
within 10 working days of becoming aware of the event (5 days if the event is life -
threatenin g or resulted in death) using the Adverse Events Communication Form. If the 
principal investigator determines the unanticipated adverse device effect presents an 
unreasonable risk to subjects, the study will be terminated as soon as possible, but no 
later than 5 working days after the PI makes the determination and no later than 15 
working days after first receiving notification of the effect.  
 
9. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 Institutional  Review of Protocol

subjects w ho have enrolled in the study. The Stanford Data Safety Monitoring Commi ttee 
(DSMC) will also monitor the study annually. The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and 
Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will audit study related activities at least annually 
in accordance with the DSMC SOP  to determine whether the study has been conduc ted 
in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).   This may include review of regulatory binders, case 
report forms, eligibility checklists, and source documents.   In addition, the DSMC will 
regularly review serious adverse events and protocol deviations associated with the 
research to ensure the protection of human subjects.   Results of DSMC audits will be 
communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the tim e of 
continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed .   
 
10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Populations  
Patien ts with ≥ stage 3 breast cancer  or ≥ stage 2 prostate cancer (and/or PSA >10 
micrograms/L), including patients with recurrent breast or prostate cancer  will be 
enrolled.  The analysis subset will consist of patients with a n interpretable 99mTc MDP 
Version 9    June 28, 201 7       CONFIDENTIAL    Page 15 of 20 bone scan,  18F NaF /18F FDG PET/ MRI evaluations, and a known clinical bone lesion 
evaluation at 12 months.  
10.2 Key Variables   
Diagnostic bone me tastases  status using 99mTc MDP bone scan,  18F NaF /18F FDG 
PET/ MRI , bone metastases status at 12 months (all binary)  
10.3 Endpoints  
Primary:  concordance between 99mTc MDP bone scan and  18F NaF /18F FDG PET/ MRI , 
as the proportion of patients where the modali ties agree.  
Secondary:  
 Per patient: concordance in cases, c oncordance in controls, sensitivity, specific ity, 
positive predicted va lue, negative predictive value  
 Per lesion: distribution of lesions seen on each modality  
 Proportion of diagnostic quality sc ans using the faster protocol compared to first 
cohort of 80 participants  
10.4 Plan of Analysis  
The principal analysis will aggregate patients from the two groups and will be conducted 
on a per -patient basis. We will calcul ate the concordance between the  modalities across 
outcomes (combining cases and controls) and evaluate the results by calculating the 
kappa coefficient. Secondary endpoints will be calculated, both as aggregates of the three 
diseases and separately by disease.  Sensitivities and other summ aries will only be 
calculated if  they involve a denominator of a t least 10.  
10.5 Sample Size  
A key parameter in determining the sample size for a study of the sensitivity and 
specificity of a new diagnostic modality relative to a standard modality is the degree of 
concordance of the modalities, or roughly speaking, the degree to which the modalities 
are corre lated. The higher the concordance, the smaller the sampl e size required. For 
example, if c urrent modalities for bone met astases detecti on (99mTc MDP b one scan) have 
a sensitivity of 80%, then t he number of cases needed to demonstrate a 10% margin of 
superiority ranges from 83 to 284.  Details are given in the Appendix  
10.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned.  
10.7 Criteria for Future Studi es 
The accrual will continue until reaching the sample size required for statistical analysis, 
as described above , given the results from the previous 30 patients . The combined 
PET/MRI scanners are an ideal tool to evaluat e this hypothesis . 
10.8 Accrual es timates    
 
We will attempt to recruit patients who are referred for a 99mTc MDP bone scan for 
Version 9    June 28, 201 7       CONFIDENTIAL    Page 16 of 20 detection of skeletal metastases. In a typical year, approximately 3,500 99mTc bone scans 
are performed in our c linic, 90% (3,150) of them with referral for osseo us metastases 
identification. We plan to recruit 40 patients per year. Cancers with highest potential to 
metastasize to the skeleton (breast  and prostate cancers) will be considered .

11. APPENDIX  
The sample size follows Connett et al 1 . We replace the no menclature of “Control” by “Old 
modality” and “Case” by “New Modality”.  The numbers A, B,C D are the true probabilities 
summing to 1 as shown in the table:  
 
 Old Modality   
New 
Modality  Positive  Negative   
Positive  A B Se.New  
Negative  C D  
 Se.Old   1 
 
A convenient parametrization consists of  
 The proportion discordant 
CBK  
 the sensitivity of the old modality Se.Old= A+C ,  
 the target improvement in sensitivity 
 CBCABA    
Connett et al adopt the parameterization:  
 Odds ratio

 Proportion positive under old but negative under new

With this parametrization the sample size is given by

The Connett parameters can be derived thus:

 and 
 K K    
 
To illustrate, we set the sensitivity of the old modality to 0.8, Delta to 0.1, If we set the 
discordance close to its minimum value 0.11 we get the following table:  
 
 Old Modality

Modality  Positive  Negative   
Positive  0.795  0.105 0.900  
Negative  0.005  0.095  0.100  
 0.800  0.200  1.000  
 
With resulting OR=21, P01=0.005.  With these parameters Connett's formula give N=84.

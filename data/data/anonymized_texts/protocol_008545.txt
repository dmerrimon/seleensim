CLINICAL TRIAL SUMMARY
Background
The smoke generated by electrosurgical devices in the process of dissection of tissues during laparoscopy can 
obscure the surgical visual field. Laparoscopic hysterectomy and laparoscopic myomectomy are procedures 
that produce a considerable amount of smoke, which impedes the operating surgeon. It is often necessary to 
suspend the surgery to allow the smoke to dissipate, or more commonly open a laparoscopic port to vent the 
smoke into the room, adding to the operating time. It is also common to remove the laparoscope to clean the 
lens because it can be soiled by the smoke as well. In order to enhance the dissipation of smoke and maintain 
an adequate pneumoperitoneum it is often necessary to increase the flow of carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the 
insufflator. Surgical smoke handling during laparoscopic surgery results in an increase of the known risks to 
the patient of using excessive CO 2; as well as exposing the operating room staff to the smoke which may 
create a potential health concern.
The electrostatic-precipitation of laparoscopic smoke is a new technique, marketed under the name 
Ultravision©, making it possible to precipitate the smoke as it is created, thereby actively eliminating it from 
the field of view. Safety and feasibility studies have been carried out allowing it to be placed on the market in 
Europe, Japan and the United States. A randomized study of its clinical effectiveness (ref: Ansell J. Surg, 
Endosc. (2014) 28: 2057-2065) showed that electrostatic-precipitation significantly improved visibility 
(reduction of visual impairment) and reduced surgery time in laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Ultravision is cleared for use in all laparoscopic surgery i.e. including laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy, in the United States.  However, the clinical benefits arising from its use in gynaecology have 
not yet been quantitatively assessed and published in an independent medical journal.
Study Purpose: 
There are three main study objectives
1.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision device during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on the quality of visualization in the laparoscopic field
2.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision device during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on procedural characteristics
3.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision device during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on clinical outcomes

Primary Hypothesis
The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that using Ultravision during laparoscopic hysterectomy 
and myomectomy improves visualization similar to that reported when used in laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
without the need for CO 2 exchange and that, by doing so, the amount of CO 2 that is utilized during the 
procedure and that the patient is exposed to is reduced compared to the current standard of care.  Ultravision 
has already been shown in laparoscopic cholecystectomy to minimize the amount of CO 2 that a patient is 
exposed to during laparoscopic surgery because it does not rely on the process of dilution using ongoing CO 2 
supply from the insufflator.  
Secondary hypothesis :
There are two aspects to CO 2 exposure during laparoscopic surgery: the amount of gas used and the intra-
abdominal pressure of the pneumoperitoneum. In addition to the amount of CO 2 utilized during the procedure 
another related factor is the intra-abdominal pressure of the pneumoperitoneum.  Decreasing the intra-
abdominal pressure below the conventional 12-15 mmHg during laparoscopic surgery has been shown by 
others to lead to improved clinical outcomes.1
Use of the Ultravision during laparoscopic hysterectomy and myomectomy is expected to allow for lower 
intrabdominal insufflation pressures. In this study, the target abdominal pressure for all procedures conducted 
will be 10mmHg.  The ability to maintain that pressure during the procedure will be reported and compared 
for the randomized group.  In addition to this secondary endpoint other procedure data will be collected to 
assess the potential impact of the Ultravision™ System on procedure characteristics such as adverse events, 
procedure time, patient temperature, patient end tidal CO 2 level, post-op medications for pain etc.
Study Population
The study will enroll female patients who are indicated for laparoscopic hysterectomy or myomectomy.  
Patients must meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Study Design
This is a prospective blinded, randomized controlled study.  The study will include three study arms:

Patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomies will be randomized to one of either “Ultravision” (study arm  
1) or “no Ultravision” (study arm 2, i.e. the current standard of care) groups.  The study will be conducted 
blinded to the investigator during the procedure through patient discharge.  The Ultravision system will be 
present in both, with the generator covered (not seen by user) and either on or off depending on the 
randomization. 30 patients will be enrolled, 15 per group.
Whilst less common, it has been reported that myomectomy is considered to be a procedure that generates a 
great deal of surgical smoke.  Five patients undergoing myomectomy will have their procedures conducted 
using the Ultravision (study Arm 3).  Results from this study arm will be reported and discussed.  All 
measures conducted for the randomized study arms will be collected but no comparative statistical analysis is 
planned for this group.
Primary Endpoints
Success will be based on demonstration that the procedures using Ultravision demonstrate a meaningful 
difference/improvement when compared to the control according to the following measures:
1.The quality of visualization in the laparoscopic field of view will be assessed by the investigator 
using a 5 point Visual Analog Scale (V AS).  Results for the laparoscopic hysterectomy will be 
compared to determine if there is a significant difference between “Ultravision” and “no Ultravision” 
groups.
2.The amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) utilization during the procedure will be measured.  Results for 
the laparoscopic hysterectomy study arms will be compared to determine if there is a significant 
difference in the amount of CO 2 utilized between groups.
Secondary Endpoints:
The following data will be collected for all groups.  Comparisons between the study arms 1 and 2 will be 
conducted.  For study arm 3 the data will be reported and generally compared to study arms 1 and 2.
From the initial 10mmHg setpoint, the time in minutes until a change /increase in the abdominal 
pressure is required, and the reason for the change (i.e. visualization, access).
The number of times the laparoscope is removed in order to clean it of debris.
The number of times a trocar valve is opened to evacuate smoke.
The number of pauses due to a loss of sufficient visibility.
The number of times there is a loss of pneumoperitoneum due to the evacuation of the surgical 
smoke.
The maximum intra-abdominal pressure used and the duration at that pressure.
The number of times intra-abdominal pressure required adjustment during the procedure.

The patient's temperature during the procedure.
The amount of pain control medicine administered to the patient prior to discharge from the hospital 
and reported at the two week follow-up visit.
Adverse Events.
 End tidal CO2 volume throughout the procedure (taken at 15-minute intervals)
Duration of the procedure (from the time all ports are in place to completion of the colpotomy for  
hysterectomy and to closure of last uterine defect for myomectomy).
Duration of post-operative hospital care (time of entry to post-operative recovery to discharge)
Pain assessments (including pain score and pain location) documented during post-operative recovery, prior to  
discharge and at the two week follow up visit. Other Data Collection:
Electrosurgical instrument(s) used.
Study Size:
30 consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy randomized 1:1 to either an “Ultravision” or 
“No Ultravision” (control, current standard of care) group.  Five consecutive patients undergoing 
myomectomy.
Duration of Study:
Each patient will be assessed from the start of procedure until discharge from the hospital.  Routine follow-up 
(i.e. that normally undertaken under current standard of care) will be performed.  Formal follow-up for the 
study is through patient discharge, however any adverse events that occur thereafter that are related to the 
procedure will be reported.
The target for the overall duration of the study is six months.
Data Analysis:  Descriptive and comparative statistics for all endpoints will be applied to analyze the results 
from study arms 1 and 2.  Success is dependent on a favorable comparison between Ultravision and no 
Ultravision groups for Primary Endpoints. 95% confidence levels are assigned.  Descriptive statistics for 
study arm 3 with general comparisons to study arms 1 and 2.  Exploratory analysis may be conducted.

1.STUDY PROTOCOL INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND 
The Ultravision™ System is a medical device that removes surgical smoke by means of electrostatic 
precipitation from the visual field during laparoscopic surgical procedures. “Surgical smoke” refers to the 
suspended particulate matter that is generated as a by-product of the combustion and other processes that are 
associated with the use of energy-based surgical instruments. Surgical smoke can obscure (partially or totally)  
the surgeon’s view of the operative field and this has obvious safety implications for the patient. In the case of  
laparoscopic procedures, which are increasing in popularity, the smoke is retained within the “closed 
abdomen” and this, coupled with the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum, presents additional challenges for the surgical 
team.  The Ultravision™ System can therefore be considered an accessory to electrosurgical instruments that 
is used to clear the surgical smoke generated during their use and as such will only be used when such devices  
are in use.  
This post-market clinical study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ultravision™ System when 
compared to the current standard of care (no field clearing/evacuation).  Comparisons in terms of surgical 
field visualization, procedure times, and CO2 consumption will be conducted in order to determine whether 
or not any clinical benefits are derived from the use of the Ultravision™ System compared to the standard of 
care.  In order to reduce bias, the study is being conducted using a randomized blinded design.
2.STUDY PURPOSE 
There are three main study objectives
1.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision™ System during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on the quality of visualization in the laparoscopic field;
2.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision™ System during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on procedural characteristics; and
3.To evaluate the impact of use of Ultravision™ System during laparoscopic hysterectomy and 
myomectomy on clinical outcomes.

5.US REGULATORY STATUS
The Ultravision™ System obtained regulatory clearance through US FDA’s De Novo Classification Process 
(DEN 150022). The system has been in distribution in Europe since January 2014 and in the US since 
December of 2016, over 250 systems are currently in use.  To date there have been no incident or medical 
device reports (patient injury reports) and there have been no product recalls.  The Ultravision™ System and 
consumable items are being provided for this study free of charge.
6.STUDY DESIGN
This is a prospective blinded, randomized controlled study.
Confidential Page 12 of 29
 Mercy Institutional Review Board
Approval Date: November 5, 2019
Arms 1 and 2: Patients enrolling in study arms 1 and 2 who are undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy will be  
randomized to either the Ultravision™ System (Arm 1) or Standard of Care/no Ultravision (Arm 2) study 
arms.  
Arm 3:  Patients enrolling in study arm 3 who are undergoing a laparoscopic myomectomy will have their 
procedure conducted with the Ultravision™ System.  The procedure is purported to generate the greatest 
smoke and therefore constitutes a worst-case challenge for the system.
All prescribed evaluations will be performed for all study arms.
7.STUDY SIZE
Arms 1 and 2 (randomized) will enroll 15 patients each.  Arm 3 will enroll an additional 5 patients.
8. DURATION
The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 6 months.
9.HYPOTHESES
Primary hypothesis:
The primary hypothesis being tested in this study is that using the Ultravision™ System during laparoscopic 
hysterectomy and myomectomy improves visualization similar to that reported when used in laparoscopic 
cholecystectomy and that the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) utilized is reduced as CO 2 is deemed related to 
complications such as tissue desiccation and postoperative pain.2 
Secondary hypothesis :
In addition to the amount of CO 2 utilized during the procedure another related factor is the intra-abdominal 
pressure of the pneumoperitoneum.  Decreasing the intra-abdominal pressure below the conventional 12-15 
mmHg during laparoscopic surgery has been shown by others to lead to improved clinical outcomes.3

11.SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION & SELECTION
Potential subjects will be identified from the clinical practice of the participating investigator or by their 
respective research staff. 
Patients presenting to the clinical practice of the participating investigator for diagnosis or treatment 
consistent with the inclusion criteria will be informed about the study.  
With referral from the treating physician/provider, patients scheduled for surgery prior to the start of the study  
may be contacted via telephone by a study team member to inform them of the study, assess their interest and 
assess their eligibility to participate.  An IRB approved script will be used for such calls.  For interested 
patients, a copy of the informed consent can be mailed or emailed to the patient for their review and 
consideration  prior to their next clinic visit or the scheduled procedure.  
Each new subject presenting for evaluation or inclusion is to be assessed for adherence to the following 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Determination of whether subjects satisfy the criteria may be established by 
review of medical records, subject interview, physical examination, or testing as appropriate. A baseline form

is used to collect subject screening information and baseline assessments.  Patients are considered enrolled 
once it has been demonstrated that the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met and the patient signs the 
informed consent.  
11.1.INCLUSION CRITERIA
Subjects MUST meet all the following:
I1 Is 21 years or older.
I2Provide written informed consent prior to trial procedures after studies indicate  
that the patient needs the prescribed procedure.
I3 Agrees to attend all follow-up assessments.
I4Is clinically indicated to undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy (with or without  
unilateral or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy) or  
myomectomy.
11.2.EXCLUSION CRITERIA
Subjects MUST not have any of the following:
E1Existing comorbidities that would contraindicate them for laparoscopic surgery.
E2 Be pregnant.
12. SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT AND HIPAA AUTHORIZATION
A partial waiver of HIPAA Authorization is being requested for the purposes of initial screening for study 
eligibility and recruitment purposes.   Identifiable health information to be accessed under this waiver will 
include contact information, demographics, and medical history.  Only study team members will have access 
to this information.  Safeguards to maintain privacy and confidentiality of information will be taken as 
described in the data collection and management section of the protocol. Patient inclusion could be 
substantially hindered without the ability to review patients’ records for eligibility and recruitment purposes, 
particularly for patients who may have already been scheduled for surgery at the time the study begins.  
Referred patients presenting for diagnosis or treatment consistent with the inclusion criteria will undergo the 
informed consent process to authorize the gathering of data recorded on the Subject Screening & Enrollment 
Form.  
Confidential Page 16 of 29
 Mercy Institutional Review Board
Approval Date: November 5, 2019
The study investigator will administer informed consent or may delegate the responsibility to a qualified 
individual as long as it is defined on the study responsibility log.  When administering consent, it must be 
evident that the participant comprehends the nature of the study and the risks and benefits.  Evidence is the 
patient is able to verbalize these topics in sufficient detail to confirm comprehension.
Completion of the informed consent does not constitute enrollment.  Enrollment occurs once screening is 
complete and all criteria for participation have been met.
Subjects must document their consent for study participation by signing the Institutional Review Board 
approved Informed Consent Form.  The informed consent process must be consistent with the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  The subject must be given the opportunity to ask questions of, and receive answers from, study 
personnel prior to a request to sign the Informed Consent Form.  This form is to be co-signed by the 
investigator.  Failure to obtain consent prior to subject participation is considered a protocol deviation and 
must be reported to the Institutional Review Board.
Note that subjects will be asked to provide consent so that data related to their eligibility status data can be 
gathered.
After the subject and investigator sign the Informed Consent Form, the original is to be filed in the subject’s 
study binder.  Copies will be filed in the subject’s medical record and the subject is also to be given a copy.
13.SCREENING & ENROLLMENT
Patient demographics and other baseline information will be collected to establish whether the patient meets 
the requirements for the study.   Each patient will be assigned a unique study number.  Baseline information 
will be collected, consistent with the standard of care.

13.1.RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING
For study arms 1 and 2 patients will be randomized using a paper envelope system.  Randomization shall 
occur just prior to surgery.  The investigator will not be informed of the randomization assignment until 
after the surgical intervention for a patient is completed.  For randomization, a simple envelope system 
will be used.  Pre-made study arm assignment envelopes of the study quantity will be created.  30 
envelopes – 15 containing “Ultravision” cards and 15 containing “Non-Ultravision” cards - will be 
opened by the Lead Study Coordinator just prior to the procedure.  For patients randomized and 
withdrawn prior to the procedure or converted to open procedure, replacement envelopes will be added to 
the envelope pool.
To preserve blinding of the investigator/surgeon during the procedure, the Ultravision™ System 
consumable will be introduced into the patient and the generator will appear operational during all 
procedures.  The display will be covered during use so that the investigator is not aware of whether the 
system is on or off.  If for any reason unblinding occurs accidentally or the Principal Investigator deems it  
necessary to unblind a particular patient, it will be recorded by notifying the Lead Study Coordinator and 
recording the reason for this unblinding on the narrative CRF in the relevant section.  Study assessments 
will be collected per protocol, but the data will not be pooled with blinded data for analysis.  
13.2.PREOPERATIVE PROTOCOL
 Patients will be assessed preoperatively in accordance with the current standard of care.

16.ADVERSE EVENTS
16.1.ADVERSE EVENT CATEGORIES
For purposes of this protocol the adverse event definitions are derived from GCP standards and FDA 
Guidance.5  
Table 4
Adverse Event Definitions
Adverse Event
(AE)Untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs  
(including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users or other persons, whether or  
not related to the medical device. Includes events related to the study device or 
comparator device, or the procedures involved.
Serious Adverse 
Event
(SAE)Adverse event that:
 Led to death
 Led to serious deterioration in the health of the  
subject, that:
o Resulted in a life-threatening illness or  
injury, or
o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a  
body structure or a body function, or
o Required in-patient hospitalization or  
prolongation of existing hospitalization, or
o Resulted in medical or surgical intervention  
to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a  
body structure or a body function
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a  
congenital abnormality or birth defect
Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition without serious deterioration  
in health, is not considered a serious adverse event.  Hospitalization is defined as  
an admission greater than 24 hours
Adverse Device 
Effect
(ADE)Untoward and unintended response to a medical device or as a consequence of  
inadequate labeling and includes any event that is a result of user error.  
Serious Adverse 
Device Effect

The signs, symptoms, and sequelae of an underlying adverse event (linked pathophysiologically to the 
AE) should not be reported as separate adverse events.     
All adverse events, of any type, are to be recorded on an “Adverse Event Form”.  Adverse events are to 
be characterized by their severity, relatedness the implant procedure, need for therapy, and resolution 
status.
Adverse events will initially be characterized as “serious” or “non-serious” by the study investigator.  
16.2.ADVERSE EVENT ADJUDICATION
Events are to be initially judged by the investigator as to their relatedness to the study device, implant 
procedure, or “other etiology”.  The classifications will be “not related”, “probably not related”, 
“undetermined”, “probably related”, or “related”.  
16.3.   REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS AND UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS
Serious adverse events and Unanticipated Problems related to the research will be reported to the Mercy 
Institutional Review Board. 
16.4.SUBSEQUENT SURGICAL INTERVENTIONS
Some complications may lead to a subsequent surgical intervention.  The reason for each subsequent 
surgical intervention and the action taken is recorded on the case report form, along with the identification  
of the type subsequent surgical interventions according.  The exact type of intervention must be specified.
17.PATIENT WITHDRAWAL
A patient may choose to withdraw from participation in the study at any time without penalty.  If a patient 
chooses to withdraw they will still receive medical care consistent with the standard of care.  The investigator 
may at their discretion withdraw a patient from participation. Examples include if the procedure necessitates 
conversion from laparoscopic to open technique, lack of adherence to visit schedule, adverse events, or safety 
concerns. For all withdrawals the date, point in the study, and reason for withdrawal will be recorded.  
18.STUDY SUSPENSION/TERMINATION
If for any reason the principle investigator chooses to suspend or terminate the study, the IRB shall be 
informed of the decision and the basis of the decision.  
19.STUDY MATERIALS
The Investigator is responsible for assuring that routine medical supplies, equipment, personnel, and facilities 
are available to successfully implement this study plan in a timely and efficient manner.  Provisions should be 
made for research and medical staff to sufficiently accomplish:

20. PROVISION AND INVENTORY OF STUDY DEVICES
The device and required materials will be provided to the Investigator by Alesi Surgical Ltd.
21.DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT
The investigator and study team members as delegated are responsible for collecting the data from the study. 
Copies of all imaging documentation files will be collected and retained by the study team.
Case Report Forms (CRF) specifically created for this study will be used to collect all data. Case Report 
Forms shall reflect the contents of this study plan.  The CRF and any amendment to it shall bear a version 
number and each page shall be identifiable by the number and identification of the subject whose data the 
CRF pertains. If/when it is necessary to amend the CRFs, the investigator shall review the IP to determine if 
an amendment to this IP is necessary.
Manually entered information on any paper study documents must be legibly written in black ink only.  If 
changes are required, a single line must be drawn through the incorrect information, the correct information 
written in, and the changes initialed and dated.  The reason for the correction should be noted, unless obvious.  
Use of white-out, obscuring incorrect data (scribbling-out), and additional comments written on the 
documents is prohibited. 
The investigator must review sign and date each CRF or document review on a CRF review log; these 
responsibilities cannot be delegated to another person.  The investigator is responsible for the accuracy and 
completeness of all study data.
All original imaging, laboratory, and procedural reports, etc., are considered source documents and will also 
be retained at the investigational site. 
For analysis data may be extracted from case report forms and entered into spreadsheets or local 
computerized systems.
Study subjects will be identified by unique study identification numbers.  The identification number is the 3-
digit study number and the patients three initials.  A master key will contain the study identification number 
Confidential Page 24 of 29

Approval Date: November 5, 2019
and patient identifier (as defined by the Study number, the patient ID number and the patient’s initials). The 
master key will be stored in the study binder and kept in a secure, locked location in the Principal 
Investigator’s office.
Study binders containing study data will be collected and stored in a secure, locked location in the Principal 
Investigator’s office. Access to the records will be limited to the Lead Study Coordinator and the Principal 
Investigator only.
Study data will not be removed from the site listed above at any time during the course of this study.  Data 
extracted into spreadsheets or computer files may be shared outside of the facility for data analysis purposes.  
Such data extractions will be transmitted to the Biostatistician by the Mercy Secure File Transfer System for 
data analysis.  All shared data will be de-identified.
22.IMAGING DIAGNOSTICS
All imaging performed for patients is considered consistent with standard of care.
23.DATA ANALYSIS PLAN  
23.1. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION
The sample size selected (15) per group is considered to be a number to allow for a meaningful 
comparison between the study arms conducted by a single investigator.  As a post-market study intended 
to evaluate user satisfaction and relative impact the Ultravision™ System has on the procedure as 
opposed to demonstrating safety and efficacy, the sample size is considered to be sufficient for that 
purpose.  This essential information is identified in the primary and secondary endpoints.     
23.2.DATA ANALYSIS
Data collected will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  For study success results must 
demonstrate a clinical benefit for the randomized Ultravision group compared to the no Ultravision group 
based upon the primary endpoint analysis.  Additional exploratory analysis may be conducted during data 
analysis.  Because the study is not statistically powered, analysis for primary and secondary endpoints 
will be conducted using comparative statistics with the caveat understood regarding the relatively small 
sample sizes for each group.  
24.TRAINING PROCEDURES
Specific training of trial personnel is the responsibility of the Investigator.  Training will occur before the first 
device use.  To ensure compliance with the study plan and regulatory requirements as well as accurate data

29.RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
As a surgical accessory device, the Ultravision™ System does not administer any medical treatment.  The 
risks associated with its use are consistent with other surgical accessories used in laparoscopic surgery.  The 
device has been tested for sterility, biocompatibility, and electrical safety demonstrating that such risks have 
been mitigated to acceptable levels. The benefits that are being evaluated in this study are improved 
visualization, lower pressure of pneumoperitoneum, and CO 2 consumption have the potential to favorably 
impact patient outcomes.

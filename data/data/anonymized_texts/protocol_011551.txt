Study Description:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (HAM -D total score ≥22). Randomization  will be stratified based on use of antidepressant 
treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) at basel ine and carried out  within 
each stratum in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching 
placebo ; subjects will be treated  for 14  days beginning on Day 1.  
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14 -day Treat ment Period, and a 
4-week Follow -up Period.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities.  The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made accor ding to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID -5-
CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary 
screening procedur es at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the 
HAM -D and CGI-S.  
Antidepressants are permitted provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy

 6  or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day  42 
assessments.  
Eligible subjects wil l be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects  will self-
administer a sing le dose of study drug once daily at bedtime with food, on an outpatient basis , 
for 14 days . Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods 
as outlined in  Table  1. 
Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be discontinued from study drug and will receive 
treatment as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the 
site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is 
discontinued. Follow -up visits should take place every 7 days after the last dose of treatment for 
a total of 4 follow -up visits. If at any time afte r the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the 
study, the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can 
be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day 
during a cl inic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed  to obtain 399 evaluable subjects .

mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulo se (SMCC) , colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium 
stearyl fumarate as excipients. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component of the 
SMCC or a standalone excipient in the formulation. SAGE -217 capsules will be orally 
administered as a 30 -mg or 20 -mg dose.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing only the 
excipients listed above for the active capsule.  
Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods:  
A detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study  will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock  
and treatment unblinding. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock 
will be described in detail in the Clinical Study Report.

 9  General  Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measure ment prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Randomized Set, defined as all subjects who are randomized, will be used for all data 
listings, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide 
descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post -baseline HAM D 
evaluation, will be used for ana lysis of efficacy data.  
 
 
Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subj ects would 
provide 90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points 
in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15, assuming 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Assuming a 11% dropout rat e and a 1:1:1 randomization 
ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total 
randomized subjects will be required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are 
defined as those randomized subjects wh o receive study drug and have valid baseline and at 
least 1 post -baseline HAM -D assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout 
rate is greater than 11%.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline to each assessment in HAM -D total 
score, will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model 
will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, 
and time point -by-treatment as e xplanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated 
as fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the model. The main 
comparison will be between SAGE -217 and placebo at the 15 -day time point. Model -based 
point estimates (i e, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be 
reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the 
within -subject errors. The Toeplitz or compound symmetry covariance structure will be use d if 
there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time po ints in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, sleep endpoints (eg , sleep latency  (SL), total 
sleep time ( TST), wake after sleep onset  (WASO), ISI score and selected individual items and/or 
subscale scores.  
Generalized est imating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for 
treatment, baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 10  treatment as explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between 
SAGE -217 and matching placebo at the 15 -day time point. Model -based point estimates (ie, 
odds ratios), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI -I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/ser ious 
adverse events, concomitant medication usage, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C -SSRS.

 21  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease 
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/ ). Globall y, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people.  
In the U nited States, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs 
and suicide -related costs, was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015 ). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second 
leading cause of death in 15 - to 29 -year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 t o 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017 ). 
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM -5), depression 
refers to an overarching set of diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD).  
Diagnostic criteria for MDD includes  a set of at least 5 depressive symptoms out of 9, including 
depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other  changes  affecting appetite or 
weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability and 
suicidality during the same 2 -week period , that represents a change from previous functioning  
(DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mains tay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds that affect monoaminergic 
neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the major classes of 
antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated 
their limited efficacy , including low remission rates and untreated symptoms (Trivedi 2006 ; 
Conradi 2011 ; Romera 2013 ). 
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Gerner 1981 ; Honig 1988 ; Drugan 1989 ; 
Luscher  2011 ; Mann 2014 ) implicates deficits in γ-aminobutyric acid  (GABA )-ergic  
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including MDD. Furthermore, 
experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of endogenous neuroactive 
steroids in depressive disorders ( Maguire 2008; Maguire 2009 ). Depress ed patients show low 
levels of GABA in the brain and of neurosteroids in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and plasma, 
and antidepressant therapy restores GABA levels in relevant animal models and neurosteroid 
concentrations in depressed patients ( Luscher  2011 ; Schüle 2014 ). 
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 
rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetrat ion and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE -217 was highly selective 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 22  for GABA A recep tors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011 ), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo.  
Data from a n open -label  Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administered to subjects with moderate to 
severe MDD  showed clinically significant improvements from baseline in depression and 
anxiety scale scores ( Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D], Montgomery -Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Hamilton Anxiety Rating S cale [HAM -A], and Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement [CGI -I]) as early as Day 2 of the 14 -day treatment period, 
with durable responses following the end of treatment. This result was further supported by the 
randomized , double -blind portion of this s tudy including 89 subjects, in which  a rapid and 
substantial decrease in HAM -D scores was observed at  Day 15 (primary endpoint) , starting at 
Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other efficacy scales, including MADRS, 
CGI-I, and HAM -A. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
adverse events ( AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among the over 260 
subjects exposed to SAGE -217 in clinical trials, there have been no deaths and only o ne subject 
with essential tremor experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. No other SAEs have been rep orted in any study of SAGE -217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Nonserious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with SAGE -217. Given  the outcome  of the Phase  2a study  of SAGE -217 in subjects  with 
MDD , the current  significant  unmet  need  in the treatment  of depression,  and a favorable  benefit -
risk profile , further  investigation  of SAGE -217 in patients  with MDD  is justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
There will be 2 dose levels of SAGE -217 in this study  in order to study dose ranging : 30 mg per 
day and 20 mg per day. The high er dose level of 30 mg per day is the maximum tolerated dose in 
the multiple ascending dose study o f SAGE -217 in healthy subjects and is also the dose level that 
was effective and generally well tolerated in a Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD (217-MDD -
201). The low er dose of 20 mg per day will be studied in subjects with MDD for the first time in 
the current study  and is anticipated to be well tolerated as it is lower than the maximum tolerated 
dose level . Due to sedation/somnolence observed in previous clinical trials when administered in 
the morning, and improved tolerability when given in the evenin g, both doses of SAGE -217 will 
be administered at bedtime in this study.

25 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
7.1. Overall Study Design
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (HAM -D total score ≥22). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 
14-day Treatment Period, and a 4 -week Follow -up Period.
The Screeni ng Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities . At the time 
of providing informed consent for the study,  subjects will also be asked to authori ze that their 
unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry ( www.subjectregistry.com ) with the intent of 
identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria due to participati on in another clinical 
study (Section  8.2). 
The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic 
and DSM -5 Clinical Trial Version  (SCI D-5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to 
determine eligibility, including completion of the HAM -D and CGI-S.  
Antidepressants are permitted  provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to  continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on ef ficacy 
or safety endpoints is prohibited between screening and completion of the Day 42 assessments.  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within eac h stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio . Subjects  will self-
administer a single dose of study drug with food once daily  at bedtime on an outpatient basis , for 
14 days . Dose reductions ar e not permitted. Study drug administration will be monitored via a 
clinical monitoring service  (see Section  9.3). 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in  
Table  1. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed  to obtain 399 evaluable subjects (see 
Section  13.8). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1. Randomizatio n will be 
stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 
days) at baseline and perform ed within each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, 
SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo.

 26  7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be 
discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated  (see Section  8.3). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacc eptable risk to 
subjects, or for administrative reasons . In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will 
provide written notification to the Investigator . Investigational sites must promptly notify their 
ethics committee and initiate withdrawal p rocedures for participating subjects .

8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw from the study drug or terminate from the study at any time for any 
reason . The Investigator may withdraw the subject from t he study drug or from the study for any 
of the following reasons:  
• The subject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol  
• The subject experiences an intolerable AE  
• Other medical or safety reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the 
Medical Monitor  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a 
subject withdraw s from study drug or terminates the study for any reason. The reason must be 
recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
If a subject is persistently noncompliant, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor the 
potential discontinuation of the subject. A ny reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere to 
the protocol  must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF , includ ing: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration;  
• non-permitted medications  (see Section  9.2). 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE, regardless of Investigator -determined 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator 
determines the event is no longer clinically significant.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) 
visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up visits 
should take place every 7 days after the last dose of treatment for 28 days. If at any time after the 
EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues 
study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events 
scheduled for the ET  visit will be conducted.

9.3. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be self -administered by subjects once daily at bedtime  with food. 
Sites will dispense study drug to the subjects to take at home with instruction s for use (see 
Section  10.4 and Table  1).  
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform  
used on smartphones to visually confirm medication ingestion. Subjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will 
follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front -facing webcam to visually confirm their 
ingestion of the medication. The application will record the dat e and time of study drug 
administration by dose level , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit  to the site  as outlined in 
Table  1, at which time the Investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the kit 
contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period .  
All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement duri ng study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re -education must document the process in the subject 
source records.  
The Investigator(s) will record a ny reasons for non -compliance in the source documents . 
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized double -blind, placebo -controlled study. Subjects who meet the entrance 
criteria will be randomized in a stratified manner based on use of antidepressant treatment  
(current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days ) at baseline; random ization will be done within 
each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matched 
placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
Randomization will be performed centrally via an intera ctive response technology (IRT) system.  
Randomization schedule s will be generated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or placebo) will be based on the 
randomization schedule. The randomization  schedules will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding.  
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety  of the study subject,  the Investigator  may request 
unblinding  of an individual subject’s tr eatment in the study via the IRT  (see Section  12.6 for 
more details related to unblinding).

 35  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY  
All assessments will be conducte d according to the sc hedule of a ssessments (Table  1). Study 
assessments that involve subject interviews, including the HAM -D and SCID -5-CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purpo ses. All assessments must be conducted by 
raters that have been trained and certified to conduct assessments in this study.  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1.  Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individual subject.  An assessment timeframe of 7 days will be 
used at S creening  and ‘S ince Last Visit’ will be used for  all other  visits . 
The 17 -item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17 -item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the followin g symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), a gitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to  the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each  subscale . 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score . Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM -D total score of  ≤7.  
11.1.2.  Montgomer y-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in subjects with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM -D that 
would be more sensitive to the cha nges brought on by antidepressants and other forms of 
treatment than the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total sc ore will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3.  Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) 
The 14 -item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d ). Each of the 14 items is defined by a ser ies of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 36  present) to 4 (very severe), with a  total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24 , mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30 , moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores . 
11.1.4.  Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are  being used in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert scale to rate the severity of the subject’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. 
Considering total clinical exp erience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the 
time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately 
ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill ( Busner 2007a ).  
The CGI-I employ s a 7-point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the subject ’s 
condition posttreatment . The Investigator will rate the subject ’s total improvement whether or 
not it is due entirely to drug treatment . Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much 
improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 
6=much worse, and 7=very much worse  (Busner 2007b ). The CGI -I is only rated at 
posttreatment assessments . By definition, all CGI -I assessments are evaluated agains t baseline 
conditions . CGI-I response will be defined as having a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or 
“much improved.”  
11.1.5.  Short Form -36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
The Medical Outcomes Study SF -36v2 is a 36 -item measure of health status that has undergone 
validat ion in many different disease states ( Ware 2007 ). The SF -36v2 covers eight health 
dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role 
participation with physical health problems [role -physical], bodily pain, and general hea lth) and 
four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional 
health problems [role -emotional], and mental health). In addition, two summary scores, physical 
component summary and mental component summary, are produced by taking a weighted linear 
combination of the eight individual domains. The SF -36v2 is available with two recall periods: 
the standard recall period is 4 weeks and the acute recall period is 1 week. This study will use the 
acute version, which as ks patients to respond to questions as they pertain to the past week. 
Higher SF -36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  
11.1.6.  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomn ia (Morin 2011 ). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0  = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = moderately  satisfied, 3 = 
dissatisfied, 4 = very dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily 
functioning (0 = not at all, 1  = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 
0 to 7 = “no clinically significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = 
“clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”

The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collect s subjective sleep parameters, including sleep onset 
latency , total sleep time , and wake after sleep onset , number of awakenings , and sleep quality . 
The take -home subject  sleep diary assessment will be administered using an eDiary solution. The 
eDiary will be captured using either a provisioned smartphone de vice or bring -your-own-device

 39  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
12.1.1.  Demographic /Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status , highest education 
level , marital/civil status ) and a full medical history , including family psychiatric history,  will be 
documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be  determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, t he 
disease code  associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  (ICD -10) should  be recorded . 
The Massach usetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH  ATRQ) will be  used to determine whether the subject has a history of treatment -resistant 
depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment with adequate dose s of 
antidepressants from two different classes for an adequate amount of time (ie, at least 4 weeks of 
treatment) . 
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented.  
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing b ody systems (eg, head, eye s, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual 
is to p erform all physical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief , symptom -driven  
physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as 
AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1 . 
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart 
rate measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure  are to be collected in supine position after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes and then after 1 minute in the standing position. 
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital 
signs will be document ed. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, vital 
signs will be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in  vital signs will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalit ies that are judged to be 
clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1 .

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis , 
and coagulation . The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred 
electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or subinvestigator indicating 
that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical 
significance. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and  complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpret ed by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or 
worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, 
assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1 . A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a 
satisfactory explanation has be en obtained.  
A serum f ollicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a 
female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol -defined criteria 
for be ing post -menopausal (Section  8.1).

for alcohol  will be performed.  
12.1.6.2.  Pregnancy Screen  
For female subjects that are not surgically sterile and do not meet the protocol -defined criteria 
for being post -menopausal , a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other scheduled timepoints  thereafter , including the ET 
visit for s ubjects who prematurely discontinue.  
12.1.7.  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011 ). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post -baseline evaluation that focus es on suicidality since the last 
study visit . The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being 
the most severe) .  
The “Ba seline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months) . The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table  1. 
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical  product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicin al (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product . In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment  has been administered.  
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and c hanges from baseline in vital signs , ECGs , and physical 
examinations  are considered AEs if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study 
treatment , require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) 
and/or i f the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Laboratory values and vital 
signs that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported in an expedited manner.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations  that are 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  clearly attributable to another  AE do not require discrete reporting (eg , electrolyte disturbances 
in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis) . 
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the study , 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to  Sage Therapeutics.  
12.2.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dos e: 
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may  also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requirin g intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF  and throughout the duration of the 
study , whether or not  they are related to the study, must be recorded on  the SAE  form provided 
by Sage Therapeutics . Serious adverse event s occurring after a subject’s final visit (including the 
last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee only if the Investiga tor considers the 
SAE to be related to study treatment.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The preschedul ed or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled 
(or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate 
in the study  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of 
the procedure or treatment.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator  must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse 
event ( not related, possibly related or probably related) . The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the ev ent may have been 
caused by the investigational product . If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then 
the adverse event should be classified as “ not related.”  If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible ca use-and-effect relationship between the investigational 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 44  product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at 
least “possibly related.”   
Table  4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible  temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be  reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study pers onnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible . For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study  drug or withdraw early from the 
study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)  
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serio us and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under  Section  12.2.1.2 . An AE of severe intensit y 
may not be considered serious.  
Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the Sage Therapeutic s pregnancy 
notification form . Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an 
investigational product may h ave interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented on the Sage Therapeutics 
pregnanc y outcome form, even if the subject  was discontinued from the study . All reports of 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 45  congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs . Spontaneous miscarriages should also be 
reported and handled as SAEs .  
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage , or designee,  immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage , or designee, within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event by the 
investigator and/or his staff . The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE form , verify 
the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source 
documents, and send a copy to Sage , or designee .  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics , or designee,  within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the case report form 
(CRF ) and/or study file.  
Any SAEs discovered by the Investigator  after the designated follow up time for the study, 
should be promptly reported to Sage , or designee,  according to the timelines noted above .  
Sage , or designee,  is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study . Ethics Committee  
(EC) /Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by 
local law . In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or 
designee, will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regula tory reporting. The Sponsor, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law. The Sponsor, or designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a 
blinded fashion.  
12.6. Emergency Identification of St udy Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject is 
at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at 
immediate risk, the Investigator must make dil igent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding 
the study treatment administered to a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the 
treatment administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs 
without Sage’s know ledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later 
than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be 
clearly documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any requ est for 
the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by the 
appropriate Sage personnel, according to standard operating procedures.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent in formation 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the 
eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from the study.

 46  13. STATISTICS  
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study . The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock . Any 
deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized set, defined as all subjects who are randomized, will be used for all data 
listings, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide 
descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post -baseline HAM -D 
evaluation, will be used for analysis of efficacy data.  
 
  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All subjects will be used in the analyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non -missing data available . No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data . A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group have missing data.  
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy  analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, mini mum, and maximum . In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively . For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages .  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data ( Section  12.1.1 ) and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and body 
mass index (BMI), will be summarized using the Safe ty Set.  
Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not 
summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical/family history will be listed by subject.  

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 47  13.5. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline to each assessment in HAM -D total 
score, will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model 
will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, ass essment time point, 
and time point -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the model. The main comparison 
will be between SAGE -217 and placebo at t he 15 -day time point. Model -based point estimates 
(ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be reported where 
applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. 
The Toeplitz o r compound symmetry covariance structure will be used if there is a convergence 
issue with the unstructured covariance model.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from basel ine in other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, sleep endpoints (eg , sleep latency ( SL), total 
sleep time ( TST), wake after sleep onset ( WASO), ISI score and selected individual items and/or 
subscale scor es.  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between SAGE -217 and 
matching placebo at the 15 -day time point. Model -based poi nt estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p -values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI -I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, a nd time point -by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/serious 
adverse events, concomitant medication usage, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C -SSRS. Safety data will be listed by subject 
and summarized by treatment group. All safety summaries will be per formed on the Safety Set.  
Where applicable, ranges of potentially clinical significant (PCS) values are provided in the 
SAP. 
13.6.1.  Adverse Events

Result s of clinical laboratory para meters  in each scheduled visit and m ean changes from baseline 
will be  summarized. in standard units . Normal range of each parame ter is provided by the 
laboratory; shift from baseline to post -baseline values in abnormality of results will be provided.  
Potentially clinically significant  values will be summarized by treatment.  Any abnormal values  
deemed clinically significant by the i nvestigator will be reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). 
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by subject and timing of collection.  
13.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a p hysical examination (Y/N) and the date performed  will be listed by  subject . 
Any clinically significant observation in physical examination will be reported as an AE  (see 
Section  12.2). 
13.6.4.  Vital Signs  
Results from each  visit and m ean changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by 
scheduled visit . Any abnormality deemed clinically significant by the investigat or will be 
reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). Potentially clinically significant  values will be summarized 
by treatment.  Vital sign results will be listed by subject and timing of collection . 
13.6.5.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each of the triplicate ECGs for each subject : 
heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ; the derived mean of each parameter will also be listed . Any 
clinically significant abnormalities or changes in mean ECGs should  be reported  as an AE (see 
Section  12.2). Mean ECG  data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinicall y significant  
values of QTcF will be summa rized by treatment.  Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by 
subject and visit .  
13.6.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through the duration of the study 
will be recorded . In addition, all psychotropic medications taken 6 months  prior to Screening  will 
be recorded . Those medications  taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be 
denoted “Prior” . Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or aft er the 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -301 v1.0   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 49  initiation of the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are 
ongoing or with a stop date on or after the fir st dose of study drug) .  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above . If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomit ant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7.  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment Period 
will be summa rized by treatment . Listings will include all data , including behavior type and/or 
category for Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior of the C -SSRS .  
  
 
 
 
 
13.8. Determinati on of Sample Size  
Assuming a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would provide 
90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the 
primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15, assuming SD of 10 
points. Assuming a n 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum 
(antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be 
required to obtain 399 evaluab le subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized 
subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at least 1 post -baseline HAM -D 
assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 11% .

Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutic s (or designee) will v isit the investigational study site per Sage S tandard Operating 
Procedure s to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the respon sibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clini cal Trial Agreeme nt between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from  Sage Therapeutics  or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the inv estigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product 
accountability checks are being per formed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the subject ’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study . This will require direct access to all origina l records for each 
subject  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to  Sage Therapeutics . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and  confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB.  
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeut ics, a regulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, 
including source data verification . The purpose of a  Sage Therapeutics  audit or inspection is to

Study Description:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (HAM -D total score ≥22). Randomization will be stratified based on use of antidepressant 
treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) at basel ine and carried out within 
each stratum in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching 
placebo; subjects will be treated  for 14  days beginning on Day 1.  
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14- day Treatment Period, and a 
4-week Follow-up Period.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities. The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID -5-
CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the 
HAM -D and CGI -S.  
Antidepressants are permitted provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy

 6  or safety endpoints will not be allowed betwe en screening and completion of the Day  42 
assessments.  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects  will self-
administer a sing le dose of study drug once daily in the evening with food, on an outpatient 
basis, for 14 days. Subjects will return to the study center during the treatme nt and follow -up 
periods as outlined in Table  1. 
Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the 
site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is 
discontinued. Follow- up visits should take place every 7 days after the last dose of treatment for 
a total of 4 follow -up visits. If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the 
study, the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed  to obtain 399 evaluable subjects.

mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose  (SMCC) , colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium 
stearyl fumarate as excipients. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component of the 
SMCC or a standalone excipient in the formulation. SAGE -217 capsules will be orall y 
administered as a 30 -mg or 20-mg dose. 
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing only the 
excipients listed above for the active capsule.

 9  Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods:  
A detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study  will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock 
and treatment unblinding. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock 
will be described in detail in the C linical Study Report. 
General  Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets 
The Randomized S et, defined as all subjects who are randomized, will be used for all data 
listings, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide 
descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post -baseline HAM D 
evaluation, will be used for analysis of efficacy data.  
 
 
Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would 
provide 90% power to detect a placebo-adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM- D total score at Day 15, assuming 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Assuming a 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization 
ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total 
randomized subjects will be required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are 
defined as those randomiz ed subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at 
least 1 post -baseline HAM-D assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout 
rate is greater than 11%.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline to each assessment in HAM- D total 
score, will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model 
will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, 
and time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated 
as fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the model. The main 
comparison will be between SAGE-217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. Model- based 
point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p -values) will be 
reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the 
within -subject errors. The Toeplitz or compound symmetry covariance structure will be used if 
there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in  other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 10  total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, sleep endpoints (eg , sleep latency  (SL), total 
sleep time ( TST), wake after sleep onset  (WASO), ISI score and selected individual items and/or 
subscale scores.  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM- D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score) and HAM- D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for 
treatm ent, baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point- by-
treatment as explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between 
SAGE -217 and matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model- based point est imates (ie, 
odds ratios), 95% confidence intervals, and p- values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point- by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/serious 
adverse events, concomitant medication usage, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C- SSRS.

 20  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease 
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globall y, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United S tates, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs 
and suicide-related costs, was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second 
leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder (26% to 54%, respectively; O lfson 2017).  
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM -5), depres sion 
refers to an overarching set of diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Diagnostic criteria for MDD includes  a set of at least 5 depressive symptoms out of 9, including 
depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability and suicidality during the same 2- week period , that represents a change from previous functioning 
(DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds that affect monoaminer gic 
neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the major classes of 
antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated 
their limited efficacy , including low remission rates and untreated symptoms ( Trivedi 2006; 
Conradi 2011; Romera 2013). 
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Gerner 1981; Honig 1988; Drugan 1989; 
Luscher  2011; Mann 2014) implicates deficits in γ-aminobutyri c acid (GABA)-ergic 
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including MDD. Furthermore, 
experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of endogenous neuroactive 
steroids in depressive disorders ( Maguire 2008; Maguire 2009). Depressed patients show low 
levels of GABA in the brain and of neuros teroids in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and plasma, 
and antidepressant therapy restores GABA levels in relevant animal models and neurosteroid 
concentrations in depressed patients ( Luscher  2011; Schüle 2014).  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synth etic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 
rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE- 217 was highly selective 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 21  for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo. 
Data from  an open- label  Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administered to subjects with moderate to 
severe MDD  showed clinically significant improvements from baseline in depression and 
anxiety scale scores ( Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D], Montgomery- Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM -A], and Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as early as Day 2 of the 14 -day treatment period, 
with durable responses following the end of treatment. This result was further supported by  the 
randomized, double-blind portion of this study including 89 subjects, in which a rapid and 
substantial decrease in HAM -D scores was observed at  Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at 
Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other efficacy scales, including MADRS, 
CGI-I, and HAM- A. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
adverse events ( AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among the over 260 
subjects exposed to SAGE-217 in clinical trials, there have been no deaths and only one subject 
with essential tremor experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Nonserious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with  SAGE -217. Given  the outcome of the Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 in  subjects  with  
MDD, the current  significant  unmet need  in the treatment  of depression, and  a favorable benefit -
risk profile , further investigation  of SAGE -217 in  patients  with  MDD is  justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
There will be 2 dose levels of SAGE -217 in this study in order to study dose ranging : 30 mg per 
day and 20 mg per day. The high er dose level of 30 mg per day is the maximum tolerated dose in 
the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects and is also the dose level that 
was effective and generally well tolerated in a Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD (217- MDD -
201). The low er dose of 20 mg per day will be studied in subjects with MDD for the first time in 
the current study and  is anticipated to be well tolerated as it is lower than the maximum tolerated 
dose level . Due to sedation/somnolence observed in previous cli nical trials when administered in 
the morning, and improved tolerability when given in the evening, both doses of SAGE -217 will 
be administered in the evening in this study.

 24  7. INVE STIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (HAM -D total score ≥22). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 
14-day Treatment Period, and a 4- week Follow -up Period.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities . At the time 
of providing i nformed consent for the study, subjects will also be asked to authorize that their 
unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry ( www.subjectregistry.com ) with the intent of 
identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria due to participation in another clinical 
study (Section  8.2).  
The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and DSM-5 Clinical Trial Version  (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the HAM -D and  CGI -S.  
Antidepressants are permitted  provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to  continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy or safety endpoints is prohibited between screening and completion of the Day 42 assessments. 
 
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects  will self-
administer a single dose of study drug with food once daily  in the evening on an outpatient basis, 
for 14 days. Dose reductions are not permitted. Study drug administration will be monitored via 
a clinical monitoring service  (see Section  9.3). 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in Table 1. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects (see Section  13.8). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1. Randomization will be 
stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stab le or not treated/withdrawn 
≥60 days) at baseline and perform ed within each stratum in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive SAGE -217 
20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching pla cebo.

 25  7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be 
discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated  (see Section  8.3). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to subjects, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will 
provide written notification to the Investigator. Investigational sites must promptly  notify their 
ethics committee and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating subjects .

reason . The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study drug or from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
• The su bject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol 
• The subject experiences an intolerable AE  
• Other medical or safety reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the 
Medical Monitor 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a 
subject withdraws from study drug or terminates the study for any reason. The reason must be 
recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
If a subject is persistently noncompliant, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor the potential discontinuation of the subject. A ny reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere to 
the protocol must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF , including: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration; 
• non-permitted medications  (see Section  9.2). 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE, regardless of Investigator- determined 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator 
determines the event is no longer clinically significant.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 29  Subjects who discontinue study drug early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) 
visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow-up visits 
should take place every 7 days after the last dose of treatment for 28 days. If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the su bject should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for the ET  visit w ill be conducted.  
A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up after attempts at contacting  the subject have been 
unsuccessful. 
8.3.1. Replacement of Subjects

 31  9.2.3. Other Restrictions  
The consumption of grapefruit juice, grapefruit, or Seville oranges, or products containing these 
is prohibited throughout the treatment period. 
Consumption of alcohol or use of drugs of abuse is discouraged throughout the duration of the 
study. 
Female subjects who are lactating or actively breastfeeding must stop giving breast milk to the baby(ies) starting on Day 1 until 7 days after the last dose of study drug. 
9.3. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be self -administered by subjects once daily in the evening with food. 
Sites will dispense study drug to the subjects to take at home with instructions for use (see Section  10.4 and Table 1 ).  
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform 
used on smartphones to visually confirm medication ingestion. Subjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will 
follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front- facing webcam to vis ually confirm their 
ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time of study drug administration by dose level , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to the site  as outlined in 
Table 1, at which time the Investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period.  
All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the subject 
source records.  
The Investigator(s) will record any reasons for non- compliance in the source documents. 
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized double-blind, placebo- controlled study. Subjects who meet the entrance 
criteria will be randomized in a stratified manner based on use of antidepressant treatment  
(current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days ) at baseline; randomization will be done within 
each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matched 
placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization will be perfor med centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system.  
Randomization schedules will be generated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE-217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or placebo) will be based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. 
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety  of the study subject,  the Investigator  may request 
unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment in the study via the IRT  (see Section  12.6 for 
more details related to unblinding).

217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 33  Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening Visit to obtain a subject identification (ID) number 
for each subject. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary subject-
identifying information, including the subject ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the 
eligible subject into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be 
dispensed to that subject. The medication ID number and the number of capsules dispensed must 
be recorded.  
At the subsequent study drug-dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same subject ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID 
number for the study drug to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number 
of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the subject at this visit must be recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the Sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. After the study is completed, all unused study drug  must be returned as directed or destroyed on site per the Sponsor’s 
instructions. The Investigator or designee must keep a record of all study drug received, dispensed and discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountabi lity and reconciliation.

 34  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
All assessments will be conducte d according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). Study 
assessments that involve subject interviews, including the HAM- D and SCID -5-CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purposes.  All assessments must be conducted by 
raters that have been trained and certified to conduct assessments in this study. 
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individual subject. An assessment timeframe of 7 days will be 
used at Screening  and ‘S ince Last Visit’ wi ll be used for all other  visits . 
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013a; Williams 2013 b). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score . Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM- D total score of  ≤7.  
11.1.2. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in subjects with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of 
treatment than the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 200 8). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM- A) 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM- A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 35  present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. 
11.1.4. Clinical Global Impressio n (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are being us ed in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert scale to rate the severity of the subject’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill ( Busner 2007a ).  
The CGI-I employs a 7 -point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the subject ’s 
condition posttreatment. The Investigator will rate the subject ’s total improvement whether or 
not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse ( Busner 2007b). The CGI -I is only rated at 
posttreatment assessments . By definition, all CGI -I assessments are evaluated against baseline 
conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having a CGI-I score of “very much improved” or 
“much improved.”  
11.1.5. Short Form-36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
The Medical Outcomes Study SF -36v2 is a 36- item measure of health status that has undergone 
validation in many different disease states ( Ware 2007). The SF-36v2 covers eight health 
dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role 
participation with physical health problems [role -physical], bodily pain, and general health) and 
four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional 
health problems [role-emotional], and mental health). In addition, two summary scores, physical 
component summary and mental component summary, are produced by taking a weighted linear 
combination of the eight individual domains. The SF-36v2 is available with two recall periods: the standard recall period is 4 weeks and the acute recall period is 1 week. This st udy will use the 
acute version, which asks patients to respond to questions as they pertain to the past week. Higher SF -36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  
11.1.6. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral , 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinica lly 
significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”

 36  11.1.7. Core Consensus Sleep Diary  
The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collect s subjective sleep parameters, i ncluding sleep onset 
latency , total sleep time , and wake after sleep onset , number of awakenings, and sleep quality. 
The take-home subject  sleep diary assessment will be administered using an eDiary solution. The 
eDiary will be captured using either a prov isioned smartphone device or bring- your-own-device 
(BYOD ) solution, depending on the subject’s  preference.

 38  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule of assessments ( Table 1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics ( age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status , highest education 
level , marital/civil status) and a full medical history, including family psychiatric history,  will be 
documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available,  the 
disease code associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  (ICD -10) should be recorded . 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH  ATRQ) will be  used to determine whether the subject has treatment-resistant depression, 
defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive 
episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from two different classes for at least 4 weeks of treatment . 
12.1.2. Weight and Height 
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examinations assess ing body systems (eg, head, eyes , ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual 
is to perform all physical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief, symptom- driven  
physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Heart rat e and blood pressure are to be collected in supine position after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes and then after 1 minute in the standing position. 
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital signs will be documented. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, vital 
signs will be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in  vital signs will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis , 
and coagulation. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or subinvestigator indicating that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical 
significance. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, 
assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a 
satisfactory explanation has been obtained. 
A serum f ollicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a 
female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol- defined criteria 
for be ing post- menopausal (Section  8.1).

12.1.6.1. Drugs of Abus e and  Alcohol 
Urine toxicology tests  will be performed  for selected drugs of abuse (see Table  3). A breath test 
for alcohol will be performed. 
12.1.6.2. Pregnancy Screen  
For female subjects that ar e not surgically sterile and do not meet the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other scheduled timepoints  thereafter , including the ET 
visit for s ubjects who prematurely discontinue. 
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime exper ience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table 1. 
12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
adminis
tered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laborat
ory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicina
l (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 42  A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigatio nal product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs , and physical 
examinations  are considered AEs if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study 
treatment , require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) 
and/or if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Laboratory values and vital 
signs that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported in an expedited manner. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations that are 
clearly attributable to another  AE do not require discrete reporting (eg, electrolyte disturbances 
in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis). 
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the study, 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeu tics. 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persi stent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur a fter any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE  report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics  within 24 hours of first awareness (Section  12.5) . All SAEs 
should to be followed until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered clinically significant or the subject was lost to f ollow-up. Serious adverse event s occurring after 
a subject’s final visit (including the last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee 
only if the Investigator considers the SAE to be related to study treatment.  
A prescheduled or elective pr ocedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled 
(or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate in the study 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of the 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  Investigator, between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of 
the procedure or treatment.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse event (not related, possibly related or probably related). The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at least “possibly related.”  
Table 4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known respon se pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
12.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the invest igator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the subject  to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 44  It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.1.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The I nvestigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy 
information on any male subject’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject 
is participating  in study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was 
discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (e.g., spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage, or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage, or designee, within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event by the 
investigator and/or his staff. The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form , 
verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding 
source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics , or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the case report form 
(CRF ) and/or study file. 
Any SAEs discovered by the Investigator after the designated follow up time for the study, should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee, according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact information for reporting SAEs and/or pregnancies is located in the study reference 
manual.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. Ethics Committee  
(EC)/I nstitutional Review Boards (IRBs) will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by 
local law . In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or 
designee, will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. The Sponsor, or 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 45  designee, will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law. The Sponsor, or designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a 
blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject is 
at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at 
immediate risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study treatment administered to a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the 
treatment administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs 
without Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be 
clearly documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for 
the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by the appropriate Sage personnel, according to standard operating procedures.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be permanently discontinued from the study.

 46  13. STATISTICS  
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any 
deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized set, defined as all subjects who are randomized, will be used for all data 
listings, unless otherwise specified.  
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post- baseline HAM -D 
evaluation, will be used for analysis of efficacy data.  
 
  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All subjects will be used in the analyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available . No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data . A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group have missing data.  
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy  analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demograp hics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data (Section  12.1.1) and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and body 
mass index (BMI),  will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical/family history will be listed by subje ct.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 47  13.5. Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline to each assessment in HAM- D total 
score, will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, assessment time point, 
and time point- by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the model. The main comparison 
will be between SAGE -217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. Model- based point estimates 
(ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p- values) will be reported where 
applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within- subject erro rs. 
The Toeplitz or compound symmetry covariance structure will be used if there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM- D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, sleep endpoints (eg, sleep latency ( SL), total 
sleep time ( TST), wake after sleep onset ( WASO), ISI score and selected individual items and/or 
subscale scores.   
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM- D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM-D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models wil l include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by- treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between SAGE -217 and 
matching placebo at the 15- day time po int. Model-based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p- values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response including terms for treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point- by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of advers e events/serious 
adverse events, concomitant medication usage, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C -SSRS. Safety data will be listed by subject 
and summarized by treatment group. All safety s ummaries will be performed on the Safety Set.  
Where applicable, ranges of potentially clinical significant (PCS) values are provided in the 
SAP. 
13.6.1. Adverse Events  
The analysis of adverse events will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence of TEAEs will be summarized overall and by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)

presented in order of decreasing frequency . In addition, summaries will be provided by intensity 
(mild, moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not related) to study drug (see Section  12.3).  
Any TEAEs  leading to discontinuation and SAE s with onset after the start of study drug will also 
be summarized .  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of study drug) 
through the end of the study will be listed).  
13.6.2. Clinical L aboratory Evaluations 
Result s of clinical laboratory para meters  in each scheduled visit and m ean changes from baseline 
will be  summarized. in standard units. N ormal range of each parameter  is provided by the 
laboratory; shift from baseline to post- baseline values in abnormality of results will be provided. 
Potentially clinically significant values will be summarized by treatment.  Any abnormal values 
deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). 
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by subject and timing of collection.  
13.6.3. Physical Examinations 
The occurrence of a p hysical examination (Y/N) and the date performed will be listed by  subject . 
Any clinically significant observation in physical examination will be reported as an AE  (see 
Section  12.2). 
13.6.4. Vital Signs  
Results from each  visit and m ean changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by 
scheduled visit. Any abnormality deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be 
reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). P otentially clinically significant values will be summarized 
by treatment.  Vital sign results will be listed by subject and timing of collection . 
13.6.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each of the triplicate ECGs for each subject : 
heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ; the derived mean of each parameter will also be listed . Any 
clinically significant abnormalities or changes in mean ECGs should be reported  as an AE (see 
Section  12.2). Mean ECG  data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinicall y significant  
values of QTcF will be summarized by treatment.  Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by 
subject and visit.  
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO-DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through the duration of the study 
will be recorded . In addition, all psychotropic medications taken 6 months prior to Screening  will 
be recorded . Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be 
denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 49  initiation of the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are 
ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomit ant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment Period 
will be summa rized by treatment . Listings will include all data , including behavior type and/or 
category for Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior of the C- SSRS.  
  
 
 
 
 
13.8. Determination of Samp le Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would provide 
90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the 
primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM- D total score  at Day 15, assuming SD of 10 
points. Assuming an 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be 
required to obtain 399 evaluable subject s. Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized 
subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at least 1 post- baseline HAM -D 
assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 11%.

 50  14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics (or designee) will visit the investigational study site per Sage S tandard Operating 
Procedure s to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics  or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator( s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that investigational product accountability checks are being performed  
• Perform source data verification . This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
subject  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics . 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on e CRFs and  confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SA Es that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a reg ulatory authority, an Independent Ethics 
Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification . The purpose of a Sage Therapeutics  audit or inspection is to 
systematically and ind ependently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The

Amendment #1, Version 2.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 3 Purpose : Clarify exclusion criteria regarding treatment -resistant depression  
The primary change occurs in Section 8.2. Subject Exclusion Criteria #4 
Changed text: 4. Subject has a history of treatment -resistant depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment 
with adequate doses of antidepressants within the current major depressive episode (excluding antipsychotics) from 
two different classes for an adequate amount of t ime (ie, at least 4 weeks of treatment ). Massachusetts General Hospital

Amendment #1, Version 2.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 4 Purpose : Update language for reporting SAEs to be consistent with current program standards 
The primary change occurs in 12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Changed text: All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the study, whether or not they are 
related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form provided by Sage Therapeutics within 24 hours of first 
awareness (Section 12.5). All SAEs should to be followed until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered clinically significant or the subject was lost to follow -up. Serious adverse events occurring aft er a 
subject’s final visit (including the last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee only if the Investigator 
considers the SAE to be related to study treatment. 
Sections also affected by this change:  
• Not applicable  
Purpose : Update language for reporting pregnancies, including partner pregnancies to be consistent with current program standards 
The primary change occurs in Section 12.4. Recording Adverse Events 
Formerly read:  If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on 
the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. 
The Investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject’ s female partner who 
becomes pregnant while the male subject is participating in study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures sp ecified for pregnant female subjects.  Should a pregnancy occur, it must be reported and recorded on the 
Sage Therapeutics pregnancy notification form. Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion 
that an investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or congenital abnormality) 
must be followed up and documented on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy outcome form, even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor.  All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs. Spontane ous miscarriages 
should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or a complication relating to  the pregnancy occurs (e.g., 
spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth 
defects), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
Protocol 217- MDD-301 Summary of Changes                   Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment #1, Version 2.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 5 Now reads:  If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on the 
Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject’s female partner who becomes 
pregnant while the male subject is participating in study. After obtaining the necess ary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminati on, normal birth or congenital abnormality) 
must be followed up and documented even if the subject was discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any 
reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may have interfered with the 
effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or a complication relating to the pregnancy occurs (e.g., spontaneous 
abortion). If the outcome of the pr egnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum 
complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator 
should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
Sections also affected by this change:  
• Not applicable  
Purpose : Correct an error regarding version of HAM -A scale to be used   
The primary change occurs in footnote ‘o’ in Table 1 ‘Schedule of Events’ 
Changed text: The assessment timeframe for HAM- D and HAM -A scales will refer to the past 7 days (1 week) at Screening and “Since 
Last Visit” for all other visits. The assessment timeframe for HAM -A scale will refer to the past 7 days (1 week) at 
all visits.

 6 Purpose : Prohibit breastfeeding during SAGE-217 treatment 
The primary change occurs in Section 9.2.3. Other Restrictions 
Added text: Female subjects who are lactating or actively breastfeeding must stop giving breast milk to the baby(ies) sta rting 
on Day 1 until 7 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Sections also affected by this change:  
• Synopsis, 8.2. Subject Exclusion Criteria 
Purpose : Correct a response category for the Insomnia Severity Index  
The primary change occurs in Section 11.1.6. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) 
Changed text: The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia (Morin 2011). The ISI 
uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of insomnia severity (0 =  none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 
4 = very severe), satisfaction with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = moderately satisfied neutral , 
3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomni a on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 1 
= a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinically significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 
= subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”

Study Description:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (MADRS  total score ≥30). Randomization will be strat ified based on use of 
antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) at baseline and 
carried out within each stratum in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SAGE-217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, 
or matching placebo ; subjects will be treated  for 14 days beginning on Day 1.  
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14- day Treatment Period, and a 
4-week Follow-up Period.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit; t he ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities. The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM- 5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID -5-
CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the 
MADRS  and CGI -S.

 6  Antidepressants are permitted provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy 
or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day 42 
assessments.  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects  will self-
administer a sing le dose of study drug once daily in the evening with food, on an outpatient 
basis, for 14 days. Practical options include taki ng SAGE -217 within 1 hour of dinner or taking 
SAGE -217 later in the evening with solid food. Subjects will return to the study center during 
the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in Table  1. 
Subjects who c annot tolerate study drug will be discontinued from study drug and will receive 
treatment as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the 
site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is 
discontinued. Follow- up visits should take place every 7 days after the last dose of treatment for 
a total of 4 follow -up visits. If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the 
study, the subject should return f or an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can 
be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day 
during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
Num ber of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects.

Study Drug,  Dosage and M ode of Administration:  
SAGE -217 is available as hard gelatin capsules containing a white to off -white powder. In 
additi on to SAGE -217 Drug Substance, the SAGE-217 capsules contain croscarmellose sodium, 
mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose  (SMCC) , colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium 
stearyl fumarate as excipients. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component of the 
SMCC or a standalone excipient in the formulation. SAGE -217 capsules will be orally 
administered as a 30 -mg or 20-mg dose. 
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing only the 
excipients listed above for the active capsule.  
Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods:  
A detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study  will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock 
and treatment unblinding. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock 
will be described in detail in the C linical Study Report. 
General  Considerations  
For the purpose of a ll safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets 
The Randomized S et, defined as all subje cts who are randomized, will be used for all data 
listings, unless otherwise specified. 
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide 
descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post -baseline HAM D 
evaluation, will be used for analysis of efficacy data.  
 
 
Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would 
provide 90% power to detect a placebo-adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points 
in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM- D total sc ore at Day 15, assuming 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Assuming a 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be required to obtai n 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are 
defined as those randomized subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL 
 
 10  least 1 post-baseline HAM-D ass essment. Additional subjects may  be randomized if the dropout 
rate is greater than 11%. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint The estimand for the primary e fficacy analysis is the mean chan ge from baseline in HAM-D 
total score at Day 15. This will be analyzed using a mixed effe cts model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM-D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, and time point-by-treatment as explanato ry variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fi xed effects. All post-baseline t ime points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison will be between SAGE-217 and placebo  at the 15-day time point. 
Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values) will be reported where a pplicable. An unstructured cova riance structure will be used to 
model the within-subject errors. If there is a convergence issu e with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)]  covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If  the model still does not converge 
with AR(1) structure, no results  will be reported. When the cov ariance structure is not UN, the 
sandwich estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL 
option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints Similar to those methods describ ed above for the primary endpoi nt, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM-D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM-A total score , SF-36v2 score, PHQ-9 score, sle ep endpoints (eg, sleep latency 
(SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO)), I SI score and selected individual 
items and/or subscale scores in HAM-D for change from baseline.   
Generalized estimating equati on (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM-D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM-D tota l score) and HAM-D 
remission (defined as HAM-D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for 
treatment, baseline score, stratification factor, assessment ti me point, and time point-by-
treatment as explanatory variabl es. The comparison of interest will be the difference between 
SAGE-217 and matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% confidence inte rvals, and p-values will be re ported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I respon se including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI-S score, stratification factor, assessm ent time point, and time point-by-
treatment as explanatory variables. 
 
 
Safety Analysis 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/serious 
adverse events, concomitant me dication usage, vital signs, clin ical laboratory evaluations, and 
12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C-SSRS. Poten tial withdrawal symptoms 
after discontinuation of SAGE-217 will be assessed using the PW C-20.

a Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit  as soon as possible , 
preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up visits should take place every 7 days after the last dose of 
treatment for a total of 4 follow -up visits. If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject 
should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study 
drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
b Subjects will be asked to authorize that their unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry (www.subjectregistry.com ) 
with the intent of identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria for participation in another clinical study.  
c A serum follicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening for female subjects that are not surgically steri le to 
confirm whether a female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol -defined criteria for being 
post-menopausal.  
d Subjects will be trained on use of software appli cations and devices necessary for the conduct of the study by site personnel.

 21  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of dise ase 
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United S tates, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs 
and suicide- related costs , was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt  has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder (26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
In the Diagnostic and Sta tistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM -5), depression 
refers to an overarching set of diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Diagnostic criteria for MDD includes  a set of at least 5 depressive symptoms out of 9, including 
depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes  affecting appetite or 
weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability and suicidality during the same 2- week period , that represents a change fr om previous functioning 
(DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic 
antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds that affect monoaminergic 
neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the major classes of antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated 
their limited eff icacy , including low remission rates and untreated symptoms ( Trivedi 2006; 
Conradi 2011; Romera 2013). 
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Gerner 1981; Honig 1988; Drugan 1989; 
Luscher  2011;  Mann 2014) implicates deficits in γ-aminobutyric acid  (GABA )-ergic 
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including MDD. Furthermore, 
experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of endogenous neuroactive 
steroids in depressive disorders ( Maguire 2008; Maguire 2009). Depressed patients show low 
levels of GABA in the brain and of neurosteroids in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and plasma, 
and antidepressant therapy restores GABA levels in relevant animal models and neurosteroid 
concentrations in depressed patients ( Luscher  2011; Schüle 2014).  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 
rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE- 217 was highly selective 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 22  for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo. 
Data from an open- label  Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administe red to subjects with moderate to 
severe MDD  showed clinically significant improvements from baseline in depression and 
anxiety scale scores ( Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D], Montgomery- Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Hamilton Anxiety R ating Scale [HAM -A], and Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as early as Day 2 of the 14 -day treatment period, 
with durable responses following the end of treatment. This result was further supported by  the 
randomized, double-blind portion of this study including 89 subjects, in which a rapid and 
substantial decrease in HAM -D scores was observed at  Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at 
Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other efficacy scales, including MADRS, 
CGI-I, and HAM-A. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
adverse events ( AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. Among th e over 260 
subjects exposed to SAGE-217 in clinical trials, there have been no deaths and only one subject 
with essential tremor experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of transient confusion leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
Nonserious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly report ed 
AEs with  SAGE -217. Given  the outcome of the Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 in  subjects  with  
MDD, the current  significant  unmet need  in the treatment  of depression, and  a favorable benefit -
risk profile , further investigation  of SAGE -217 in  patients  with  MDD is  justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
There will be 2 dose levels of SAGE -217 in this study in order to study dose ranging : 30 mg per 
day and 20 mg per day. The high er dose level of 30 mg per day is the maximum tolerated dose in 
the multiple ascending dose stud y of SAGE -217 in healthy subjects and is also the dose level that 
was effective and generally well tolerated in a Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD (217- MDD -
201). The low er dose of 20 mg per day will be studied in subjects with MDD for the first time in 
the current study and  is anticipated to be well tolerated as it is lower than the maximum tolerated 
dose level . Due to sedation/somnolence observed in previous clinical trials when administered in 
the morning, and improved tolerability when given in the evening, both doses of SAGE -217 will 
be administered in the evening in this study.

 25  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (MADRS  total score ≥30). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 
14-day Treatment Period, and a 4- week Follow -up Period.  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening act ivities . At the time 
of providing i nformed consent for the study, subjects will also be asked to authorize that their 
unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry ( www.subjectregistry.com ) with the intent of 
identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria due to participation in another clinical 
study (Section  8.2).  
The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and DSM-5 Clinical Trial Version  (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the MADRS  and CGI -S.  
Antidepressants are permitted  provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to  continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy or safety endpoints is prohibited between screening and completion of the Day 42 assessments. 
 
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1: 1 ratio . Subjects  will self-
administer a single dose of study drug with food once daily  in the evening on an outpatient basis, 
for 14 days. Dose reductions are not permitted. Study drug administration will be monitored via 
a clinical monitoring service  (see Section  9.3). 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in 
Table 1. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects (see Section  13.8). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1. Randomization will be 
stratified based on us e of antidepressant treatment (current/stab le or not treated/withd rawn 
≥60 days) at baseline and perform ed within each stratum in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive SAGE -217 
20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo.

 26  7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be 
discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated  (see Section  8.3). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to subjects, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will 
provide written notification to the Investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify their 
ethics committee and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating subjects .

• The subject experiences an intolerable AE  
• Other medical or safety reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the 
Medical Monitor 
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a subject withdraws from study drug or terminates the study for any reason. The reason must be 
recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 30  If a subject is persistently noncompliant, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor the 
potential discontin uation of the subject. A ny reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere to 
the protocol must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF , including: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration; 
• non-permitted medications  (see Section  9.2). 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE, regardless of Investigator- determined 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator 
determines the event  is no longer clinically significant.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) 
visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow-up visits 
should take place every  7 days after the last dose of treatment for 28 days. If at any time after the 
EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues 
study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events 
scheduled for the ET  visit will be conducted.  
A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up after attempts at contacting  the subject have been 
unsuc cessful . 
8.3.1. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects will not be replaced . Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop- out rate is 
higher than anticipated  (Section  13.8).

Elective surgeries or procedures are prohibited during participation in the study. 
9.3. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be self -administered by subjects once daily in the evening with food. 
Sites will dispense study drug to the subjects to take at home with instructions for use (see 
Section  10.4 and Table 1 ).  
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform 
used on smartphones to visually confirm medication ingestion. Subjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will 
follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front- facing webcam to visually confirm their 
ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time of study drug administration by dose level , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to the site  as outlined in 
Table 1, at which time the Investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period.  
All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the subject 
source records.  
The Investigator(s) will record any reasons for non- compliance in the source documents. 
9.4. Randomization and Blinding  
This is a randomized double-blind, placebo- controlled study. Subjects who meet the entrance 
criteria will be randomized in a stratified manner based on use of antidepressant treatment  
(current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days ) at baseline;  randomization will be done within 
each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matched 
placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization will be performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 33  Randomization schedules will be generated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE-217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or placebo) will be based on the 
randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. 
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety  of the study subject,  the Investigator  may request 
unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment in the study via the IRT  (see Section  12.6 for 
more details related to unblinding).

10.6. Study  Drug Accountability  
Upon receipt of study drug, the Investigator(s), or the responsible pharmacist or designee, will inspect the study drug and complete and follow the instructions regarding receipt in the 
Pharmacy Manual . A copy of the shipping documenta tion will be kept in the study files.  
The designated site staff will dispense the supplied subject- specific kits  to subjects at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table 1.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 35  Site staff will access t he IRT at the Screening Visit to obtain a subject identification (ID) number 
for each subject. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary subject-
identifying information, including the subject ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the eligible subject into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be 
dispensed to that subject. The medication ID number and the number of capsules dispensed must 
be recorded.  
At the subsequent study drug-dispensing visit , the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same subject ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the subject at this visit must be recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the Sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. After the study is completed, all unused study drug  must be returned as directed or destroyed on site per the Sponsor’s 
instructions. The Investigator or designee must keep a record of all study drug received, dispensed and discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation.  
10.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of the study, a ll used and unused study drug will be reconciled  and returned to Sage 
Therapeutics for destruction or destroyed locally; disposition of study drug will be documented. 
A copy of the inventory record and a record of any clinical supplies that have been received, 
dispensed or destroyed must be documented by the site as directed. This documentation must 
include at least the information below:  
• the number of dispensed units; 
• the number of unused units; 
• the number of units destroyed at the end of the st udy; 
• the date, method and location of destruction.

 36  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
All assessments will be conducte d according to the schedule of a ssessments (Table 1). Study 
assessments that involve subject interviews, including the HAM -D and SCID -5-CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purposes. All assessments must be conducted by 
raters that have been trained and certified to conduct assessments in this study. 
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hami lton Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments for a n individual subject. An assessment timeframe of 7 days will be 
used on Day 1 and ‘S ince Last Visit’ will be used for all other  visits . 
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton R ating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score . Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM- D total score of  ≤7.  
11.1.2. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in subjects with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM- A) 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM- A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 37  present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. 
11.1.4. Clinical Global Impression (CGI) 
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are being used in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert scale to rate the severity of the subject’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. 
Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill ( Busner 2007a ).  
The CGI-I employs a 7 -point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the subject ’s 
condition posttreatment. The Investigator will rate the subject ’s total improvement whether or 
not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse ( Busner 2007b). The CGI -I is only rated at 
posttreatment assessments . By definition, all CGI -I assessments are evaluated  against baseline 
conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having a CGI-I score of “very much improved” or 
“much improved.”  
11.1.5. Short Form-36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
The Medical Outcomes Study SF -36v2 is a 36-item measure of health status that has undergone 
validation in many different disease states ( Ware 2007). The SF-36v2 covers eight health 
dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role 
participation with physical health problems [role -physical], bodily pain, and gene ral health) and 
four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional 
health problems [role-emotional], and mental health). In addition, two summary scores, physical 
component summary and mental component summary, are produced by taking a weighted linear 
combination of the eight individual domains. The SF-36v2 is available with two recall periods: the standard recall period is 4 weeks and the acute recall period is 1 week. This study will use the 
acute version, which asks patients to respond to questions as they pertain to the past week. 
Higher SF -36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  
11.1.6. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 
The PHQ -9 is a subject -rated depressive symptom severity scale. To monitor severity over time 
for newly diagnosed subjects or subjects in current treatment for depression, subjects may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter. Scoring is based on responses to specific questions, as follows: 0=not at all; 1=several days; 2=more than half the days; and 3=nearly every day.  
The PHQ -9 total score will be calculated as the sum of the 9 individual item scores. The PHQ -9 
total score will be categorized as follows: 1 to 4=minimal depression, 5 to 9=mild depression, 10 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 38  to 14=moderate depression, 15 to 19=moderately severe depression; and 20 to 27=severe 
depression. 
11.1.7. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI use s a 5-point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral , 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 
1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinically 
significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”  
11.1.8. Core Consensus Sleep Diary  
The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collect s subjective sleep parameters, including sleep onset 
latency , total sleep time , and wake after sleep  onset, number of awakenings, and sleep quality. 
The take-home subject  sleep diary assessment will be administered using an eDiary solution. The 
eDiary will be captured using either a provisioned smartphone device or bring- your-own-device 
(BYOD ) solution, depending on the subject’s  preference.

12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule o f assessments ( Table 1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity , employment status , highest education 
level , marital/civil status) and a full medical history , including family psychiatric history,  will be 
documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, the 
disease code associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  (ICD -10) should be recorded . 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH  ATRQ) will be  used to determine whether the subject has treatment-resistant depression, 
defined as per sistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive 
episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from two different classes for at least 4 weeks of treatment . 
12.1.2. Weight and Height 
Height (Screening only) and weight will be meas ured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eyes , ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual 
is to perform all physical examinations  for a given subject . Unscheduled brief, symptom- driven  
physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormalit y in physical examinations will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supine position after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes and then after 1 minute in the standing position. 
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital 
signs will be d ocumented. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, vital 
signs will be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in  vital signs will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1.

 41  12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supine 12- lead ECG s will be performed  in triplicate  at all scheduled  time points. The standard 
intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be 
recorded.  
 
12.1.6. Laboratory Assessments 
Samples  will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures detailed  in the 
laboratory manual.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry,  urinalysis , 
and coagulation. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in  the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or subinvestigator indicating that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical significance. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside th e central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or 
worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to  Section  12.2.1.1. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been obtained. 
A serum f ollicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a 
female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol- defined criteria 
for be ing post- menopausal (Section  8.1).

12.1.6.1. Drugs of Abus e and  Alcohol 
Urine toxicology tests will be performed  for selected drugs of abuse ( see Table  3). A breath test 
for alcohol will be performed. 
12.1.6.2. Pregnancy Screen  
For female subjects that are not surgically sterile and do not meet the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other scheduled timepoints  thereafter , including the ET 
visit for s ubjects who prematurely discontinue. 
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C -SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal ideation and behavior, and a post-baseline evaluation that focuses on s uicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months). The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table 1. 
12.1.8. Physician With drawal Checklist  
The PWC is based on the 35- item Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist that was developed in 
the 1960s to measure benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like discontinuation symptoms. The 
PWC -20 is a shorter version of the Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist based on the 20 items 
that provided the best differentiation from placebo in previous trials. The PWC-20 is made up of a list of 20 symptoms (eg, loss of appetite, nausea-vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety-nervousness, irritability, etc) that are rate d on a scale of 0 (not present) to 3 (severe) ( Rickels  2008). The 
PWC -20 will be used to monitor for the presence of potential withdrawal symptoms following 
discontinuation of SAGE-217.

 44  12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can  include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after the first administration of any study drug . The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs , and physical 
examinations  are considered AEs if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study 
treatment , require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) 
and/or if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Laboratory values and vital signs that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported in an expedited manner. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations that are 
clearly attributable to another  AE do not require discrete reporting (eg, electrolyte disturbances 
in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis). 
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the study, 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be reporte d to Sage Therapeutics.  
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalizatio n 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the subject or may require me dical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE  report form 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 45  provided by Sage Therapeutics  within 24 hours of first awareness (Section  12.5). A ll SAEs 
should to be followed until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered 
clinically significant or the subject was lost to follow -up. Serious adverse event s occurring after 
a subject’s final visit (including the last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee 
only if the Investigator considers the SAE to be related to study treatment.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled 
(or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate 
in the study 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of the Investigator, between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse event ( not related, possibly related or probably rel ated) . The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause- and-effect relationship between the investigational 
product and the occurrence of the adverse event, then the adverse event should be considered at least “possibly related.”  
Table 4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship  Definition  
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience and the administration of study  drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study  drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administered to the subject.  
If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.

 46  12.4. Recording Adve rse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site . The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applicable), and 
whether or not it caused the subj ect to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal act ivities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.1.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this study, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The I nvestigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy 
information on any male subject’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject 
is participating in study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective term ination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject  was 
discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy  in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (e.g., spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of th e pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs must be reported to Sage, or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sage, or designee, within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event by the 
investigator and/or his staff. The In vestigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form , 
verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding 
source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee.  
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v3.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 47  Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics , or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the case report form 
(CRF ) and/or study fi le. 
Any SAEs discovered by the Investigator after the designated follow up time for the study, should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee, according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact information for reporting SAEs and/or pregnancies is locat ed in the study reference 
manual.   
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events . It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. Ethics Committee  
(EC)/I nstitutional Review Boards (IRBs) will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by 
local law . In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or 
designee, will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. The Sponsor, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law. The Sponsor, or designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject i s 
at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, the Investigator must make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study treatment administered to a subject. Any reques t from the Investigator about the 
treatment administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be 
clearly documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for 
the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by the appropriate Sage personnel, according to standard operating procedures.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the eCRF.  If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be 
permanently discontinued from the study.

 48  13. STATISTICS  
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study . The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. Any 
deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized set, defined as all subjects who are randomized, will be used for all data listings, unless otherwise specified.
 
The Safety Set, defined as all subjects administered study drug, will be used to provide descriptive summaries of safety data.  
The Efficacy Set, defined as all subjects in the Safety Set with at least 1 post -baseline HAM -D 
evaluation, will be used for analysis of efficacy data.  
 
  
13.2. Handling of Missing Dat a 
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data . All subjects will be used in the analyses, as 
per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available . No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data . A sensitivity analysis will b e used  to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group have missing data.  
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy  analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the st art of study drug administration .  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time point and summarized descripti vely. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data (Section  12.1.1) and baseline characteristics, such as heigh t, weight, and body 
mass index (BMI), will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical/f amily history will be listed by subject.

 49  13.5. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be summarized us ing appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where appli cable; subject listings will be  provided for all efficacy data. 
Subjects will be analyzed accord ing to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean chan ge from baseline in HAM-D total 
score at Day 15. This will be ana lyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include t reatment, baseline HAM-D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, and time point-by-treatment as explanato ry variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fi xed effects. All post-baseline t ime points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison w ill be between SAGE-217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. 
Model-based point estimates (ie, l east squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured cova riance structure will be used to 
model the within-subject errors. I f there is a convergence issu e with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence unt il convergence is  achieved. If  the model still does not converge 
with AR(1) structure, no results  will be reported. When the cov ariance structure is not UN, the 
sandwich estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be d erived, using the EMPIRICAL 
option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS. 
Similar to those methods descri bed above for the primary endpoi nt, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from  baseline in other time points i n HAM-D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM-A total sco re, SF-36v2 score, PHQ-9 score, sleep endpoints (eg, sleep latency 
(SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO)), I SI score and selected individual 
items and/or subscale scores in HAM-D for change from baseline.   
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM-D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduc tion from baseline in HAM-D tota l score) and HAM-D 
remission (defined as HAM-D total  score of ≤7.0). GEE models wi ll include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratificati on factor, assessment time point, a nd time point-by-treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the d ifference between SAGE-217 and 
matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point es timates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p- values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I respon se including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI-S score , stratification f actor, assessm ent time point, and time point-by-
treatment as explan atory variables. 
 
13.6. Safety Analyses 
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by inci dence of adverse events/serious 
adverse events, concomitant medi cation usage, vital signs, clin ical laboratory evaluations, and 
12-lead ECG. Suicidality will be  monitored by the C-SSRS. Poten tial withdrawal symptoms after 
discontinuation of SAGE-217 will be  assessed using the PWC-20. Safety data will be listed by 
subject and summarized by treat ment group. All safety summaries  will be performed on the

will be  summarized. in standard units. N ormal range of each parameter  is provided by the 
laboratory; shift from baseline to post-baseline values in abnormality of results will be provided. 
Potentially clinically significant values will be summarized by treatment.  Any abnormal values 
deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). 
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by subject and timing of collection.  
13.6.3. Physical Examinations 
The occurrence of a p hysical examination (Y/N) and the date performed will be listed by subject.

Section  12.2). 
13.6.4. Vital Signs  
Results from each visit and m ean changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by 
scheduled visit. Any abnormality deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be 
reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). P otentially clinically significant values will be summarized 
by treatment.  Vital sign results will be listed by subject and timing of collection. 
13.6.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each of the triplicate ECGs for each subject : 
heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF ; the derived mean of each parameter will also be listed . Any 
clinically significant abnormalities or changes in mean ECGs should be reported  as an AE (see 
Section  12.2). Mean ECG  data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinicall y significant 
values of QTcF will be summarized by treatment.  Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by

 51  13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be recorded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO-DD) September 2015, or later .  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through the duration of the study 
will be recorded . In addition, all psychotropic medications taken 6 months prior to Screening  will 
be recorded . Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be 
denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the 
initiation of  the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are 
ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study dru g).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment Period

13.6.8. Physician Withdrawal Checklist  
Potential withdrawal symptoms collected on the PWC -20 will be summarized by visit and 
treatme nt. Listings will include all data by subject . 
  
 
 
 
 
13.8. Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would provide 
90% power to detect a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the 
primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM- D total sco re at Day 15, assuming SD of 
10 points. Assuming an 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be 
required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized 
subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at least 1 post- baseline HAM -D 
assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 11%.

efficacy assessments with a patient -reported outcome (PRO) measure that provides balanced 
assessment of the core symptoms of a major depressive episode  
• Add the 20- item Physician Withdrawal Checklist (PWC -20) as a safety endpoint to better 
characterize the clinical e ffects of the proposed time -limited use of SAGE -217 
• Add a Day 18 follow- up visit to evaluate potential withdrawal symptoms of SAGE -217 
• Replace HAM- D with MADRS as the assessment of MDD at screening to better capture 
depresstion presentations featuring hypersomnia 
• Increase exclusionary period for use of benzodiazepines and GABA A modulators/GABA-
containing agents to avoid confounding by the natural resolution of prolonged mild 
GABAergic withdrawal symptoms  
Additional changes are bei ng implemented as outlined below: 
• Exclude subjects that have taken non -GABA anti -insomnia medications (eg melatonin, 
Benadryl [anti -histamines], trazodone, low dose quetiapine, mirtazapine, etc) within 14 days 
of initition of study drug.  
• Remove criterion that subjects must be ambulatory 
• Remove duplicate inclusion criterion #8 (reflected in exclusion criteria)  
• Include exception to contraception criteria for subjects in same-sex relationship(s) which do not carry a risk of pregnancy 
• Enhance exclusion of subjects with treatment- resistan t depression within the current major 
depressive episode 
• Exclude subjects with and/or treated for any type of cancer (excluding basal cell carcinoma and in situ melanoma) within the past year  
• Exclude subjects with a history of sleep apnea  
• Exclude subjects that have had procedures that interfere with gastrointestinal transit  
• Define timeframes for each type of prohibited medication  
• Reiterate exclusion criterion prohibiting elective surgeries or procedures during participating in the study 
• Offer practical opti ons for taking study drug with food in the evening

The primary change occurs in Section 13.5 Efficacy Analyses 
Changed text: The estimand  for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM-D total score at Day 15. 
This  primary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline to each assessment in HAM- D total score, will be analyzed 
using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM- D total 
score,  stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point- by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the model. The main 
comparison will be between SAGE-217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. Model- based point estimates (ie, least 
squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p- values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured 
covariance structure will be used to model the within-subject errors. The Toeplitz or compound symmetry covariance 
structure will be used if there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model. If there is a convergence 
issue with the unstructured covariance model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance 
structure will be used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved.  If the model still does not converge with 
AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the sandwich estimator for 
the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in 
SAS.

Study Description: 
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD ( MADRS  total score ≥ 30). Randomization will be stratified based on use of 
antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) at baseline and 
carried out  within each stratum in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, 
or matching placebo; subjects will be treated  for 14  days beginning on Day 1.  
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14- day Treatment Period,  a 28-
day follow -up period, and an extended follow -up period through Day 182 (6 months following 
the last dose) .  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities.  The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID -5-
CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary 
screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v4.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
6 MADRS  and CGI-S. 
Antidepressants are permitted provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 an d agree to continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy 
or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day  42 
assessments.  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects will self -
administer a single dose of study drug once daily in the evening with food, on an outpatient 
basis, for 14 days . Practical options include taking SAGE -217 within 1 hour of dinner or taking 
SAGE -217 later in the evening with solid food.  Subjects will return to the study center during 
the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in  Table  1. 
Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the 
site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is 
discontinued. Follow -up visits should take place as scheduled relative to the last dose of 
treatment (eg, if a subject’s last dose is on  Day 13, their first follow -up visit (Visit  7,) should 
occur 4 days later ). If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, 
the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day 
during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects.

Study Drug,  Dosage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -217 is available as hard gelatin capsules containing a white to off-white powder. In 
addition to SAGE -217 Drug Substance, the SAGE -217 capsules contain croscarmellose sodium, 
mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose  (SMCC), colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium 
stearyl fumarate as excipients. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component of the 
SMCC or a standalone excipient in the formulation. SAGE -217 capsules will be orally 
administered as a 30 -mg or 20-mg dose.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing only the 
excipients listed above for the active capsule.  
Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods: 
A detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study  will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to treatment 
unblinding.   
When all subjects complete the Day 42 visit, the database will be locked, followed by treatment 
unblinding to the Sponsor and data analyses (site personnel and subjects will re main blin ded). 
The extended follow -up period will continue as scheduled; the final database lock will occur 
when all subjects complete the extended follow-up period.  
General  Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be c alculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets 
The Randomized Set is defined as all subjects who are randomized.  
The Safety Set  is defined as all subjects administered study drug.  
The Full Analysis Set  is defined as all randomized subjects in the Safety Set with a valid 
baseline HAM -D total score at least 1 post -baseline HAM -D total score.

Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would 
provide 90% power to detect a placebo-adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points 
in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15, assuming 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Assuming a 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization 
ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total 
randomized subjects will be required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at 
least 1 post -baseline HAM -D assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout 
rate is greater than 11%.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM -D 
total score at Day 15. This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, and time point-by -treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All post-baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. 
Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence inter vals, and p -
values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the sandwich estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF-36v2  score, PHQ -9 score, sleep diary endpoints (eg, sleep 
latency  (SL), total sleep time ( TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO) ), ISI score and selected 
individual items and/or subscale scores  in HAM -D for change from baseline .  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for 
treatment, baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-
treatment as explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between 
SAGE -217 and matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model -based point estimates (ie, 
odds ratios), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI -I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by -
treatment as explanatory variables. 
 
 
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/serious adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12 -lead ECG. Suicidality will be 
monitored by the C -SSRS . Potential withdrawal sympto ms after discontinuation of SAGE -217

 43  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/ ). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United S tates, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs 
and suicide-related costs, was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015 ). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5), depression 
refers to an overarching set of  diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). 
Diagnostic criteria for MDD includes  a set of at least 5 depressive symptoms out of 9, including 
depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability and 
suicidality during the same 2- week period, that represents a change from previous functioning 
(DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds that affect monoaminergic 
neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapin e and bupropion, represent the major classes of 
antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated 
their limited efficacy , including low remission rates and untreated symptoms ( Trivedi 2006; 
Conradi 2011; Romera 2 013). 
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Gerner 1981; Honig 1988; Drugan 1989; 
Luscher  2011;  Mann 2014) implicates deficits in γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)- ergic 
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including MDD. Furthermore, experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of endogenous neuroactive steroids in depressive disorders ( Maguire 2008; Maguire 2009). Depressed patients show low 
levels of GABA in the brain and of neurosteroids in the cerebrosp inal fluid ( CSF) and plasma, 
and antidepressant therapy restores GABA levels in relevant animal models and neurosteroid concentrations in depressed patients ( Luscher  2011; Schüle 2014).

SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 
rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was highly selective 
for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo. 
Data from a n open- label  Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administered to subjects with moderate to 
severe MDD  showed clinically significant improvements from baseline in depression and 
anxiety scale scores ( Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D], Montgomery-Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], and Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as early as Day 2 of t he 14-day treatment period, 
with durable responses following the end of treatment. This result was further supported by the 
randomized, double-blind portion of this study including 89 subjects, in which a rapid and 
substantial decrease in HAM- D scores was observed at  Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at 
Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other efficacy scales, including MADRS, 
CGI-I, and HAM -A. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatme nt-emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
adverse events ( AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. There have been no deaths 
and only one subject with essential tremor experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of 
transient confusion leading to discontinuation of study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure .  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
Non-serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with  SAGE -217. Given the outcome of  the Phase 2 study  of SAGE -217 in  subjects with  
MDD, the current significant  unmet need  in the treatment  of depression, and a favorable benefit-
risk profile , further investigation  of SAGE -217 in  patients  with  MDD is  justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
There will be 2 dose levels of SAGE -217 in this study  in order to study dose ranging : 30 mg per 
day and 20 mg per day. The higher  dose level of 30 mg per day is the maximum tolerated dose in 
the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects and is also the dose level that 
was effective and generally well tolerated in a Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD (217-MDD-
201). The low er dose of 20 mg per day will be studied in subjects with MDD for the first time in 
the current study and is anticipated to be well tolerated as it is lower than the maximum tolerated 
dose l evel. Due to sedation/somnolence observed in previous clinical trials when administered in 
the morning, and improved tolerability when given in the evening, both doses of SAGE -217 will 
be administered in the evening in this study.

 43  7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (MADRS  total score ≥30). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 
14-day Treatment Period, a 28-day follow-up period, and an extended follow -up period through 
Day 182 (6 months following the last dose).  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities. At the time 
of providing informed consent for the study, subjects will also be asked to authorize that their 
unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry ( www.subjectregistry.com ) with the intent of 
identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria due to participation in another clinical 
study (Section 8.2).  
The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and DSM-5 Clinical Trial Version  (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the MADRS  and CGI -S.  
Antidepressants are permitted  provided subj ects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to  continue on the stable dose through the 28-day follow-up period ( Day 42). 
Initiation of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy or safety endpoints is prohibited between screening and completion of the Day 42 
assessments. 
 
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will self-
administer a single dose of study drug with food once daily in the evening on an outpatient basis, 
for 14 days. Dose reductions are not permitted. Study drug administration will be monitored via 
a clinical monitoring service  (see Section  9.3). 
Subjects will return to the study cen ter during the treatment and follow-up periods as outlined in 
Table  1. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects (see 
Section  13.8 ). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1. Randomization will be 
stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn 
≥60 days) at baseline and perform ed within each stratum in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive SAGE -217 
20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo.

 43  7.4. Dose  Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be 
discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated  (see Section  8.3). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
subjects, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will provide written notification to the Investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify their 
ethics committee and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating subjects.

 43  8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw from the study drug or terminate from the study at any time for any 
reason . The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study drug or from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
• The subject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol  
• The subject experiences an intolerable AE  
• Other medical or safety reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the 
Medical Monitor  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a 
subject withdraw s from study drug or terminates the study for any reason. The reason must be 
recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
If a subject is persistently noncompliant, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor the potential discontinuation of the subject. Any reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere to the protocol must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF , including: 
• missed visits;  
• interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration;  
• non-permitted medications (see Section  9.2). 
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE, regardless of Investigator-determined causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator determines the event is no longer clinically significant.  
Subjects who  discontinue study drug early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) 
visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up visits 
should take place as scheduled relative to  the last dose of treatment  (eg, if a subject ’s last dose is 
on Day 13, their first follow -up visit ( Visit 7) should occur 4 days later ). If at any time after the 
EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT a nd ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues 
study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for the ET visit will be conducted.  
A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up afte r attempts at contacting  the subject have been 
unsuccessful . 
8.3.1. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects will not  be replaced . Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop- out rate is 
higher than anticipated (Section  13.8 ).

9.3. Treatment Adherence  
SAGE -217 or placebo will be self -administered by subjects once daily in the evening with food. 
Sites will dispense study drug to the subjects to take at home with instructions for use (see 
Section  10.4  and Tab le 1).  
Administration of study drug will be monitored by a medication adherence monitoring platform 
used on smartphones to visually confirm medication ingestion. Subjects will receive a reminder 
within a predefined time window to take study drug while using the application. Subjects will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front-facing webcam to visually confirm their ingestion of the medication. Th e application will record the date and time of study drug 
administration by dose level , as well as missed doses.  
In addition, the subject will be instructed to bring their dosing kit to the site  as outlined in 
Table  1, at which time the Investigator or designee will be responsible for ensuring the kit 
contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  All subjects should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the re-education must document the process in the subject 
source records.  
The Investigator(s) will record a ny reasons for non- compliance in the source documents. 
9.4. Random ization and Blinding 
This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects who meet the entrance 
criteria will be randomized in a stratified manner based on use of antidepressant treatment  
(current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days ) at baseline; randomization will be done within 
each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matched 
placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization will be performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system.  
Randomization schedules will be generated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or placebo) will be based on the 
randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding.  
The Sponsor will be unblinded following the first database lock when all subjects complete the 
Day 42 visit; site personnel and subjects will remain blinded throughout the extended follow-up 
until the final database lock when all subjects complete the Day 1 82 visit. 
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety  of the study subject, the Investigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment in the study via the IRT (see Section  12.6 for 
more details related to unblinding).

identifying information, including the subject ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the 
eligible subject into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be 
dispensed to that subject.  The medicatio n ID number and the number of capsules dispensed must 
be recorded.  
At the subsequent study drug- dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same subject ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID numb er for the study drug to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number 
of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the subject at this visit must be recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by sit e staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
Sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. After the study is completed, 
all unused study drug must be returned as directed or destroyed on site per the Sponsor’s 
instructions.  The Investigator or designee must keep a record of all study drug received, 
dispensed and discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion o f the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation.  
10.7. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
At the end of the study, a ll used and unused study drug will be reconciled  and returned to Sage 
Therapeutics for destruction or destroyed locally; disposition of study drug will be documented. 
A copy of the inventory record and a record of any clinical supplies that have been received, 
dispensed or destroyed must be documented by the site as directed. This documentation must 
include at least the information below:  
• the number of dispensed units; 
• the number of unused units; 
• the number of units destroyed at the end of the study; 
• the date, method and location of destruction.

 43  11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY   
All assessments will be conducted according to the sc hedule of a ssessments (Table  1). Study 
assessments that involve subject  interviews, including the HAM- D and SCID-5- CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purposes. All assessments must be conducted by 
raters that have been trained and certified to conduct assessments in this study.  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an in dividual subject. An assessment timeframe of 7 days will be 
used on Day 1 and ‘S ince Last Visit’ will be used for all other  visits . 
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depressed ( Willia ms 2013a; Williams 2013b). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Ratin g Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score . Hamilton Rati ng Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM- D total score of  ≤7.  
11.1.2. Montgomery-Å sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in subjects with m ood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yi elds a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM- A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A tot al 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. 
11.1.4. Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are being used in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert scale to rate the severity of the subject’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. 
Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=moderately 
ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill (Busner 2007a ).  
The CGI-I employs a 7- point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the subject ’s 
condition posttreatment. The Investigator will rate the subject ’s total improvement whethe r or 
not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much 
improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse ( Busner 2007b). The CGI -I is only rate d at 
posttreatment assessments. By definition, all CGI- I assessments are evaluated against baseline 
conditions. CGI-I response will be defined as having a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or 
“much improved.”  
11.1.5. Short Form -36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
The Medica l Outcomes Study SF-36v2 is a 36- item measure of health status that has undergone 
validation in many different disease states (Ware 2007). The SF-36v2 covers eight health 
dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role 
participation with physical health problems [role -physical], bodily pain, and general health) and 
four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional 
health problems [role-emotional], and mental health). In addition, two summary scores, physical 
component summary and mental component summary, are produced by taking a weighted linear 
combination of the eight individual domains. The SF-36v2 is available with two recall periods: the standard recall period is 4 weeks and the acute recall period is 1 week. This study will use the 
acute version, which asks patients to respond to questions as they pertain to the past week. 
Higher SF- 36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  
11.1.6. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 
The PHQ- 9 is a subject -rated depressive symptom severity scale. To monitor severity over time 
for newly diagnosed subjects or subjects in current treatment for depression, subjects may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter. Scoring is based on responses to specific questions, as follows: 0=not at all; 1=several days; 2=more than half the 
days; and 3=nearly every day.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  The PHQ -9 total score will be calculated as the sum of the 9 individual item scores. The PHQ -9 
total score wi ll be categorized as follows: 1 to 4=minimal depression, 5 to 9=mild depression, 10 
to 14=moderate depression, 15 to 19=moderately severe depression; and 20 to 27=severe 
depression. 
11.1.7. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction 
with current sle ep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral, 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinically significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate 
severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”  
11.1.8. Core Consensus Sleep Diary  
The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collect s subjective sleep parameters, including sleep onset 
latency , total sleep time , and wake after sleep onset , number of awakenings, and sleep quality. 
The take- home subject  sleep diary assessment will be administered using an eDiary solution. The 
eDiary will be captured using either a provisioned smartphone device or bring-your- own-device 
solution, depending on the subject’s  preference.

 43  12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status, highest education 
level , marital/civil status ) and a full medical history , including family psychiatric history, will be 
documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID-5- CT. If available, t he 
disease code  associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems  (ICD -10) should be recorded . 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH ATRQ) will be  used to determine whether the subject has treatment- resistant depression, 
defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive 
episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from two different classes for at least 4 weeks of treatment. 
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eye s, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual 
is to perform all physical examinations for a given subject . Unscheduled brief , symptom-driven 
physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart 
rate measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supine position after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes and then after approximately 3 minutes in the s tanding 
position. Respiratory rate and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital signs will 
be documented. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, vital signs will 
be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in vital signs wi ll be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1.

 43  12.1.5. Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supine 12- lead ECG s will be performed  in triplicate  at all scheduled  time points. The standard 
intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) as wel l as any rhythm abnormalities will be 
recorded.  
 
12.1.6. Laboratory Assessments  
Samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures detail ed in the 
laboratory manual.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis , 
and coagulation. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or subinvestigator indicating that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical significance. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or 
worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been obtained.  
A serum f ollicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a 
female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal (S ection  8.1).

12.1.6.1. Drugs of Abuse and Alcohol 
Urine toxicology tests will be performed  for selected drugs of abuse (see Table  3). A breath test 
for alcohol will be performed.  
12.1.6.2. Pregnancy Screen  
For female subjects that are not surgically sterile and do not meet the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other scheduled timepoints  thereafter , including the ET 
visit for s ubjects who prematurely discontinue. 
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C- SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months) . The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table  1. 
12.1.8. Physician Withdrawal Checklist  
The PWC is based on the 35-item Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist that was developed in 
the 1960s to measure benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like discontinuation symptoms. The 
PWC -20 is a shorter version of the Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist based on the 20 items 
that provided the best differentiation from placebo in previous trials. The PWC-20 is made up of 
a list of 20 symptoms (eg, loss of appetite, nausea-vomi ting, diarrhea, anxiety -nervousness, 
irritability, etc) that are rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 3 (severe) ( Rickels 2008). The 
PWC -20 will be used to monitor for the presence of potential withdrawal symptoms following 
discontinuation of SAGE-217.

 43  12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
12.2.1.1. Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after  the first administration of any study drug. The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs , and physical 
examinations are considered AEs if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study 
treatment, require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) 
and/or if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Laboratory values and vital 
signs that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported in an expedited manner. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations that are 
clearly attributable to anothe r AE  do not require discrete reporting (eg , electrolyte disturbances 
in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis). 
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF  and throughout the duration of the study, 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeutics.  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by 
the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
The Sponsor or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening 
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of th e outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF  and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE  report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics within 24 hours of first awareness (Section  12.5). A ll SAEs 
should to be followed until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered clinically significant or the subject was lost to follow -up. Serious adverse event s occurring after 
a subject’s final visit (including the last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee 
only if the Investigator considers the SAE to be related to study treatment.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routi nely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled 
(or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participate in the study 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of the Investigato r, between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of 
the procedure or treatment.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse 
event ( not related, poss ibly related or probably related). The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then 
the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event,  then the adverse event should be considered at 
least “possibly related.”   
Table  4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship Definition 
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administere d to the subject.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  If the relationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational s ite. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applica ble), and 
whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
• Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)  
• Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under  Section  12.2.1.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this stud y, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The Investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy 
information on any male subje ct’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject 
is participating in study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the 
investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (e.g., spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs must be reported to Sage , or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sag e, or designee, within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event by the 
investigator and/or his staff . The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form , 
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding 
source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics, or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow- up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the case report form 
(CRF ) and/or study file. 
Any SAEs discovered by the Investigator after the designated follow up time for the study, should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee,  according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact information for reporting SAEs and/or pregnancies is located in the study reference manual.  
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical st udy. Ethics Committee  
(EC) /Institutional R eview Boards (IRBs) will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by 
local law . In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or 
designee, will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. The Sponsor, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law. The Sponsor, or designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug 
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at 
immediate risk, the Investigator must m ake diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding 
the study treatment administered to a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the 
treatment administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs 
without Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later 
than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for 
the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by the 
appropriate Sage personnel, according to standard operating procedures.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the 
eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be permanently discontinued from the study.

 43  13. STATISTICS  
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to treatment unblinding. 
When all subjects complete the Day 42 visit, the database will be locked, followed by treatment 
unblinding to the Sponsor and data analyses (site personnel and subjects will remain blinded). 
The extended follow-up period will continue as scheduled; the final database lock will occur 
when all subjects complete the extended follow -up period. 
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized set is defined as all subjects who are randomized.  
The Safety Set is defined as all subjects administered study drug. 
The Full Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects in the Safety Set with a valid baseline 
HAM -D total score and at least 1 post -baseline HAM- D total score.  
  
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All subjects will be used in the analyses, as per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available . No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data. A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group have missing data. 
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy  analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, cha nge from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively . For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data (Section 12.1.1) and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and body 
mass index (BMI), will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
Hepatitis, HIV, d rug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not 
summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical/family history will be listed by subject.

 43  13.5. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM- D total 
score at Day 15. This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, an d time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison will be between SAGE-217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with  the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge 
with AR(1) structure, no results wil l be reported. The sandwich estimator for the variance 
covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement 
in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM- D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, PHQ-9 score, sleep diary endpoints (eg, sleep 
latency ( SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset ( WASO) ), ISI score and selected 
individual items and/or subscale scores in HAM -D for change from baseline.  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM- D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score) and HAM- D 
remission (defined as HAM-D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference  between SAGE -217 and 
matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p-values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerab ility of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of AEs/SAEs , vital signs, 
clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12 -lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C- SSRS. 
Potential withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of SAGE -217 will be assessed usi ng the 
PWC -20. Safety data will be listed by subject and summarized by treatment group. All safety 
summaries will be performed on the Safety Set.  Where applicable, ranges of potentially clinical 
significant (PCS) values are provided in the SAP.

summarized overall and by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 
18.1 or higher, System Organ Class (SOC) , and preferred term . Incidences will be presented in 
order of decreasing frequency. In addition, summaries will be provided by intensity (mild, 
moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not related) to study drug (see Section  12.3).  
Any TEAEs  leading to discontinuation and SAE s with onset after the start of study drug will also 
be summarized .  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of study drug) 
through the end of the study will be listed).

Result s of clinical laboratory para meters in each scheduled visit and m ean changes from baseline 
will be  summarized  in standard units. N ormal range of each parameter  is provided by the 
laboratory; shift from baseline to post-baseline values in abnormality of results will be provided. 
Potentially clinically significant values will be summarized by treatment.  Any abnormal values 
deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be reported as an AE  (see Section  12.2). 
Clinical laboratory results will be listed by subject and timing of collection. 13.6.3. Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a p hysical examination (Y/N) and the date performed  will be listed by subject. 
Any clinically significant observation in physical examination will be reported as an AE (see 
Section  12.2 ). 
13.6.4. Vital Signs  
Results from each visit and mean changes from baseline in vital signs will be summarized by 
scheduled visit . Any abnormality deemed clinically significant by the investigator will be 
reported as an AE (see Section  12.2 ). Potentially clinically significant values will be summarized 
by treatment.  Vital sign results will be listed by subject and timing of collection . 
13.6.5. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each of the triplicate ECGs for each subject : 
heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF; the derived mean of each parameter will also be listed . Any 
clinically significant abnormalities or changes in mean ECGs should be reported as an AE (see 
Section  12.2 ). Mean ECG  data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinically significant 
values of QTcF will be summarized by treatment.  Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by 
subject and visit .  
13.6.6. Prior and Concomitant Medications

Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later .  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc. 
217-MDD-301 v4.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 43  All medications taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through the duration of the study 
will be recorded . In addition, all psychotropic medications taken 6 months prior to Screening  will 
be recorded . Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be 
denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the 
initiation of the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dat es are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Sc ale 
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment Period

Potential withdrawal symptoms collected on the PWC -20 will be summarized by visit and 
treatment. Listings will include all data by subject. 
  
 
 
 
13.8. Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would provide 
90% power to detect a placebo-adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the 
primary endpoint, change from bas eline in HAM -D total sco re at Day 15, assuming SD of 
10 points. Assuming an 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum 
(antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be 
required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those random ized 
subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at least 1 post- baseline HAM- D 
assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 11%.

ability to complete or participate in this clinical study. A body mass index (BMI) ≤18 or ≥50 kg/m2 at Screening is 
exclusionary; a BMI of 40 to 49 kg/m2, inclusive, at Screening is subject to a broader evaluation of  medical co-
morbidities (such as sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease [COPD]), concomitant medications, and prior 
tolerability of sedating agents.

Study Description:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in s ubjects with 
MDD ( MADRS  total score ≥ 32 and a HAM -D total score ≥22 ). Randomization will be stratified 
based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) at baseline and carried out  within each stratum in a 1:1:1 ra tio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, 
SAGE -217 30 mg, or matching placebo; subjects will be treated  for 14  days beginning on Day 1. 
 
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14- day Treatment Period,  a 28-
day follow -up period, and an extended follow -up period through Day 182 (6 months following 
the last dose) .  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activitie s. The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID -5-
CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary 
screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the 

Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 6  MADRS , HAM -D and CGI-S.  
Antidepressants are permitted provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to continue on the stable dose through the follow -up period ( Day 42). Initiation 
of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy 
or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of the Day  42 
assessments.  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not 
treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or  matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. S ubjects will self -
administer a single dose of study drug once daily in the evening with food, on an outpatient 
basis, for 14 days . Practical options include taking SAGE -217 within 1 hour of dinner or taking 
SAGE -217 later in the evening with solid food.  Subjects will return to the study center during 
the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in  Table  1. 
Subjects who cannot tolerate study drug will be discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated. Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the 
site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is 
discontinued. Follow -up visits should take place as scheduled relative to the last dose of 
treatment (eg, if a subject’s last dose is on  Day 13, their first follow -up visit (Visit  7,) should 
occur 4 days later ). If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, 
the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the same day 
during a clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
Number of Subjects (planned):  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects .

Study Drug, D osage and Mode of Administration:  
SAGE -217 is available as hard gelatin capsules containing a white to off-white powder. In 
addition t o SAGE -217 Drug Substance, the SAGE -217 capsules contain croscarmellose sodium, 
mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose  (SMCC), colloidal silicon dioxide and sodium 
stearyl fumarate as excipients. Colloidal silicon dioxide may be either a component  of the 
SMCC or a standalone excipient in the formulation. SAGE -217 capsules will be orally 
administered as a 30 -mg or 20-mg dose.  
Reference Therapy, Dosage, and Mode of Administration:  
Placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules for oral administration containing only the 
excipients listed above for the active capsule.  
Duration of Treatment: 14 days  
Statistical methods: 
A detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study  will be provided in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to treatment 
unblinding.   
When all subjects complete the Day 42 visit, the database will be locked, followed by treatment 
unblinding to the Spon sor and data analyses (site personnel and subjects will re main blinded) . 
The extended follow -up period will continue as scheduled; the final database lock will occur 
when all subjects complete the extended follow-up period.  
General  Considerations  
For the p urpose of all safety and efficacy analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized descriptively with n, mean, standard deviation, 
median, minim um, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets 
The Randomized Set is defined as all subjects who are randomized.  
Clinical Protocol   Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-301 v5.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 10  The Safety Set  is defined as all subjects administered study drug.  
The Full Analysis Set  is defined as all randomized subjects in the Safety Set with a valid 
baseline HAM -D total score at least 1 post -baseline HAM -D total score.  
 
Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would 
provide 90% power to dete ct a placebo -adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points 
in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15, assuming 
standard deviation (SD) of 10 points. Assuming a 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization 
ratio within each stratum (antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total 
randomized subjects will be required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those randomized subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at 
least 1 post -baseline HAM -D assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout 
rate is greater than 11%.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM -D 
total score at Day 15. This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, and time point-by -treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All post-baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. 
Model -based point estimates (ie, least sq uares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance 
model, Toepl itz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge with AR(1) structure, no results will be reported. When the covariance structure is not UN, the sandwich estimator for the variance covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement in SAS.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF-36v2  score, PHQ -9 score, sleep diary endpoints (eg, sleep 
latency  (SL), total sleep time ( TST), wake after sl eep onset  (WASO) ), ISI score and selected 
individual items and/or subscale scores  in HAM -D for change from baseline .  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for 
treatment, baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-
treatment as explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference between 
SAGE -217 and matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model -based point estimates (ie, 
odds ratios), 95% confidence intervals, and p -values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response including terms for treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by -
treatment as explanatory variables.

 11  Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of adverse events/serious 
adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12 -lead ECG. Suicidality will be 
monitored by the C-SSRS. Potential withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of SAGE -217 
will be assessed using the PWC -20.

a Subjects who discontinue treatment early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit  as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. 
Follow-up visits should take place as scheduled relative to the last dose of treatment . If at any time after the EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject should 
return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues study drug and terminates the study on the  same day during a 
clinic visit; in this case, all events scheduled for both visits will be conducted.  
b Subjects will be asked to authorize that their unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry (www.subjectregistry.com) with the intent of identifying subjects who may meet 
exclusion criteria for participation in another clinical study.  
c A serum follicle stimulating hormone t est will be conducted at Screening for female subjects that are not surgically sterile to confirm whether a female subject with ≥12 months 
of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol -defined criteria for being post -menopausal. 
d Subjects will be trained on use of software applications and devices necessary for the conduct of the study by site personnel.  
e A full physical examination will be conducted at Screening and abbreviated physical examinations will be conducted thereafter. A full physical examination i ncludes assessment 
of body systems (eg, head, eye, ear, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; and extremities).  
f Safety laboratory tests will include hematology, serum chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis.  
g Urine toxicology for selected drugs of abuse (as per the lab manual) and breath test for alcohol. 
h Serum pregnancy test at screening and urine pregnancy test thereafter for female subjects that are not surgically sterile and do not meet the prot ocol-defined criteria for being 
post-menopausal.

5.1. Backgr
ound of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United S tates, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs 
and suicide-related costs, was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015) . As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (D SM-5), depression 
refers to an overarching set of diagnoses, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Diagnostic criteria for MDD includes  a set of at least 5 depressive symptoms out of 9, including 
depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or 
weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability and 
suicidality during the same 2- week period, that represents a change from previous functioning 
(DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other compounds that affect monoaminergic 
neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the major classes of 
antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated their limited efficacy , including low remission rates and untreated symptoms ( Trivedi 2006; 
Conradi 2011; Romera 2013). 
Converging preclinical and clinical evidence ( Gerner 1981; Honig 1988; Drugan 1989; 
Luscher  2011; Mann 2014) implicates deficits in γ-aminobutyric acid ( GABA)- ergic 
neurotransmission in the pathophysiology of depressive disorders including MDD. Furthermore, experimental data implicate deficiencies in the normal regulation of endogenous neuroactive steroids in depressive disorders ( Maguire 2008; Maguire 2009). Depressed patients show low 
levels of GABA in the brain and of neurosteroids in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) and plasma, 
and antidepressant therapy restores GABA levels in relevant animal models and neurosteroid concentrations in depressed patients ( Luscher  2011; Schüle 2014).  
5.2. SAGE -217 
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 
rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier

217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
and is gene
rally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was highly selective 
for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo. 
Data from  an open- label  Phase 2a study of SAGE -217 administered to subjects with moderate to 
severe MDD  showed clinically significant improvements from baseline in depression and 
anxiety scale scores ( Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM -D], Montgomery-Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale [HAM-A], and Clinical 
Global Impression – Improvement [CGI- I]) as early as Day 2 of the 14 -day treatment period, 
with durable responses following the end of treatment. This result was further supported by the 
randomized, double-blind portion of this study including 89 subjects, in which a rapid and 
substantial decrease in HAM- D scores was observed at  Day 15 (primary endpoint), starting at 
Day 2. This response pattern was also observed with other  efficacy scales, including MADRS, 
CGI-I, and HAM -A. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment- emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) were sedation, somnolence, and dizziness. Most 
adverse events ( AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in intensity. There have been no deaths 
and only one subject with essential tremor experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of 
transient confusion leading to discontinuation of study drug. No other SAEs have been reported in any study of SAGE-217.  
Additional information on nonclinical and clinical data is provided in the Investigator’s 
Brochure.  
5.3. Potential Risks and Benefits 
Non- serious events of sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were the most commonly reported 
AEs with  SAGE -217. Given the outcome of  the Phase 2 study  of SAGE -217 in  subjects with  
MDD, the current significant  unmet need  in the treatment  of depression, and a fa vorable benefit-
risk profile , further investigation  of SAGE -217 in  patients  with  MDD is  justified.  
5.4. Dose Justification  
There will be 2 dose levels of SAGE -217 in this study  in order to study dose ranging : 30 mg per 
day and 20 mg per day. The higher  dose level of 30 mg per day is the maximum tolerated dose in 
the multiple ascending dose study of SAGE-217 in healthy subjects and is also the dose level that 
was effective and generally well tolerated in a Phase 2 study in subjects with MDD (217-MDD-
201). The low er dose of 20 mg per day will be studied in subjects with MDD for the first time in 
the current study and is anticipated to be well tolerated as it is lower than the maximum tolerated 
dose level. Due to sedation/somnolence observed in previous cli nical trials when administered in 
the morning, and improved tolerability when given in the evening, both doses of SAGE -217 will 
be administered in the evening in this study.

VESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1. Overall Study Design
This is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo-controlled study in subjects with 
MDD (MADRS  total score ≥32 and a HAM -D total score  ≥22). The study will consist of a 
Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14-day Treatment Period, a 28-day follow-up period, and an 
extended follow -up period through Day 182 (6 months following the last dose).  
The Screening Period begins with the signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the 
Screening Visit ; the ICF must be signed prior to beginning any screening activities. At the time 
of providing informed consent for the study, subjects will also be asked to authorize that their 
unique subject identifiers be entered into a registry ( www.subjectregistry.com ) with the intent of 
identifying subjects who may meet exclusion criteria due to participation in an other clinical 
study (Section 8.2).  
The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and DSM-5 Clinical Trial Version  (SCID -5-CT) performed by a qualified healthcare 
professional. Subjects will undergo preliminary screening procedures at the Screening Visit to determine eligibility, including completion of the MADRS , HAM -D, and CGI -S.  
Antidepressants are permitted  provided subjects are on a stable dose for at least 60 days prior to 
Day 1 and agree to  continue on the stable dose through the 28-day follow-up period ( Day 42). 
Initiation of new antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact on efficacy or safety endpoints is prohibited between screening and completion of the Day 42 
assessments. 
 
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn ≥60 days) and randomized within each stratum to one of 3 treatment groups 
(SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will self-
administer a single dose of study drug with food once daily in the evening on an outpatient basis, 
for 14 days. Dose reductions are not permitted. Study drug administration will be monitored  via 
a clinical monitoring service  (see Section  9.3). 
Subjects will return to the study center during the treatment and follow -up periods as outlined in  
Table  1. 
7.2. Number of Subjects  
Approximately 450 subjects will be randomized and dosed to obtain 399 evaluable subjects (see 
Section  13.8 ). 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group on Day 1. Randomization will be 
stratified based on use of antidepressant treatment (current/stable or not treated/withdrawn 
≥60 days) at baseline and perform ed within each stratum in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive SAGE -217 
20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matching placebo.

7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustments are not permitted in this study. Subjects who cannot tolerate st udy drug will be 
discontinued from study drug and will receive treatment as clinically indicated  (see Section  8.3). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
subjects, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will 
provide written notification to the Investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify their 
ethics committee and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating subjects .

217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
Subjects may withdraw from the study drug or terminate from the study at any time for any 
reason . The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study drug or from the study for any 
of the following reasons: 
•The subject is unwilling or unable to adhere to the protocol
•The subject experiences an intolerable AE
•Other medical or safety reason, at the discretion of the Investigator and/or the
Medical Monitor
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor and/or the Medical Monitor immediately when a 
subject withdraw s from study drug or terminates the study for any reason. The reason must be 
recorded in the subject’s electronic case report form ( eCRF ).  
If a subject is persistently noncompliant, the Investigator should discuss with the Sponsor the potential discontinuation of the subject. Any reasons for unwillingness or inability to adhere to the protocol must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF , including: 
•missed visits;
•interruptions in the schedule of study drug administration;
•non-permitted medications (see Section  9.2).
Subjects who discontinue the study due to an AE, regardless of Investigator-determined causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the Investigator determines the event is no longer clinically significant.  
Subjects who discontinue study drug early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) 
visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up visits 
should take place as scheduled relative to  the last dose of treatment  (eg, if a subject ’s last dose is 
on Day 13, their first follow -up visit ( Visit 7) should occur 4 days later ). If at any time after the 
EOT visit, a subject decides to terminate the study, the subject should return for an early termination (ET) visit. The EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a subject discontinues 
study drug and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case, all events 
scheduled for the ET visit will be conducted.  
A subject will be deemed lost to follow -up after attempts at contacting  the subject have been 
unsuccessful . 
8.3.1. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects will not  be replaced . Additional subjects may be randomized if the drop- out rate is 
higher than anticipated (Section  13.8 ).

each stratum in a 1:1 :1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE-217 30 mg, or matched 
placebo. Subjects, clinicians, and the study team will be blinded to treatment allocation. Randomization will be performed centrally via an interactive response technology (IRT) system.  
Randomization schedules will be gen erated by an independent statistician. The allocation to 
treatment group (SAGE -217 20 mg, SAGE -217 30 mg, or placebo) will be based on the 
randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly confidential, 
accessible only to authorized  personnel until the time of unblinding.  
The Sponsor will be unblinded following the first database lock when all subjects complete the 
Day 42 visit; site personnel and subjects will remain blinded throughout the extended follow-up 
until the final databas e lock when all subjects complete the Day 182 visit. 
In exceptional circumstances and for the safety  of the study subject, the Investigator may request 
unblinding of an individual subject’s treatment in the study via the IRT (see Section  12.6 for 
more details related to unblinding).

The des
ignated site staff will dispense the supplied subject- specific kits to subjects at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table  1.  
Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening Visit to obtain a subject identification (ID) number 
for each subject. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide th e necessary subject -
identifying information, including the subject ID number assigned at Screening, to randomize the 
eligible subject into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be 
dispensed to that subject.  The medication ID number and the number of capsules dispensed must 
be recorded.  
At the subsequent study drug- dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same subject ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID number for the study drug to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number 
of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the subject at this visit must be 
recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staf f or sponsor’s designee, the 
Sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The study drug provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. After the study is completed, 
all unused study drug must be returned as directed or destroyed on site per the Sponsor’s 
instructions.  The Investigator or designee must keep a record of all study drug received, 
dispensed and discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation.

11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
All assessments will be conducted according to the sc hedule of a ssessments (Table  1). Study 
assessments that involve subject  interviews, including the HAM- D and SCID-5- CT, may be 
audiotaped for independent quality control purposes. All assessments must be conducted by 
raters that have been trained and certified to conduct assessments in this study.  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression ( HAM -D) 
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an in dividual subject. An assessment timeframe of 7 days will be 
used at Screening, and ‘S ince Last Visit’ will be used for all other visits . 
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in subjects who are already 
diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D comprises 
individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, hopeless, 
helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, 
retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased motor 
activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores. 
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score . Hamilton  Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM- D total score of  ≤7.  
11.1.2. Montgomery-Å sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)  
The MADRS is a 10-item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in subjects w ith mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that 
would be more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each it em yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.   
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the seve rity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
38

Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Protocol 
217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
complai
nts related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores. 
11.1.4. Clinical Global Impression (CGI)  
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical trials to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the subject’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are being used in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert scale to rate the severity of the subject’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with subjects who have the same diagnosis. 
Considering total clinical experience, a subject is assessed on severity of mental illness at the time of rating as 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3=mildly ill; 4=mo derately 
ill; 5=markedly ill; 6=severely ill; and 7=extremely ill (Busner 2007a ).  
The CGI-I employs a 7- point Likert scale to measure the overall improvement in the subject ’s 
condition posttreatment. The Investigator will rate the subject ’s total improvem ent whether or 
not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, and 7=very much worse ( Busner 2007b). The CGI -I is only rated at 
posttreatment assessments. By definition, all CGI- I assessments are evaluated against baseline 
conditions. CGI-I response will be defined as having a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or 
“much improved.”  
11.1.5. Short Form -36 Version 2 (SF-36v2) 
The Medical Outcomes Study SF-36v2 is a 36- item measure of health status that has undergone 
validation in many different disease states (Ware 2007). The SF-36v2 covers eight health 
dimensions including four physical health status domains (physical functioning, role 
participation with physical health problems [role -physical], bodily pain, and general health) and 
four mental health status domains (vitality, social functioning, role participation with emotional 
health problems [role-emotional], and mental health). In addition, two summary scores, physical 
component summary and mental component summary, are produced by taking a weighted linear 
combination of the eight individual domains. The SF-36v2 is available with two recall periods: the standard recall perio d is 4 weeks and the acute recall period is 1 week. This study will use the 
acute version, which asks patients to respond to questions as they pertain to the past week. Higher SF- 36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  
11.1.6. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ -9) 
The PHQ -9 is a subject -rated depressive symptom severity scale. To monitor severity over time 
for newly diagnosed subjects or subjects in current treatment for depression, subjects may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter. Scoring is based on responses to specific questions, as follows: 0=not at all; 1=several days; 2=more than half the 
days; and 3=nearly every day.  
39
Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Protocol 
217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
The PHQ -9 t
otal score will be calculated as the sum of the 9 individual item scores. The PHQ -9 
total score will be categorized as follows: 1 to 4=minimal depression, 5 to 9=mild depression, 10 
to 14=moderate depression, 15 to 19=moderately severe depression; and 20 to 27=severe 
depression. 
11.1.7. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)  
The ISI is a validated questionnaire designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of 
insomnia ( Morin 2011). The ISI uses a 5 -point Likert Scale to measure various aspects of 
insomnia severity (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe), satisfaction 
with current sleep pattern (0 = very satisfied, 1 = satisfied, 2 = neutral, 3 = dissatisfied, 4 = very 
dissatisfied), and various aspects of the impact of insomnia on daily functioning (0 = not at all, 1 = a little, 2 = somewhat, 3 = much, 4 = very much). A total score of 0 to 7 = “no clinically significant insomnia,” 8 to 14 = subthreshold insomnia,” 15 to 21 = “clinical insomnia (moderate 
severity),” and 22 to 28 = “clinical insomnia (severe).”  
11.1.8. Core Consensus Sleep Diary  
The Core Consensus Sleep Diary collect s subjective sleep parameters, including sleep onset 
latency , total sleep time , and wake after sleep onset , number of awakenings, and sleep quality. 
The take- home subject  sleep diary assessment will be administered using an eDiary solution. The 
eDia ry will be captured using either a provisioned smartphone device or bring-your- own-device 
solution, depending on the subject’s  preference.

12.1. Safe ty Parameters
All assessments will be conducted according to the schedule of assessments ( Table  1). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status, highest education 
level , marital/civil status ) and a full medical history , including family psychiatric history,  will be 
documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID-5- CT. If available, t he 
disease code  associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the 10th revision of the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded . 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH ATRQ) will be  used to determine whether the subject has treatment- resistant depression, 
defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive 
episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from two different classes for at least 4 weeks of treatment. 
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eye s, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Whenever possible, the same individual 
is to perform all physical examinations for a given subject . Unscheduled brief , symptom-driven 
physical examinations may also be conducted per the Investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. 
12.1.4. Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart 
rate measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supine position after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes and then after approximately 3 minutes in the s tanding 
position. Respiratory rate and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital signs will 
be documented. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood draws, vital signs will 
be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in vital signs wi ll be interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1.

The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis , 
and coagulation. The results of laboratory tests will be returned to the Investigator, who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or subinvestigator indicating that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical significance. Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete 
documentation in the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically 
significant before proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by the Investigator as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or 
worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1.1. A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
subject randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or a satisfactory explanation has been obtained.  
A serum f ollicle stimulating hormone test will be conducted at Screening to confirm whether a 
female subject with ≥12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea meets the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal (S ection  8.1).

12.1.6.2. Pregnancy Screen  
For female subjects that are not surgically sterile and do not meet the protocol- defined criteria 
for being post-menopausal, a serum pregnancy test will be performed at Screening and a urine 
pregnancy test will be performed at all other scheduled timepoints  thereafter , including the ET 
visit for s ubjects who prematurely discontinue. 
12.1.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
Suicidality will be monitored during the study using the C- SSRS ( Posner 2011). This scale 
consists of a baseline evaluation that assesses the lifetime experience of the subject with suicidal 
ideation and behavior, and a post- baseline evaluation that focuses on suicidality since the last 
study visit. The C -SSRS includes ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses for assessment of suicidal ideation and 
behavior as well as numeric ratings for severity of ideation, if present (from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most severe) .  
The “Baseline/Screening” C -SSRS form will be completed at screening (lifetime history and past 
24 months) . The “Since Last Visit” C -SSRS form will be completed at all subsequent time 
points, as outlined in Table  1. 
12.1.8. Physician Withdrawal Checklist  
The PWC is based on the 35-item Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist that was developed in 
the 1960s to measure benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine-like discontinuation symptoms. The 
PWC -20 is a shorter version of the Penn Physician Withdrawal Checklist based on the 20 items 
that provided the best differentiation from placebo in previous trials. The PWC-20 is made up of 
a list of 20 symptoms (eg, loss of appetite, nausea-vomi ting, diarrhea, anxiety -nervousness, 
irritability, etc) that are rated on a scale of 0 (not present) to 3 (severe) ( Rickels 2008). The 
PWC -20 will be used to monitor for the presence of potential withdrawal symptoms following 
discontinuation of SAGE-217.

12.2.
 Adverse and Serious Adverse Events 
12.2.1. D efinition  of Adverse Events 
12.2.1.1. A dverse Event ( AE) 
An AE is 
any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
A TEAE is an AE that occurs after  the first administration of any study drug. The term study 
drug includes any Sage investigational product, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a 
clinical trial.  
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs , and physical 
examinations are considered AEs if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study 
treatment, require therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) 
and/or if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant. Laboratory values and vital 
signs that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported in an expedited manner. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, ECGs, and physical examinations that are 
clearly attributable to anothe r AE  do not require discrete reporting (eg , electrolyte disturbances 
in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis). 
All AEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF  and throughout the duration of the study, 
whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage Therapeutics.  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by 
the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
The Sponsor or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary. 
12.2.1.2. Serious Adverse Ev ent (SAE)  
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
•Results in death
•Is immediately life -threatening
•Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity
•Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the Investigator 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of th e outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
46
Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Protocol 
217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
treat
ment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any subject has signed the ICF  and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE  report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics within 24 hours of first awareness (Section  12.5). A ll SAEs 
should to be followed until the event resolved, the condition stabilized, was no longer considered 
clinically significant or the subject was lost to follow -up. Serious adverse event s occurring after 
a subject’s final visit (including the last follow -up visit) should be reported to Sage or designee 
only if the Investigator considers the SAE to be related to study treatment.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or a routi nely scheduled treatment will not be considered 
an SAE, even if the subject is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
•The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled
(or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the subject’s consent to participatein the study
•The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduledtreatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of theInvestigato r, between the subject’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of
the procedure or treatment.
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The Investigator must make the determination of relationship to the study drug for each adverse 
event ( not related, poss ibly related or probably related). The Investigator should decide whether, 
in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been 
caused by the investigational product. If no valid reason exists for suggesting a relationship, then 
the adverse event should be classified as “not related.” If there is any valid reason, even if 
undetermined, for suspecting a possible cause-and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the adverse event,  then the adverse event should be considered at 
least “possibly related.”   
Table  4: Relationship to Study Drug  
Relationship Definition 
Not Related:  No relationship between  the experience  and the administration of study drug; related to 
other  etiologies  such as concomitant medications or subject’s clinical state.  
Possibly Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction might have  been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of 
therapy  administered to the subject, but  this is not known for sure.  
Probably Related:  A reaction that follows a  plausible temporal sequence from  administration of the study  drug 
and follows a  known response pattern to the suspected study drug.  
The reaction cannot be reasonably  explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s 
clinical state or  other modes of therapy  administere d to the subject.  
47
Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Protocol 
217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
If the r
elationship between the adverse event/serious adverse event and the investigational 
product is determined to be “possible” or “probable”, the event will be considered related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational s ite. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, serious outcome (if applica ble), and 
whether or not it caused the subject to discontinue the study drug or withdraw early from the 
study. 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
•Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)
•Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
•Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs . Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under  Section  12.2.1.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not be considered serious. 
If a female subject becomes pregnant during this stud y, pregnancy information must be collected 
and recorded on the Sage Therapeutics pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. The Investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy 
information on any male subje ct’s female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject 
is participating in study. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the 
pregnant female partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting 
procedures specified for pregnant female subjects.  
The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth or 
congenital abnormality) must be followed up and documented even if the subject was 
discontinued from the study. If the pregnancy ends for any reason before the anticipated date, the 
investigator should notify the sponsor. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that a study drug may 
have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication  or a complication relating to 
the pregnancy occurs (e.g., spontaneous abortion). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the 
criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly/birth defects), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
12.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs must be reported to Sage , or designee, immediately . A written account of the SAE 
must be sent to Sag e, or designee, within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event by the 
investigator and/or his staff . The Investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form , 
48
Sage Therapeutics, Inc. Clinical Protocol 
217-M DD-301 v5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
verify t
he accuracy of the information recorded on the SAE report form  with the corresponding 
source documents, and send a copy to Sage, or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage 
Therapeutics, or designee, within 24 hours of receipt on a follow- up SAE report form  and placed 
with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the case report form 
(CRF ) and/or study file. 
Any SAEs discovered by the Investigator after the designated follow up time for the study, should be promptly reported to Sage, or designee,  according to the timelines noted above.  
The contact information for reporting SAEs and/or pregnancies is located in the study reference manual.  
Sage , or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the ethics committee of all SAEs 
that occur at his or her site . Investigators will also be notified of all suspected, unexpected, 
serious, adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical st udy. Ethics Committee  
(EC) /Institutional R eview Boards (IRBs) will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by 
local law . In addition, appropriate Sponsor Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance personnel, or 
designee, will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. The Sponsor, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies 
according to local law. The Sponsor, or designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.6. Emergency Identification of Study Drug 
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the Investigator only when the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a subject is at 
immediate risk, the Investigator must m ake diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding 
the study treatment administered to a subject. Any request from the Investigator about the 
treatment administered to study subjects must be discussed with Sage. If the unblinding occurs 
without Sage’s knowledge, the Investigator must notify Sage as soon as possible and no later 
than the next business morning. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records. Unless a subject is at immediate risk, any request for 
the unblinding of individual subjects must be made in writing to Sage and approved by the 
appropriate Sage personnel, according to standard operating procedures.  
In all cases where the study drug allocation for a subject is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the subject’s records and on the 
eCRF. If the subject or study center personnel have been unblinded, the subject will be permanently discontinued from the study.

13. STA
TISTICS
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study. The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to treatment unblinding. 
When all subjects complete the Day 42 visit, the database will be locked, followed by treatment 
unblinding to the Sponsor and data analyses (site personnel and subjects will remain blinded). 
The extended follow-up period will continue as scheduled; the final database lock will occur 
when all subjects complete the extended follow -up period. 
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Randomized set is defined as all subjects who are randomized.  
The Safety Set is defined as all subjects administered study drug. 
The Full Analysis Set is defined as all randomized subjects in the Safety Set with a valid baseline 
HAM -D total score and at least 1 post -baseline HAM- D total score.  
 
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All subjects will be used in the analyses, as per the analysis populations, using all non- missing data available . No imputation process will be 
used to estimate missing data. A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of subjects in any treatment group have missing data. 
13.3. General Considerations  
For the purpose of all safety and efficacy  analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as the 
last measurement prior to the start of study drug administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. In addition, cha nge from baseline values will be calculated at 
each time point and summarized descriptively . For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data (Section 12.1.1) and baseline characteristics, such as height, weight, and body 
mass index (BMI), will be summarized using the Safety Set.  
Hepatitis, HIV, d rug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not 
summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical/family history will be listed by subject.

 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; subject listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM- D total 
score at Day 15. This will be analyzed using a mixed effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, stratification factor, 
assessment time point, an d time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory 
variables will be treated as fixed effects. All post -baseline time points will be included in the 
model. The main comparison will be between SAGE-217 and placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares [LS] means, 95% confidence intervals, and p-
values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -subject errors. If there is a convergence issue with  the unstructured covariance 
model, Toeplitz compound symmetry or Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be 
used, following this sequence until convergence is achieved. If the model still does not converge 
with AR(1) structure, no results wil l be reported. The sandwich estimator for the variance 
covariance matrix will be derived, using the EMPIRICAL option in the PROC MIXED statement 
in SAS.  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM- D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score, SF -36v2 score, PHQ-9 score, sleep diary endpoints (eg, sleep 
latency ( SL), total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset ( WASO) ), ISI score and selected 
individual items and/or subscale scores in HAM -D for change from baseline.  
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM- D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM-D total score) and HAM- D 
remission (defined as HAM-D total score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as 
explanatory variables. The comparison of interest will be the difference  between SAGE -217 and 
matching placebo at the 15-day time point. Model-based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p-values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analysis of CGI-I response including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, stratification factor, assessment time point, and time point-by-
treatment as explanatory variables.  
 
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerab ility of study drug will be evaluated by incidence of AEs/SAEs , vital signs, 
clinical laboratory evaluations, and 12 -lead ECG. Suicidality will be monitored by the C- SSRS. 
Potential withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of SAGE -217 will be assessed usi ng the 
PWC -20. Safety data will be listed by subject and summarized by treatment group. All safety 
summaries will be performed on the Safety Set.  Where applicable, ranges of potentially clinical 
significant (PCS) values are provided in the SAP.

All medi
cations taken within 30 days prior to signing the ICF  through the duration of the study 
will be recorded . In addition, all psychotropic medications taken 6 months prior to Screening  will 
be recorded . Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the start of study drug will be 
denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the study drug and continuing 
beyond the initiation of the study drug or those medications started at the same time or after the 
initiation of the study drug will be denoted “Concomitant” (ie, those with a start date on or after 
the first dose of study drug, or those with a start date before the first dose of study drug that are ongoing or with a stop date on or after the first dose of study drug).  
Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as 
defined above. If medication dat es are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by subject, start date, and verbatim 
term.  
13.6.7. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Sc ale 
Suicidality data collected on the C -SSRS at baseline and by visit during the Treatment Period

treatment. Listings will include all data by subject. 
  
 
 
 
13.8. Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming a two-sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 399 evaluable subjects would provide 
90% power to detect a placebo-adjusted treatment difference of approximately 4 points in the 
primary endpoint, change from bas eline in HAM -D total sco re at Day 15, assuming SD of 
10 points. Assuming an 11% dropout rate and a 1:1:1 randomization ratio within each stratum 
(antidepressant use at baseline, yes or no), approximately 450 total randomized subjects will be 
required to obtain 399 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects are defined as those random ized 
subjects who receive study drug and have valid baseline and at least 1 post- baseline HAM- D 
assessment. Additional subjects may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 11%.

Protocol 217- MDD-301 Summary of Changes         Sage Therapeutics  
Amendment # 4, Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL  
 1 Protocol 217 -MDD-301 Amendment 4 
Date of Amend ment: 25  March  2019 
A Phase 3, Multicenter, Double -Blind, Randomized, Placebo -Controlled Study Evaluating 
the Efficacy of SAGE -217 in the Treatment of Adult Subjects with Major Depressive 
Disorder  
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The purpose for this protocol amendment is to increase the Montgomery- Åsberg  Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS) score required for entry into the study and include a m inimum total 
score for the 17- item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) required for entry into the 
study. These changes are a result of a blinded data review  during which it was discovered  that a 
substantial number of subjects have entered the stu dy with Day 1 HAM- D scores <22 , with some 
as low as 13, which do not correlate with the intended severity of depression to be treated in this 
study.  
A detailed summary of changes is provided in Table  1. Corrections to typographical errors, 
punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting are not detailed  individually, nor are 
administrative updates such as revising the document date, updating the document header and 
version number, and updating the table of contents.

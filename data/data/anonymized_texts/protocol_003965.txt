CONFIDENTIAL1.3 Protocol Amendment Summary of Changes
Protocol Amendment 4 Summary and Rationale
This sect ion describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 4. The 
primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Add fut ility analysis to be performed with the planned interim analysis.
Add precaut ions for photosensit ivity to sunlight.
Update the dose modificat ion gui dance for creatine phosphokinase (CPK )elevat ion to align
with the current Company Core Data Sheet ( CCDS )V3 recommendat ions.
Provi de updated bri gatinib storage conditions.
Add the descriptions of direct -to-patient (DTP) drug delivery  during the pandemic of
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19).
Add criteria to terminate central blinded I ndependent Review Co mmittee (BIRC) assessment
if the primary endpo int is met at the interim analysis (IA) or primary analysis, or not met at the
primary  analysis.
Add descript ion of remote source document verification during the pandemic o f COVID -19.
In this amendment, minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, and administrative changes not 
affect ing the conduct of the study  are included for clarification and administrative purposes only.

Individual Patient’s Study 
Participation
Section 13.1.3.2 Primary  Efficacy 
Endpoint Analyses
Section 13.2 IAA futility analysis will be performed 
with the interim analysis. Due to strategic considerations, a 
futility  analy sis is added to the 
interim analysis so that the study 
could be terminated early if the real 
efficacy of alectinib and brigatinib in 
the stud y populatio n significantly 
deviates from the study assumption.
Section 8.3Recommended Dosing 
and Dose Modification GuidelinesUpdated the creatine phosphokinase
(CPK )dose modification guidance .Alignedprotocol with the current 
CCDS V3 dose modification 
guidance for CPK elevation. 
An analy siswas performed using 
data from Studies 301 and 201 to 
evaluate the relationship of CPK 
increase, brigatinib treatment 
duration and muscular toxicities. The 
results suggested that CPK increase 
was associated with longer duration

Description Rationale
of treatment and did notseem to be 
associated with the frequency of 
muscular toxicity. Also, review of 
individual patient data from Studies 
301 and 201 showed only 1 report of 
patient with a Grade 3 CPK elevation 
as well as a Grade 3 muscular 
toxicity (P referred Term: muscular 
toxic ity). 
Additionally, many of the 49 patients 
from pooled Studies 301 and 201 
with a Grade ≥3 CPK elevation did 
not report a muscular toxicity event 
(any grade or Grade ≥3). 
Based on these analyses, it was 
concluded that the dose modification 
for CPK elevations of Grade 3 and 4, 
without concurrent muscular 
toxicity, is not warranted and 
therefore the guidance was modified 
accordingly. 
Section 8.6Precautions and 
RestrictionsAdded precautions for 
photosensitivity to sunlight.Mitigation of photosensitivity to 
sunlight, which has been observed in 
patients treated with brigatinib .
Section 8.10 Storage, Handling, and 
AccountabilityUpdated the storage condition of 
brigatinib to “Store at controlled 
room temperature of20°C to 25°C 
with excursions permitted be tween 
15°C to30°C. ”Update of the storage condition of 
brigatinib to be consistent with 
Investigational Medicinal Product 
Dossier and other documents.
Section 8.11 Preparation and 
DispensingAdded the description of DTP drug 
delivery during the COVID -19
pandemic .Because of the impact of the 
COVID -19 pandemic ,travel 
restrictions were executed in most of 
the countries participating in the 
study, and some of the study centers 
were temporarily closed. Instructions 
were provided to establish the DTP 
process to facilitate the direct 
delivery of the drugs from the study 
site to the patient ’s home to make 
sure the patients are able to continue 
the treatment without physically 
going to the study center.

Summary of Changes Since the Last Version of the Approved Protocol
Sections Affected by Change Description of Each Change and Rationale
Description Rationale
Section 9.8Posttrea tment Follow -up 
Assessments (Progression -Free 
Survival and Overall Survival) and 
Appendix ASchedule of EventsProvide dclarification that the 
collection of tumor assessment data 
is not required if the patient has 
progressed and has started treatment 
beyond progression during the 
posttreatment follow -up.Although the tumor assessment is 
still a requirement, collection of these 
data is not required if the patient has 
progresse d and has started treatment 
beyond progression.
Section 11.2 IRC Added criteria to terminate BIRC 
assessment if the primary endpoint is 
met at the IA or primary analysis, or 
not met at the primary analysis. Tumo r assessment by BIRC is no 
longer warranted after primary 
analy sis,and assessment of ongoin g 
patients will continue to be 
performed by investigators .
Section 14.1Study -Site Monitoring 
VisitsAdded description of remote source 
document verification during the 
COVID -19 pandemic .Because of the impact of the 
COVID -19 pandemic, travel 
restrictions were executed in most of 
the countri es participating the study ,
and some of the study centers were 
temporarily  closed or limiting 
entrance of nonpatient personnel. 
This made the on -site SDV 
impossible in some of the sites. To
ensure data integrity, remote source 
data verification was allowed and 
conducted in a small number of sites.

Brigatinib (AP26113)
Title of Protocol: A Phase 3 Randomized Open -label 
Study of Brigatinib (ALUNBRIG®) Versus Alectinib 
(ALECENSA®) in Advanced Anaplastic Lymphoma 
Kinase-Positive Non –Small - Cell Lung Cancer Patients 
Who Have Progressed on Crizotinib (XALKORI®)IND No.: 
IND 110,935EudraCT No.:
2018 -001957 -29
Study Number: Brigatinib -3001 Phase: 3
Study Design: 
A phase 3, randomized, open -label, comparative, multicenter, international study of patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase -positive (ALK+) non –small - cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed on crizotinib
Primary Objective:
To compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of alectinib in patients with ALK+ locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC 
who have progressed on crizotinib as evidenced by progression -free survival (PFS) as assessed by Response 
Evaluatio n Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1.
Secondary Objectives:
1.To compare the efficacy of brigatinib to that of alectinib as evidenced by overall survival (OS), PFS as assessed
by the investigator, objective response rate (ORR), time to response, and duration of response (DOR) (all as
assessed by RECIST v1.1).
2.To compare the efficacy of brigatinib in the central nervous syste m (CNS)to that of alectinib as evidenced by
intracranial objective response rate (iORR), intracranial duration of response (iDOR), and time to intracranial
progressive disease (iPD) without prior systemic progression as assessed by modified RECIST criteria .
3.To assess the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in comparison with alectinib.
4.To collect plasma concentration -time data for brigatinib to contribute to population pharmacokinetic (PK)
analy ses.
5.To assess patient -reported symptoms and health- related quality of life (HRQoL) with the European Organization
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire -Core 30 (QLQ -C30) (v3.0) and its
Quality  of Life Lung Cancer Module (QLQ -LC13), in patients treated with brigatinib compared w ith those treated
with alectinib.
Exploratory Objectives: 
1.To compare the efficacy in the CNS of brigatinib to that of alectinib as evidenced by iORR, iDOR, and time to
iPD, per the Response Assessment in Neuro -Oncology Brain Metastases (RANO -BM) criteria.
2. T o explore the molecular determinants of efficacy and safety with brigatinib and alectinib.
3.To evaluate health resource utilization.
4.To use patient reported outcomes to assess morbidity related to CNS symptoms.
Subject Population: Adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC w hose disease has progressed 
on crizotinib.
Number of Subjects:
Approximately 246 expected Number of Sites: 
100-120 globally.

CONFIDENTIALDose Level(s):
Arm A: Brigatinib 180 mg once daily (QD) with a 7 -day 
lead-in at 90mg QD. Brigatinib can be taken with or 
without food.
Arm B: Alectinib 600 mg orally twice daily with food.Route of Administration:
Oral
Duration of Treatment:
Patients will continue to be treated with brigatinib or 
alectinib until they experience obje ctive disease 
progression by the investigator’s assessment per RECIST 
v1.1 or until any other discontinuation criterio n is met. 
Continuation of brigatinib and alectinib beyond 
progression is permitted, at the investigator’s discretion, 
if there is evidence of continued clinical benefit.Period of Evaluation: 
The total estimated duration of the study is 
approximately 5 years, including approximately 2 years 
to accrue patients, with approximately 3 years for 
treatment and follow -up of the last patient. 
Main Criteria for Inclusion:
Male or female, aged 18 years or older or of local legal adult age.
Have histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IIIB (locally advanced or recurrent) or stage IV NSCLC.
Must meet one of the following criteria:
–Have documentatio n of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) rearrangement by a positive result from the Vysis 
ALK Break -Apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Probe Kit or the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx 
Assay  or Foundation Medicine’s FoundationOne CDx.
–Have doc umented ALK rearrangement by a different test and be able to provide a tumor sample to the central 
laborato ry. (Note: central laboratory ALK rearrangement testing results are not required to be obtained before 
randomization.)
Had progressive disease while on crizotinib, as assessed by the investigator or treating physician. (Note: crizotinib 
does not need to be the last therapy a patient received. The patient may have received chemotherapy as his/her last 
systemic anticancer therapy.)
Treatment with crizoti nib for at least 4 weeks before progression.
Have had no other ALK inhibitor other than crizotinib.
Have had no more than 2 prior regimens of systemic anticancer therapy in the locally advanced or metastatic 
setting (other than crizotinib).

CONFIDENTIALSafety Endpoints:
Safety assessments will include physical and laboratory examinations, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Adverse 
events will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03.
Exploratory Endpoints:
1.CNS efficacy outcomes as assessed by the BIRC per RANO -BM crit eria (iORR, iDOR, and time to iPD).
2.Molecular determinants of efficacy and safety with brigatinib and alectinib.
3.HRQoL measured by EuroQoL –5 Dimensions –5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) questionnaires.
4.Items from the EORTC Quality of Life Brain Cancer Module (QLQ -BN20) used to assess morbidity related to 
CNS symptoms.
5.To evaluate health resource utilization.
Statistical Considerations:
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a 2 -sided stratified log- rank test (stratification 
factors: presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline [yes vs no] and best prior response to crizotinib therapy as 
assessed by th e investigator [complete response/partial response vs any other response/status unknown]) to compare 
BIRC -assessed PFS of patients randomized to brigatinib with the BIRC -assessed PFS of patients randomized to 
alectinib. The overall (2 -sided) type I error r ate will be controlled at 0.05. The primary analysis will be based on the 
intent -to-treat population. The Kaplan Meier (K -M) survival curves and K -M estimates (if estimable), along with their 
2-sided 95% CIs, will be provided for each treatment group. Addi tionally, hazard ratios will be estimated using the 
stratified Cox regression model with the stratification factors.
The interim analysis (IA) for efficacy and futility will be performed after the first 115 events have been observed, and 
the final analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed after 164 events have been observed. An 
O’Brien -
Fleming Lan -DeMets alpha spending function will be used to control the overall alpha level at 0.05 2 -sided. 
A gamma spending function will be used for the futility s topping boundary. Futility is nonbinding. OS, the key 
secondary endpoint, will be formally tested for statistical significance only once when PFS per BIRC is statistically 
significant. 
Further details of statistical analyses including the data handling ru les will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.
Sample Size Justification: 
For the purposes of this sample size calculation, the median PFS for alectinib is estimated as 9 months and the PFS for 
brigatinib is estimated to be 15 months on the basis of the outcomes observed in previous single -arm studies. 
Approximately 246 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive brigatinib or alectinib. A total of 164 events 
(progression or death among the randomized patients) will provide 90% power t o detect a 6 -month improvement in 
PFS (hazard ratio=0.60). This power projection is based on a 2-sided log -rank test, and is controlled at the 2 - sided 0.05 
level, adjusting for the proposed IAplan. The number of events is fixed, but the enrollment number may change based 
on an assessment of the overall event rate pooled across treatment groups before the close of enrollment.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
4.1.1 Epidemiology and Pathology
Lung cancer is one of the most commo n cancers in the world —1.8 millio n new cases in 2012 or 
12.9% of all new cancers worldwide [
1]. Globally, lung cancer accounted for 1.6 millio n cases and 
1.4 millio n deaths in 2008 [
2]. It is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US) and 
in the Euro pean Unio n (EU). In the US, an estimated 234,030 new cases of lung cancer will be 
diagnosed by the end o f 2018, and 154,050 deaths are estimated to occur due to the disease [3]. In 
the EU, lung cancer is ranked as the fourth most frequent cancer; approximately 313,000 new 
cases were diagnosed in 2012 with 268,000 deaths in that year [
1]. Five -year survival rates remain 
low: 17.7% and 13% in the US and Europe, respectively  
[4,5]. In Japan, lung cancer is ranked as 
the third most frequent cancer; approximately 113,000 new cases were diagnosed in 2012 and 
approximately  71,500 deaths in that y ear (ganj oho.jp/reg_stat/statistics/index.html, Accessed 
07March 2018 [in Japanese]). Most  lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and about 
78% of newly diagnosed patients have regional/distant disease [1,6] .
Historically, l ung cancers have been stratified on the basis o f histol ogic criteria and are generally 
divided into 2 categories: small -cell lung cancer and no n
–small -cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
NSCLC is the most prevalent histologic class, accounting for more than 80% of all lung cancers 
[
7,8], and includes a number of subt ypes such as adenocarcino ma, squamous cell carcino ma, large 
cell carcino ma, and bronchio loalveo lar carcino ma [
9]. More recently, attention has turned to 
stratifying pat ients with lung cancer on the basis o f molecular alterations since it has beco me clear 
that histol ogically  identical tumors are driven by different oncogenes and are therefore likel y to 
respond different ly to therapeutic intervent ion, such as therapies directed at epithelial growth 
factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutant, ALK receptor ty
rosine kinase ( ALK) rearranged, ROS 
proto -oncogene 1, receptor ty rosine kinase ( ROS1 ) rearranged, or B- Raf p roto-oncogene, 
serine/threonine kinase ( BRAF ) V600E mutant NSCLC. The focus herein is on NSCLC that 
contain oncogenic rearrangements in the ALK gene, and the role of brigat inib, a novel small 
molecule inhibitor, in the treatment of anaplast ic lympho ma kinase -positive(ALK+) NSCLC. 
4.1.2 ALK+ NSCLC
Anaplast ic lympho ma kinase (ALK) is a ty rosine kinase encoded on chromoso me 2 and is 
primarily invo lved in developmental processes and expressed at low levels in adults [10]. The first 
genet ic rearrangement of ALK seen in NSCLC involved a fusio n between the echinoderm 
microtubule associated protein like 4 gene ( EML4) and the ALK tyrosine kinase dom ain. 
EML4 -ALK has the capacit y to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous 
xenografts to induce tumor format ion [
11]. Since then, a number of addit ional ALK fusio n 
partners have been described in NSCLC that are be lieved to result in aberrant signaling and 
oncogenic transformat ion [12,13] .

CONFIDENTIALEstimates of the frequency o f ALKrearrangement in the overall populat ion of pat ients with 
NSCLC range from 2% to 7% [14,15] , which represent, based on proportionalit y of total  
popul ations in the US and EU, approximately 7000 to 25,000 patients in the US and 5800 to 
20,000 patients in the EU with ALK+ NSCLC in 2016. ALK rearrangements are more common 
among pat ients with adenocarcino ma histol ogy, pati ents who have never smoked, and patients 
who have wild -type EGFR and KRAS proto
-oncogene, GTPase (KRAS ) [10]. 
4.1.3 Current Treatment for ALK+ NSCLC
While the standard treatment algorithm for patients with unselected NSCLC has historically 
involved front line treatment with chemotherapy, recent clinical trials have demo nstrated that
patients wi th ALK+ l ocally  advanced or m etastati c NSCLC respond well to treatment with the 
ALK inhibitors (crizotinib, alectinib, and cerit inib). Crizotinib received accelerated approval fro m 
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 on the basis of resul ts from 2single -arm 
studi es [
16]. The efficacy of crizotinib has been confirmed in a randomized study  of crizotinib 
versus chemotherapy  [
16,17] .
ALK -dependent mechanisms o f resistance, observed in approximately 30% of pat ients [
18], 
include the acquisit ion of secondary mutations in ALK that interfere with crizotinib binding, 
and/or amplification of the ALK fusio n gene. More than 10 secondary  mutations in ALK have been 
associ ated wi th crizotinib resistance in patients, with the most commo n being L1196M and 
G1269A [
19,20] . The central nervous system (CNS) is the first site of progression in 
approximately  50% of  patients treated with crizotinib [21,22] , suggesting inadequate penetration 
of crizotinib into the brain (ie, pharmaco logic failure) as the primary  cause of  resistance in these 
patients. Therefore, an ALK inhibitor that can overcome secondary  resistance m utations in ALK, 
has adequate penetration into the CNS, and is less suscept ible to pharmaco logic failure, m ay be 
requi red to ove rcome resistance.
Recent ly, 2 other ALK inhibitors, cerit inib [23]and al ectinib [24], have beco me available for 
patients wi th NSCLC wit h ALK rearrangements. Both drugs are effect ive in pat ients previously 
treated with crizotinib. Cerit inib demo nstrated significant ly improved progressi on-free survival 
(PFS) vs chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR] 0.55) [25]whereas alect inib demo nstrated significant ly 
improved PFS vs crizotinib (HR 0.34 -0.47) [
26,27] in treatment naïve ALK+ advanced NSCLC. 
ALK secondary  mutations a ssoci ated wi th clinical  resistance to ceri tinib and alect inib have also 
been ident ified, including L1152R and F1174C/V for ceritinib, I1171N/T/S for alect inib, and 
G1202R for both agents [
17,26-29] . 
More recently, the invest igational agent lorlat inib has been evaluated in a phase 1/2 study showing
responses after ≥1 prior ALK t yrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) (25% [11 of 44] object ive response 
rate [ORR] in pat ients with 2 pri
or ALK T KI and 31% [4 of 13] ORR in pat ients with 3 prior ALK 
TKI). The most common treatment -related adverse events (AEs) wer e hypercho lesterol emia (90%) 
and hypertriglyceridemia (72%) [28].

CONFIDENTIAL4.1.4 Unmet Medical Need
Significant progress has been made with incorporation of ALK TKIs for treatment of ALK+ 
NSCLC, but eventually almo st all pat ients progress after crizotinib wit h over 50% of these patients 
developin g brain metastases. The impact of progressio n is seen in the qualit y of life o f patients as 
well as their survival. Despite 2 ALK inhibitors (ie, cerit inib and alect inib) being available for 
crizotinib failures, the majorit y of patients currently treated w ith ALK inhibitors in second- line 
therapy  progress wi thin 1 y ear. ALK secondary  mutations associ ated wi th clinical resistance and 
treatm ent failure to crizotinib, cerit inib, and alect inib have been i dentified. The alternat ive 
treatm ents for these pat ients include chemotherapy and checkpo int inhibitors (PD -1 or PD -L1 
antibody ). The efficacy o f platinum doublet chemo therapy  is not impacted by prior TKI treatment; 
however, the benefits of doublet therapy  are limi ted wi th response rates about 30% and median 
PFS about 4 m onths [29]. Checkpo int inhibitors have recent ly become available as treatment for 
NSCLC. These agents are particularly effective in patients whose tumors over -express PD -L1 and 
have less benefit in pat ients with EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangements [
30], possibly related to 
the low m utation burden in this populat ion. Of note, patients with ALK+ NSCLC are often 
nonsmokers, which may help to explain the low mutation burden [31].
Clinicians treating patients with ALK+ NSCLC with metastatic disease need to know the benefit, 
in months, of one next generation ALK inhibitor versus another in terms of PFS, time to 
intracranial  progressi on wi thout pri or systemic progressio n (iPD), durati on of  response (DOR), 
and intracranial duration o f response (iDOR). These measures represent time free of int ervent ions 
such as radiotherapy or surgery . The likelihood of response as assessed by PFS as assessed by the 
investigator, ORR, and intracranial object ive response rate (iORR) are also important factors in 
clinical decisio n making. Given that the majorit y of these patients will have had CNS metastases, 
the intracranial data obtained from this study  will be of particular value in determining the best 
therapeuti c opti on for that large subset of patients with brain metastases present at the init iation of 
therapy. This study (the primary analysis) will provide the CNS data to address this unmet medica l 
need. 
Brigatinib
Brigatinib (AP26113) is a novel, orally administered TKI discovered and developed by ARIAD 
Pharmaceut icals, Inc (ARIAD; Cambridge, Massachusetts ), a wholly owned subsidiary o f Takeda 
Pharmaceut ical Co mpany Limited. Primary targets are activated, mutant forms o f ALK and ROS1 , 
which play  important rol es in NSCLC and other cancers. 
A ser ies of in vitro and in vivo studies demo nstrated that brigat inib potently inhibited ALK activit y 
and pro liferat ion in ALK+ cell lines and exhibited >100 -fold select ivity over ALK -negat ive lines. 
In clinical studies, brigat inib has an acceptable safety profile at the recommended dose of 90 mg 
once daily  (QD) f or 7 day s, then 180 m g QD, continuously (hereinafter mentioned as 90 mg QD 
→180 mg QD). Brigat inib at this dose level exhibited substantial efficacy in pat ients with ALK+ 
NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. In 110 patients, the confirmed response rate was 56.4% 
(62 of 110, 97.5% CI: 45.2, 67.0) by Independent Review Committee (IRC) assessment. The IRC 
assessed median DOR was 15.7 months (95% CI: 12.8, 21.8 event rate: 54.8%) and median PFS

CONFIDENTIALwas 16.7 months (95% CI: 11.6, 21.4, event rate: 49.1%). High IRC -assess ed iORR (66.7%, 12/18, 
95% CI: 41.0, 86.7) with a median 16.6 month (95% CI: 3.7, not reached) iDOR was also observed 
in patients with measurable baseline brain metastases by IRC (ALTA study , data cut- off: 29 
September 2017, data on file). On 28 April 2017 , the FDA granted accelerated approval to 
brigatinib for the treatment of pat ients with metastati c ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or 
are intolerant of crizotinib. 
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
Crizotinib has been approved by  both the FDA and Europea n Medicines Agency (EMA) for 
first-line treatment of advanced ALK+ NSCLC, after 2 phase 3 clinical studies demo nstrated a 
significant PFS benefit over chemotherapy [32,33] . Since crizotinib was approved for first -line 
treatm ent of advanced ALK+ NSCLC, several newer ALK inhibitors with greater efficacy and 
tolerabilit y have been developed and approved for this pat ient populat ion. 
The newer ALK inhibitors, ceritinib, alect inib, and brigat inib, have been shown to be of benefit in 
a postcrizotinib setting. Cerit inib received accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2014, and was 
approved in the EU in May 2015, in patients previously treated with crizotinib [
34-36] . In a phase 
2 study  of ceritinib, pati ents who had progressed on crizotinib showed an ORR of 38.6% and a 
median PFS of 5.7 months [
35]. In patients with intracranial brain metastases, the iORR was 33% 
[
35]. Alectinib was granted accelerated approval in the US in December 2015 for patients with 
ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant to crizotinib. In 2017, alect inib received 
condi tional market ing authorization fro m the EMA in pat ients with ALK+ NSCLC previously 
treate d with crizotinib. In 1 clinical studies, alect inib has been shown to be well tolerated by  
patients. The ORR based on IRC assessment was 38% and 44% in studies 1 and 2, respectively 
[
37-39] . Median PFS was approximately 9 months [ 38]. In patients with intracran ial CNS 
metastases (N = 51), the iORR was 61%, with a median duration of CNS response of 9.1 months 
[
24]. Brigat inib received accelerated approval by the FDA in April 2017 for the treatment of 
patients wi th metastati c ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on or are intolerant of crizotinib. 
Brigatinib’s accelerated approval was based on efficacy seen in a 2 -arm,open -label, mult icenter 
trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] [ALTA]). In this study , pati ents wi th ALK+ NSCLC who had progressed on 
crizotinib demo nstrated an IRC assessed ORR of 51% in patients given 90 mg QD (Arm A; 
N
=112) and 55% in pat ients who were given 180 mg QD w ith a 7 -day lead in at 90 m g QD 
(Arm B; N =110). The IRC- assessed median DOR was 13.8 months in Ar m A and 14.8 months in 
Arm B. IRC -assessed PFS was 9.2 months in Arm A and 16.7 months in Arm B. In patients with 
measurable brain metastases, the iORR was 5 0% (N =26) in Arm A and 67% (N =18) in Arm B, 
and median iDOR was not reached in Arm A and was 16.6 months in Arm B. Both doses were well 
tolerated in this study . Based on these results, the recommended dosing regimen o f brigatinib is 
180 m g QD wi th 7-day lead-in at 90 mg QD.

There i s a need for a head- to-head comparison of the newer ALK inhibitors in this pat ient 
popul ation. This study will provide a direct comparison of brigat inib wit h alectinib. This study will 
be conducted in the postcrizotinib setting rather than in th e ALK inhibi tor naïve setting, because 
the sam ple size required for a head -to-head study in the first -line setting would be prohibit ive. 
Alect inib has been chosen as the co mparator, because it is more widely prescribed than cerit inib or 
lorlatinib. Data al so suggest alect inib has the best PFS in this setting; alt hough at this time, 
lorlatinib data is st ill maturing.

6.0 STUDY DESIGN
6.1 Overview of Study Design
This is a phase 3, randomized, open -label, comparative, mult icenter, international study  in which 
patients wi th ALK+ NSCLC who have progressed on crizotinib wi ll be rando mized in a 
1:1fashion to receive brigat inib in Arm A or alect inib in Arm  B. Pati ents will  be stratified by the 
presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline (Yes versus No) and best prior response to 
crizotinib therapy  as assessed by the invest igator (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR] 
vs any other response/status unknown). 
Patients will be treated on each arm unt il they experience progressive disease (PD) assessed by the 
investigator or intolerable toxicit y, or until any other discont inuat ion criterion is met. On each arm,  
treatm ent will be given cont inuously. For logist ical convenience, every 28 days is defined as 
1cycle. Continuat ion of study  drug bey ond progressio n is permitted, if there is potential for 
continued clinical b enefi t (eg, absence of clinical symptoms or signs, indicating clinically  
significant disease progression requiring alternat ive systemic ant icancer therapy; no decline in 
perform ance status; absence of rapid disease progressio n or threat to vital organs or critical 
anatomical sites [eg, respiratory  failure due to tumor compressio n, spinal cord compressio n] 
requi ring urgent use of alternat ive ant icancer therapy; and no significant, unacceptable or 
irreversible toxicit ies related to study  treatm ent).

patients wi th ALK+ l ocally  advanced or m etastati c NSCLC who have progressed on crizotinib as 
evidenced by BIRC -assessed PFS. An interim analysis (IA) to as sess the primary endpo int will be 
conducted once 70% of PFS events have been observed. It is expected that enrollment will be 
completed before reaching IA. 
AEs will be assessed fro m the time a patient signs the informed consent form (ICF) unt il 30 days 
after last dose of the study drug a patient receives. Patients’ signs and symptoms, laboratory values, 
vital signs, ECGs, and any other relevant special examinat ions as clinically indicated will be 
obtained to evaluate the safet y and tol erabili ty of brigatinib. For patients randomized to the 
brigatinib arm of the study (Arm A), sparse PK samples will be co llected during the study to 
measure plasma concentrations of brigat inib as outlined in Appendix A, PK Sam pling Schedule. 
Before randomizat ion, ALK status must be confirmed with documentation fro m a pat hology  report 
of ALK+ tum or tissue. If the determinat ion of ALK posit ivity was m ade by  a non -FDA -approved 
test, tumor tissue (archival or new biopsy) must be submitted to a central laboratory  for ALK
rearrangement testing. Central laboratory  resul ts of ALK testing are not required to be available 
before rando mizat ion. Given that all pat ients are required to ha ve received therapy with crizotinib, 
it is not deem ed necessary  that central  laboratory  tests be in agreement with local ALK tests (i t is 
anticipated that the central laboratory  will have an intrinsic false negative rate).
For pati ents f or whom  there i s available form alin-fixed, paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue 
that was acquired after progression on crizotinib, a sample will be requested for exploratory  
molecular genet ic analysis. In patients without such tissue available, an optional biopsy for 
explor atory  molecular genetic analysis may  be obtained during screening if the patient has an 
amenable lesio n. An optional biopsy will be obtained at the time of disease progression for patients 
who consent to the procedure and genetic test ing of the sample. FFP E tumor tissue will be used for 
exploratory  molecular genetic analysis. For all patients, blood samples will be obtained for 
exploratory  biomarker studi es, including mo lecular genetic analysis, according to the Schedule of 
Events 
(Appendix A).
Toxicit y will be evaluated according to NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effect ive date 
14June 2010 [40].
6.2 Number of Patients
The expected number of pat ients is 246 enro lled at 100 to 120 sites globally (a patient is 
considered to be enro lled in the study  once the ICF is signed, all screening evaluat ions are 
completed and the patient has been rando mized).

radiological disease progression is observed. All new systemic ant icancer therapies init iated in the 
follow-up period should be reported.
An IA for efficacy and fut ilityto assess the primary  endpoint will be conducted once 70% of PFS 
events have been observe d. This corresponds to 115 PFS events. 
The primary analys is for the primary endpoint will be conducted when 164 events have been 
observed, which is approximately  30 m onths after the first patient has enro lled. 
The final analysis for OS and HRQoL endpoint s will occur approximately 5 years after the first 
patient has enrolled .The study  will end after the final analysis has been performed. The sponsor 
may also terminate the study  prem aturely  due to safet y or administration reasons.
This study  will begin to enroll patients in May 2019. The overall timeframe will depend upon the
actual enro llment rate and event rate.

approv e the case and an informed consent shall be obtained fro m the pati ent.
Missed Doses of Either Brigat inib or Alect inib
A missed dose is defined as a dose not taken within 6 hours of the intended scheduled 
administration. Missed doses should be recorded in a n appropriate source record (eg, clinic chart, 
patient diary  card) and study  drug administration electronic case report form (eCRF). If a dose of 
study  drug i s missed or vomit ing occurs after taking a dose, do not administer an addit ional dose. 
The patient shall take the next dose of study  drug at the scheduled time.
8.3 Recommended Dosing and Dose Modification Guidelines
BRIGATINIB RECOMMENDED DOSING
Brigatinib will be administered orally at a dose of 90 mg QD for the first 7 days. Patients who have 
tolerated the 90 mg starting dose on Days 1 through 7 of Cycle 1 will be expected to increase their 
dose to 180 mg QD continuously, beginning on Day  8. Bri gatinib may  be taken wi th or wi thout 
food at  approximately the same t ime every day , and pati ents will take their prescribed dose with 
water (recommended 240 mL). 
The patient’s daily  dose of bri gatinib shoul d not be increased to 180 mg if any of the fo llowing 
AEs are experienced during treatment at 90 mg QD:
Intersti tial lung disease/pneumo nitis (any grade).
Symptom atic bradycardia (Grade 2 or greater).
Grade 2 or higher visual disturbance.
Any other Grade 3 or higher adverse reaction.
Once the decisio n not to increase the dose to 180 mg QD is made, it should not be increased in the 
future even if the AE has reso lved.
The invest igator should carefully evaluate the safety o f the pati ents before m aking the decisio n to 
escalate the dose to 180 mg QD.
Brigatinib Dose Modifications for Adverse Reactions
The allowable daily doses of brigat inib in this study  are 180 m g, 120 m g, 90 m g, and 60 m g. In 
cases where pat ients are intolerant of their current dose, they  will have the opti on to reduce their 
dose, in accordanc e with the dose -reduction scheme shown in Table 8.a.

Reintroducing Brigatinib After Dose Interruption
If brigatinib treatment interruption lasts ≥14 days, and prior dose was >90 mg QD, patients should 
resum e treatm ent at 90 m g QD f or 7 day s, before escalat ing dose back to their previous treatment 
dose, 120 mg QD or 180 mg QD. The dose should not be escalated higher than the prior dose level 
before treatment interrupt ion. If an AE does not resolve to baseline after dose interruption for more 
than 28 days, the sponsor’s medical mo nitor must be contacted before the study  drug can be 
resum ed.
Re-escalation of Brigatinib After Dose Reduction
Re-escalat ion after dose modifi cation for AEs i s discouraged. However, if in the opinio n of the 
treating invest igator re -escalat ion is warranted, this must be undertaken after consultation with the 
sponsor. To be a candidate for re -escalat ion, the AE that led to dose modificat ion must not have 
recurred, and no other AEs of Grade 3 or 4 must have been observed during the preceding 28 days.
Pulmonary Adverse Reactions and Other AEs
During early clinical development of brigatinib, moderate and severe pulmo nary AEs (eg, dyspnea, 
hypoxia, cou gh, pneumonia, and pneumo nitis) were observed shortly after init iation o f the drug in 
a subset of patients. These events were termed early onset pulmo nary events (EOPE).
In the ALTA study  (AP26113-13- 201) for bri gatinib, as of 21 February 2017, of 219 treated 
patients, there were 14 cases of EOPE (6.4%). All cases occurred at a dose of 90 mg QD. No 
EOPEs were ident ified after escalation to 180 mg QD in the 90 mg QD →180 mg QD dose group, 
or after re -initiation following study  treatm ent interrupti on. Medi an time of onset of EOPE was 
Day 2 (range: 1 -9). Eleven of these 14 cases were reported as SAEs. Seven pat ients had events that 
were Grade ≥3, all o f whom permanent ly discontinued brigat inib because of these events. One 
patient had an EOPE that was Grade 5 (pneumonia).
Pulmo nary events occurring within the first 7 day s of treatment, including, but not limited to, 
dyspnea, hypoxia, dry  cough, chest tightness, and presumpt ive lung infection (pneumo nia) should 
be monitored and reported. To reiterate, some even ts occur after a single dose of brigat inib, and 
physicians should be aware of this possibilit y and di scuss i t with patients. Newly developed or 
worsening of pulmo nary symptoms in the first week of study  drug administration, specifically  
with hypoxia and gr ound gl ass opaci ty on radi ographic imaging indicat ive of interst itial lung 
disease or pneum onitis, coul d suggest a rel ationship to brigatinib after other etio logies, including 
pulmo nary embo lism, rapi d disease progressi on, and infect ious pneumo nia are rul ed out. If no 
evidence of other etiology  is ident ified, a causal relationship to brigat inib may be considered.
The m anagement of new or worsening pulmo nary symptoms wi thin the first 7 day s of bri gatinib

8.6 Precautions and Restrictions
Brigatinib induces CYP3A in vitro and may decrease concentrations of CYP3A substrates.
Coadministration of brigat inib wit h CYP3A substrates, including hormonal c ontraceptives, can 
resul t in decreased concentrations and loss of efficacy  of CYP3A substrates. Brigat inib may also 
induce other enzymes and transporters (eg, CYP2C, P -glycoprotein [P -gp]) vi a the same 
mechanism responsible for induct ion of CYP3A (eg, preg nane X receptor activat ion). Therefore, 
additional mo nitoring should be considered for patients receiving substrates of these enzymes and 
transporters with a narrow therapeuti c index during treatment with brigat inib as their effect iveness 
may be reduced.

CONFIDENTIALBrigatinib is an in vitro inhibitor of P -gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic cat ion 
transporter 1 (OCT1), mult idrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 (MATE1) and 2K (MATE2K). 
Patients shoul d be cl osely  monitored when brigat inib is coadministere d with substrates of these 
transporters with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, dabigatran, methotrexate) as their 
plasma concentrations may be increased.
Photosensit ivity to sunlight has occurred in pat ients treated with brigatinib. Patients should be 
advised to avoid prolonged sun exposure while taking brigat inib, and for at least 5 day s after 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent. When outdoors, patients should be advised to wear a hat and 
protective clothing, and to use a broad -spectrum ultraviolet A (UVA)/ ultravio let B (UVB) 
sunscreen and lip balm (SPF [sun protecti on factor] 30) to help protect against potential sunburn. 
For severe photosensit ivity react ions (Gr ade ≥3), bri gatinib should be withheld unt il recovery to 
baseline. The dose should be modified accordingly (see the “other”AE in the dose modification 
guidelines in Table 8.b).
8.6.1 Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, and Contraception
8.6.1.1 Brigatinib
It is not known what effects brigat inib has on human pregnancy  or devel opment of the embry o or 
fetus. Therefore, female pat ients parti cipating in this study  shoul d avoi d beco ming pregnant, and 
male pat ients should avo id impregnat ing a female partner. Nonsterilized female pat ients of 
reproducti ve age and male pat ients should use effective methods of contraception through defined 
periods d uring and after study  treatm ent as specified below.
There are no data regarding the secret ion of brigatinib in human milk or its effects on the breast fed 
infant or milk production. Because of the potential for adverse react ions in breastfed infants, 
female patients shoul d not breastfeed during treatment with brigatinib and for 1 week following 
the final dose.
Female pat ients must m eet 1 of  the fo llowing:
Postmenopausal  for at l east 1 year before the screening visit, or
Surgically sterile, or

Female Patients
Based on animal studies and its mechanism of action, alect inib can cause fetal harm when 
administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available data on alect inib use in pregnant women. 
Female patients of reproductive potential should use effect ive contraception during treatment with 
alectinib and for 1 week after the final dose.
There are no data on the presence of alect inib or its metabo lites in human milk, the effects of 
alectinib on the breast fed infant, or its effects on milk production. Because o f the potenti al for 
serious adverse reactions in breast fed infants from alect inib, advise a lactating wo man not to 
breast feed during treatment with alect inib and for 1 week after the final dose.
Male Patients
Based on genotoxicit y findings, male patients with female partners of reproductive potential 
should use effect ive contraception during treatment with alect inib and for 3 months fo llowing the

CONFIDENTIAL9.3.1 Informed Consent
Each patient must provide written informed consent before any  study -requi red procedures are 
conducted, unless those procedures are performed as part of the patient’s standard care.
Patient Dem ographi cs
The date of birth (outside European Economic Area) or age (in European Economic Area), race, 
ethnicit y (opti onal depending on count ry), and sex of the pati ent are to be recorded during 
screening.
9.3.2 Screening
Screening assessments must be performed no more than 28 day s before Cy cle 1 Day  1, wi th the 
exception of tumor imaging assessment, where the allowable window is 21 days before first dose 
of study  drug (Cy cle 1, Day  1) and pregnancy  testing which m ust be com pleted wi thin 7 days of 
Cycle 1 Day  1. However, whenever feasible, baseline imaging should be performed as close as 
possible to Cy cle 1, Day  1. Tum or radi ological imaging generated for the purpose of regular 
medical pract ice before patients sign the ICF can be used as baseline disease assessment provided 
the imaging meets the qualit y and time window required for this study .
Vital signs shoul d be repeated on Cy cle 1, Day  1 before the first dose, regardless of the time fro m 
screening. Physical examinat ion, ECOG performance status assessments, hematology , chemistry , 
insulin, and pregnancy tests do not need to be repeated on Cy cle 1, Day  1 if they  were perform ed 
for screening within 7 days before Cycle 1, Day 1 and, in the opinio n of the invest igator, there is no  
reason to believe they have substant ially changed. The pregnancy test may be repeated at any time 
during the study  if the pati ent or the invest igator has cause to believe that th e pati ent may  be 
pregnant. If screening laboratory  assessments need to be repeated on Cy cle 1, Day  1, the resul t 
shoul d be obtained before the treatment is started.
Any pat ient who i s re-screened after screen failure must, in addit ion to the failed test, r epeat only 
those screening tests that have fallen outside the specified screening period, as outlined in the SOE 
(Appendix A).

Women who are not of childbearing potential (status posthysterectomy, status post –bilateral 
oophorectomy , or postmenopausal [defined as amenorrhea for at least 12 months]) and men do not 
need to have the test performed.
The test must be known to be negative before the study  drug administration and be performed 
within 7 days before first study  drug administrati on (Cycle 1, Day  1).
The pregnancy tests must be a beta -human chorionic gonadotropin test , and either urine or serum 
can be used. Wo men of childbearing potential at study start must also complete the pregnancy test 
once every  12 weeks (3 cy cles) thereafter and at the end

testing should be performed if r ecommended or required per local guidelines or regulat ions.
9.3.16 Disease Assessment
Tumor response assessments will be determined per RECIST v.1.1 by  the invest igator and an 
independent radiological review co mmit tee. Patients m ust have at l east 1 m easurable les ion per 
RECIST v1.1. Previously irradiated lesio ns may not be used for target lesio ns, unless there is 
unambiguous radiological progression after radiotherapy. Brain lesio ns may be used as target 
lesions provi ded they  are ≥10 mm and have not been: 1) previ ously  treated wi th who le brain 
radiation therapy  within 3 m onths, or 2) previously treated by SRS or surgical resect ion.
At screening, disease assessment must include imaging of the chest and abdo men (including 
adrenal glands), using appropriate radio logical procedures (computed tom ography [CT] scans or 
magnet ic resonance imaging [MRI] with contrast, unless contrast media is contraindicated). 
Contrast -enhanced MRI of the brain (such as gadolinium) is required at screening for all pat ients, 
unless medically contraindicated. If contrast for MRI is contraindicated, use CT with contrast. All

using C1D1 as the starting po int (on Day  28 [±7 days] of every  even-numbered cycle), through 
Cycle 12 after the init ial dose of study  drug, and every  3 cycles thereafter until end of treatment. 
More frequent imaging is recommended at any  time if clinically  indicated; confirmat ion of CR or 
PR shoul d be perfor med at least 4 weeks after init ial response. If confirmatory  imaging occurs 
4weeks after the init ial response it is preferred, but not required. that regular imaging resume at 
the original schedule (eg, on Day 28 o f every even cycle or Day 28 of each orig inal 3 -cycle block). 
Imaging assessment will also be performed at end of treatment if more than 4 weeks have passed 
since the l ast imaging assessment. The same imaging modalit y at the same inst itutionshoul d be 
used at each assessment, if possible.
For pat ients who discont inue the study drug because of a reason other than PD by invest igator’s 
assessment, addit ional tumor assessment should be documented, if available, unt il disease 
progression or start of subsequent sy stemic ant icancer therapy. 
9.3.17 Confirmation of ALK Positivity
All patients are required to have documentation of ALK rearrangement before randomizat ion. If 
the docum entati on is a posi tive result from eit her the Vysis ALK Break -Apart FISH Probe Kit or 
the Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay or Foundation M edicine’s Foundat ionOne CDx, then 
confirmat ion by a central laboratory  is not required.
If the patient has documented ALK rearrangement by a different test (other than 1 of the 2 listed 
above), the patient must provide a tumor sample to the central laborat ory before rando mizat ion. A 
pathol ogist shoul d assess the ti ssue sample to ensure adequate tumor tissue is available based on 
the minimum requirements described in the study  manual. (Note: central laboratory  ALK
rearrangement testing results are not requir ed to be obtained before rando mizat ion.)
9.3.18 PK Measurements
Patients randomized to the brigat inib arm o f the study  (Arm  A) must provi de blood samples 
(approximately 3 mL per sample) for measurement of plasma concentrations of brigatinib. Patients 
must be inst ructed not to take the day’s dose of brigatinib unt il after the predose blood sample is 
collected. Predose samples should be collected as close as possible to 24 hours after the prior 
brigatinib dose. The administration date and t ime of the prior 2 brigat inib doses must be recorded. 
On the PK sampling day , the collect ion time of the predose PK sample alo ng with t ime of 
brigatinib dosing should be recorded. Blood samples for the determinat ion of plasma 
concentrations of brigat inib will be co llected as indica ted in Appendix A, PK Sampling Schedule. 
The exact date and time o f each PK sample co llectio n shoul d be recorded.
Plasma concentrations o f brigatinib w ill be measured using a validated liquid chro matography  
tandem -mass spectrometry  assay . Details regarding the preparation, handling, and shipping of the

QLQ -BN20)
The HRQL assessments (EORTC QLQ -C30, QLQ- LC13, and QLQ -BN20) will be completed by  
the pati ent as specified in the Schedule o f Events ( Appendix A). The EORTC QLQ -C30 
incorporates 5 funct ional scales (physical functioning, role funct ioning, em otional functioning, 
cogni tive functioning, and social functioning), 1 global healt h status scale, 3 symptom scales 
(fatigue, nausea and vo miting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, inso mnia, appetite loss, 
constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies).
The l ung cancer specific module QL Q-LC13 co mprises 13 questions assessing lung cancer 
associ ated symptom s (cough, hemopt ysis, dyspnea, and site -specific pain), treatment -related si de 
effects (sore mouth, dy sphagia, peri pheral neuropathy , and al opecia), and use of pain medication. 
This will be administered subsequent to the EORTC QLQ -C30.
To reduce the clinical site and respondent burden, 5 items from the brain cancer module 
QLQ -BN20 will be used to assess morbidit y related to CNS symptoms, including headaches (item 
4), coordination (item 15), and communicat ion deficit (items 11, 12, and 13). This will be 
administered subsequent to the EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LC13.
The time recall period for the instruments is 1 week (the week immediately preceding the 
assessment). These are reliable and valid measures of HRQoL in pat ients with cancer and take 
about 15 minutes to administer. The instruments have been validated and used in many countries.

The end -of-treatm ent visit should be performed within 2 weeks (14 days) of the patient’s last dose 
of study drug or the patient/invest igator decisio n to discontinue study drug, whichever occurs later. 
Physical examinat ions, laboratory  tests (hematol ogy, chemistry , and insulin), and ECG may  be 
omitted if they had been previously performed within 2 weeks since the last asse ssments and if, in 
the invest igator’s judgment, significant change is unlikely.
9.3.25 30 Days After Last Dose
The 30 days after last dose assessments must be performed 30 days (±7 days) after the last dose of 
study  drug. Physical examinations and laboratory  tests (hematology , chemistry , and insulin) can 
be omitted if the visit occurs within 10 days o f the end -of-treatm ent assessment and there have 
been no clinically significant findings. Any new systemic ant icancer therapies that the patient has 
begun receiving s ince the end of treatment should be reported at this visit. For both the 
end-of-treatm ent and 30 day s after l ast dose assessments, informat ion may be collected from tests 
perform ed for the study or as part of the patient’s routine medical care. If the day the patient has the 
last dose equals or is more than 30 day s before the decisio n of permanent discont inuat ion from 
study  treatm ent, the end -of-treatm ent visi t and 30 days after last dose visit can be combined as 1 
visit. If pat ients permanent ly discont inued study  treatm ent before radiological disease progressio n 
is observed, this visit may  occur before the end -of-treatm ent visi t.

CONFIDENTIAL9.3.26 Follow -up Period
The fo llow-up peri od for a pati ent begins after end of treatment (ie, when all study  drug has been 
discontinued) and continues unt il pat ient contact ceases. The fo llow-up assessments 
(ie,contacting the patient for survival and subsequent ant icancer therapy) must be performed 
every 12 weeks (±14 days) after the last dose of the study  treatm ent. The all owable window for 
follow-up assessments is 14 days. All new systemic ant icancer therapies should be reported. Also, 
the EQ -5D- 5L will be obtained in this period every 12 weeks (±14 days) (the questionnaires 
shoul d be administered to patients when they  arrive for their s cheduled visit s, before any  clinical  
measurements, assessments, evaluat ions, or procedures being performed).
9.4 Completion of Study Treatment (for Individual Patients)
For the purpose of analysis, patients will be considered to have co mpleted study  treatm ent once 
they have perm anently discont inued study  drug (either brigat inib or alectinib) because of disease 
progression by  the invest igator’s assessment, intolerance, invest igator discret ion, or if they die 
while on study  treatm ent. 
For vi sit purposes, the end -of-treatm ent visit occurs at the l ast dose of study  drug or when the 
investigator or the patient decide the patient will receive no further study  drug, whichever occurs 
later. 
At 30 days after last dose of study  drug, the patient shall complete all postt reatm ent 
discontinuat ion assessments. If the date the patient has the last dose equals or is more than 30 days 
before the decisio n of permanent discont inuat ion from study  treatm ent is made, the 
end-of-treatm ent visi t and 30 days after last dose visit can be combined as 1 visit. 
9.5 Completion of Study (for Individual Patients)
All patients who have discont inued study drug(s) shall be followed for survival, regardless of the 
reason of discontinuation. The survival fo llow-up will cont inue until the pat ient dies or the study  
ends. Pati ents will be considered to have co mpleted the study  if they died before the time of data 
cut. Pati ents l ost to foll ow-up or who have withdrawn consent before study  com pletion are not 
counted in number of patients completing this stud y.
9.6 Discontinuation of Treatment With Study Drug 
Study  drug m ust be permanent ly discontinued for patients meet ing any o f the following criteria:
PD assessed by the invest igator as defined by RECIST v1.1.
–Note: Treatment of pat ients with brigatinib or alectinib may be continued, despite 
progression by  RECIST v1.1, at the discret ion of the invest igator, if there is st ill evidence 
of clinical benefit. In this scenario, the medical mo nitor shall be contacted to approve these 
cases. Patients shall sign an a dditional ICF before the treatment continues.

Significant protocol  deviat ions that will jeopardize safet y surveilla nce and pose a significant 
threat to the safet y of the pati ent.
Study  terminated by  sponsor.
Withdrawal by subject.
In cases in which patients request to discont inue the study drug, the invest igator should assess 
if this is due to study  drug related toxi city. This electi on is only applicable if the patients are 
not having into lerable toxicit y by invest igators’ medical judgment. Patients who request to 
perm anent ly discont inue the study treatment shall continue to be fo llowed for tum or 
assessment and survival , unless pat ients withdraw consent to participate the study .
By invest igator discret ion it is in the best interests of the patient to discont inue. 
If invest igator discretion is based on intolerable toxicit y, the reason of discont inuat ion shall be 
recorded as due to intolerable toxicit y. Before di scontinuing a patient because i t is in the best 
interests of the patient the invest igator should contact the study  sponsor to di scuss the m atter. 
Lost to follow -up.
Pregnancy.
Other.
Once study drug has been disco ntinued, all study procedures outlined for the end -of-treatm ent visit  
will be co mpleted as specified in the Schedule of Events ( Appendix A). The prima ry reason for 
study  drug di scont inuat ion will be recorded in the eCRF.
9.7 Study Compliance
Patients will  be provi ded a diary  card or equivalent where the date of study  drug administration 
will be recorded. Complete instructions will be provided with the study manual.
Study  drug will be administered or dispensed only to eligible pat ients under the supervisio n of the 
investigator or ident ified subinvest igator(s). The appropriate study personnel will maintain records 
of study  drug recei pt and dispensing.
9.8 Posttrea tment Follow -up Assessments (Progression -Free Survival and Overall 
Survival)
After end of treatment, all pat ients will be fo llowed f or OS until  death or study  end. The survival 
follow-up can be conducted by  remote m ethod (eg, telephone call). At each visit , the survival 
status and informat ion about subsequent anticancer therapy, such as the name, starting and ending 
time and best -known response, will be co llected.
If pat ients discont inue study  treatm ent due to reasons other than disease progression, tumor 
assessment according to the protocol is strongly encouraged to be continued unt il radio logical 
disease progressi on is observed.

10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS
10.1 Definitions
10.1.1 Pretreatment Event Definition
A pretreatment event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient who has signed informed 
consent to participate in a study  but before administrati on of  any study  medicat ion; it does not 
necessarily have to have a causal relationship with study  participati on.
10.1.2 AE Definition
AE m eans any  untoward m edical  occur rence in a patient administered a pharmaceut ical product; 
the untoward medical occurrence does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with this 
treatm ent. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a m edicinal 
(invest igational) product whether or not it is related to the medicinal product. This includes any 
newly occurring event, or a previous condit ion that has increased in severit y or frequency since the 
administration of study  drug.
An abnormal laboratory  value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to 
discontinuat ion or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervent ion, or is considered 
by the investigator to be a clinically significant change fro m baseline.
Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy  under study  does not need to be reported as 
AEs.
AE Severity
The severit y of AEs will be assessed according to the NCI CTCAE v4.03 (see the study manual ). If 
the AE i s not defined in the NCI CTCAE, the investigator will determine the severit y of the AE 
based on the fo llowing definit ions:
Mild (grade 1): The AE is noticeable to the patient but does not interfere with routine activit y.
Moderate (grade 2): T he AE interferes wit h routine activit y but responds to symptomat ic 
therapy  or rest.
Severe (grade 3): The AE significant ly limits the patient’s abilit y to perform routine act ivities 
despite symptomat ic therapy.
Life-threatening (grade 4): The patient is at immediate risk of death.
Death (grade 5): The patient dies as a direct result of the complicat ion or condit ion induced by 
the AE.

CONFIDENTIAL10.1.3 SAE Definition
SAE m eans any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death.
Is life-threatening (refers to a n AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
Requi res inpat ienthospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization (see 
clarificati onin the paragraph in Sect ion 10.2 on planned hospitalizat ions).
Results in persistent or sign ificant disability or incapacity. (Disabilit y is defined as a 
substant ial disrupt ion of a person’s abilit y to conduct normal life functions).
Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect .
Is a medically important event . This refers to an AE that may  not resul t in death, be 
immediately  life threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, 
based on appropriate medical judgment, may  jeopardi ze the pati ent, requi re medical or 
surgi cal interventi on to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above, o r invo lves suspected 
transmissio n via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent. Examples of such medical events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in inpatient hospitalizat ion, or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse; any  organism , virus, or infecti ous parti cle 
(eg,prion protein transmitt ing transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
nonpathogenic, is considered an infect ious agent.
In thi s study , severi ty for each AE, incl uding any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Versi on 4.03, effect ive date 14 June 2010 [40].Clarificat ion should be 
made between an SAE and an AE that is considered severe in intensit y (Grade 3 or 4), because 
the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous. The general term severe is often used to 
describe the inte nsity (severi ty) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may  be of  
relatively minor m edical  significance (such as a Grade 3 headache). This is NOT the same as 
serious , which i s based on pati ent/event outcom e or action criteria described above, and is 
usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s life or abilit y to funct ion. A 
severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered serious. For example, a 
white blood cell count of 1000/mm3to less than 2000 is considere d Grade 3 (severe) but may 
not be considered serious. Seriousness (not intensit y) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.
10.2 Procedures for Recording and Reporting AEs and SAEs
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent and/or in r esponse to an open question fro m study  
personnel or revealed by observation, physical examinat ion, or other diagnostic procedures will be 
recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF (see Section 10.3 for the period of observation). Any 
clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical finding is considered an

CONFIDENTIALAE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a commo n underl ying patho logy shoul d be 
noted as 1 comprehensive event.
Regardless of causalit y, SAEs must be reported (see Section 10.3 for the period of observa tion) by 
the invest igator to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance depart ment or designee wit hin 24 hours 
of beco ming aware of the event. This will be done by transmitt ing an electronic data capture (EDC) 
SAE report. If transmissio n of an EDC SAE report is n ot feasible, then a facsimile o f the 
completed Takeda paper -based SAE form will be sent. In case of fax, site personnel need to 
confirm successful transmission o f all pages and include an e -mail address on the fax cover sheet 
so that an acknowledgment of r eceipt can be returned via e -mail within 1 business day . A sam ple 
of the paper -based SAE form and processing directio ns are in the Study  Manual. Inform ation in 
the SAE report or form must be consistent with the data provided on the eCRF. 
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, then the 
investigator will transmit a fo llow-up EDC SAE report (or a paper -based SAE form if an EDC 
SAE report is not feasible) or provide other documentation immediately wit hin24 hours of receipt. 
Copi es of  any relevant data from the hospi tal notes (eg, ECGs, l aboratory  tests, di scharge 
summary, postmortem results) should be sent to the addressee, if requested. 
Planned hospi tal admissio ns or surgical procedures for an illness or disease that existed before 
study  drug was given are not to be considered AEs unless the condit ion deteri orated in an 
unexpected manner during the trial (eg, surgery  was perform ed earlier or l ater than planned).
For both serious and nonserious AEs, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxi city 
grade) of the event and the relat ionship of the event to study drug administration. For serious 
pretreatm ent events, the invest igator must determine both the severit y (toxicit y grade) of the event 
andthe causalit y of the event in rel ation to study  procedures.
Severit y (toxi city grade) for each AE, including any  laboratory  abnorm ality, will  be determined 
using the NCI CTCAE, Version 4.03, effective date 14 June 2010 [40]. The criteria are provided in 
the study  manual .
Relationship of the event to study  drug administratio n (ie, its causali ty) will be determined by  the 
investigator respondin g yes (rel ated) or no (unrelated) to this quest ion: “Is there a reasonable 
possibilit y that the AE is associated with the study  drug?”
10.3 Monitoring of AEs and Period of Observation
AEs, both nonserious and serious, will be mo nitored throughout the study  as follows:
AEs will be reported from the signing of informed consent through 30 day s after 
administration of the last dose of study  drug and recorded i n the eCRFs. AEs that occur 
between the ICF and the first dose of study  drug will  be captured as pretreatmen t events or 
medical history .

–Related and unrelated treatment -emergent SAEs will be reported to the Takeda Global 
Pharmacovigilance department or designee fro m the first dose of study  drug through 
30days after administration o f the last dose of study drug and recorded in the eCRF. After

10.4 Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure During Pregnancy and Birth Events
If a woman beco mes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participat ing in this study, she 
must inform the invest igator immediately and permanent ly discont inue study  drug. The sponsor 
must al so be contacted immediately  by faxing a completed Pregna ncy Form  to the Takeda Global 
Pharmacovigilance department or designee (see Section 10.2). The pregnancy must be followed 
for the final pregnancy  outcome.
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male pat ient’s participat ion in 
this study, the sponsor must also be contacted immediately by faxing a completed Pregnancy Form 
to the Takeda Global Pharmacovigilance depart ment or de signee (see Sect ion 10.2). Every  effort 
shoul d be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy  outcom e.
10.5 Procedures for Reporting Product Com plaints or Medication Errors (Including 
Overdose)
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression that implies dissat isfaction 
regarding the identit y, strength, puri ty, quali ty, or s tabilit y of a drug product. Individuals who 
ident ify a potenti al product com plaint si tuation shoul d immediately report this via the phone 
numbers or e -mail addresses provided below.
A medicat ion error is a preventable event that involves an ident ifiable pat ient and that l eads to 
inappropriate medicat ion use, w hich may  resul t in patient harm. Whereas overdoses and 
underdoses const itute medication errors, doses missed inadvertent ly by a pat ient do not.

The sponsor will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions 
(SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory  authori ties, including the EMA 
investigators and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in accordance with national regulat ions in the 
countri es where the study  is conducted. Relative to the first awareness of the event b y/or further 
provi sion to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted to the regulatory  
authori ties as an expedited report within 7 days for fatal and life -threatening events and 15 days for 
other serious events, unless otherwise required b y national regulat ions. The sponsor will also 
prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues where these might materially  alter the current 
benefit -risk assessment of an invest igational medicinal product or that would be sufficient to 
consider changes in the invest igational medicinal product’s administration or in the overall 
conduct of the trial. The invest igational site also will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his

guidance to study  design, conduction, and reporting. The details o f the steering co mmittee 
membership and responsibilit ies wil l be included in the steering co mmittee charter.
11.2 IRC
A central  BIRC wi th no knowl edge of  the pati ents’ status on treatment will evaluate all images 
collected during the study  for the primary  endpoint of PFS per RECIST v1.1, as well as several 
secondary  endpoints such as time to iPD, as per modified RECIST v1.1. An IRC charter defines 
the procedures used by  the committee.
The central BIRC assessment may  be terminated if the primary  endpoint is m et at the IAor

using the World Healt h Organization Drug Dict ionary.
12.1 eCRFs 
Com pleted eCRFs are required for each subject who signs an ICF.
The sponsor or its designee will supply invest igative sites with access to eCRFs and will make 
arrangements to train appropriate site staff in the use of the eCRF. These forms are used to transmit  
the informat ion collected in the performance of this study  to the sponsor, contract research 
organi zation partners, and regulatory  authori ties. Investi gative si tes m ust com plete eCRFs in 
English.
After complet ion of the entry process, computer logic checks will be run to identify items, such as 
inconsistent dates, missing data, and questionable values. Queri es may  be issued by Takeda 
personnel (or designees) and will be answered by the site.
Any change of, modificat ion of, or addit ion to the data on the eCRFs should be made by the 
investigator or appropriate site personnel . Corrections to eCRFs are recor ded in an audit trail that 
captures the old informat ion, the new information, ident ificat ion of the person making the 
correcti on, the date the correction was made, and the reason for change.
The principal invest igator must review the eCRFs for completenes s and accuracy  and must si gn 
and date the appropriate eCRFs as indicated. Furthermore, the principal invest igator must retain 
full responsibilit y for the accuracy  and authent icity of all data entered on the eCRFs .
eCRFs will be reviewed for completeness an d acceptabilit y at the study  site during peri odic visi ts 
by study  monitors. The sponsor or i ts designee will be permitted to review the subject’s medical 
and hospital records pertinent to the study to ensure accuracy of the eCRFs. The completed eCRFs 
are the sole property  of the sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, 
except for authorized representatives of appropriate governmental healt h or regulatory authorities, 
without wri tten permissio n of the sponsor.

rando mizat ion unt il the first date at which disease progression is object ively documented via 
RECIST v1.1, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first, in the full analysis set. PFS will be 
censored for patients without documented dise ase progression or death at the last valid tumor 
response assessment.
Secondary  efficacy endpo ints for this study  are defined as fo llows (unless otherwi se stated, 
secondary  efficacy endpoints of response will use BIRC assessments with sensit ivity analyses 
perform ed using the investigator assessments):
OS is defined as the time interval fro m the date of rando mizat ion unt il death due to any cause 
in the full analysis set. It will be censored on the date of last contact for those patients who are 
alive.
PFS as assessed by  the investi gator.
ORR is defined as the proportion of the patients who have achieved CR or PR using RECIST 
v1.1 after the init iation of study  treatm ent in the full analysis set.
DOR is defined as the time interval fro m the time that the measurement criteria are first met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that the PD is object ively 
docum ented or death.

Exploratory  efficacy endpo ints include CNS efficacy  via R ANO -BM on init ial treatment, 
molecular determinants of efficacy and safet y with brigatinib and alectinib, HRQoL endpo ints and 
healt h resource utilizat ion endpo ints. Detailed definit ions of these exploratory  efficacy  endpoints 
will be provided in the SAP.
13.1.3.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
The primary analysis o f the primary endpo int will be performed using a 2 -sided stratified log- rank 
test (stratificat ion factors: presence of intracranial CNS metastases at baseline [yes vs no], and best  
prior response to c rizotinib therapy  as assessed by  the invest igator [CR/PR vs any other 
response/status unknown]) to compare the BIRC- assessed PFS of pat ients randomized to 
brigatinib wit h the BIRC -assessed PFS of patients rando mized to alect inib. The overall (2 -sided) 
typeI error rate will be controlled at 0.05. The primary  analysis will  be based on the full analysis 
set. PFS will be est imated for each treatment arm using the Kaplan -Meier method [41]. 
Addit ionally , HRs will  be estimated using the stratified Cox re gression model wit h the 
stratificat ion factors.
Sensit ivity analyses of the primary endpo int of PFS will also be performed in the fo llowing 
popul ations:
Per

CONFIDENTIAL13.1.3.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Analyses
OS, the key secondary  endpoint, will be formally tested for statist ical significance only once PFS 
per BIRC is statist ically significant. OS will be assessed in the full analysis set. 
PFS as assessed by the investigator and ORR will be assessed in the full analysis set. iORR will be 
assessed in pat ients in the full analysis set with measurable brain metastases. The percentage 
responding an d the associ ated 2 -sided 95% CI will be calculated. A Mantel -Haenszel (using the 
stratificat ion factors) test will be performed to compare each endpo int between the 2 arms.
The analysis of time to iPD , as assessed by  the BIRC, will be performed using a 2 -sided stratified 
log-rank test (using the stratificat ion factors) to compare the BIRC -assessed time to iPD of patients 
rando mized to brigatinib wit h the BIRC -assessed time to i PDof patients randomized to alectinib. 
The analysis will be based on patients in the full analysis set. Time to iPD will be est imated for 
each treatment arm using the Kaplan -Meier m ethod [
41]. Addi tionally, HRs will be est imated 
using the stratified Cox regressio n model with the stratificat ion factors. Addit ional analyses in 
patients wi th measurable brain metastases and in patients without brain metastases will also be 
perform ed in a similar m anner.
DOR will be assessed amo ng responders in the full analysis set. iDOR will be assessed among 
patients with brain metastases with an intracranial response in the fu ll analysis set. For each time to 
event endpo int, values and 2
-sided 95% CIs will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method 
according to the init ially assigned treatment. Stratified log -rank tests (using the stratificat ion 
factors) will be performed to compare each endpo int between the 2 arms. Survival probabilit ies at 
12 m onths and the associ ated 2 -sided 95% CIs will be calculated.
Time to response will be summarized only for responders using descript ive statist ics.
13.1.4 PK Analysi s 
PK data collected in this study will contribute to populat ion PK and exposure/response (safet y and 
efficacy) analyses. These analyses may include data fro m other bri gatinib clinical studies. The 
analysis plans for these analyses will be separately devel oped and the resul ts reported separately.
13.1.5 Analysis of PRO and Health Resource Utilization Data
Analyses of PRO data will be performed using the PRO -ITT populat ion, which will be defined as 
patients wi th baseline and at least 1 postbaseline measurement in t he ITT populat ion. The global 
healt h status/qualit y of life and functions from EORTC QLQ -C30 and symptoms measured by  
QLQ -LC13 will be of special interest.
The descriptive statist ics of the actual value and change fro m baseline of the EORTC QLQ -C30, 
QLQ -LC13, and QLQ -BN20 scores will be summarized by treatment group over time. The change 
from baseline scores will be analyzed using linear mixed models to compare 2 treatment groups. 
The number and percentage of patients with improved, stable and worsened qual ity of life scores 
will be analyzed by treatment group over time. Time to qualit y of life worsening will also be

administrated treatment, dose intensit y, and rel ative do se intensit y.
13.2 IA
One IA for efficacy and futilit yis planned after approximately 70% of the total expected events 
(progression or death) have been observed. An O’Brien -Fleming Lan -DeMets [42] alpha spending 
funct ion will be used to control the overall alpha level at 0.05 2
-sided. A gamma spending funct ion 
[43] will be used for the futilit y stopping boundary. Futilit y is nonbinding. The IA is planned to be 
perform ed after the 115 events have been observed. If the observed HR doesn’t meet the 
prespecified stopping rule for efficacy or futilit y at the IA thenthe primary
analysis will  be 
conducted after 164 events are observed. The efficacy  and fut ility stoppi ngboundaries used in the 
analysis will be adjusted based on the actual number of events observed at each analysis using the 
O’Brien -Fleming Lan -DeMets [42] alpha spending funct ionand gamma spending funct ion [ 43].

CONFIDENTIAL13.3 Determination of Sample Size
For the purposes of this sample size calculat ion, the m edian PFS for alect inib is est imated as 
9months and the PFS for brigat inib is estimated to be 15 months on the basis o f the outcom es 
observed in previous single -arm studi es (AP26113 -13-201 and AP26113 - 11-101). Approximately 
246 pati ents will be rando mized in a 1:1 fashio n to receive brigat inib or alect inib. A total of 164 
events (progression or death among the randomized patients) will provide 90% power to detect a 
6-mont h improvement in PFS (HR=0.60). This power project ion is based on a 2 -sided l og-rank 
test, and is controlled at the 2 -sided 0.05 level, adjusting for the proposed IAplan. The number of 
events is fixed, but the enro llment number may change based on an assessment of the overall event 
rate pooled across treatment groups (before the close of enro llment).
14.0 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source d ocum ents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access to source documents by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (contract research organization) and by the IRB or IEC.
In the event a monitor cannot visit the site in a timely manner due to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
alternat ive monitoring approaches ,such as remote source data verificat ionor tel ephone contact,
may be used to ensure data qualit y and integri ty and maintain pat ient safet y. Alternative 
monitoring approaches should be used only  where all owed by  the l ocal heal th authori ty and 
permitted by  the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study and its documentation will be subject to review by the sponsor or designee, 
including but not limited to the Invest igator’s Binder, study  medicat ion, subject medical records, 
inform ed consent docum entati on, docum entati on of  subject authori zation to use personal healt h 
inform ation (if separate from the ICFs), and review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It 
is important that the invest igator and other study  personnel are available during the monitoring 
visits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.
14.2 Protocol De viations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other unexpected circumstances arise that will require 
deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the inves tigator shoul d consul t with the sponsor or 
designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of action. There will be 
no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) from the inclusio n or exclusio n criteria.
The site should docu ment all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event of 
a significant devi ation, the si te shoul d notify  the sponsor or i ts desi gnee (and IRB or IEC, as 
requi red). Si gnificant devi ations include, but are not limited to, those that in volve fraud or

The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will  contact the si te in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies where laboratory  samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibilit y that this study may be inspecte d by regulatory agencies, including 
those of foreign governments (eg, the FDA, the United Kingdo m Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory  Agency , the Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency o f Japan). If the 
study  site is contacted for an inspect ion by a regulatory  body , the sponsor should be notified 
immediately . The invest igator and inst itution guarantee access for qualit y assurance auditors to all 
study  docum ents as described in Section 14.1.
15.0 ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual participants (ie, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declarat ion of Helsinki, 
and the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for GCP. Each invest igator will conduct the study 
according to applicable local or regional regulatory requirements and align his or her conduct in 
accordance with the “Responsibi lities of the Investigator” that are listed in Appendix B. The 
principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through appendices contain ing 
requi rements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilities.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable state and federal/local requirements 
of each participat ing regio n. The sponsor or designee will r equire docum entati on noting all names 
and tit les of members who make up the respective IRB or IEC. If any member of the IRB or IEC 
has di rect parti cipat ion in this study , written notification regarding his or her abstinence fro m 
voting must also be obtaine d. Those American sites unwilling to provide names and tit les of all 
members because of privacy and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a Federal 
Wide Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by the Department of Health and 
Hum an Ser vices.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the Invest igator’s Brochure, a copy o f 
the ICF, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materia ls and/or advertisements and other 
docum ents requi red by all applicable l aws and regul ations, m ust be submitted to a central or local 
IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval o f the protocol  and subject

number, and versio ndate; i dentify versio ns of other documents (eg, ICF) reviewed; and state the 
approval  date. The sponsor will notify  site once the sponsor has confirmed the adequacy of site 
regul atory  docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has received permissio nfrom 
competent authori ty to begin the study . Until the site receives notification no protocol act ivities, 
including screening may occur.
Sites m ust adhere to all requirements stipulated by  their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may include 
notification to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the ICF, recruit ment 
materi als intended for viewing by  subjects, l ocal safety reporting requirements, reports and 
updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals specified by the respect ive IRB or 
IEC, and submissio n of the invest igator’s final status report to IRB or IEC. All IRB and IEC 
approval s and rel evant docum entati on for these i tems must be provi ded to the sponsor or its 
designee.
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for parti cipat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.
15.2 Subject Information, Informed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. The ICF, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject 
inform ation sheet (if applicable) describe the planned and permitted uses, trans fers, and 
disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for purposes of conducting 
the study . The ICF and the subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) further explain the nature of 
the study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefits, as well as the date informed consent is 
given. The ICF will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that he or she is free to 
withdraw at any  time wi thout giving a reason and without prejudice to his or her further medical 
care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the ICF 
and if applicable, the subject authorizat ion form. The ICF, subject authorization form (if 
applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) must be a pproved by both the IRB or IEC 
and the sponsor before use.
The ICF, subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) 
must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the prospective subject. It is the 
responsibilit y of the invest igator to explain the detailed elements of the ICF, subject authorizat ion 
form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if applicable) to the subject. Informat ion 
shoul d be given in both oral  and wri tten form  whenever possible and in the manner deemed 
appropriate by  the IRB or EC. 
The su bject must be given ample opportunit y to: (1) inquire about details of the study  and 
(2)decide whether or not to participate in the study. If the subject determines he or she will 
participate in the study, then the ICF and subject authorizat ion form (if a pplicable) must be signed 
and dated by  the subject at the time of consent and before the subject entering into the study . The

ballpo int ink. The invest igator m ust al so sign and date the ICF and subject authorizat ion (if 
applicable) at the time o f consent and before subject entering into the study; however, the sponsor 
may allow a designee of the invest igator to sign to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Once signed, the ori ginal  ICF, subject authori zation form (if applicable), and subject informat ion 
sheet (if applicable) will be stored in the investigator’s site file. The investigator must document 
the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subj ect’s medical record. Copies of the 
signed ICF, the signed subject authorizat ion form (if applicable), and subject informat ion sheet (if 
applicable) shall be given to the subject.
All revised ICFs must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects in the sam e manner as the 
original  informed consent. The date the revised consent was obtained should be recorded in the 
subject’s medical record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the revised ICF.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and uphol d the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical study  database or documentation via a unique ident ificat ion number. As 
permi tted by all applicable laws and regulat ions, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date 
of birth, and subject init ials may be used to verify the subject and accuracy o f the subject’s unique 
ident ificat ion number.
To com ply with ICH Guidelines fo r GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the sponsor 
requi res the investigator to permit its monitor or designee’s monitor, representatives fro m any 
regul atory  authori ty (eg, FDA, Medi cines and Heal thcare products Regul atory  Agency, 
Pharmaceut icals and Medical Devices Agency), the sponsor’s designated auditors, and the 
appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records (source data or 
docum ents), including, but not limited to, laboratory  test resul t reports, ECG reports, admissio n 
and discharge summaries for hospital admissio ns occurring during a subject’s study participation, 
and autopsy  reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires the specific 
authori zation of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see Section 15.2).
Copi es of  any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally ident ifiable informat ion rem oved (ie, subject name, address, and other ident ifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy

15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration
In order to ensure that informat ion on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to 
comply with applicable laws, regulat ions and guidanc e, Takeda will, at a minimum register 
intervent ional clinical trials it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.gov or other 
publicly  accessible websites on or before start of study , as defined in Takeda Policy/Standard. 
Takeda contact information , along with invest igator’s cit y, state (for Am ericas invest igators), 
country , and recrui ting status will be registered and available for public viewing. 
As needed Takeda and invest igator/site contact information may be made public to support 
participant access to trials via registries. In certain situations/registries, Takeda may assist 
participants or potential participants to find a clinical trial by helping them locate trial sites closest 
to their homes by providing the investigator name, address, and phone number via email/phone or 
other m ethods callers requesting trial informat ion. Once subjects receive invest igator contact 
inform ation, they  may call the si te request ing enro llment into the trial. The invest igative sites are 
encouraged to handle the tr ial inquiries according to their established subject screening process. If 
the caller asks addit ional questions beyo nd the topic of trial enro llment, they should be referred to 
the sponsor.
Any invest igator who objects to Takeda providing this informat ionto callers must provide Takeda 
with a wri tten noti ce request ing that their informat ion not be listed on the registry site. 
15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure
Takeda will post the results of clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov or other publicly accessibl e 
websites (including the Takeda corporate site) and registries, as required by Takeda 
Policy/Standard, applicable laws and/or regulations. 
Data Sharing
The sponsor is committed to responsible sharing of clinical data with the goal of advancing 
medical sc ience and improving pat ient care. Qualified independent researchers will be permitted 
to use data collected from pat ients during the study to conduct addit ional scient ific research, which

b This visit shall be scheduled with a ±7 -day window. If patient’s last dose equals or is more than 30 days before the decision of permanent discontinuation from study treatment is 
made, the end -of-treatment visit and 30 days after last dose visit can be combined as 1 visit.
c The medical history needs to include the detail of prior treatment, starting and ending time, and the best response to each treatment. The assay and sample type of prior ALK test will 
also be collected.
d Exploratory biomarker studies (including ALK mutation status) will be performed on tissue biopsy obtained after progres sion on crizotinib but before start of study treatment. Tissue 
can be obtained as part of standard of care or as an optional screening biopsy in this study. The collection of this tissue i s not mandatory, but highly encouraged. An optional biopsy 
will also be taken at time of progression on brigatinib and alectinib for patients who consent to the procedure and test. FFPE tumor ti ssue will be used for exploratory molecular 
genetic analysis.
e Exploratory biomarker studies (including ALK mutation status) will be performed on tissue biopsy, taken at time of progression on brigatinib and alectinib for patients who consent

f Physical examination, ECOG performance status assessments, hematology, chemistry, insulin, and pregnancy tests do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1, Day 1 if they were 
performed for screening within 7 days before Cycle 1, Day 1 and, in the opinion of the investigator, there is no reason to be lieve they have substantially changed.
g Assessment for early pulmonary symptoms must be performed during the visit on Day 8 before receiving study drug.
hOnly aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransaminase and total bilirubin will be evaluated at t his visit.
iPregnancy tests will be performed for women of childbearing potential at screening. The test must be known to be negative bef ore the study drug administration and be performed 
within 7 days before first study drug administration (Cycle 1, Day 1). The pregnancy tests must be a beta -human chorionic gonadotropin test, and either urine or serum can be used. 
Women of childbearing potential at study start must also complete the pregnancy test once every 12 weeks (3 cycles) ±7 days thereafter and at t he end -of-treatment visit. Additional 
pregnancy testing should be performed if recommended or required per local guidelines or regulations.
j PRO assessments: EORTC QLQ -C30 (v3.0) and its lung cancer module, QLQ -LC13, items of QLQ -BN20, and EQ -5D-5L questi onnaires will be administered at baseline, per the 
Schedule of Events throughout the study, and at the 30 days after last dose visit. The questionnaires should be administered to patients when they arrive for their scheduled visits, 
before any clinical mea surements, assessments, evaluations, or procedures being performed. The EQ -5D-5L will be administered in the follow -up period.
kOn C1D1 site staff will explain to the patient how to complete the patient diary. 
lSurvival follow -up shall be scheduled with a ±14 -day window.
mIf study treatment is stopped for a reason other than disease progression, the re -biopsy or plasma for ctDNA shall be collected after confirmed disease progression occurs.
nImaging of chest, abdomen and brain will occur at each assessment for all patients until disease progression is observed. If patients continue to receive the study drug beyond 
progression, the tumor assessment will continue to occur at the same schedule ;however, the sponsor does not require further tumor assessment data to be collected .

Rationale for Amendment 3
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 3. The 
primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Change the legal entit y of the sponsor and the na me of  study  lead due to a company level 
change. 
Incorporate the recommendation fro m the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) for the endpo int of “time to intracranial disease progression (iPD),” which will no 
longer be a key  secondary  endpoint and was remo ved fro m hierarchical testing. The ordering 
of secondary  objectives and endpoints were revised to reflect this change.
Provi de cl arificat ion for some of the protocol language.
In thi s amendment, minor grammat ical, editorial, formatting, a nd administrative changes not 
affect ing the conduct of the study  are included for clarification and administrative purposes only.
Changes in Amendment 3
The fo llowing i s a summary  of changes made in the amendment:
Updated sponsor informat ion from ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc to Takeda Development 
Center Am ericas, Inc.
Changed the clinical study  lead to 
, MD, on signatory  page.
Removed “t ime to intracranial progressive disease (iPD)” fro m the key  secondary  endpoints 
and revised the order of other seco ndary  endpoints. The order of secondary  objectives was 
revised to match the order of key  and other secondary  endpoints.
Clarified throughout the protocol that the treatment will cont inue unt il “progressive disease 
(PD) assessed by  the invest igator.”
Removed statem ents about “End of Study /Study  Com pletion Definit ion, and Planned 
Reporting,” “Primary  Com pletion/Study  Com pletion,” and “Study  Com pletion,” and unified 
the terms in Section 6.3.1 for the definit ion of “End of Study” and “Primary  Com pletion.”
Speci fied that timing for exclusio n criteria 2 (crizotinib use) and 7 (chemotherapy or radiatio n

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 4 08 March 2021
CONFIDENTIALAdded new exclusio n criterion 7 (other primary malignancies other than NSCLC) and
renumbered subsequent criteria.
Clarified that timing for exclusio n criterion 11 (symptom atic central nervous system
metastases; formerly exclusio n criterion 10) was a minimum of 7 day s.
Clarified the required test to support protocol exclusion criteria 18 (formerly  exclusion
criterion 17) for an activ e hepati tis B virus/hepat itis C virus infect ion.
Clarified requi rement that both bri gatinib and alectinib be administered at approximately the
same time every  day and added detail regarding dose -limit ing AEs.
Clarificat ion for dose modification for AEs andclarificat ions that if the brigatinib dose cannot
be escalated to 180 mg QD due to AE, 90 mg QD should be administered throughout the study.
Clarificat ion for pulmo nary events occurring within the first 7 day s of treatm ent regarding
ruling out other etiol ogies including rapid disease progression for assessing relat ion to
treatm ent.
Clarificat ion for alectinib dose discont inuat ion due to AEs.
Provi ded addi tional information regarding the use of moderate CYP3A inducers and
alternat ive or herbal therapy after consultation with and approval by the sponsor.
Clarificat ion for disease assessment in pat ients who discont inue study  drug for reasons othe r
than PD.
Corrected total blood volume co llection for DNA measurements.
Added requirement for acknowledgment of receipt when reporting AEs and SAEs by
facsimile.
The secondary  endpoint analyses were revised to reflect that iPD will no longer be a key
secondary  endpoint and was removed from hierarchical testing.
Minor edi torial revisi ons were m ade for cl arificat ion throughout the document.
Rationale for Amendment 2
This document describes the changes in reference to the protocol incorporating Amendment 2. The 
primary  reasons for thi s amendment are to:
Change the current secondary  endpoint for intracranial progressio n-free survival (iPFS) to
time to intracranial progression (iPD) without prior sy stemic progression per advice fro m the
United States Food and D rug Administration (US FDA).
To cl arify the dose m odificat ion table for treatment -related adverse events ( Table 8.b) and
provi de consistency with the Com pany Core Data Sheet (CCDS) for brigat inib and to provide
clarity on all owed dose levels.

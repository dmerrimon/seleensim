AN OVERVIEW  OF THE STUDY AND KEY INFORMATION
Why is  this study being done?
The aims  of this study are to better understand how different types of electronic cigarettes 
affect blood nicotine levels and how you feel.
You are  being asked to participate in this study because you are a current cigarette smoker. 
Approximately 30 individuals will participate in this study.
What will  happen if I participate?
For this study,  you will be asked to visit the Center for the Study of Tobacco Products four times 
for study visits. Each visit lasts about 4 hours.
In this  study, you will be asked to do the following things one time: 
1. Fill  out questionnaires about your health, smoking history, cannabis and alcohol use
2. Take  a pregnancy test (to see if you meet criteria to be in the study)

VCU IRB  PROTOCOL NUMBER: HM20012013
Version: 6/24/19 Page 2  of 8In this  study, you will be asked to do the following things prior to or during each study visit:
1. Abstain  from tobacco and caffeine use prior to visits
2. Take  breath tests throughout study visits
3. Have an  IV catheter inserted into your arm during each study visit
4. Wear  a heart rate device on your finger and a blood pressure cuff on your arm during 
each study visit
5. Respond  to questionnaires to measure how you feel before and after you use the study 
product
6. Use  the tobacco products during each study visit
During each  study visit, you will use a different tobacco product. In each session, you will 
receive either an e-cigarette or your own brand cigarette.  The two e-cigarettes you will use are 
both marketed tobacco products. During the session we will ask you to use the product we 
provide at two separate times. The first time, we will ask you to take only 10 puffs, and we will 
tell you when to take each of these puffs. The second time we will ask you to use the product 
however you’d like.  
Your participation  in this study will help us understand how people use tobacco products and e-
cigarettes and what effects these products produce.  You will have an opportunity to 
experience all of the questionnaires and see all of the equipment before your first session.
Significant new findings  developed during the course of the research which may relate to your 
willingness to continue participation will be provided to you.
This study  will not use your samples to sequence all or part of your DNA. 
What alternative  treatments or procedures are available?
This is  not a therapeutic study.  You have the alternative not to participate.
What are  the risks and benefits of participating?
There are  both risks and benefits of participating in research studies. We want you to know 
about a few key risks right now. We will give you more information in the “WHAT RISKS AND 
DISCOMFORTS CAN I EXPECT FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?” section.
RISKS AND  DISCOMFORTS: You may experience some discomfort during abstinence from 
cigarettes and nicotine before the session or while using tobacco products/electronic cigarettes 
during the session. Side effects from tobacco/nicotine abstinence can include irritability, 
anxiety and restlessness, excessive hunger, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbance. 
Approved by the VCU IRB on 7/12/2019
VCU IRB  PROTOCOL NUMBER: HM20012013
Version: 6/24/19 Page 3  of 8These are  common abstinence symptoms in cigarette smokers. Though uncomfortable, these 
feelings are not medically dangerous. Side effects from products that contain nicotine can 
include sweating, lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and nervousness. These effects 
are unlikely in individuals who use nicotine-containing products regularly. In addition, some 
people who use e-cigarettes have reported experiencing seizures. You may also feel some 
discomfort when the nurse inserts or withdraws the needle, or when blood samples are taken. 
It is also possible that you might feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions we ask.  
You do not have to answer any question that you feel uncomfortable answering. There is also a 
risk of a loss of confidentiality.
BENEFITS TO YOU  AND OTHERS: You may not get any direct benefit from this study, but the 
information we learn from people in this study may help us to better understand the effects of 
tobacco products/e-cigarettes.
Now that  you have a general overview of the study, we want to provide the details about what 
your participation involves. Please read, or have someone read to you, the rest of this 
document. If there is anything you don’t understand, be sure to ask the study staff.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN  IF I PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY?
If you  decide to be in this research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form after you 
have had all your questions answered and understand what will happen to you.
If you  agree to join the study, you will be asked questions about your general health, smoking 
history, and marijuana and alcohol use.  If you are a woman you will need to provide a urine 
sample that will be tested immediately for pregnancy.  If you are pregnant you cannot 
participate in this study.  All of your responses will be confidential.
If the  urine tests and your answers to our questions indicate that you fulfill the entry criteria, 
we will ask you to participate in three, approximately 4-hour sessions here at the Clinical 
Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory or the Center for the Study of Tobacco Products 
Laboratory, located on VCU’s campus.  The three sessions will begin at approximately the same 
time each day, will be separated by at least 48 hours, and will not occur more than two times 
per week.  Before each session, we will ask you to abstain from all tobacco products for at least 
12 hours.  We will also ask you to abstain from caffeinated beverages for 1 hour before each 
session.  In addition, the use of any other nicotine-containing products (like e-cigarettes, 
nicotine gum or the nicotine patch) is prohibited.  We will ask you to take a simple breath test 
to make sure that you have complied with these restrictions.  Our tests are not perfect, but 
they are the only measures that we can accept to make certain that you have complied with the 
Approved by the VCU IRB on 7/12/2019
VCU IRB  PROTOCOL NUMBER: HM20012013
Version: 6/24/19 Page 4  of 8no tobacco/no  nicotine restrictions.  Also, during the study sessions, we will ask you to turn off 
your cell phone for the duration of the session.
Each session  will begin with a one hour waiting period during which you will sit in the session 
room to allow you to get acclimated to the setting. During this waiting period, you will not be 
allowed to use your phone, however, we will provide you with a movie to watch or magazine to 
read. After the waiting period, a nurse will insert an IV catheter into your arm that will stay 
there for the entire session. This catheter will be used to draw blood periodically (less than 1 
tablespoon per sample, 4 samples per session). We use this method because participants tell us 
that it is more comfortable than repeated “sticks” with a needle. During this session we will 
take much less blood than the amount you would give in a single donation at a blood drive. 
Inserting a catheter can be challenging for some individuals with smaller veins or veins that are 
harder to see. In this laboratory we will attempt to insert a catheter no more than three times 
in one day and, if all three attempts are unsuccessful, we will discontinue the session and pay 
you for the time that you spent complying with study conditions before the session began ($15) 
and also for the time you spent in the laboratory ($15/hour). You will also provide additional 
breath tests during the session before and after using the e-cigarettes or your own brand 
cigarette.
During each  session, we will also monitor your heart rate (with a device that attaches to your 
finger) and blood pressure (with a blood pressure cuff on your arm) and ask you to respond to 
several questionnaires to measure how you feel before and after you use the study product. 
During each  session, you will use a different product. In each session, you will receive either an 
e-cigarette or your own brand cigarette.  The two e-cigarettes you will use (JUUL and iQOS) are 
both marketed tobacco products. During the session we will ask you to use the product we 
provide at two separate times. The first time, we will ask you to take only 10 puffs, and we will 
tell you when to take each of these puffs. The second time we will ask you to use the product 
however you’d like.  At each of these two times we need you to remain seated in a comfortable 
chair while you are using the product.   
Your participation  in this study will help us understand how people use tobacco products and e-
cigarettes and what effects these products produce.  You will have an opportunity to 
experience all of the questionnaires and see all of the equipment before your first session.

excessive hunger, difficulty concentrating, and sleep disturbance. These are common

lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and nervousness. These effects are unlikely in 
individuals who use nicotine-containing products regularly. In addition, some people who use e-
cigarettes have reported experiencing seizures. Some of these individuals reported a prior 
history of seizures or using other substances at the same time as their e-cigarette. You may also 
feel some discomfort when the nurse inserts or withdraws the needle, or when blood samples 
are taken. We try very hard to minimize your discomfort at these times, and the use of a 
trained nurse and sterile, disposable equipment enhances comfort while reducing the risk of 
bruising and infection. If you find any effects or data collection procedures unacceptable, you 
may stop your participation at any time. You should not donate blood 4 weeks before or 4 
weeks after this study.
Non-Physical Risks
It is  possible that you might feel uncomfortable answering some of the questions we ask.  You 
do not have to answer any question that you feel uncomfortable answering. There is also a risk 
of a loss of confidentiality.
Unknown or  Unforeseeable Risks
The researchers  will let you know about any significant new findings (such as additional risks or 
discomforts) that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.
WILL I  BE PAID TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY?
You will  be paid for the time that you are not using tobacco prior to session and for your time in 
the laboratory: you will receive $75 after the first session, $100 after the second session, and 
$125 after the third session.  In all, you can earn $300 for completing this study. All payments 
will be in cash.
Total payments within  one calendar year that exceed $600 will require the University to 
annually report these payments to the IRS and you.  This may require you to claim the 
compensation you receive for participation in this study as taxable income.  
 
You will  be asked to provide your social security number in order to receive payment for your 
participation.  Your social security number is required by federal law.  It will not be included in 
any information collected about you for this research.  Your social security number will be kept 
confidential and will only be used in order to process payment.

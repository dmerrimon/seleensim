Title  A Post -Market, Single Blind, Randomized Clinical Prospective Study on Intradialytic 
Symptoms in Subject s treated with Qd 500  vs Qd 300  
Study Goal  To determine the impact of dialysate flow rate (Qd) on Subject  reported dialysis related 
symptoms and on time to recovery post dialysis.  
Study Background  Subject s undergoing conventional intermittent thrice weekly hemodialysis using a Qd of 
500ml/min or higher report many inter and intra dialytic symptoms. Common symptoms 
include fatigue, cramping, and insomnia.  
Subject s treated on the Tablo hemodialysis system  report ‘feeling better’. Tablo has a 
dialysate flow rate of 300 ml/min.  
Study Objective  The objecti ve of this study is to determine if Subject s who report dialysis symptoms while 
meeting adequacy (as determined by Kt/V of 1.2 or greater) on thrice weekly dialysis or 
who have a recovery time of at least 4 hours when treated on a conventional, i.e. non 
Tablo, hemodialysis device feel better with a reduced dialysate flow rate of 300ml/min 
based on an assessment of time to recovery post dialysis and  Subject  reported symptoms 
via a modified weekly ESAS survey.  
Study Length  The study will last approximately 8  weeks consisting of chart review, Subject selection, 
medical record review, data collection and data analysis.  
Inclusion Criteria  1. Subject has provided informed consent and has signed a Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) compliant authorization statement.  
2. Subject is at least 18 of age.  
3. Subject has end stage renal disease (ESRD) adequately treated with  thrice weekly 
dialysis.  
4. Subject is currently stable on dialysis for at least 3  months on a conventional dialysis 
machine and Qd of 500ml/min  or higher  with no change in the following dialysis 
prescri ption parameters over that time:  Qb, Qd, Dialyzer, Time.  
5. Subject has a baseline Kt/V of greater than 1.2.  
6. Subject has a stable vascular access.  
7. Subject reports time to recovery of more than 4 hours or a modified ESAS with at least 
5 symptoms of which at least 2 are rated as moderate (rating of 4 -6) or severe (r ating 
of 7-10). 
Exclusion Criteria  1. Subject is unable to complete the questionnaires.  
2. Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant . 
3. Subject is scheduled for a change in modality or expected kidney transplant in the next 
3 months.  
4. Any other documented  condition that the Investigator feels would prevent the Subject 
from successful inclusion in the study.  
Primary Endpoint   Change in time to recovery and self -reported symptoms . 
Secondary Endpoint  Caregiver assessment o f changes in Subject ’s health, m issed or reduced treatments, 
number of intradialytic interventions ( saline, prn medications, early discontinuation, UF 
change related to sxs) and the reason for intervention.

3 BACKGROUND  
Subject s experience various symptoms during hemodialysis. Prior studies have shown that fatigue, muscle cramps, 
insomnia and pruritis are most commonly reported as symptoms associated with dialysis(5).. The frequency and 
severity of intradialytic symptoms are associated with missed treatment s, shortened treatment time and delayed 
time to recovery after dialysis  (3,7,8).. Longer time to recovery has also been shown to be a simple, reproducible, 
tool associated with poor er HRQoL, hospitalization and mortality  (3,4). Subject s treating on the Tablo system have 
previously reported feeling better when dialyzing thrice weekly with this device. The Tablo system utilizes a 
dialysate flow rate of 300ml/min to achieve the standard  adequacy target as defined as a Kt/V of 1.2 or greater 
(1,9). To better understand the feeling better effect on Tablo, this study was designed to determine if a decrease in 
dialysate flow rate on a conventional dialysis device produces a similar effect on  Subject  reported symptoms. This 
study assesses time to recovery as well as prevalence and severity of Subject  reported symptoms via a weekly 
modified Edmonton Symptom Assessment System when dialysate flow rate is decreased from 500ml/min or higher 
Outset Medical   CONFIDENTIAL

DOC -0004298 , Rev 0 3   to 300m l/min on standard thrice weekly dialysis. In addition, the Subject ’s primary caregiver will be given a KDQoL 
SF-36 to complete as to their perception of the Subject ’s quality of life at baseline as well as after each 4 -week 
interval. These assessment tools  have been shown to be reliable, simple methods for symptom assessment 
(2,4,8,10,11,12). 
4 STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to determine if Subject s who report dialysis symptoms while meeting adequacy (as 
determined by Kt /V of 1.2 or greater) on chronic thrice weekly dialysis or who have a recovery time of more than 4 
hours when treated on a conventional, i.e. non Tablo, hemodialysis device feel better with a reduced dialysate flow 
rate of 300ml/min based on an assessment of time to recovery post dialysis, weekly modified ESAS, and Subject ’s 
caregiver assessment of the Subject ’s symptoms . 
5 STATEMENT OF COMPLIA NCE 
This study will be conducted according to the protocol, good clinical practice (GCP) and all applicable regulator y 
requirements (21CFR).  
6 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a  single center, post market, prospective, single blind, randomized, cross -over study  involving approximately 
50 subjects currently dialyzing on a  conventional dialysis machinev at a dialysate flow rate of 500ml/ min or higher  
thrice weekly. The study may collect retrospective and prospective medical records and other treatment data. 
Enrolled subje cts will answer the question, “ How long does it take you to recover from a dialysis session?”  (TTR)  
along with a modifi ed ESAS at baseline and weekly. Subject s will be screened prior to entry into the study  and 
enrolled if time to recovery at baseline of >  4 hours or the results of their modified ESAS demonstrate at least 5 
dialysis related symptoms with at least 2 being described as moderate (rating of 4 -6) or severe (rating of 7 -10). 
Caregivers of screened Subject s meeting the study criteria will be given  a baseline KDQoL SF-36 to determine their 
perception if the Subject ’s current state of health. Subject s enrolled will be randomized to two groups. Group 1 will 
dialyze for the first 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 300ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a  Qd of 500ml/min. 
Group 2 will dialyze for the first 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 500ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a Qd of 
300ml/min. At the end of each week, the Subject  will respond to the TTR question as well as the modified ESAS 
survey. Subje ct caregivers will complete the KDQoL at the end of each 4 -week interval. The study will assess the 
Subject  and Subject  caregiver responses to the survey tools as well as other outcome measures which may include 
but are not limited to, kinetics, laboratory  values, blood pressure measurement, intradialytic interventions, missed 
or shortened treatments, and/or changes to treatment parameters. The study will collect subject demographics 
and dialysis related medications.  The goal is to enroll at least 15 Subjec ts who report intradialytic symptoms as the 
ITT group for study analysis . 
6.1 Effort to Minimize Bias  
All eligible Subjects that , in the treating physician’s best medical judgement, meet the selection criteria  will be 
asked to participate in this study. Subjec ts will not be excluded based on gender, race, ethnicity or sexual 
orientation .

Study# 2019 -03 
DOC -0004298 , Rev 0 3   6.2 Evaluation of Safety  
Treatment with a Qd of 300ml/min has been shown to be safe and effec tive in the treatment of ESRD subjects . It 
has also been demonstrated that dialysis at a Qd of 300ml/min can achieve the prescribed adequacy target of  a 
Kt/v of 1.2 or greater. Standard safety precautions as per clinic  protocol will be continued. No portion of this study 
will be beyond the st andard of care.  
6.3 Blinding  and Randomization  
This study is a single center, post market, prospective , single blind , randomized, cross -over study comparing 
symptoms with a conventional dialysis device at a Qd of 500 ml/min and a Qd of 300 ml/min. Only Subject s will be 
blinded to the dialysis device Qd.  
Subjects will be randomized to either arm at a 1:1 ratio using excel’s RANDBETWEEN function. Subjects will be 
randomly assigned a 0 or a 1. Subjects tha t are assigned ‘0’ will go to Group 1 , and subjects that a re assigned ‘1’ 
will go to Group 2 .

DOC -0004298 , Rev 0 3   8 STUDY PROCEDURES AND  DATA COLLECTION  
8.1 Baseline Evaluation   
Subjects will be asked for their response to the TTR question and a modified ESAS. Subject s meeting the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, will be consented and enrolled into the study . Enrollees w ill be randomized to treatment 
Group 1 or 2. Enrollee caregi vers will be asked to complete a KDQoL SF -36 regarding their perception of the 
Subject ’s overall health . Additionally, historical dialysis treatment information including hemodialysis prescription 
and any recent changes, baseline laboratory values including kinetics, temperature, height, weight, body mass 
index, vascular access type, presence or absence of diabetes mellitus, hypotension, ejection fraction, arrhythmia, 
high blood pressure, and any other co -morbid conditions considered relevant may al so be collected where 
available.  Any subjects of child -bearing potential will be given a pregnancy test to confirm negative results. Those 
subjects will also  be utilizing medically acceptable means of contraception during the study period . Demographic 
information will be collected including age, gender, ethnicity and race. Dialysis related medications, laboratory 
values, blood pressure readings taken before, during and after dialysis treatments and adverse event data may 
also be collected if available.   
8.2 Group 1 
Subjects will undergo staff administered dialysis treatment 3 times/week for 8 weeks In -Center with prescription 
adjustment s as outlined in the Schedule of Events. Subjects will respond to the TTR question and modified ESAS at 
the completion of every week. Caregivers will be asked to respond to the KDQoL SF -36 during week 4 and week 8.  
Subjects Serum Potassium, BUN, CO2, Phos, Na , Beta -2-Microglobulin , Vitamin B12 and Kt/V labs  and treatment 
flowsheets will also be evaluated.  Dialysis prescription changes, dialysis related medications,  blood pressure 
readings taken before, during and after dialysis treatments and adverse event data may also be collected if 
available.  Group 1 will dialyze for the first 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 300ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a 
Qd of 500ml/min.  
8.3 Group  2  
Subjects will undergo staff administered dialysis treatment 3 times/week for 8 weeks In -Center with prescription 
adjustment as outlined in the Schedule of Events. Subjects will respond to the TTR question and modified ESAS at 
the co mpletion of every week. Caregivers will be asked to respond to the KDQoL SF -36 during week 4 and week 8.  
Subjects Serum Potassium, BUN, CO2, Phos, Na , Beta -2-Microglobulin , Vitamin B12  and Kt/V labs  and treatment 
flowsheets  will also be evaluated.  Dialysis prescription changes, dialysis rel ated medications, blood pressure 
readings taken before, during and after dialysis treatments and adverse event data may also be collected if 
available.  Group 2 will dialyze for the first 4 weeks of the study  at a Qd of 500ml/min, then for the last 4 weeks at a 
Qd of 300ml/min.  
9 STUDY LIMITATIONS  
Limitation of this include its small size and in a single center. Additionally, every attempt has been made to remove 
any variables other than change in dialysis treatment device; however, Subjects  with ESRD have com plex medical 
histories and the effect of illness unrelated to ESRD (whether worsened or improved) was not taken into 
consideration. Socioeconomic factors that can affect a Subject’s  sense of wellbeing or any changes to these factors 
during the study  were also not accounted for.  
10 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
Risks: The risks to subjects participatin g in this study are minimal. Subjects  will be informed of the potential risk of 
an overall decrease in weekly Kt/V due the change in Qd.  A possible risk is expos ure of protected health 
information. Every effort will be made to maintain subject privacy.  
Benefits: The study will provide information on Subject  self-reported symptoms in the real world setting for 
subjects who dialyze thrice weekly with a dialysate flo w rate of 500ml/min who are changed to a dialysate flow 
Outset Medical   CONFIDENTIAL

DOC -0004298 , Rev 0 3   rate of 300ml/min. Pts will be informed of the potential benefits from none to possible reduction in symptoms  
from the potential intervention. Subjects and their caregivers will be compensated for the ir time and effort to 
complete the surveys as requested.  
Participation in this study  is voluntary. Failure to participate in the study will not impact Subject  care.  
11 STATISTICAL METH ODS 
Descriptive statistics will be performed. Data resulting from this study may be compared to prior studies evaluating 
the frequency of Subject reported symptoms.  
12 STUDY RECORD  MANAGEMENT

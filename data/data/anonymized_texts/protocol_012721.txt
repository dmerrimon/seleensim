Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3Definition of Key Study Terms   
Terms Definition of terms
Baseline A period that begins at the Screening visit where all initial subject assessments 
and findings will be obtained prior to study drug administration on Day 1.
Discontinuation A discontinuation is a subject who is enrolled in the study and for whom study 
drug is terminated for any reason.  Subject will discontinue if he experiences 
bone disease progression per PCWG2 guidelines, or soft tissue disease 
progression per RECIST 1.1, the subject initiates treatment with another 
anticancer therapy, continued dosing would lead to undue risk to the subject in 
the opinion of the Investigator, subject meets a discontinuation criterion or the 
Sponsor terminates the study.
Enroll To enter in to the study following the signing of informed consent.  
Evaluable subject Subject with a confirmed seizure (confirmed by the Independent Adjudication 
Committee) during the 4 -month treatment period of the study or who 
completed at least 3 months (75%) of theplanned treatment. Only an enrolled 
subject who discontinues the study before completing 3 months on treatment 
may be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor, however, an enrolled subject 
who is discontinued due to a confirmed seizure event will not be replaced.
Extension period Period of time where a subjec t continue sto receive enzalutamide after 
completing a 4-month treatment period .A subject in the extension period may 
discontinue for any reasons listed in Discontinuation.
Screening period 30 days prior to Day 1 of Treatment
Screening failure Screened subject, but did not fulfill protocol in clusion and/or exclusion criteria
and failed to receive study treatment, or decided not to participate anymore 
(withdrew consent) prior to completing pre-treatment period.
Treatment period Period of time where major i nterests of protocol objectives are observed, and 
where the test drug is usually give n to a subject which continues until the last 
assessment after completing administration of the test drug .
Follow -up visit A visit occurring approximately 30 days following the last dose of 
enzalutamide or prior to the initiation of another anticancer therapy, whichever 
comes first .
Subject An individual who participates in this clinical trial, and will be a recipient of 
the study drug.
Study period Period of time from the first site initiation date to the last site completing the 
study.
Variable Any quantity that varies; any attribute, phenomenon or event that can have 
different qualitative or quantitative values.

Name of Study Drug: 
EnzalutamidePhase of Development:  
Phase 4
Title of Study:  
A Multicenter, Single -arm, Open -Label, Post -Marketing Safety Study to Evaluate the Risk of 
Seizure Among Subjects with Metastatic Castration -Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) Treated 
with Enzalutamide Who Are at Potential Increas ed Risk of Seizure
Planned Study Period: 
From 3Q2013to 2Q2018
Study Objective(s): 
To evaluate the incidence of seizures and monitor the safety of enzalutamide treatment in subjects 
with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer known to have risk factor (s) for seizure
Planned Total Number of Study Centers and Location(s):  
Approximately 135centers ; global ly
Study Population:  
Subjects with m etastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer known to have risk factor (s)for seizure
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled / Randomized:  
Approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled to achieve a minimum of 350 evaluable subjects 
assuming a drop -out rate of approximately 1 3% for this population.
In order to avoid patient enrollment being domin ated by single patient characteristics in the study, 
the number of subjects enrolled under each risk factor will be monitored closely. Subjects enrolled 
under a specific risk category i.e., class of medication may be limited.  
Study Design Overview:  
This is a multicenter, single -arm, open -label, post -marketing safety study to evaluate the risk of 
seizure among subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with 
enzalutamide who are at potential increased risk of seizure. 
Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and 
participate i n a 4 -month treatment period during which once daily dosing of enzalutamide (160 
mg/day) will occur ,followed by a n approximate 30-day follow -up visit for those who do not 
continue on the extension treatment.
At the end of the 4 -month treatment visit, sub jects who are assessed as deriving benefit from

Oral
Enzalutamide Dose Reduction/Dose Adjustment
Subjects who experience a Grade 3 or higher toxicity that is attributed to enzalutamide and c annot 
be ameliorated by the use of appropriate medical intervention may interrupt treatment with 
enzalutamide for 1 week or until the toxicity grade improves to Grade 2 or lower severity.  
Subsequently, study drug dosing may be restarted at the original dose (160 mg/day) or a reduced 
dose (120 or 80 mg/day) in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
If enzalutamide is co -administered with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide 
should be reduced to 80 mg once daily. If co -administration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is 
discontinued, the enzalutamide dose should return to the dose used prior t o initiation of the strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor. 
If the adverse event is considered not related to enzalutamide by the Investigator , enzalutamide 
may be resumed at the same dose. 
The Sponsor Medical Monitor may be contacted with any questions or concerns on managing dose.

Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3Seizure Therapy: 
Standard anticonvulsant measures, if indicated in the event of a seizure ( note: concomitant 
medication restrictions below). 
If the decision is made to continue a subject in the study after a first seizure, treatment including 
anti-seizure medication may be administered as recommended by the local neurologist and guided 
by the following restrictions. Enzalutamide has the potential to interact with some anti -seizure 
drugs.
Seizure Therapy continued : 
Acceptable drugs u nlikely to c ause interactions are 
oLevetiracetam
oGabapentin
oPregabalin
Drugs which are acceptable but should be administered with caution include :
oEthosucc imide
oLacosamide
oLamotrigine
oOxcarbazepine
oTopiramate
oValproate
oZonisamide
Benzodiazepines should not be used for maintenance therapy of seizure.
Other anti -seizure medications not permitted in the study includ e:
oCarbamazepine
oPhenytoin
oPhenobarbital
oPrimidone
oFelbamate
oVigabatrin
oRetigabine
Concomitant Medication Restrictions or Requirements:   
The following medications are prohibited during the course of the study: 
Therapies to treat prostate cancer including but not limited to:
oCytotoxic chemotherapy 
oHormonal therapies (e.g., anti-androgens, abiraterone acetate, estrogens; testosterone, 
dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], etc.), 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors, ketoconazole;
oAnticonvulsant substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 with a narrow 
therapeutic index (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone );. 
Note: GnRH analogues (agonists or antagonists), bone -targeting agents, such as 
bisphosphonates and denosumab, and glucocorticoids are allowed. Palliative radiotherapy is 
also allowed (provided the subject does no t meet discontinuation criteria).
Any other investigational agent.

Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3medicinal products to affect exposure to enzalutamide:
Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., ge mfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) are to be avoided. If 
subject must be co -administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide should
be reduced to 80 mg once daily. If a co -administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, 
the en zalutamide dose should be returned to the dose used prior to initiation of the strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor.
Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Uridine 5’ -diphospho -glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) may also be induced.  
Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of  CYP3A4, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with 
enzalutamide and may require dose adjustment to maintain therapeuti c plasma concentrations
as drug level smay be reduced by the interaction with enzalutamide. Such substrates include ,
but are not limited to: 
oMacrolide antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin)
oBenzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam)
oImmune modulators (e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
oHIV antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir)
oAnti-epileptics (e.g. phenobarbital , phenytoin). 
oCoumarins (e.g. warfarin)
If enzalutamide is co -administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), additional INR 
monitoring should be conducted.
Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates for P -gp (e.g., digoxin, 
colchicine , dabigatran etexilate) or for the breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or the 
multidrug resistance -associated protein 2 (MRP2), should be used with caution when 
administered concomitantly with enzalutamide and may require dose adjustment to maintain 
optimal plasma concentrations.
No other new systemic therapy or new radiotherapy for treatment (exception for spinal cord 
compression, pain management, etc) for prostate cancer is permitted while subject is on the 
study. Subjects with pre -existing non -target lesions (e.g., bone metastases) receiving palliative 
radiography for pain treatment before participation in the study are allowed to continue 
receiving radiotherapy during the study .

Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3Duration of Treatment:  
A total of 4 months in duration , starting from the date of the first dose . At the end of the 4 -month 
treatment period, subjects who are assessed as deriving benefit from enzalutamide treatment may
continue in the extension period where subjects will continue to receive enzalutamide until one of 
the fol lowing criteria is met:
1.The subject experience sbone disease progression per PCWG2 guidelines or soft tissue disease 
progression per RECIST 1.1 ,
2.The subject initiate streatment with another anticancer therapy, continued dosing would lead to 
undue risk to t he subject in the opinion of the Investigator , 
3.The subject meet sa discontinuation criterion or
4.The Sponsor terminates the study . 
The total study drug treatment duration for the extension period will depend on individual clinical 
benefit with enzalutamide treatment as assessed by the Investigator .
Subjects may be asked to complete their extension period participation in another Astellas 
sponsored study  upon activation of the roll -over extension study at the institution .
Discontinuation Criteria:
The following safety/compliance events will result in the removal of subjects from enzalutamide 
therapy and from the study ,if:
●Any adverse event that is intolerable to the subject and that cannot be ameliorated by the use 
of adequate medical int ervention, or that in the opinion of the Investigator would lead to 
undue risk to the subject if dosing continued;  
●Any first confirmed seizure requiring treatment with maintenance anticonvulsant therapy if the 
only anticonvulsant(s) the patient can tole rate is carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, 
primidone, felbamate, vigabatrin, or retigabine.
●Any second seizure confirmed by the independent Adjudication Committee ;
●Inability to maintain the absolute neutrophil count above 500/ µL(Grade 4) or 500-1000/ µL
(Grade 3) with evidence of infection ;
●Inability to maintain the platelet count above 25,000/ µL(Grade 4) or 25,000 -50,000 /µL 
(Grade 3) with spontaneous bleeding ;
●Subject who has unequivocal evidence of disease progression (upon bone disease progression 
per PCWG2 guidelines or soft tissue disease progression per RECIST 1.1 ) or, is no longer 
deriving clinical benefit;
●Subject who is, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, grossly n on-
compliant with the protocol requirements.
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or acute 
liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury, 
the subject may be discontinued from the study. The Investigator may determine that it is not in the 
subject’s best interest to continue study enrollment. Discontinuation of treatment should be 
considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metastas es
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated)
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 ×ULN in patients with liver metastases)

Formal Stopping Rules
The study design considers early stopping criteria that can be applied to a study as a whole or a 
specific risk factor group, if any, based on the statistical boundary calculated from Maximized 
Sequential Probability Ratio Test [Kulldorff, 2011 ]. The s tatistical boundary will be provided in the 
DSMB charter. Evaluation of the seizure risk is performed by DSMB for the study as a whole and 
for the risk factor group at the same time using the same stopping boundary based on false stopping 
probability of 0.1. R ecommendation will be made by DSMB to either stop the study or stop further 
enrollment of a specific risk factor group.

Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3Suspected Seizure Event Management: 
Each subject will be given a patient card with the following information; a list of signs and 
symptoms of a suspected seizure (Seizure Description Subject Information) and a Suspected 
Seizure Event Questionnaire list as well as instructions regarding what to do in the event of a 
suspected seizure for awareness. 
Thesubject will contact the Investigator immediately (within 24 hours) after onset of a suspected 
seizure event and return to the site with best efforts in 3 days after event for evaluation by the local 
neurologist. 
Investigator will: 
Instruct the subject to stop taking the enzalutamide study drug until after the clinical assessment 
has been completed by the neurologist. (Note: t his could be a temporary stoppage ,if the event 
turns out not to have been deemed a seizure, or is a 1stseizure with good benefit/risk ratio for 
continuing study drug.)
Instruct the subject to complete the Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire with input from any 
witness(es) to suspected events.
Schedule a clinic visit to be evaluated by the local neurologist .
Evaluation by a local neurologist is required including electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI of the brain ) procedures as soon as possible after a potential seizure event 
occurrence. A description of the events leading up to the seizure will be obtained from the 
individual and any witnesses. 
The study site will interview the subject and any witnesses , if poss ible, regarding the event. The 
study site will complete a Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire including a Cover S heet which 
will be signed by the PI/ Sub-Investigator andbeincluded as part of the package to the IAC. The 
site will review the Suspected Se izure Event Questionnaire completed by the subject , if available .
The subject Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire is a tool to capture information of the suspected 
event which the PI/Sub -Investigator will utilize for completion of their evaluation when a vailable. 
The Questionnaire completed by the subject will not be collected.
Subjects will be treated as indicated by the local neurologist including the use of acceptable anti -
convulsants Anticonvulsant substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9  or CYP2C19 with a narrow 
therapeutic index are notpermitted (e.g., a nticonvulsant medications including carbamazepine, 
phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, felbamate, vigabatrin, and retigabine ). 
If the treati ng neurologist deems the event not to have been a seizure, enzalutamide may be 
restarted .If the neurologist determines that a seizure has occurred and the event is a first seizure , 
prior to the IAC assessment , an allowable anticonvulsant may be administer ed on a maintenance 
basis and enzalutamide may be restarted if desired by the investigator and subject ,AFTER 
confirmation of clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator . Results of the assessment of the 
IAC will be provided to the investigator and th e subject will be allowed to continue in the study if 
the event is determined to be a first confirmed seizure.
In the event of a second seizure, enzalutamide will be held until the IAC’s review is complete d. 
Upon IAC co nfirmation of a second seizure , enzalutamide may not be restarted and the subject will
be discontinued from the study.
All relevant information, including the completed seizure assessment questionnaire, the 
neurologist ’sevaluation, andresults of the MRI of the brain and EEG ,will be s ubmitted to the IAC
for evaluation. Results of the assessment of the IAC will be provided to the investigator and the 
subject will be allowed to continue in the study if the event is determined to be a first confirmed 
seizure. If the seizure is determined by the IAC to be a second confirmed seizure event in the study,

Version 3.1Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 3the subject will be withdrawn from the study. If it is determined that the event did not meet criteria 
for a confirmed seizure, the subject can continue in the study if no other discontinuation criteria 
have been met.
DSMB and IAC
A DSMB will be established for this study and remain active for the study duration. The DSMB 
will examine safety data and be informed o fseizure events as expediently as possible. The role and 
responsibilities of the DSMB will be described in the DSMB charter which will be in place for the 
start of the study. Details of statistical boundaries for monitoring of the seizure event will be 
provided in the DSMB charter.
AnIAC will be established to assess all suspected seizure events occurring during the study. The 
committee will consist of independent members of appropriate expertise who are not directly 
involved in the conduct of the clinical study. Suspected seizure adverse events and related 
information of the cases will be sent to the committee for assessment. The IAC charter will 
describe the classification of those events to be adjudicated and the specification of the event -
related docum ents, listings, data flow, method(s) for data collection, andany applicable data 
transfer s.
Statistical Methods: 
Sample size justification: 
Approximately four hundred (400) subjects will be enrolled to target approximately 350 evaluable 
subjects assuming an early discontinuation of study drug of approximately 1 3% for this population
and based on the recommendation from the FDA, respectively. Assuming the true incidence of 
seizure in the first 4 months as 0.9%, based on the incidence rate of 2.8 per 100 patient years, 
which is obtained from the previous studies and the sample size of 350, the chance of observing 
5 or less subjects with seizur e events is 88.9% . Given 5 out of 350 subjects, i. e., point estimate of 
1.43%, the upper limit 95% exact confidence interval will be3.31% and the width of the exact 
confidence interval will be 2.84%.
Efficacy:  
Efficacy data will be listed .
Pharmacokinetics:

Safety:  
An evaluable subject is defined as a subject with a confirmed seizure during the 4 -month treatment 
period of the study or who completed at least 3 months (75%) of the treatment. Only an enrolled 
subject who discontinues the study before completing 3 months on treatment may be replaced at 
the discretion of the Sponsor, however, an enrolled subject who is discontinued due to a confirmed 
seizure event will not be replaced.
Primary endpoint, the proportion of evaluable subjects with at least one confirmed seiz ure as 
adjudicated by the IAC during the 4 -month treatment duration , will be estimated using a point 
estimate and its 95% exact confidence interval. 
Inaddition, a cumulative summary to include all seizure events, including those occurring beyond 
the 4 mo nth-treatment period, will be reported using all evaluable subjects. Seizures will continue

For a ny subject who continues on treatment after his 1 year extension period, data collection will 
be limited to dosing information, and all AEs including serious adverse events (SAEs) . 
All other safety analyses will include subjects who receive at least one d ose of enzalutamide (safety 
population). 
All adverse events will be coded to preferred term, higher level term, and system organ class using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and p roportion of 
subjects with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, 
relationship to enzalutamide, and severity. Laboratory values will be classified as applicable by the

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 31 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Back ground
Enzalutamide (formerl y MDV3100) is an androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor that blocks 
multiple steps in the AR signaling pathway . Enzalutamide competitively  inhibits binding of 
androgens to ARs, inhibits nuclear translocation of receptors and inhibits the association of 
the AR with DNA even in the setting of AR over expression and in prostate cancer cells 
resistant to anti -androgens. By  inhibiting AR signaling, enzalutamide elicits several 
downstream effec ts, which include reduced expression of AR -dependent genes, decreased 
growth of prostate cancer cells, induction of cancer cell death, and tumor regression. 
Enzalutamide lacks agonist activities such as those that may  limit the sustained efficacy  of 
curren t anti -androgens.
In the Phase 3 study  CRPC2 (AFFI RM), the prespecified interim analy sis at the time of 
520events demonstrated a statistically  significant improvement in overall survival in patients 
with metastatic CRPC treated with enzalutamide versus pl acebo (hazard ratio [HR] =0.631; 
95% CI:0.529, 0.752, p <0.0001). Median survival was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide 
arm and 13.6 months in the placebo arm (Δ =4.8 months) . 
In the AFFIRM stud y, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with enzalutamide 160 mg once dail y 
experienced a seizure. No seizures occurred in patients treated with placebo. Seizures 
occurred from 31 to 603 day s after initiation of enzalutamide. Patients experiencing seizure 
were permanently  discontinued from therap y and all seizures re solved. 
This study  is being conducted to assess the risk of seizure in patients with characteristics that 
were previousl y excluded from clinical s tudies and to monitor the safety  of enzalutamide in 
patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate ca ncer who are known to have risk 
factor(s) for seizure. Although no direct comparison is planned in this study , the results from 
the study  will be interpreted in the context of all available data on enzalutamide and seizure 
risk in the general patient popul ation and available epidemiological data at the timing of 
study  reporting.
1.2 Non-clinical and Clinical Data
1.2.1 Summary of Relevant Nonclinical Experience with Enzalutamide
A complete assessment of toxicity  has been conducted with enzalutamide, including evaluat ion 
of impurities. The species included in the toxicity  program were mice, rats, dogs, and 
cynomolgus monkey s. Toxicokinetic evaluations demonstrated that all of these species 
produce the 2 major human metabolites of enzalutamide, N -desmeth yl enzalutamide and an 
inactive carbox ylic acid derivative.  
Long -term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of 
enzalutamide.  
Enzalutamide did not induce mutations in the bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay  and 
was not genotoxic in either the in vitro cy togenetic assay  with mouse l ymphoma thy midine 
kinase gene mutation or the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay .

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3In a cell -based activity  assay  both enzalutamide (formerl y MDV3100) and its active metabolite 
functionally  inhibited the GABA -gated chloride channel (α1β3 and α1β3γ2 GABA -A receptor 
subty pe). In addition enzalutamide treatment was associated with dose -dependent conv ulsions 
in mice, and convulsions were also observed in 1 rat and 2 dogs in repeat dose toxicity  studies.  
Both enzalutamide and its active metabolit e cross the blood -brain barrier , and comparison of 
brain concentrations of these compounds in mice with and without convulsions shows that 
seizurogenic activity  is mainly  dependent on the extent of brain penetration.

Enzalutamide I nvestigator Brochure.  
1.2.2 Summary o f Relevant Clinical Experience w ith Enzalutamide
The key  clinical studies evaluating enzalutamide in men with prostate cancer are described 
briefl y as follows:
S-3100 -1-01:  The pharmacokinetics (PK), tolerability , and antitumor activity  of enzalutamide 
(then known as MDV3100) were first studied in a multicenter, open -label, first -in-human, 
dose-escalation study  in 140 patients with CRPC. Patients who were chemotherapy -naïve or 
who had previous docetaxel -based chemotherap y failure were treated with enzalutamide at 
doses of 30 to 600 mg/day  until disease progression or intolerable side effects developed. The 
maximum tolerated dose was determined to be 240 mg dail y. After review of all data available 
from S -3100 -1-01, the optimal dose of enzalutamide for evaluation in P hase 3 clinical trials 
was determined to be 160 mg/day .  
CRPC2 (AFFIRM) :  A multinational Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
efficacy  and safet y stud y of enzalutamide (160 mg daily ) in patients with progressive CRPC 
previously  treated with docetaxel -based chemotherap y was conducted in 1199 men, 800 of 
whom received treatment with enzalutamide. The primary  endpoint was overall survival. The 
FDA and EU approval of enzalutamide was based on the results of this study .  
MDV3100 -03 (PREVAIL) :  A multinational, Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled, efficacy  and safet y stud y of enzalutamide (160 mg daily ) in 
chemotherap y-naïve patients with progressive metastatic prostate cancer who have failed 
androgen deprivation therap y is o ngoing. Enrollment is complete with 1717 men, 
approximately  half of whom received treatment with enzalutamide. The coprimary  endpoints 
are overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression -free survival (PFS).  
1.2.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism
In PK investigations in men with CRPC, enzalutamide was absorbed rapidly  after oral 
administration, with the time to maximum plasma concentration (t max) after a single dose 
typicall y occurring at 1 hour post dose. No major deviations from dose proportionality  were 
observed over the dose range 30 mg to 600 mg.  
Terminal half -lifewas approximately 5.8days. The average difference between the peak 
(maximum plasma concentration, C max) and trough (predose plasma concentration, C trough ) 
concentrations was ≤ 25%.  Therefore, plasma profiles at steady  state resembled a constant

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3infusion. Time -liner PK was observed bey ond steady  state at Day  28. P lasma concentrations 
of enzalutamide and the active metabolite, N -desmethy l enzalutamide, were approximately  
the same.  
In a drug-drug interaction study  in male patients with CRPC (9785 -CL-0007), a single oral 
dose of a substrate for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP3A4 was 
administered before and concomitantly  with enzalutamide (after at least 55 days of dosing at 
160mg dail y). Enzalutamide at stead y state reduced the plasma exposure to midazolam 
(CYP3A4 substrate), warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), and omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) by  
86%, 56%, and 70%, respectivel y. Based on the magnitude of the decreases in expo sure, 
enzalutamide is considered a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 
and CYP2C19. Substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 with a narrow therapeutic 
index should be avoided when possible, as enzalutamide may  decrease plasma exposur e of 
these drugs. If enzalutamide is coadministered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), additional 
international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring should be conducted. Enzalutamide did not 
cause clinically  meaningful changes in exposure to pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate).  
In a drug -drug interaction study  in health y male volunteers (9785 -CL-0006), a single 160 mg 
oral dose of enzalutamide was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of gemfibrozil 
(strong CYP2C8 inhibitor). Gemfibrozil increased the composite area under the curve from 
time zero to infinity  (AUC 0-∞) of enzalutamide plus N -desmeth yl enzalutamide by 2.2-fold 
with minimal effect on C max; therefore, st rong CYP2C8 inhibitors should be avoided when 
possible as they  can increase plasma exposure to enzalutamide plus N -desmethy l 
enzalutamide .  If coadministration with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is necessary , the dose of 
enzalutamide should be reduced to 80 mgonce daily .If coadministration of the strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose should be returned to the dose used 
prior to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor. The effects of CYP2C8 inducers on the PK 
of enzalutamide have not been evaluated in vivo.
In the drug -drug interaction study  in health y male volunteers (9785 -CL-0006), a single 
160mg oral dose of enzalutamide was administered alone or after multiple oral doses of 
itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor). I traconazole increased the composite AUC 0-∞of 
enzalutamide plus N -desmethy l enzalutamide by 1.3-fold with no effect on C max.As this 
small change is not clinically  meaningful, no starting dose adjustment is needed when 
coadministering enzalutamide with CYP3A4 inhibitors .The effects of CYP3A4 inducers on 
the PK of enzalutamide have not been evaluated in vivo.
Additional information on the PK and drug metabolism of enzalutamide is provided in the 
Enzalutamide I nvestigator Brochure.  
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Enzalutamide
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 5%) in patients treated with enzalutamide (N =800) 
in the Phase 3 study  CPRC2 (AFFI RM) (N =1199) were asthenia/fatigue, back pain, 
diarrhea, arthralgia, hot flush, peripheral edema, musculoskeletal pain, h eadache, upper 
respiratory  infection, muscular weakness, dizziness, insomnia, lower respiratory  infection,

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3spinal cord compression and cauda equina s yndrome, hematuria, paresthesia, anxiety, and 
hypertension. Discontinuations due to adverse events were rep orted for 16% of 
enzalutamide -treated patients and 18% of placebo -treated patients. The most common 
adverse reaction leading to treatment discontinuation was seizure, which occurred in 0.9% of 
the enzalutamide -treated patients and none (0%) of the placebo -treated patients.  
Seizure is an identified risk associated with enzalutamide, based on nonclinical findings, the
results of the dose -escalation study  in patients with CRPC, S -3100 -1-01, and events observed
in subsequent clinical trials. I n Study  S-3100 -1-01, seizures were reported in 3 patients and
identified as dose -limiting toxicities (DL Ts), 1 each at dail y doses of 360, 480 and 600 mg
enzalutamide. No seizures were reported in patients receiving dail y doses of 240 mg
enzalutamide or below in this study . Given the potential risk of seizure associated with
enzalutamide, investigators were instructed to have a heightened vigilance for seizures or an y
events suggesting seizure activity  in the controlled Study  CRPC2 and all subsequent studies. 
In the r andomized clinical trial CRPC2, 7 of 800 (0.9%) patients treated with enzalutamide 160 
mg once dail y experienced a seizure. No seizures occurred in patients treated with placebo. The 
onset of seizure events ranged from 31 to 603 days after initiation of en zalutamide. Patients 
experiencing seizure were permanently  discontinued from enzalutamide therapy  and all seizures 
resolved. There is no clinical trial experience re -administering enzalutamide to patients who 
experienced seizures. The safet y of enzalutamid e in patients with predisposing factors for 
seizure is not known because these patients were excluded from the trial. These exclusion 
criteria included a history  of seizure, underl ying brain injury  with loss of consciousness, 
transient ischemic attack with in the previous 12 months, cerebral vascular accident, brain 
metastases, brain arteriovenous malformation or the use of concomitant medication that may  
lower the seizure threshold. 
As of the cutoff date of 01Jan 2014, seizure occurred in <1% of prostate c ancer patients 
receiving enzalutamide who previously  received docetaxel (chemotherapy ), and < 0.1% of 
prostate cancer patients receiving enzalutamide who had not received chemotherapy .
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment
In the Phase 3 study  CRPC2 (AFFI RM), the pre -specified interim analy sis at the time of 
520events demonstrated a statistically  significant improvement in overall survival in patients 
with metastatic CRPC treated with enzalutamide versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR] =0.631; 
95% CI:0.529, 0.752, p <0.0001). Median survival was 18.4 months in the enzalutamide 
arm and 13.6 months in the placebo arm (Δ =4.8 months). The overall survival benefit was 
consistent across all subgroups, including age, baseline pain intensity , geographic region, and 
type of dis ease progression at entry . Enzalutamide treatment was superior to placebo for all 
secondary  endpoints including proportion of patients with a reduction in PSA level by  
50% or more (54% vs. 2%, p <0.001), soft tissue response rate (29% vs. 4%, p <0.001), 
quality -of-life response rate (43% vs. 18%, p <0.001), time to PSA progression (8.3 vs. 
3.0months; HR 0.25, p <0.001), radiographic PFS (8.3 vs. 2.9 months; HR 0.40, p <0.001), 
and time to first skeletal -related event (16.7 vs. 13.3 months; HR 0.69, p <0.001).  Based on

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3the AFFIRM data, the US FDA approved enzalutamide in August 2012 for men with 
metastatic CRPC who previously  received docetaxel therapy .  
Review of the enzalutamide program safet y information obtained through Jan 2014 
confirmed that th e previously  identified potential risk of seizure is an “important identified 
risk” per International Conference on Harmonisation (I CH) definition, with an estimated 
incidence of <1% based on cumulative data.  In addition to seizures, hy pertension, falls, 
hallucinations, non -pathologic fractures, neutrophil count decrease, and Cognitive/memory  
impairment were defined as important identified risks
The confirmed benefit of enzalutamide in the randomized CRPC2 trial in terms of overall 
survival advantage over placebo indicates a favorable benefit risk profile even in patients 
who were sy stematicall y excluded from clinical studies and may  be at potential increased risk 
of seizure described in this protocol.
This study  will enroll metastatic CRPC patients who hav e at least one risk factor which has 
the potential to increase risk for seizure. All subjects will have a baseline neurology  
assessment prior to treatment initiation with enzalutamide. 
This study  will have anindependent DSMB to monitor the safet y, includ ing being informed 
of every  seizure event occurring during the trials as well as the assessment from the IAC as to 
whether the event actually qualifies as a seizure . 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S
2.1 Study Objective
The study  object iveis to evaluate the seizure rateand monitor the safet y of enzalutamide 
treatment in subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer known to have risk 
factor (s)for seizure .
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This study  is being co nducted to assess the risk of seizure in patients with characteristics that 
were previousl y excluded from clinical studies and to monitor the safety of enzalutamide in 
patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer who are at potential incre ased risk 
ofseizure.
Seizure is an identified important risk and known toxicity  of enzalutamide, based on 
nonclinical findings and the results of the dose -escalation study  in patients with castration 
resistant prostate cancer (S -3100 -1-01) and the AFFIRM study  (CRPC2). However, it needs 
to be noted that the exact mechanism by  which enzalutamide may  lower the seizure threshold 
is not known, but could be related to the affinit y of enzalutamide and the metabolite M2 for 
the GABA -gated chloride channel.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3Risk factors that could contribute to the risk of seizure were exclude din the ongoing and 
closed studies; however, some riskfactors were unknowingl y present in several patients 
which may have independently  increased their risk of seizure (i.e., brain metastas is). 
The current study  will assess to the best of the current knowledge, the risk of seizure in a 
patient population at risk, with the potential limitation that not all factors that could 
contribute to that risk may be known or identified. Additionally , this study  does not include a 
comparator arm, therefore an y comparison to other drugs used in that indication will be 
indirect and onl y reflect the published literature. One additional limitation is that the study 
population may  also not entirely  reflect th e patient population at potential risk as there are 
other inclusion/exclusion criteria that determine enrollment. 
This trial has been designed to anal yze the incidence of seizure in the presence of potent ial 
risk factors . This approach will lead to reducing the potential bias which can be caused b y 
dominating risk factor (s). However, there may  be a situation where very  few patients are 
enrolled with a particular risk factor making estimation of seizure incidence associated with 
that risk fac tor not feasible. 
This is a multicenter, single -arm, open -label, post -marketing safet y study t o evaluate the risk 
of seizure among subjects with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) 
treated with enzalutamide who are at potential increas ed risk of seizure. 
Eligible patients may  be drawn from various sources including hospitals and private practices 
of urologists and oncologists, and community  based organizations where patients will be 
screened for the eligibility criteria of the study . 
Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study  and 
participate in a 4 -month treatment period during which once dail y dosing of enzalutamide 
(160 mg/day ) will occur followed by  an approximate 30-day follow -up visit fo r those who do 
not continue on the extension treatment or prior to the initiation of another anticancer 
therap y, whichever occurs first .
At the end of the 4 -month treatment visit, subjects who are assessed as deriving benefit from 
enzalutamide treatment maycontinue in the extension period where subjects will continue to 
receive enzalutamide until one of the following criteria is met:
1.The subject experience sbone disease progression per PCWG2 guidelines or soft tissue 
disease progression per RECI ST 1.1,
2.Thesubject initiate streatment with another anticancer therap y, orcontinued dosing 
would lead to undue risk to the subject in the opinion of the Investigator, 
3.The subject meet sa discontinuation criterion or, 
4.The Sponsor terminate sthis study .
Subjects who are continuing to receive clinical benefit from treatment with enzalutamide and have 
not met any discontinuation criteria may transition to an open label roll-over extension study upon 
approval of the study protocol at the institution they are receiving treatment.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3Subjects who donot continue in the extension period or who meet a discontinuation criterion 
will be discontinued from enzalutamide therap y and complete a 30-day follow -up visit from 
the last dose of enzalutamide or prior to the initi ation of another anticancer therap y 
whichever occurs first .
When any subject who continues on treatment after his 12 -month extension period, data 
collection will be limited to dosing information , concomitant medications, and all AEs
including serious adver se events (SAEs). 
Each subject will be given a patient card with the following information; a list of signs and 
symptoms of a suspected seizure (Seizure Description Subject I nformation) and a Suspected 
Seizure Event Questionnaire list as well as instructi ons regarding what to do in the event of a 
suspected seizure for awareness. 
The subject will contact the Investigator immediately  (within 24 hours) after onset of a 
suspected seizure event and return to the site with best efforts in 3 day s after event for
evaluation b y the local neurologist.
Investigator will:
Instruct the subject to stop taking the enzalutamide study  drug until after the clinical 
assessment has been completed by  the neurologist. (Note: this could be a temporary  
stoppage, if the event turn s out not to have been deemed a seizure, or is a 1stseizure with 
good benefit/risk ratio for continuing stud y drug.)
Instruct the subject to complete the Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire with input 
from an y witness(es) to suspected events.
Schedule a clinic visit to be evaluated b y the local neurologist.
Evaluation by  a local neurologist is required including electroencephalogram (EEG) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI of the brain ) procedures as soon as possible after a 
potential seizure event occurrence. A description of the events leading up to the seizure will 
be obtained from the individual and an y witnesses. 
The study  site will interview the subject and any  witnesses , if poss ible,regarding the event. 
The study  site will complete a Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire including a Cover 
Sheet which will be signed by  the PI /Sub investigator and included as part of the package to 
the IAC. The site will review the Suspected Seizu re Event Questionnaire completed by  the 
subject , if available. The subject Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire is a tool to capture 
information of the suspected event which the PI/Sub -investigator will utilize for completion 
of their evaluation when avai lable. The Questionnaire completed b y the subject will not be 
collected.
Subjects will be treated as indicated by  the local neurologist including acceptable anti -
convulsants, if indicated.  
If the treating neurologist deems the event not to have been a seizure, enzalutamide may  be 
restarted.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3If the neurologist determines that a seizure has occurred and the event is a first seizure prior 
to the I AC assessment, an allowable anticonvulsant may  be administered on a maintenance 
basis and enzalutamide may  be restarted if desired by  the investigator and subject, AFTER 
confirmation of clinical benefit as assessed b y the Investigator. Results of the assessment of 
the IAC will be provided to the investigator and the subject will be allowed to continue in the 
study  if the event is determined to be a first confirmed seizure.
In the event of a second seizure, enzalutamide will be held until the IAC’s review is 
completed. Upon IAC confirmation of a second seizure, enzalutamide may  not be restarted 
and the subject will b e discontinued from the study . 
All relevant information, including the completed seizure assessment questionnaire, the local 
neurologist ’sevaluation, and results of the MRI of the brain and EEG, will be submitted to 
the IAC for evaluation. Results of the assessment of the IAC will be provided to the 
Investigator and the subject will be allowed to continue in the study  if the event is determined 
to be a first confirmed seizure. I f the seizure isdetermined by  the IAC to be a second 
confirmed seizure event, the subject will be withdrawn from the stud y. If it is determined that 
the event did not meet criteria for a confirmed seizure, the subject can continue in the study  if 
no other discontinuation criteria have been met.
Disease assessments should be performed regularly  per standard of care or when there is 
clear clinical evidence of progression, while the subj ects are receiving enzalutamide and also 
upon confirmation of a first seizure to confirm clinical risk/benefit profile to continue 
enzalutamide.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
A dose of 160 mg enzalutamide (four 40 mg capsules) once daily  administered orally  is the 
recommended daily  dose by regulatory  agencies in countries where the drug has been approved . 
2.3 Endpoints 
2.3.1 Primary Endpoints
The proportion of evaluabl e subjects with at least one confirmed seizure as adjudicated by 
the Independent Adjudication Committee (I AC) during the 4 -month treatment duration. 
An evaluable subject is defined as a subject with a confirmed seizure during the 4 -month 
treatment period of the study  or who completed at least 3 months (75%) of the planned 
treatment. Onl y an enrolled subject who discontinues the study before completing 3 months 
on treatment may  be replaced at the discretion of the Sponsor, however, an enrolled subject 
who i s discontinued due to a confirmed seizure event will not be replaced.
A cumulative summary  to include all seizure events, including those occurring bey ond the 
4 month treatment period will be included.
In case the drop -out rate is higher than expected, a ppropriate method such as Kaplan -Meier 
estimations may  be considered .

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3The subject will contact the Investigator immediately  (within 24 hours) after onset of a 
suspected seizure event and return to the site with best efforts in 3 day s after event for 
evaluation b y the local neurologist.
Investigator will:
Instruct the subject to stop taking the enzalutamide study  drug until after the clinical 
assessment has been completed by  the neurologist. (Note: this could be a temporary  
stoppage, if the event turns out not to have been deemed a seizure, or is a 1stseizure with 
good benefit/risk ratio for continuing stud y drug.)
Instruct the subject to complete the Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire with input 
from an y witness(es) to suspected events. 
Schedule a clinic visit to be evaluated b y the local neurologist.
Evaluation by  a local neurologist is required including electroencephalogram (EEG) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures as soon as possible after a potential seizure 
event occurrence. A description of t he events leading up to the seizure will be obtained from 
the individual and an y witnesses. 
The study  site will interview the subject and any  witnesses , if possible, regarding the event. 
The study  site will complete a Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire including a Cover 
Sheet which will be signed by  the PI /Sub-Investigator and included as part of the package to 
the IAC. The site will review the Suspected Seizure Event Questionnaire completed by  the 
subject ,if available . The subject Suspected Seizure Ev ent Questionnaire is a tool to capture 
information of the suspected event which the PI/Sub -Investigator will utilize for completion 
of their evaluation when available. The Questionnaire completed b y the subject will not be 
collected.
Subjects will be treat ed as indicated by  the local neurologist including acceptable anti -
convulsants. Anticonvulsant substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9  or CYP2C19 with a narrow 
therapeutic index are notpermitted (e.g., anticonvulsant medications including carbamazepine, 
pheny toin, phenobarbital, primidone, felbamate, vigabatrin, and retigabine). 
Subjects may continue on enzalutamide at the discretion of Investigator while the evaluation 
for a first possible seizure is ongoing. The dose of enzalutamide may  be continued while the 
subject is on treatment with anticonvulsant therapy . If a subject experiences a second 
confirmed seizure by IAC, the subject will be discontinued from the stud y.
All relevant information, including the completed seizure assessment questionnaire, the local 
neurologist ’sevaluation, and results of the MRI of the brain and EEG, will be submitted to 
the IAC for evaluation. Results of the assessment of the IAC will be provided to the 
Investigator and the subject will be allowed to continue in the study  if the ev ent is determined 
to be a first confirmed seizure. I f the seizure is determined by  the IAC to be a second 
confirmed seizure event in the study , the subject will be withdrawn from the study . If it is 
determined that the event did not meet criteria for a con firmed seizure, the subject can 
continue in the study  if no other discontinuation criteria have been met.

5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION
5.1 Dosing and Administration of Enzalutamide and Other Medication(s)
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
Subjects will be instructed to take 4 capsules (40 mg each) per day orall y. Enzalutamide may 
be taken with or without food and should be taken as close to the same time each day  as 
possible. The total duration of treatment is 4 months. At the end of the 4 -month treatment 
period, subjects who are assessed as deriving benefit from enzalutamide treatment may
continue in the extension period . Subjects in the extension period may continue to receive 
enzalutamide until they experience bone disease progression per PCWG2 guidelines or soft 
tissue disease progression per RECI ST 1.1, they initiate treatment with another anticancer 
therap y, continued dosing would lead to undue risk to the subject in the opinion of the 
Investigator, they  meet a discontinuation criterion or the Sponsor terminates the study . The 
total study  drug treatment duration for the extended period will depend on individual clinical 
benefit to enzalutamide treatment. 
Subjects who are continuing to receive clinical benefit from treatment with enzalut amide and 
have not met an y discontinuation criteria may transition to an open label roll-over extension 
study  upon approval of the study  protocol at the institution they  are receiving treatment at.
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of Enzalutamide
Subjects who experience a Grade 3 or higher toxicity  that is attributed to enzalutamide and 
cannot be ameliorated b y the used of adequate medical intervention may interrupt treatment 
with enzalutamide for 1 week or until the toxicity  grade improves to Grade 2 or lower
severit y. Subsequently, study drug dosing may be restarted at the original dose (160 mg/day ) 
or a reduced dose (120 or 80 mg/day ) in consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
If the adverse event is considered not related to enzalutamide by  the Investigator , enzalutamide 
may be resumed at the same dose. 
If the adverse event is considered possibly  or probably  related to enzalutamide, enzalutamide 
may be resumed with medical monitor approval either at the same dose or at a reduced dose 
of 120 or 80 mg/day  once daily .

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3If enzalutamide is co -administered with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of enzalutamide 
should be reduced to 80 mg once dail y. If co -administration of strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is 
discontinued, the enzalutamide dose should return to the dose us ed prior to initiation of the 
strong CYP2C8 inhibitor.
The Sponsor Medical Monitor may  be contacted with any  questions or concerns on managing 
dose.
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment (Medication and Non-Medication
Therapy )
Medication taken within four wee ks prior to Screening visit willbe collected. 
All concomitant medications must be documented at each visit, at the time of discontinuation, 
and at the 30 day  follow -up visit. 
The following medications are prohibited during the course of the study : 
●Therapies to treat prostate cancer including but not limited to:
oCytotoxic chemotherap y 
oHormonal therapies (e.g., anti -androgens, abiraterone acetate, estrogens; testosterone, 
dehy droepiandrosterone [DHEA], etc.), 5 -alpha reductase inhibitors, ketoconazol e;
oAnticonvulsant substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 with a narrow 
therapeutic index (e.g., carbamazepine, pheny toin, phenobarbital, and primidone are 
not permitted in this study. Felbamate, vigabatrin, and retigabine are also not 
permitted for reason s of potential toxicity . 
●Note: GnRH analogues (agonists or antagonists), bone -targeting agents, such as 
bisphosphonates and denosumab, and glucocorticoids are allowed. Palliative radiotherap y 
is also allowed (provided the subject does not meet discontinua tion criteria).
●Any other investigational agent.
There is a potential for enzalutamide to affect exposures to other medicinal products, or for 
other medicinal products to affect exposure to enzalutamide:
●Strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) or inducers (e.g. rifampicin) are to be 
avoided.  If subject must be co -administered a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor, the dose of 
enzalutamide must be reduced to 80 mg once daily . If a co -administration of the strong 
inhibitor is discontinued, the enzalutamide dose should be returned to the dose used prior 
to initiation of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor.
●Enzalutamide is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and a moderate inducer of CYP2C9 and 
CYP2C19. Uridine 5’ -diphospho -glucuronos yltransferase (UGT1A1) may  also be induced.  
Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range that are substrates of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 should be used with caution when administered 
concomitantly  with enzalutamide and may  require dose adjustment to maintain therapeutic 
plasma concentr ations. Such substrates include, but are not limited to:

oBenzodiazepines (e.g. diazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam)
oImmune modulators (e.g. cy closporine, tacrolimus)
oHIV antivirals (e.g. indinavir, ritonavir)
oAnti-epileptics (e.g. phenobarbit al, phen ytoin). 
oCoumarins (e.g. warfarin)
●If enzalutamide is co -administered with warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate), additional I NR 
monitoring should be conducted.
●Medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic range th at are substrates for P -gp (e.g., 
digoxin, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate) or for the breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) 
or the multidrug resistance -associated protein 2 (MRP2), should be used with caution 
when administered concomitantly  with enzalut amide and may  require dose adjustment to 
maintain optimal plasma concentrations.
●No other new s ystemic therapy  or new radiotherapy  for treatment (exception for spinal 
cord compression, pain management, etc) for prostate cancer is permitted while subject is
on the study . Subjects with pre -existing non -target lesions (e.g., bone metastases) 
receiving palliative radiograph y for pain treatment before participation in the study are 
allowed to continue receiving radiotherap y during the study.
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance
Study  subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study  drug.  
Investigator or designee should ensure that study  subjects meet this goal throughout the study  
period. Compliance will be verified b y the accounting of stud y drug at each monthly  visit
after Baseline. When study  drug is administered at the research facility , it will be
administered under the supervision of study  personnel.
Compliance of the study  drug will be monitored by  the accounting of unused medication
returned b y the subject at visits. Compliance will be documented.
If compliance is 80%, the Investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps
are taken to improve compliance. Subjects who are less than 80% compliant with the dosage
regimen for an y two consecutive visit periods during the study  should be withdrawn from the
study .
Treatment compliance should be monitored closely  and deviation in compliance should be 
reported to the Sponsor.
5.1.5 Criteria for Continuation of Treatment 
At the end of the 4 -month treatment visit, subjects who are assessed as deriving benefit from 
enzalutamide treatment may continue in theextension period. S ubjects in the extension 
period will continue to receive enzalutamide until they experience bone dis ease progression 
per PCWG2 guidelines or soft tissue disease progression per RECI ST 1.1, they initiate 
treatment with another anticancer therap y, continued dosing would lead to undue risk to the

5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events (AEs)
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AEcan therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., lab oratory  parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, ph ysical exam) should be defined as an AE only  if the abnormality  meets one of the 
following criteria:
●Induces clinical signs or sy mptoms
●Requires active intervention
●Requires interruption or discontinuation of stud y medication
●The abnormalit y or investigational value is clinically  significant in the opinion of the 
Investigator.
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE. I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these AEs or other reporting requirement s are followed 
and the information is appropriatel y recorded in the eCRF accordingl y. 
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAE s)
An adverse event is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any  of the foll owing outcomes:
●Results in death
●Is life threatening ( an adverse event is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse eve nt that, had it occurred in a more severe form, 
might have caused death)
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect
●Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious)
●Other medicall y important events
For the purpose of this study ,all potential seizures will be reported as SAEs. Seizure s
due to enzalutamide overdose will be reported similar to all other seizure events.
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3subject or may  require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These events , including those that may  result in disability /incapacit y, 
should also usually  be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency  room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions 
that do not re sult in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, background therap y) that may require expedited reporting and/ or 
safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
●Overdose of the medicinal product(s)
●Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)
●Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)
●Medication error involving the medicinal product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)
All of the events of interest noted above should be recorded on the (e)CRF. Any  situation 
involving these events of interest that also meets the criteria for an SAE should be recorded 
on the AE page of the (e)CRF and marked ‘serious’ onthe SAE worksheet.
The Sponsor has a list of events that they  classify  as “alway s serious” events.  I f an adverse 
event is reported that is considered to be an event per thisclassification as “alway s serious”, 
additional information on the event may  be requested.
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug
Adverse events that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as "adverse 
events whose relation ship to the study  drugs could not be ruled out" .
Causal relationship
to the study drugCriteria for ca usal relationship
Not Related A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
temporal  relationship to drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and /orin  which other drugs, chemicals or 
underly ing disease provide plausible explanations.
Possible A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may  be lacking or 
unclear.
Probable A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormality , with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikel y to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or  other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically  reasonable response on re -administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).

report will be submitted to the I RB/I EC where required .SUSAR will be submitted to the 
authorities by  means of a MedWatch report (FDA) or an E2B report (Eudravigilance) .
5.5.6 Follow -up ofAdverse Events
Adverse event collection will begin at the time of the first dose of study  drug and continue 
through approximately  30 day s post last dose or immediately prior to start of another 
antineoplastic therap y. All adverse events reported during thissafety reporting period are to 
be followed at appropriate intervals until resolution oruntil judged to b e no longer clinicall y 
significant, or until the event become schronic to the extent that the event can be full y 
characterized or until new antineoplastic treatment is initiated. 
If during AE follow -up, the adverse event progresse sto an"SAE ", or if a subject experiences 
a new SAE , the Investigator must immediately  report the information to the Sponsor . 
Please refer to Appendix 12.2 Liver Safet y Monitoring and Assessment for detailed
instructions on Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI).
5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events
Common serious adverse events are SAEs commonly  anticipated to occur in the study  
population independent of drug exposure. SAEs classified as “common” are provided in 
Appendix 12.3 Common Serious Adverse Events for y our reference. The list does NOT change 
your reporting obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an 
SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to alert you that some events reported as 
SAEs may  not require expedited reporting to the regulatory  authorities based on the 
classification of “common serious adverse events” as specified in Appendix 12.3 Common

study  for any  change in frequency .Any changes to this list will be communicated to the 
participating investigational sites. I nvestigators must report individual occurrences of these 
events as stated in Section 5.5.5 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events . 
5.5.8 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If during the conduct of a clinical trial (from first dose through the safety  follow -up period 
approximately  30 days after discontinuation of dosing), a male subject makes his partner 
pregnant, the subject should report th e pre gnancy  to the Investigator. The Investigator will 
report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor in the same manner as an SAE. 
The expected date of delivery  or expected date of t he end of the pregnancy , last menstruation, 
estimated conception date, pregnancy  result and neonatal data etc., should be included in this 
information.
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy  is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.
The Investigator should repo rt the outcome of the pregnancy  (independent of outcome, e.g., 
full term delivery , pre-term delivery , spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn, congenital anomaly  (including ano maly  in a miscarried fetus ), in accordance 
with the same report ingprocedure as for SAE s. The date of outcome of the pregnancy , 
gestational age, date of birth and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this information. 
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy  (which is categorized as an 
SAE ) is mentioned below.
●"Spontaneous abortion "includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion
●Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE regardless of 
itsrelationship with the study  drug
●If an infant dies more than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as "possible "by 
the Investigator
●In the case of a delive ry of a living newborn, the "normality "of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth
●Unless a congenital anomaly  are identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embry o or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects b y visual examination
5.5.9 Eme rgency Procedures and Management of Overdose
There is no antidote for enzalutamide. I n the event of an overdose, stop treatment with 
enzalutamide and initiate general supportive measures based on the clinical presentation of 
the patient. Subjects may be at increased risk of seizure following an overdose.
5.5.10 Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study
When new information becomes available necessary  for conducting the clinical study  
properl y, the Sponsor will inform all Investigators involved in the clinical study  as well as

5.7 Other Measurements, Assessments or Methods
5.7.1 Blood Sample for Future PGx Analysis (Retrospective PGx Analysis) 
A PGx research may  be conducted i n the future to anal yzeor determine genes of relevance to 
clinical response, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity /safet y issues. Any time  during the Screening 
Period , and after the patient has signed the study  PGx informed consent form (see s chedule of 
assessments), a 5 mL sample of whole blood for possible retrospective PGx analy siswill be 
collected using a vacutainer tube containing EDTA. After collection, gently  invert the blood 
sample 8 to 10 times. The blood collection tube may  either be stored upr ight at 4°C for up to 
5 day s prior to shipment or stored frozen at - 20°C or below at the site for extended storage. 
Samples will be shipped to a Sponsor designated banking CRO.
Labels should uniquely  identify  each sample and contain at least:
●Protocol number (9785 -CL-0403),
●Subject number, and
●Purpose and biolog ical matrix (i.e., “biobanking”, “whole blood”).
Details on sample collection, labeling, storage and shipment procedures will be provided in a 
separate laboratory  manual.
See Appendix 12.4, Retrospective PGx Sub -study for further details on the banking procedures .
5.8 Total Amount of Blood
The total amount of blood collected for each subjects will vary depending on how long the 
subjects stay s on the study . Ifa subject is found to have laboratory  abnormalities or adverse 
events, additional blood may  be drawn for evaluation and/or monitoring. Additional diagnostic 
blood for routine work may  also be drawn. 
In addition, the total amount of blood collected for each subject for the optional pharmaco -
genomics (PGx) sample is approximately  4-6mL.
6 DISCONTINUATION
6.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subject(s) 
A discontinuation is a subject who enrolled in the study and for whom study  treatment is 
permanentl y discontinued for any reason.  
Subjects who are continuing to receive clinical benefit from treatment with enzalutamide and have 
not met any discontinuation criteria may transition to an open label extension stu dy upon approval of 
the study protocol at the institution they are receiving treatment at.  The subject is free to withdraw
from the study  treatment and/or study  for any  reason and at any  time without giving reason

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3for doing so and without penalty  or preju dice. The Investigator is also free to terminate a 
subject 's involvement in the study  at any  time if the subject 's clinical condition warrants it.
If a subject is discontinued from the study  with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is significantly  outside of the reference range, the Investigator will attempt 
to provide follow -up until the condition stabilizes or no longer is clinicall y significant. 
The following safet y/compliance events will result in the removal of subjects f rom 
enzalutamide therap yand from the study if:
●Any adverse event that is intolerable to the subject and that cannot be ameliorated by  the 
use of adequate medical intervention, or that in the opinion of the Investigator would lead 
to undue risk to the subj ect if dosing continued;  
●Any first confirmed seizure requiring treatment with maintenance anticonvulsant therap y
if the only  anticonvulsant( s) the patient can tolerate is carbamazepine, pheny toin, 
phenobarbital, primidone, felbamate, vigabatrin, or retigabine.
●Any second seizure confirmed by  inde pendent adjudication committee;
● Inability  to maintain the absolute neutrophil count above 500/ µL(Grade 4) or 500-
1000 /µL (Grade 3) with evidence of infection ;
●Inability  to maintain the platelet count above 25,000/ µL(Grade 4) or 25,000 -50,000/ µL 
(Grade 3) with spontaneous bleeding ;
●Subject who has unequivocal evidence of disease progression (upon bone disease 
progression per PCWG2 guidelines or soft tissue disease progression per RECI ST 1.1) or 
is no longer deriving clinical benefit;
●Subject who is, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor, grossly  non-
compliant with the protocol’s requirements.
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued from the study . The Investigator may  determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  enrollm ent. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if :
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metast ases
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/
evaluated )
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 ×ULN in patients with liver metast ases)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). 
6.2 Discontinuation of the Site

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 36.3 Discontinuation of the Study
The Sponsor may  terminate this study  prematurely , either in its entirety  or at any  study  site, 
for reas onable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination .Advance notice is not required if the study  is stopped due to safety  concerns. If 
the Sponsor terminates the study  for safet y reasons, the Sponsor will immediate ly notify  the 
Investigator and subsequently  provide written instructions for study  termination.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
The statistical anal ysis will be coordinated by  the responsible biostatistician of APGD . A 
Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analy sis, along with 
specification for tables, listings, and figures to be produced. The SAP will be finalized before 
the database soft lock at the latest. An y changes from the anal yses planned in SAP will be 
justified in the Clinical Study  Report (CSR).
Prior to database lock, a final review of data and Table L isting Figures (TLFs) meeting will 
be held to allow a review of the clinical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for 
analysis set classification. If required, consequences for the statistical analysis will be 
discussed and documented. A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications may  also be 
held prior to database lock. 
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints.
7.1 Sample Size
Approximately  four hundred (400) subjects will be enrolled to target approximately  350 
evaluab le subjects ,assuming a drop-outrate of approximately  13% for this population and 
based on the recommendation from the FDA, respectivel y.Assuming the true incidence of 
seizure in the first 4 months as 0.93%, based on the incidence rate of 2.8 per 100 pat ient 
years, which is obtained from the previous studies and the sample size of 350, the chance of 
observing 5 or less subjects with seizure events is 88.9%. Given 5 out of 350 subjects, i.e ., 
point estimate of 1.43%, the upper limit 95% exact confidence in terval will be 3.31 % and the 
width of the exact con fidence interval will be 2.84%.
7.2 Analysis Set
7.2.1 Safety Analysis Set (SAF)
For the statistical summary  of the safet y data, the safet y analysis set (SAF) will be used. The 
SAF consists of all subjects who took at least one dose of study  medication, and will be used 
for safety  anal yses.Detailed criteria for analy sis sets will be laid out in Classification 
Specifications and the allocation of subjects to analy sis sets will be determined prior to 
database hard-lock.

For the statistical summary  and anal ysis of seizure events, seizure risk evaluation set (SRES) 
will be used by including all evaluable subjects. An evaluable subject is defined as a subject 
with a confirmed sei zure during the 4 -month treatment period of the study  or who completed 
at least 3 months (75%) of the planned treatment.
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographics and other baseline characteristics will be summarized for the SAF. 
Descri ptive statistics will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
median and maximum for continuous endpoints, and frequency  and percentage for 
categorical endpoints.
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy
Efficacy  data will be collected at baseline and at the time of seizure event for this study . No 
statistical analy sis will be conducted. Instead ,disease assessments including clinical, radio -
graphic and/or PSA assessments collected will be listed .
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
Primary  endpoint, the proportion of evaluable subjects with at least one confirmed seizure as 
adjudicated b y the IAC during the 4 -month treatment duration will be anal yzed estimated 
using point estimate and its 95% exact confidence interval using all SRES.
In case the drop -out rate is higher than expected, appropriate method such as Kaplan -Meier 
estimations [Kaplan and Meier, 1958; Greenwood, 1926 ]may be considered to efficientl y 
estimate the proportion of seizure events with accounting for the censored observations in the 
SAF.
7.4.1.2 Secondary Analysis
The same anal ysis of the primary  endpoint as described in 7.4.1.1 will be conducted for a 
cumulative proportion to include all seizure events, including those occurring beyondthe 
4 month -treatment period using all SRES. Incidence of seizure events per patient -time 
exposure will be summarized. 
7.4.1.3 Subgroup Analysis
In case subgroups which may  have association with the risk of  seizure are identified during 
the study , the incidence of s eizure events will be summarized using a proportion estimate and 
its 95% exact confidence interval for the subgroups of the SRES.
7.5 Analysis of Safety
7.5.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and

number and percentage of AEs b y severity will also be summarized. All AEs will be listed.
7.5.2 Laboratory Assessments 
For quantitative laboratory measurements descriptive statistics will be used to summarize 
results and change from baseline b y time point . Using the definitions provided in the NCI 
CTCAE Version 4.03, lab values will be classified as Grade 1 through 5, where possible. 
Shifts from baseline will be tabulated regar ding either normal ranges or CTC CTCAE grade. 
Laboratory  data will be display ed in listings and summary  tables.
7.5.3 Vital Signs
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize vital sign results and changes from baseline 
by time point . Vital signs data will be display ed in listings and summary  tables .
7.5.4 Physical Examination Including Neurological Status
Physical examination including neurological status will be summarized .
7.5.5 ECGs 
The 12 -lead ECG results will be summarized.
7.6 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics
Nopharmacokinetic analysis is planned.
7.7 Analysis of Pharmacodynamics
No pharmacod ynami cs analy sis is planned.
7.8 Protocol Deviations and Other Analyses   
Protocol deviations as defined in Section 8.1.6 Protocol Deviations will be listed by site and 
subject.
Theprotocol deviation criteria will be uniquely  identified in the listing. The unique 
identifiers will be as follows:
PD1 -Entered in to the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria, 
PD2 -Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not withdrawn,
PD3 -Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,
PD4 -Received excluded concomitant treatment. 
7.9 Interim Analysis ( and Early Discontinuation of Subjects Subgroup )
No formal interim anal ysis is planned for a specific timepoint .
The DSMB will examine safet y data and be informed on seizure events as expediently  as 
possible. Statistical boundaries for continuously  monitoring of the seizure event will be 
provided in the DSMB charter as a guidance for early  stopping criteria. The DSMB will use 
them to appropriatel y recommend either stop the enrollment of specific risk factor group (s)

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3identified during the DSMB review period or in extreme circumstance DSMB may  ask 
sponsor to stop the study . 
The study  design considers earl y stopping criteria that can be applied to a study as a whole or 
a specific risk factor group, if any , based on the statistical boundary  calculated from 
Maximized Sequential Probability  Ratio Test [Kulldorff, 2011 ]. Statistic al boundary  will be 
provided in the DSMB charter. Evaluation of the seizure risk is performed by  DSMB for the 
study  as a whole and for the risk factor group at the same time using the same stopping 
boundary  based on false stopping probability  of 0.1. Recom mendation will be made b y 
DSMB to either stop the study  or stop further enrollment of a specific risk factor group.
7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will be done. Exceptions are the start and 
stop dates of AEs and concomitant medication. The imputed dates will be used to determin e
whether an AE is/is not treatment emergent. Listings of the AEs and concomitant medications 
will present the actual partial dates; imput ed dates will not be shown.

8.1 Procedure for Clinical Study Quality Control
8.1.1 Data Collection
The Investigator or site designe e will enter data collected using an Electronic Data Capture 
(EDC) s ystem. In the interest of collecting data in the most efficient manner, the Investigator
or site designee should record data (including laboratory  values, if applicable) in the eCRF 
within the timeframe defined for the stud yafter the subject visit.
The Investigator or site designee is responsible to ensure that all data in the eCRFs and 
queries are accurate and complete and that all entries are verifiable with source documents. 
These docum ents should be appropriatel y maintained by the site.
The monitor should verify  the data in the eCRFs with source documents and confirm that 
there are no inconsistencies between them.
Laboratory  tests are performed at local laboratory . 
For Screen failures the demographic data, reason for failing, informed consent, inclusion and 
exclusion criteria will be collected in the eCRF.
8.1.2 Specification of Source Documents
Source data must be available at the site to document the existence of the study  subjects and 
to substantiate the integrity  of study  data collected. Source data must include the original 
documents relating to the study , as well as the medical treatment and medical history  of the 
subject.

any subject who: 
●Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria. 
●Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and not withdrawn .
●Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose. 
●Received excluded concomitant treatme nt. 
When a deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the Investigator or 
designee must ensure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor will follow -up with the 
Investigator , as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y and / 
or efficacy  of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the Investigator must contact the Sponsor 
imme diately .
The Investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  authori ties will be provided to the

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 312.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study  with active drug therapy  who reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN (to > 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases), 
or bilirubin > 2 × ULN , should undergo detailed testing for liver enzy mes (including at least 
ALT, AST, A LP, and TBL) . Testing should be repeated within 48 -72 hours of notification of 
the test results. For studies in which a central laboratory  is used, alerts will be generated b y the 
central lab regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality  to inform the Investigator , study  
monitor and study  team. Subjects should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of 
hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Definition of Liver Abnormalities
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Moderate > 3 x ULN (in patients without 
liver metastases), > 5 x ULN (in 
patients with liver metastases)or > 2 x ULN
Severe* > 3 x ULN and > 2 x ULN
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any  of 
the following:
●ALT or AST > 8 ×ULN
●ALTor AST > 5 ×ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metast ases)
●ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated).
●ALT or AST > 3 ×ULN with the appearan ce of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%). 
The Investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may  qualify  as moderate or severe abnorm alities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly  
characterized b y obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , phy sical 
examination and laboratory  tests. The site should complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report 
Form (LA -eCRF) that has been developed globally  and can be activated for the study . Subjects 
with confirmed abnormal liver function testing should be followe d as described below. 
Confirmed moderatel y abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2 -3 times weekly  then weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above , in the absence of another 
etiology may beconsidered an important medical event and may be reported as a Serious

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3Adverse Event (SAE). The Sponsor should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom 
severe hepatic live r function abnormalities possibly  attributable to study  drug are observed.
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory  findings, the Investigator is expected to:
●Obtain a more detailed history  of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. Sy mptoms 
and n ew onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘adverse events’ on the AE page of 
(e)CRF . Illnesses and conditions such as hy potensive events, and de compensated cardiac 
disease that may lead to secondary  liver abnormalities should be noted. Non -alcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH) is seen in obese h yperlipoproteinemic, and/or diabetic patients 
and may  be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The Investigator should 
ensure that the medical history  form captures any  illness that pre -dates study  enrollment 
that may  be relevant in assessing hepatic function.    
●Obtain a history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription medication, 
complementary  and alternative medica tions), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose, should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the (e)CRF . Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -eCRF or an appropriate document.
●Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents.
●Based on the subject’s history , other testing may  be appropriate including: 
○acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents). 
○ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary  tract disease
○other laboratory  tests including INR, direct bilirubin
●Consider gastroenterology or hepatology  consultations .
●Submit results for any  additional testing and possible etiology  on the LA -eCRF or an 
appropriate document.
Stud y Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre -existing or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury , the subject may  be discontinued fro m the study . The Investigator may determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue study  enrollment. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects witho ut liver metast ases
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is 
applicable/evaluated )
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 ×ULN in patients with liver metast ases)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia ( > 5%). 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory  tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 312.4 Retrospective PG xSub-Study
INTRODUCTION
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment 
options are best suited for the subject . Through investigation of PGx by  technologies such as 
genot yping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy or toxicity  
may be better understood. As many  diseases may  be influenced b y one or more genetic 
variations, PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the way  a 
subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
OBJECTIVES
The PGx research t hat may  be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine genes of relevance 
to clinical response, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variat ions, it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
SUBJECT PARTICIPATION
Subjects who have consented to participate in this study  may  participate in this PGx sub-
study . As part of this sub -study , subjects must provide separate written consent prior to 
providing an y blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analy sis.
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study  will provide one 4-6 ml  tube of whole 
blood per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by  the unique subject number 
(first code). Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO either directly  from 
site or via a central l aboratory  as directed by  Astellas.
BANKING CRO STORAGE AND SAMPLE CODING 
Once received at the banking CRO, the samples will be assigned a unique sample code (second 
code) and stored frozen. A table linking the subject number (first code) with the newl y-assigned 
sample code (second code) will be kept b y thebanking CRO. 
PGx ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analy sis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that genetic variants may  be influencing the d rug’s 
kinetics, efficacy  and / or safety. Prior to initiating any  anal ysis on the banked samples, the 
Astellas ethical committee (AREC) must approve the anal ysis plan.

Version 3.1 Incorporating Non-Substantial Amendment 3DISPOSAL OF PGx SAMPLES / DATA
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following stud y 
database hardlock. If there is no requirement for analy sis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroy ed after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw co nsent at 
any time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be 
destroy ed. The results of any  PGx anal ysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will 
be retained at Astellas indefinitely .
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO THE SUBJECTS
Exploratory  PGx analy sis may  be conducted following the conclusion of the clinical study , if 
applicable. The results of the genetic analy sis will not be provided to any  Investigator sor 
subjects, nor can the results be requested at a later date. Any information that is obtained 
from the PGx analy sis will be the propert y of Astellas.

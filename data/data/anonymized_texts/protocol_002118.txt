 This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo contr olled, prospective clinical trial to 148 
be conducted at a single center  over 46  weeks  (40 weeks on -treatment) . There are two 149 
treatment arms.  Patients will be randomized to liraglutide 3.0 administered once a day by 150 
subcutaneous injection or matching placebo,  in addition to a reduced -calorie diet and increased 151 
physical activity.  All participants will be prescribed a 500 kcal per day deficit diet, based on 152 
estimated 24 -h energy expenditure.1  All participants will be instructed to maintain physical 153 
activity at the recommended level of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week.  154 
 155 
Trial Population:  156 
Planned number of subjects to be screened:  356 (2:1 screen to randomizat ion ratio)  157 
Planned number of subjects to be treated in run -in period : 214 158 
Planned number of subjects to be randomized/started on trial medication(s) :178 159 
Anticipated number of subjects to be studied : At least 128 completers  160 
Number of trial sites: Single center 161 
 162 
Sample Size:  163 
This trial is powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the percent relative reduction 164 
in VAT.  The estimates used in the sample size calculations below are derived from prior data 165 
from the SCALE program.  Assuming a mean 8 % relative reduction of VAT  among placebo 166 
treate d subjects and an expected 16 % relative reduction of VAT among liraglutide treated 167 
subjects ( with a standard deviation of 16%, based on data from [2]), we expect to require 128 168 
total subjects (in a 1:1 trial drug:placebo randomization scheme) to achieve 80 % power to 169 
detect a n 8% difference between groups at an alpha level of  0.05.  Assuming an estimated 28 % 170 
of subject s may withdraw trial medication during the trial, we expect a planned total of 178 171 
patients will be randomized in order to achieve at least  128 completers of the full trial protocol.  172

Trial Products:  258 
Liraglutide will be administered at a concentration of 6.0 mg/mL.  Liraglutide and placebo will be 259 
supplied in a 3 mL pen-injector .  Subjects will fo llow a fixed dose escalation and in order to 260 
reduce the level of side effects, liraglutide is gradually escalated up to the maintenance dose. 261 
Subjects will be instructed to escalate the liraglutide (active or plac ebo) dose to 3.0 mg/day over 262 
a 4 week perio d following an initial dose of 0.6 mg/day and weekly dose escalation steps of 0.6 263 
mg/day.  If subjects do not tolerate an increase in dose during dose -escalation, the Investigator 264 
will have the option to delay the next dose escalation for approximately one week . 265

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : 278 
 279 
Section 1: Obesity and Cardiovascular  Risk 280 
Obesity has long bee n recognized as a risk factor for all-cause mortality4 and morbidity, 281 
including the  development of cardiovascular and metabolic disease s such as cor onary artery 282 
disease, hyper tension, insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.5  Obesity has recently 283 
been formally defined as a chronic disease characterized by pathophysiological processes that 284 
result in increased adipose tissue mass a nd can result in increased morbidity and mortality.6  285 
Although the health risks associated with obesity are clear, there is an emerging appreciation 286 
that obesity per se , as defined by simple anthropometric measures such as waist circumference 287 
or body mass index (BMI), is neither necessary nor sufficient to promote cardiometabolic 288 
disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) risk. As a result, BMI alone is an 289 
insufficient marker of risk and may not accurately identify individuals at elevated risk for 290 
ASCVD.7  There is a pressing need to more accurately phenoty pe obesity to identify individuals 291 
at elevated risk for ASCVD that may benefit from more intensive preventive and therapeutic 292 
strategies.  293 
 294 
Section 2: Visceral adipose tissue as a key marker of CV Risk  295 
It appears that risk for ASCVD and metabolic diseases v aries substantially by distribution of 296 
body fat, as well as by adipocyte size and function.  Excess intra -abdominal (i.e. visceral) 297 
adipose tissue (VAT) may be a primary driver of the cardiometabolic complications of obesity8, 298 
and ectopic fat linked to VAT may itself play a key contributory role.  An increase in VAT is 299 
thought to reflect the relative inability of the subcutaneous adipose tissue depot to sufficientl y 300 
expand its clearance and storage capacity in response to caloric excess.9  Defects in adipocyte 301 
maturation and differentiation10 cause adipocyte dysfunction, resulting in spillover of excess 302 
triglycerides and promotion of ectopic fat deposition in the viscera, liver, heart, and skeletal 303 
muscle.  The ensuing milieu of overactive lipolysis, altere d glucose homeostasis, pro - 304 
inflammatory adipocytokine release, and endothelial dysfunction appears to be a primary cause 305 
of the pathophysiological alterations observed in obesity related cardiometabolic disease.  306 
 307 
Although more simplistic anthropomorphic me asures of abdominal obesity, such an increased 308 
waist circumference , identify  individuals at increased risk for atherosclerosis11 and mortality 309 Trial periods  Scre

 across different leve ls of BMI12, it is an imprecise surrogate for the VAT phenotype.  First, the 310 
correlation between BMI, waist circumference, and VAT is highly variable among differ ent racial 311 
groups, prompting the American Diabetes Association and the International Diabetes Federation 312 
to define different cutoffs for abnormal BMI and waist circumference, respectively, in Asian 313 
populations .13,14  Second, waist circumference measurement includes both VAT and abdominal 314 
subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) compartments.  These two depots are anatomi cally and 315 
physiologically distinct, especially within the obese population, and are differentially associated 316 
with markers of cardiometabolic risk .15  VAT, but not abdominal subcutaneous fat, has been 317 
shown to associate with incident T2D and pre -T2D16, incident hypertension17, and alterations in 318 
left ventricular structure and function18, and has also been linked to increased risk of developing 319 
ASCVD and cancer .19  Medical treatments that reduce VAT mass may translate into improved 320 
major adverse cardiac event (MACE) -free survival.  321 
 322 
Section 3: Liraglutide 3.0  323 
GLP-1: Physiology and current literature   324 
In response to a meal, GLP -1, an incretin hormone secreted from the L -cells in the lower gut, 325 
stimulates endogenous insulin secretion in a glucose -dependent manner, decreases blood 326 
glucagon levels, reduces gastric emptying and increases satiety.  GLP -1 reduces appetite in 327 
lean and normal weight individuals, as well as in obese individuals, and has been shown to 328 
reduce body weight. The combination of these mechanisms makes GLP -1 receptor stimulation 329 
an attractive mechanism to investigate for weight management.   330 
 331 
Liraglutide  332 
Liraglutide 3.0 mg (Saxenda®, Novo Nordisk, Ba gsvaerd, Denmark) is a glucagon -like peptide 333 
(GLP -1) receptor agonist indicated as an adjunct to a reduced -calorie diet and increased 334 
physical activity for chronic weight management in adult patients with an initial body mass index 335 
(BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2  (obese) or in patients with a BMI of ≥27 kg/m2  (overweight) in the presence 336 
of at least one weight -related comorbid condition such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, 337 
or dyslipidemia.  338 
 339 
Compared to human GLP -1, liraglutide has a C16 fatty  (palmitic) acid chain attached at position 340 
26 (lysine) of the peptide, and has lysine at position 34 replaced by arginine. When 341 
administered subcutaneously, these structural modifications result in a compound with 342 
protracted kinetic properties suitable fo r once daily injection. The dose approved for use in the 343 
United States for the chronic treatment of obesity is 3.0 mg injection once daily. This dose was 344 
approved for use by the FDA based upon the results of a clinical trial which evaluated weight 345 
change a fter 20 weeks using liraglutide 1.2, 1.8, 2.4  and 3.0 mg compared to placebo  and open - 346 
label orlistat  (Trial 1807) .1 Those trials (a dose -ranging phase 2 and four phase 3 trials)  included  347 
5922 patients and demonstrated a consistent and clinically meaningful reduction in weight. 348 
Liraglutide met the 5% mean placebo -corrected  difference in weight los s as described in the 349 
FDA draft weight management guidance  350 
(http://www .fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/ucm071612.pdf, accessed June 3, 2015).  The 351 
safety and  efficacy of Liraglutide was established  in three 56 -week, randomized, double blind, 352 
placebo -controlled trials. In all studies, liraglutide was titrated to 3 .0 mg dail y during a 4 -week 353 
period. All patients received instruction for a reduced calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day 354 
deficit) and exercise counseling (recommended increase in physical activity of minimum 150 355 
mins/week) that began with the first dose of study  medication and continued throughout the trial. 356 
Study patients were either overweight defined as a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or greater in the presence 357 
P a g e  | 9 
 
STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 of at least one obesity related comorbidity or were obese defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or 358 
greater.  359 
 360 
These 3 trial s included 4788 patients, of these 3122 were treated with liraglutide. Study 1 361 
included 3,371 obese or overweigh t patients; s tudy 2 included 635 patients with type 2 diabetes 362 
mellitus  with obesity or overweight; and s tudy 3 included  422 obese and overweigh t patients 363 
who also lost at least 5% of body weig ht with diet and exercise alone . The primary efficacy 364 
endpoint in trial s 1 and 2 was the mean percent change in body weight and the percentages of 365 
patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% of weight los s from baseline through 56 weeks. 366 
In study 3 there was an additional efficacy measure which was the percentage of patients not 367 
gaining more than 0.5% of body weight from randomization. Patients treated with liraglutide 368 
experienced a significant decrease in  percent change (from baseline) in total body weight 369 
ranging from -4.9 to -7.4% (least square mean). Over 50% of patients lost greater than 5% of 370 
their baseline body weight and approximately 30% lost greater than 10% of their body weight. 371 
These changes wer e significantly greater than weight loss seen in the placebo arms of these 372 
three trials. In study 3 there were a statistically greater number of patients randomized to 373 
placebo that gained at least 0.5% of  their body weight at week 56.  Liraglutide  use was a lso 374 
associated with a reduction in waist circumference, blood pressure and modest reductions in 375 
total cholesterol, LDL and increase in H DL. Liraglutide was associated with an increase in heart 376 
rate of approximately 2  beats per minute .  377 
 378 
Tolerability  and Ad verse Events  379 
Treatment with liraglutide in prior obesity trials was generally well tolerated.  Approximately 70% 380 
of patients randomized to liraglutide completed the trials on medication. The withdrawal rate 381 
was approximately 8.5% in the liraglutide arms an d 8.6% in the placebo treated patients. 382 
Serious adverse events were relatively uncommon, but were more frequent in liraglutide -treated 383 
subjects c ompared with  placebo ( 4.2 vs. 2.4%).  GI side effects seen in the SCALE 384 
Maintenance trial were common in patien ts taking liraglutide 3.0 mg. The frequency of nausea 385 
was 47.6%, of diarrhea was 17.9%, of constipation was 26.9% and of vomiting was 16.5%. 386 
Other less common AEs included dyspepsia (9.4%), abdominal pain (6.6%), abdominal 387 
distension (6.1%), eructation (5. 2%), and flatulence (5.2%).20  388 
 389 
There have been rare, spontaneous post -marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients 390 
without a history of pancreatitis bein g treated with liraglutide.  In the obesity clinical trials, acute 391 
pancreatitis was confirmed in 9 of 3291 liraglutide treated patients and 1 of 1843 placebo 392 
treated patients. There were 3 additional cases of pancreatitis occurring in lirag lutide treated 393 
patients ranging 14 to 124 days after study discontinuation. A history of pancreatitis was an 394 
exclusion criterion in clinical trials performed to date. If the investigator suspects acute 395 
pancreatitis, all suspected drugs should be discontinued until confirm atory tests have been 396 
conducted and appropriate treatment  initiated.  397

Liraglutide causes dose -dependent and treatment -duration -dependent thyroid C -cell tumors at 399 
clinically relevant exposures in both genders of rats and mice. It is unknown whether liraglu tide 400 
causes thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), in humans, as 401 
human relevance could not be ruled out by clinical or nonclinical studies. Liraglutide is 402 
contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and  in patients with Multiple 403 
Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2). Based on the findings in rodents, monitoring 404 
with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound was performed during clinical  trials, but this may 405

 have increased the number of unnecessary thy roid surgeries. It is unknown whether monitoring 406 
with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound will mitigate human risk of thyroid C -cell tumors.  407 
 408 
Liraglutide and Body Composition  409 
Body composition was measured in a sub -study of Trial 1807 which included 113  patients (92 410 
completers) from 7 European centers  using dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 411 
computerized axial tomography (CT) scans .  Trial 18072 was a pl acebo -controlled 20 week trial 412 
with open label orlistat, placebo and once daily injection of liraglutide. At 1 year liraglutide 3.0 413 
mg recipients lost 5.8 kg (95% CI 3.7 –8.0) more body weight than those on placebo and 3.8 kg 414 
(1.6–6.0) more than those on or listat (P<0.0001). In this body composition sub -study at week 415 
20, mean total body fat mass was reduced between 5.0 -6.9 kg with liraglutide, 4.4 kg with 416 
placebo and 4.9 with orlistat. The percentage of body weight lost due to fat was 80 -90% of the 417 
total wei ght lost in the liraglutide treated group and 63% in the placebo group. The weight loss 418 
and reduction in waist circumference with liraglutide was primarily due to reduction in fat mass 419 
rather than lean body mass .  This sub -study also quantified the VAT and  abdominal SAT mass 420 
lost. Summary data from this body composition sub -study are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 421 
below:   422 
 423 
While there was a numerical trend for greater VAT mass loss in the liraglutide 3.0 mg group, this 424 
study was underpowered to detect b etween group differences in absolute or relative VAT mean 425 
mass lost.  This initial work is a fundamental first step but has important limitations, including: 1) 426 
lack of study subjects in the United States; patients enrolled in this study were exclusively 427 
recruited from European centers including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, 428 
Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden; 2) there were very few subjects treated with 3.0 mg of 429 
liraglutide (N=15); therefore this study was not only underpowered to detect clinicall y meaningful 430 
differences in abdominal fat distribution , but also systematically underdosed ; 3) the use of 431 
ionizing radiation (with CT scans) limits the generalizability to other research projects that will 432 
likely be conducted over long -term follow -up with repeat imaging; and 4) this study did not 433 
directly quantify hepatic fat, a known correlate of insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risk.  434 
We will address these limitations in the research proposed below.  435

Therefore, we believe there is an important and pressing need for extensive and detailed 442 
phenotyping to further elucida te the impact of Liraglutide 3.0 mg on markers of body fat 443 
distribution, visceral adiposity, and adverse cardiometabolic risk and its potential benefits on 444 
long-term cardiovascular disease outcomes.  Our long term goal is to understand how VAT 445 
contributes to cardiometabolic disease risk and to identify strategies to reduce the 446 
cardiometabolic consequences of excess VAT.  Our objectives here are to elucidate the effect 447 
of Liraglutide 3.0 on body fat distribution, visceral adiposity, and markers of cardiometa bolic 448

detailed circulating blood biomarker and imaging phenotyping.  450 
 451 
TRIAL RATIONALE:  452 
The rationale of this project is to utilize adipose tissue imaging with minim al or no ionizing 453 
radiation to investigate the potential beneficial effects of Liraglutide 3.0 mg on pathways 454 
underlying excess cardiovascular disease risk related to visceral adiposity and a n adverse 455

TRIAL DESIGN AND METHODS:  511 
 512 
Trial type:  513 
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo controlled , prospective clinical trial to 514 
be conducted at a single center  over 46  weeks  (40 weeks on -treatment) . There are two 515 
treatment arms.  Patients will be randomized to liraglutide  3.0 administered once a day  by 516 
subcutaneous injection or matching  placebo , in addition to a reduced -calorie diet and increased 517 
physical activity .  All participants will be prescribed a 500 kcal per day deficit diet, based on 518 
estimated 24 -h energy expenditure.1  All participants will be instructed to maintain physical 519 
activity at the recommended level of 150 minutes of moderate  activity per week.  520 
 521 
Rationale for trial design:  522 
This trial design will directly address the trial objectives by allowing determination of  the effects 523 
of Liraglutide on body fat distribution, visceral adiposity, and cardiometabolic risk  markers 524 
independent of a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity among overweight and 525 
obese adults at high cardiovascular disease risk.  526 
 527 
Trial population:  528 
Planned number of subjects to be screened:  356 (2:1 screen to randomization ratio)  529

Anticipated number of subjects to be studied: At least 128 completers  532 
Number of trial sites: Single center  533 
 534

Withdrawal Criteria:  592 
1. Participants may withdraw at will at any time.  593 
- Informed consent may be withdrawn at any time.  594 
P a g e  | 15 
 
STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 - Permission to follow up for  endpoint determination may be withdrawn at any time  595 
- This is distinguished from withdrawal of trial medication.  596 
2. Participants can be withdrawn from the trial at the discretion of the Investigator due to 597 
safety concerns of if judged to be non -compliant with  the trial protocol.  598 
3. Pregnancy or intention of becoming pregnant  599 
4. If target treatment dose of the randomized product is not tolerated by the subject.  600 
5. If the trial investigator suspects acute pancreatitis, the trial drug will be discontinued until 601 
the confir matory tests (clinically indicated laboratory and imaging) have been conducted 602 
and appropriate treatment has been administered.  We anticipate confirmation within 72 603 
hours. If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, the participant will be withdrawn from the tria l.  604 
If acute pancreatitis is not confirmed, the participant will resume the trial drug at the 605 
same dose previously used before temporary discontinuation . 606 
6. Temporary trial drug discontinuation criteria:  607 
- Side effects to trial medication  (until such side effec ts have resolved or have 608 
been otherwise addressed ) 609 
- Acute illness requiring treatment or hospitalization  610 
- The longest time that the subject can be off trial drug and still continue in the trial 611 
is 4 weeks.   If the trial drug is discontinued for >72 hours, th en the dosing 612 
escalation regimen will be restarted at 0.6 mg daily and titrated up according to 613 
prescribing information recommendations.  614 
 615 
Subject Replacement  616 
Participants will not be replaced if they withdraw or become ineligible but they will be asked to  617 
return at the end of the trial period to complete the follow -up imaging/laboratory testing and 618 
analyzed in an intention to treat  analysis.  As up to a 28% drop -out rate is anticipated, enrolment  619 
will account for expected drop -out to minimize loss to follow -up given that subjects will not be 620 
replaced.  621 
 622 
Rationale for Trial Population  623 
The trial population represents  the target  population for which liraglut ide is approved for chronic 624 
weight management in adult patients, with the additional inclusion criterion of a diagnosis of 625 
metabolic syndrome. This important criterion has been selected to enrich the trial population 626 
with participants with a high visceral adipose tissue burden in order to improve the statistical 627 
power to observe a meaningful effect on viscera l adipose mass and enrich the trial population 628 
with individuals at high risk for cardiovascular  disease.  629 
 630 
Imaging Assessments  631 
The primary and secondary endpoints  of visceral fat, abdominal subcutaneous fat, lower body 632 
fat, liver fat , and total body fat and  fat-free (lean) mass  will be assessed using a Phillips 3T MRI 633 
system utilizing a two point Dixon fat -water segmentation technique  (Advanced MR Analytics, 634 
Sweden) .21  This MRI system has been extensively studied and validated in multiple cohorts,21-23 635 
has excellent test/retest precision and reliability,24 and is rapid (<6 minutes) and theref ore cost 636 
effective.    637 
 638 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  639 
 640 
Sample Size Calculation:  641 
This trial is powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in the placebo -corrected relative 642 
reduction in VAT.  The estimates used in the sample size calculations below ar e derived from 643

 prior data from the SCALE program.  Assuming a mean 8% relative reduction of VAT  among 644 
placebo treate d subjects and an expected 16 % relative reduction of VAT among liraglutide 645 
treated subjects ( with a standard deviation of 16%, based on data  from [2]), we expect to require 646 
128 total subjects (in a 1:1 trial drug:placebo randomization scheme) to achieve 80% power to 647 
detect a n 8% difference between gro ups at an alpha level of 0.05.  Assuming an estimated 28% 648 
of subjects may withdraw trial medication during the trial, we expect a planned total of 178 649 
patients will be randomized in order to achieve at least 128 completers of the full trial protocol.  650

 652 
Statistical Methods:  A formal statistical analysis plan will follow.  Briefly, b aseline 653 
characteristics between lira glutide and placebo treated groups will be compared using 654 
appropriate parametric or non -parametric tests depending on the distribution of the data. The 655 
primary outcome will be analyzed using an intention to treat  analysis. Mean change in outcome 656 
measuremen ts will be compared between groups using the appropriate statistical test . 657 
Outcomes will also be analyzed by subgroups including age (above/below median), sex, race  658 
(non-Hispanic black, non -Hispanic white, and Hispanic ), BMI category (overweight, class I 659 
obese, class II/III obese), and prediabetes status (yes/no).  In order to minimize type II error in 660 
subgroup analyses by race, we will attempt to ensure Hispanics comprise at least 25% of the 661 
trial population.  A pre-specified  analysis stratified by those w ho did vs. did not lose ≥4% body 662 
weight at 16 weeks of treatment will be performed prior to unblinding to determine differential 663 
outcomes among “responders” vs. “non -responders” as outlined in the package insert.  All 664 
statistical tests are two -sided at a 5% s ignificance level . 665 
 666 
Interim Analysis:  No interim analysis will be performed.  667 
 668 
Missing Data:  The preferred approach to missing data is to incorporate proactive standard 669 
operating procedures to mitigate the likelihood of missingness. We will implement measur es to 670 
reduce missing data (both baseline and endpoint).  The statistical analysis plan will describe 671 
analytical approaches to address  missingness of data, including multiple imputation including 672 
the last observation carried forward (LOCF)  and mixed -effects  model repeated measure 673 
approaches . Sensitivity analyses will also be performed to determine the effect of missingness 674 
on the primary and secondary outcomes.  675 
 676 
DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING:  677 
Subjects will be assigned an identification code. A subject's n ame and code will be contained 678 
within a small notebook and will be kept in a locked cabinet in the research coordinator's locked 679 
office.  The research chart will contain personal health information and will be kept in locked file 680 
cabinet in the research co ordinator's locked office.  All other data on a computer will be de - 681 
identified with the subject's identification code.  Blood samples waiting for analysis will not be 682 
labeled with the subject's name, but with the assigned identification code.  The trial database will 683 
be password protected. No data will be sent over the internet unless it is encrypted. All email 684 
with subject -identifiable information will be password protected.  Only key personnel will have 685 
access to the information in the trial database on an  as-needed basis. Key personnel may not 686

ETHICS:  690 
 691 
Informed Consent  692 
Before screening takes place subjects will be provided with written and verbal infor mation about 693 
the trial and the procedures involved. Qualified site will ensure that subjects are fully informed 694 
both verbally and in writing about the practical consequences of participating, of their rights and 695 
responsibilities while participating in the trial as well as any possible advantages and 696 
disadvantages in being treated with the trial products. Subjects will have the opportunity to ask 697 
questions to a medically qualified person and have ample time to consider participation.  698 
Subjects who wish to pa rticipate must give signed and dated informed consent. This must be 699 
done prior to any trial related activities, i.e. procedures that would not have been performed 700 
during normal management of the subject. It must be stated in the medical record that the 701 
subject is participating in the current trial.  702 
 703 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the trial. Informed 704 
consent is obtained by the following process:  705 
 706 
• Subject reviews the trial consent form.  707 
• PI or trial coordinator meets  with the subject to review the consent, confirm subject’s  708 
 understanding, and answer any questions.  709 
• Once the investigator is convinced that the subject verbally demonstrates understanding  710 
 and agrees to the process, the consent is signed. Individuals au thorized to obtain written 711 
consent are the principal investigator, co -investigators, and assigned medical staff 712 
specifically designated by the principal investigator to work on this project.  713 
 714 
The trial protocol will be submitted to the local IRB for approv al before any trial activities will be 715 
initiated.  The trial protocol will be conducted and maintain compliance with appropriate ethical 716 
responsibility standards accordin g to the Declaration of Helsinki and the International 717 
Conference on Harmonization -Good Clinical Practice guidelines, as well as local institutional 718 
review board standards and approval. The investigators will comply with all applicable 719 
regulatory and legal requirements, ICH -GCP guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki in 720 
obtaining and do cumenting the informed consent.  721 
 722 
The trial investigators take full responsibility to ensure quality assurance and proper 723 
maintenance of all trial materials by periodic (biweekly) quality control checks of trial drug 724 
storage and handling, electronic databas e materials, and measurement devices.  725 
 726 
Confidentiality  727 
• Protection of subject privacy . All materials will be obtained for research purposes only, and 728 
data will be kept in strict confidence.  Subjects will be assigned an identification code. A 729 
subject's nam e and code will be contained within a small notebook and will be kept in a 730 
locked cabinet in the research coordinator's locked office.  The research chart will contain 731 
personal health information and will be kept in locked file cabinet in the research 732 
coordinator's locked office.  All other data on a computer will be de -identified with the 733 
subject's identification code.  Blood samples waiting for analysis will not be labeled with the 734 
subject's name, but with the assigned identification code.  735

Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Human Subjects and Others and 744 
Importance of Knowledge to be Gained  745 
• There is a potential direct benefit of the p roposed research to trial participants.  746 
• Knowledge gained from this project will likely lead to better understanding of obesity and 747 
visceral adiposity in the general population and across ethnic minorities and women as well 748 
as potentially lead to improved targets of therapies aimed at reducing cardiovascular 749 
disease risk.  750 
• The risks outlined in this proposal are reasonable for this societal benefit as it may lead to 751 
improved care to reduce cardiovascular disease risk, the leading cause of morbidity and 752 
mortality in the U.S.   753

TRIAL SCHEDULE:  755 
 756 
Planned d uration of recruitment period: 2.5 years  757 
 758 
Planned date for first subject (FPFV): January  2017 759 
 760 
Planned completion of the last subject (LPLV): 30 months from FPFV  761 
 762 
Planned completion of clinical trial report: 36 months from FPFV  763 
 764 
The end of the clinical trial is defined as the last visit of the last subject (LPLV).  765 
 766 
Trial Sites:  767 
The trial will be conducted at three sites in Dallas, TX:  768 
1. University Hospital Ambulatory Clinics (at Aston and St. Paul Professional Of fice 769 
Buildings)  770 
2. Clements University Hospital  771 
3. Parkland Hospital and Ambulatory Clinics  772 
 773 
Visit Procedures:  774 
Prior to the first trial visit, potential subjects will be identified by physician referral or media 775 
advertisement and will be introduced to participat ion in the trial by one of the trial staff. If the 776 
patient meets potential inclusion criteria, written informed consent will be obtained and the 777 
subject will be scheduled for Visit 1.  778 
 779 
Subjects enrolled in the trial will be provided with a subject ID card , stating that they are 780 
participating in a trial and whom to contact (site address, Investigator’s name and telephone 781 
number) for further information, if necessary. The subjects will be reminded to show the card to 782 
other health care providers, as applicabl e. The subjects will be instructed to return the card to 783 
the Investigator at the last visit of the subject or destroy the card after the last visit  784

  785 
The Investigator will keep a subject screening log and a subject enrolment log. For screening 786 
failures (sub jects who have given informed consent but who do not meet the inclusion, 787 
exclusion and/or randomization criteria and hence are not randomized), all data for completed 788 
trial procedures will be recorded in the case record form (CRF), and the reason for exclu sion 789 
from the trial will be recorded on the screening failure form. The screening failure form will be 790 
entered into the clinical database.  791

At Visit s 1, 3, and 16 the subject must attend the clinic in a fasting condition in the morning (i.e., 807 
at least eight hours overnight fast without food and/or drink intake, except for water).  808 
Background medication should be withheld on the day of the fasting Visits 1, 3, and 16  until 809 
blood sampling has been done. At all other visits the background medication and trial product 810 
should be taken as usual during the conduct of the trial.  811 
 812 
Trial product will be dispensed at visits 3 through 15 . Subjects will be asked to bring all  empty, 813 
partly used and u nused trial product at visits  4 through 16  for drug accountability. The 814 
computerized randomization system  should be contacted for trial product dispensing. If the 815 
subject attends the clinic for a visit not described in the protocol , then an Unscheduled Visit 816 
Form must be completed. The Unscheduled Visit Form should not be completed if the sole 817 
purpose of the visit is trial product dispensing. If an unscheduled visit is made for the purpose of 818 
dispensing trial products to the subject s then an unscheduled dispensing session must be 819 
completed in the computerized randomization system . If it is not possible to attend the  visit 820 
within the visit window, the subjects should be called in for an Unscheduled Visit.  821 
 822 
In case a subject is being p rematurely withdrawn from the trial before or at visit 16, the 823 
Investigator will ensure that the procedures for the End of Treatment visit (Visit 16 ) are 824 
P a g e  | 23

 undertaken, if possible. The primary reason (adverse event, non -compliance with protocol or 825 
other) for  discontinuation will be specified in the CRF and a computerized randomization system 826 
withdrawal session should be completed. Even if the subject is not able to attend a final visit, the 827 
End of Trial Form (EOT) must be completed.  828 
 829 
Subjects that have discon tinued the t rial prem aturely before Visit 16  will be asked to attend a 830 
visit (Visit  16x) taking place 4 0 weeks after the randomiz ation date. The purpose of this visit will 831 
be recording of all outcome assessments if possible . If the subject i s not willing t o attend Visit 832 
16x, it should be documented in the patient medical record that the  subject has refused to 833 
attend the visit.  834 
 835 
Visit 1  836 
At Visit 1, the informed consent will be reviewed again for signature and participants will be 837 
screened for eligibility in the trial. This will include interview assessment for inclusion and any 838 
exclusion criteria  and laboratory components of the metabolic syndrome .  Subjects that meet all 839 
eligibility requirements to participate in the trial will then return for a Run -In visit  (Visit 2) . 840 
 841 
Subjects must give signed and dated informed consent prior to any trial -related activities  842 
(including Visit 1) . All subjects will be provided with a copy of the subject information and a copy 843 
of their own signed and dated Informed Consent Form . 844 
 845 
The subjects will be allocated the unique lowest consecutive 6 digit subject number available 846 
from the range of subject numbers. The subject number is composed of three digits unique for 847 
each trial site and three digits for each enrolled subject at the trial site. The subject number is 848 
maintained throughout the trial. The computerized randomization system will be activated  to 849 
register the subject as screened and the subject will be provided with a trial card indicating that 850 
the subject is participating i n a trial.  851 
 852 
The following will be recorded in the case record form (CRF) . Expanded list of 853 
comorbidities will be developed prior to FPFV : 854 
• Age 855 
• Sex 856 
• Race /ethnicity  857 
• Height  858 
• Weight  859 
• Waist Circumference  860 
• Blood Pressure  861 
• Medical history  862 
• Concomitant medications  863 
• Inform ed consent, signed and dated  864 
 865 
The following laboratory studies will be performed and recorded in the CRF when 866 
resulted:  867 
• Fasting blood glucose  868 
• Fasting triglycerides  869 
• Fasting HDL -cholesterol  870 
• For females of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy test  871

 Visit 2 will be the start of the 2 -week Run -In phase during which time eligible participants will be 874 
counseled on diet and physical activity to determine adherence to lifestyle recommendations. A 875 
dietary diary will be recorded by the participants and retu rned to the trial coordinator at Visit 3. 876 
Pedometers will be given to the participants to encourage adherence to physical activity 877 
guidelines and will be returned at Visit 3.  878 
 879 
Counseling on Diet and Physical Activity  880 
At Visit 2 subjects will receive dieta ry counseling by trial staff according to local standard and 881 
placed on a hypo -caloric diet containing approximately 30% of energy from fat, approximately 882 
20% of energy from protein, approximately 50% of energy from carbohydrates and an energy 883 
deficit of ap proximately 500 kcal/day compared to the subjects’ estimated total energy 884 
expenditure (TEE)  (See Table below).  The hypo -caloric diet will be continued from 885 
randomization through the treatment period. Counseling on diet and physical activity will be 886 
provid ed at every trial visit.  All subjects will be instructed by trial staff to keep a 3 -day diary of 887 
food intake between Visits 2 and 3.  The 3 -day food diaries will be used for counseling at each 888 
trial visit. The subject’s dietary compliance and the average daily level of physical activity will be 889 
recorded at each visit. The subject will be questioned whether they performed less than half an 890 
hour, between half an hour and one hour or more than 1 hour of physical activity per day. An 891 
increase in physical activ ity (recommended minimum 150 minutes/week) will be encouraged.  892 
Subject compliance with the prescribed diet will be determined at the discretion of trial staff after 893 
review of the 3 -day food diaries.  894 
 895 
Calculation of estimated total energy expenditure  896 
The T EE is calculated by multiplying the estimated Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) (see Table ) 897 
with a Physical Activity Level (PAL) value of 1.325 898 
 899 
Total Energy Expenditure (TEE) (kcal/day) = BMR x 1.3  900

Visit 3  903 
At Visit 3, participants will be randomized to liraglutide or placebo injection  in a 1:1 fashion. 904 
Randomization will be implemented using a computerized  randomization system by an 905 
independent party at UT Southwes tern. Subjects will have trial products supplied according to 906 
randomization and will be instructed in administration of daily injections of liraglutide/ placebo. 907 
Injections can be done at any time  of day irrespective of meals. However, it is preferable tha t 908 
liraglutide/ placebo be injected during the same overall time period on a day to day basis. The 909 
injection site does not have to be kept consistent throughout the trial. The trial products 910 
dispensed will cover the dose escalation period. Subjects will fol low a fixed dose escalation. The 911 
dose will be gradually escalated to 3.0 mg starting with 0.6 mg and with a dose level increment 912 
of 0.6 mg every 7 days.  913

Visit 17  980 
Visit 17  will be an observational follow -up visit during which sub jects will be monitored for AEs.  981 
At the End of Trial visit (Visit 17 ) the Investigator or delegate will provide counseling on the 982 
management of weight control and follow -up medical care.  983 
 984 
Assessments for efficacy  985 
Weight will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 kg using calibrated scales.  Weight will be measured 986 
in a fasting st ate with an empty bladder, without shoes and only wearing light clothing. Height 987 
without shoes will be recorded at Visit 1. BMI will be calculated as follows: BMI = weight 988 
(kg)/height (m2) 989 
 990 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured at all visi ts  991 
• The auscultatory method should be used to measure blood pressure.  992 
• The patient should avoid caffeine, smoking, physical activity for 30 minutes prior to 993 
measurement.  994 
• Remove all clothing over the covered arm.  995 
• The same sphygmomanometer should be used thro ughout the trial.  996 
• The measurement should be taken in the seated position with legs uncrossed, back 997 
and arm supported.  998 
• Subject should rest in a sitting position for 5 minutes prior to the first blood pressure 999 
being taken.  1000  
• The measurement should be in the up per arm with a stethoscope at the elbow 1001  
crease over the brachial artery.  1002  
• The same arm should be used for blood pressure measurements at all trial visits.  1003  
• The size of the cuff should be appropriate.  The bladder of the cuff should encircle at 1004  
least 80% of t he arm circumference and the width of the cuff is at least 40% of the 1005  
arm circumference.  1006  
• The cuff placement must be preceded with palpation of the brachial artery and the 1007  
antecubital fossa.  The midline of the cuff bladder must be placed over the location of 1008  
the arterial pulsation.  The lower edge of the cuff should be 2 to 3 cm above the 1009  
antecubital fossa to allow for stethoscope placement.  1010

STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 • The cuff should be inflated to at least 30 mm above the point at which the radial 1011  
pulse disappears.  The pulse should  be then reduced at 2 or 3 mm/sec.  1012  
• Korotkoff sounds should be used to measure blood pressure using standard 1013  
techniques.  The measurement should be taken with the precision to the nearest 2 1014  
mmHg.  1015  
• There should be no talking during the measurement.  1016  
• Two reliab le measurements at intervals of at least 2 minutes should to be performed.  1017  
In case there is a greater than 5 mmHg difference between the first and second 1018  
reading of the diastolic blood pressure, one additional reading should be obtained.   1019  
 1020  
The resting heart rate  will be recorded at all trial visits  using the following methodology : 1021  
• The pulse will be recorded after resting for five minutes in a sitting position.   1022  
• The pulse will be counted for 30 seconds and recorded as beats per minute.  The pulse 1023  
will be me asured using direct palpation.  1024  
• Exercise, alcohol, nicotine, and coffee should be avoided 30 minutes preceding 1025  
measurement.  1026  
• Heart rate will be measured while the patient is seated in a comfortabl e position with 1027  
legs uncrossed.  1028  
 1029  
The laboratory analyses for efficacy and safety will be outsourced to a Central Laboratory 1030  
unless otherwise specified. Descriptions of assay methods, instrumentation and procedures for 1031  
obtaining samples, handling and storage of samples will be described in a trial specific 1032  
laboratory  manual provided by the Central Laboratory.  1033  
 1034  
Samples will be coded with the intention that the subject’s identity will remain encrypted but 1035  
information such as age, sex, race, health information and response to liraglutide will be 1036  
correlated. The samples w ill only be used in relation to the present trial. Novo Nordisk and its 1037  
representatives and/or regulatory authorities, may have access to this information. However, the 1038  
subject’s identity will not be revealed.  1039  
 1040  
Laboratory analysis results will be sent to t he Investigator after visits during which laboratory 1041  
studies are obtained. All laboratory reports must be dated and signed by the Investigator on the 1042  
day of evaluation. If a result is outside the normal range, the Investigator will judge whether the 1043  
abnorm ality is clinically significant or not. The signed laboratory report is retained at the 1044  
Investigator site as source documentation. Any abnormal, clinically significant result identified at 1045  
screening visit 1 will be recorded as a concomitant illness.  1046  
 1047  
Ascer tainment of clinical safety endpoints  1048  
At each visit trial staff will review criteria for withdrawal  and AEs/SAEs with the subject.  There 1049  
will not be external independent event adjudications for the adverse cardiovascular endpoints of 1050  
death, MI or stroke. The Investigator will identify adverse cardiovascular events.  These adverse 1051  
events of interest include death, all cause and cardiovascular deaths, nonfatal myocardial 1052  
infarction and nonfatal stroke.  These will be defined prospectively and identified by t he 1053  
Investigator.  These events will not undergo external independent event adjudication.  These 1054  
endpoints will be investigator identified using a priori  criteria.  1055  
 1056  
Ascertainment of diet/physical activity  1057  
At each visit the trial staff will review diet and physical activity compliance with the subject.  1058  
Subjects not meeting trial standards will be encouraged to adjust their behavior to adhere to trial 1059

 requirements. Subjects not meeting requirements after 2 attempts at correction may be subject 1060  
to withdrawal  from the trial at the discretion of the Investigator.  1061  
 1062  
Subject Compliance:   1063  
At each visit the trial staff will review trial medication compliance with the subject.  At the 1064  
prescribed visits, the subject will return used or partly used trial products includ ing all empty 1065  
packaging materials.  The investigator will assess the amount of return trial product and 1066  
compare it to what was dispensed to estimate the subject's compliance with trial medication.  If 1067  
noncompliance is identified, the investigator will coun sel the patient on the importance of trial 1068  
medication compliance.  Consistent failure to be compliant with trial medication or other trial 1069  
protocols could ultimately lead to subject withdrawal from the trial.  1070  
 1071  
End of trial treatment strategy  1072  
Following the end of the treatment, all trial drug treatment will be discontinued and the trial drug 1073  
collected. Subjects will be advised with regards to the best possible post -trial treatment options 1074  
for their weight management and metabolic syndrome. These treatments w ill be at the 1075  
discretion of the local Investigator. Unblinding will occur at LPLV and after ascertainment of 1076  
primary and secondary endpoints.  1077  
 1078  
 1079  
Premature discontinuation  1080  
If the trial subject op ts for early trial termination, he/she will be asked to attend a premature trial 1081  
discontinuation visit at the time of discontinuation. The purpose of this visit will be to assess 1082  
body weight, occurrence of AEs and discuss end of trial imaging studies. The PI will offer end of 1083  
trial imaging to assess for the primary an d secondary efficacy endpoints if the subject has 1084  
completed at least 4 0 weeks of trial treatment. Every effort will be made to assess for AE and 1085  
SAEs during the trial for all patients including those prematurely withdrawing from the trial.  1086  
 1087  
TRIAL DRUGS AN D MATERIALS:  1088  
Treatment with liraglutide or placebo will be blinded to the subjects  and investigator s throughout 1089  
the trial.  1090  
 1091  
Trial medication(s) / devices(s)  1092  
The administration of liraglutide/ placebo will be as outlined above.  1093  
The following trial products will be supplied by Novo Nordisk, Denmark.  1094  
• Liraglutide 6.0 mg/mL, 3 mL pen-injector  for subcutaneous injection  1095  
•  Placebo 3 mL pen-injector  for subcutaneous injection  1096  
 1097  
Liraglutide will be available at a concentration of 6.0 mg/mL.  Liraglutide and placebo wi ll be 1098  
supplied in a 3 mL  pen-injector  .  Correct dosing is achieved by using the dose counter and the 1099  
dose pointer to see how many mg to select. The subject will hear a “click” ev ery time they turn 1100  
the dose selector. The dose will not be set by counting t he number of clicks the subject hears.  1101  
Dosing with the liraglutide/ placebo pen-injector  is controlled by turning the dose selector until 1102  
the dose indicator shows the relevant dose (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 or 3.0 mg, respectively or 1103  
placebo). Therefore, the dos e level (injection volume) of liraglutide or placebo is open labeled.  1104  
 1105  
Liraglutide or placebo is administered once daily by subcutaneous injections with the pen- 1106  
injector , either in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. Injections can be done at any time of day 1107  
irrespective of meals. However, it is preferable that liraglutide be injected during the same 1108  
P a g e  | 29 
 
STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 overall time period on a day to day basis. Subjects will be instructed to perform an air shot 1109  
before the first injection with the pen-injector . For further inform ation, please see the direction 1110  
for use (DFU) for the liraglutide pen-injector . These DFUs will be provided together with the trial 1111  
product. The Investigator or trial staff will instruct subjects in how to inject liraglutide or placebo, 1112  
and will ensure tha t the subjects are familiar with the DFU. It will be documented in the subject’s 1113  
research record that the subject has been instructed in the use of the pen-injector . 1114  
 1115  
Subjects will follow a fixed dose escalation and in order to reduce the level of side eff ects, 1116  
liraglutide is gradually escalated up to the maintenance dose. Subjects will be instructed to 1117  
escalate the liraglutide (active or plac ebo) dose to 3.0 mg/day over a 4  week period following an 1118  
initial dose of 0.6 mg/day and weekly dose escalation step s of 0.6 mg/day.  1119  
If subjects do not tolerate an increase in dose during dose -escalation, the Investigator will have 1120  
the option to delay the next dose escalation for approximately one week . All subjects must be at 1121  
the target dose 3.0 mg or placebo at the la test 8 weeks after randomization.  1122  
 1123  
Dose escalation schedule:  1124

4 and beyond  3.0 
 1125  
After reaching the target dose , 3.0 mg liraglutide or placebo dose and dosing frequency should 1126  
not be changed at any time during the  treatment period. If any dose is missed by the subject up 1127  
to and including 3 consecutive days it will be documented in the research record and the 1128  
Investigator will discuss the importance of treatment compliance with the subject. After a 1129  
potential discont inuation up to 3 days the subject must be re -initiated on trial drug on target 1130  
dose 3.0 mg liraglutide or placebo. Missed doses for more than 3 consecutive days will be 1131  
discussed with the PI  and it will be up to Investigator’s judgment if the subject can c ontinue on 1132  
target dose or should be withdrawn.  1133  
 1134  
It is always important that the Investigator emphasizes  to subjects the necessity of compliance 1135  
with regard to taking trial drug as described in the protocol. It is the responsibility of the 1136  
Investigator to a ccess the subject’s overall compliance throughout the trial and subjects deemed 1137  
to be non -compliant subjects may be withdrawn at the Investigator’s discretion. If subjects do 1138  
not tolerate the target dose, they will be withdrawn from the trial.  If the Inve stigator suspects 1139  
acute pancreatitis, all suspected drugs will be discontinued until confirmatory tests have been 1140  
conducted. If tests reveal that a subject does not have acute pancreatitis, the subject can 1141  
remain in the trial with re -initiation of titratio n until the target dose is reached.  1142  
 1143  
Packaging and Labelling of Trial Medication(s)  1144  
All trial products will be packed and labeled by Novo Nordisk and provide d in non -subject 1145  
specific boxes.  Labeling will be in accordance with local law and trial requireme nts. 1146  
 1147  
Storage and Drug Accountability of Trial Medication(s)  1148  
The Investigator must keep track of all received, used, partly used and unused trial products by 1149  
the use of the drug accountability module in the computerized randomization system . 1150

 Store in a re frigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not store in the freezer or directly adjacent to the 1152  
refrigerator cooling element. Do not freeze liraglutide/ placebo and do not use liraglutide/ 1153  
placebo if it has been frozen. Liraglutide/ placebo should not be used if it does not appear clear 1154  
and colorless. After first use of the liraglutide/ placebo pen, the product can be stored for  30 1155  
days at room temperature (+15°C to +30°C)/(59°F to 86°F) or in a refrigerator (+2°C to 1156  
+8°C)/(+36°F to +46°F) . Keep the pen cap on when lirag lutide/ placebo pen is not in use in 1157  
order to protect from light. Liraglutide/ placebo should be protected from excessive heat and 1158  
sunlight.  Always remove the injection needle after each injection and store the liraglutide/ 1159  
placebo pen without an injection  needle attached. This prevents contamination, infection, and 1160  
leakage. It also ensures that the dosing is accurate. No trial product which has exceeded the 1161  
expiry date must be used.  1162  
 1163  
The Investigator will ensure the availability of proper storage condition s and record and evaluate 1164  
the temperature. The temperature will be recorded and evaluated on a daily basis (working 1165  
days) using as a minimum a calibrated min/max thermometer. A log to document the 1166  
temperature must be kept. Storage facilities will be checke d frequently (at least once every 1167  
working day).  1168  
 1169  
No trial product(s) should be dispensed to any person not enrolled in the trial and the 1170  
computerized randomization system should always be updated when dispensing trial product(s).  1171  
Returned trial product(s) (partly used or unused including empty packaging material) must be 1172  
stored separately from non -allocated trial product(s) until the monitor has performed drug 1173  
accountability. The monitor will be responsible for retrieval of trial products from the site. 1174  
Destruction of trial products will be done according to local laws and will be recorded on a 1175  
Destruction Form, which will be signed by the person responsible for destruction, as agreed with 1176  
the monitor.  1177  
 1178  
Randomization and Blinding  1179  
Trial participants  and inves tigators  will be blinded to treatment allocation throughout the trial.   1180  
 1181  
Randomization S cheme:  1182  
Participants will be randomly assigned using a computerized randomization code  generated by 1183  
UT Southwestern . 1184  
 1185  
Breaking of Blinded Codes  1186  
Blinding codes will be b roken at the end of the trial. Blinding codes will only be broken before 1187  
the end of trial if a subject develops a serious adverse event requiring knowledge of the 1188  
treatment allocation. At such time, the subject will be considered to have completed the trial and 1189  
will not undergo any further trial treatment but may be asked to undergo assessment of trial 1190  
endpoints when feasible.   Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code must print 1191  
the Code Break Confirmation generated by the computerized random ization system , record the 1192  
reason, and sign and date the document.  If the subject should be withdrawn following a code 1193  
break, a withdrawal session should be completed in the computerized randomization system . 1194  
 1195  
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS  1196  
All conc omitant illnesses and medications will be recorded in the CRF and assessed as AEs or 1197  
not AEs. If a subject is prescribed a medication meeting criteria for withdrawal /exclusion, the 1198  
subject will have the opportunity to decide whether to take such medication  and withdraw from 1199  
the trial or not take it and continue the trial.   1200

 SUBJECT SAFETY AND DATA MONITORING  1201  
ADVERSE EVENTS:  1202  
Definitions  1203  
 1204  
Adverse Event (AE):  1205  
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or not 1206  
related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related activity 1207  
after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post treatment follow -up period as 1208  
defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded as  AEs, if recorded as medical 1209  
history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  1210  
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has    1211  
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the infor med consent  1212  
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  1213  
 1214  
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  1215  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant 1216  
i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disea se and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which 1217  
requires active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more 1218  
frequent follow -up or diagnostic investigation).  1219  
 1220  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  1221  
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following:  1222  
• Death  1223  
• A life -threatening experience  (an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 1224  
the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was 1225  
more sev ere) 1226  
• In-patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalization  1227  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  1228  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  1229  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening*, or require  1230  
hospitalization  may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, 1231  
they may jeopardize  the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 1232  
of the outcomes listed in this definition . 1233  
• Suspicion of transmission of infectious agents must always be considered an SAE  1234  
 1235  
Note: The term life -threatening in the definition of serious r efers to an event in which the patient 1236  
was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically 1237  
might have caused death if it was more severe.  1238  
 1239  
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  1240  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 1241  
(Possible/Probable relation) between the trial drug and the occurrence of the event is  1242  
suspected. The ADR should be classified as serious if it meets one or more of the seriousness 1243  
criteria.  1244  
 1245  
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Rea ction (SUSAR):   1246  
An SAE which is unexpected and regarded as possibly or probably related to the trial product by 1247  
the invest igator.  1248  
 1249  
P a g e  | 32 
 
STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 Non-Serious Adverse Event:  1250  
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.  1251  
 1252  
Severity Assessment Definitions:  1253  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  1254  
• Moderate: Marked  symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities  1255  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  1256  
 1257  
Relationship to trial medication Assessment Definitions:  1258  
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient doc umentation to assume a causal relationship  1259  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  1260  
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product  1261  
• Suggested to s pecify the reference document ( eg: USPI, CCDS) in the protocol which is 1262  
agreed upon with NN, for evalu ation of expectedness  1263  
 1264  
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  1265  
• Recovered: Fully recovered or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to 1266  
the level observed at the first tri al related activity after the subject signed the informed consent  1267  
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 1268  
This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial  1269  
• Recovered with sequel ae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     1270  
significant disability/incapacity ( e.g. became blind, deaf, paralyz ed). Any AE recovered with 1271  
sequelae should be rated as an SAE  1272  
• Not recovered  1273  
• Fatal  – this term is only applicable if th e subject died from a condition related to the reported 1274  
AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed 1275  
according to the state of the event at the time of death. An AE with fatal outcome must be 1276  
reported as an SAE.  1277  
• Unknown  1278  
 1279  
Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  1280  
All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from the first 1281  
trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the end of the 1282  
post-treatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.  1283  
 1284  
Plan for reporting both anticipated and unanticipated adverse events : 1285  
Each subject will be evaluated for any adverse events.  Any event that is reported to either the 1286  
principal investigator o r his designated research associates by the subject or medical staff 1287  
caring for the subject and which meets the criteria will be documented as such.  Any event that 1288  
is reported will then generate an adverse event report, which will be submitted to the safe ty 1289  
officer, local IRB, Novo Nordisk, and FDA. The report will include a description of the event, 1290  
when and how it was reported, as well as any official chart records or documentation to 1291  
corroborate the event or the reporting of the event. All adverse event s will be graded as mild, 1292  
moderate, or severe.  All unexpected fatal or life -threatening su spected adverse reactions 1293  
represent especially important safety information and will be reported to FDA as soon as 1294  
possible but no la ter than 7 calendar days followi ng the sponsor’s initial receipt of the 1295  
information. Any severe and/or unanticipated adverse event will be reported to the safety officer, 1296  
local IRB, Novo Nordisk, and FDA  within 24 hours of knowledge of the event .  At a minimum, 1297  
the investigator will copy  NN when e xpediting SARs or SUSARs to health a uthorities and will 1298  
P a g e  | 33 
 
STU122015 -044, Joshi, Form A, Mod_8, 08 -24-18 (2)  Version 4.1  | November 1 , 2016  
 
 
 report all SARs related to NN product to the local NN affiliate safety depar tment .  All other 1299  
adverse events will be reported in a timely fashion to the safety officer, local IRB, Novo Nordi sk, 1300  
and FDA preferably within 2 weeks of the date of the event.  All adverse events will be 1301  
summarized annually and submitted to the local IRB, Novo Nordisk, and FDA.  Any action 1302  
resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of this trial (e.g. FDA acti ons, IRB actions, or 1303  
actions by the investigators or co -investigators) will be reported to the appropriate Novo Nordisk 1304  
program official.  1305  
 1306  
Follow -up of Adverse Events  1307  
Periodic reviews of adverse events and safety issues will be performed during the trial a s listed 1308  
below:  1309  
 1310  
Safety reviews . The principal investigator s (SM, IN)  will review the safety and progress of this 1311  
trial on a weekly basis.   1312  
 1313  
Annual review . The principal investigator s (SM, IN)  will review this protocol on a continuing 1314  
basis for subject sa fety and include results of the review in the annual progress reports 1315  
submitted to the safety officer, local IRB,  and Novo Nordisk.  1316  
 1317  
Pregnancy  1318  
Pregnant and breast -feeding females cannot participate in the trial because they may expose 1319  
the unborn child to r isks.  If participants can become pregnant, a pregnancy test will be done 1320  
from a urine sample, and it must be negative before they can be a part of this trial.  If they do 1321  
become pregnant during this trial, they must inform the researchers immediately and their 1322  
participation in the trial will be discontinued.  Novo Nordisk will r eceive a report of any pregnancy 1323  
in the trial subject that occurs during the use of a NN product. The investig ator must follow the 1324  
pregnancy until the pre gnancy outcome and the newbo rn infant is one month of age. The 1325  
investigator must report information about the pre gnancy, pregnancy outcome, and health of the 1326  
newborn infant(s), as well as AEs in connection with the pregnancy, and AEs in the foetus and 1327  
newborn infant.  1328  
 1329  
At a minimum th e following d etails will be reported - Trial name - Patient identification (e.g. 1330  
subject number, initials, sex, age) - Event (Prefe rably diagnosis) - Drug - Reporter - Causality – 1331  
Outcome. These details will be reported to Novo Nordisk Inc. safety depar tment. 1332  
 1333  
Precautions/Over -dosage  1334  
Certain precautions will be taken by the PI and trial staff based on prior data and experience . 1335  
These include:  1336  
1. Injection Site Reaction  1337  
Approximately 1 -10/100 subjects developed pain, bruising, irritation, itching and/ or rash 1338  
at the injection site  in the previous LEAD and SCALE clinical trials.  A similar incidence 1339  
of these injection site reactions will be expected in this clinical trial.  Safety text regarding 1340  
these reactions and the possibility of anaphylactic shock will be inc luded in the informed 1341  
consent and as part of site and investigator training.   1342  
 1343  
2. Calcitonin Monitoring  1344  
Calcitonin levels will not be routinely monitored during the trial.  1345  
 1346

 As with any drug, allergic reactions to the drug in this study  are possible.  Liraglutide may cause 1348  
some, all or none of the side -effects listed below that have been reported in patients previously.  1349  
• More frequent (>10%):  nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting;  1350  
• Less common (1 -10%):  dyspepsia, abdominal pa in, abdominal distension, eructation,  1351  
            flatulence; and  1352  
• Rarely (<1%):  gallbladder disease, acute pancreatitis  1353  
All adverse effects are reversible with discontinuation of the medication.  1354

The DSMC will meet biannually by telephone/teleconference and distribute a report to the IRB 1361  
at the completion of each meeting.  1362  
 1363  
LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  1364  
During and following a subjec t’s participation in the trial, the primary investigators (IN and SM) 1365  
and UT Southwestern Medical Center will provide adequate medical care to the study subject 1366  
for any study -related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values relate d to 1367  
the study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance 1368  
status.  1369  
 1370  
Novo Nordisk carries product liability insurance for its products.   Sponsor -investigator agrees to 1371  
indemnify Novo Nordisk in accordance with the wr itten contract executed between the parties 1372  
for this study. Generally, however, Novo Nordisk assumes no liability in the event of negligence 1373

is responsible.  1375  
 1376  
EVALUABILITY OF SUBJECTS:  1377  
The following analysis sets are defined:  1378  
 1379  
Full analysis set (FAS)  1380  
All randomized subjects exposed to at least one dose of the trial product and with at least one 1381  
post-baseline assessment of any efficacy endpoint will be included. Subjects in the FAS will be 1382  
analyz ed according to intention to treat (primary) and per -protocol ( secondary). The requirement 1383  
of a post -baseline observation is in alignment with the FDA recommendations . 1384  
 1385  
Safety analysis set  1386  
All randomized subjects who have been exposed to at least one dose of trial product . Subjects 1387  
in the safety analysis set will be analyzed “as treated”.  1388  
 1389  
PREMATURE TERMINATION OF TRIAL : 1390  
The trial will be prematurely terminated for the following reasons only:  1391  
1. A serious threat to the safety of trial participants occurs that cannot be addressed in any 1392  
other manner than trial termination.  1393  
2. Funding is withdrawn  from the trial. 1394  
3. The local IRB withdraws approval for the trial. 1395

PUBLICATION PLAN:  1397  
It is expected that this trial will generate 1 or more  scientific abstracts that will be presented at 1398  
scientific meetings and 1 or more manuscripts that will be  published in peer review journal s. For 1399  
each publication there will be  a first and senior author and a responsible writing group. This 1400  
subgroup will b e responsible for driving the publication process forward. The manuscript will be 1401  
forwarded to Novo Nordisk  for review prior to publication. Novo Nordisk  will be allowed 10 1402  
working days to review the manuscript and provide feedback. The investigators  retain the right 1403  
to publish results independent of findings and will not need Novo Nordisk permission prior to 1404  
publication and or presentation of data.  1405

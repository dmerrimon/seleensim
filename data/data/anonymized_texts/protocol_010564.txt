Primary  analy sis:Progression -free survival 
(PFS) will be analyzed and compared

arm using the stratified log -rank test with 
time to first relapse/refractory disease 
(early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) 
and age (<18 or ≥18 years) a s strata.  PFS 
censoring rules will follow FDA guidance of 
2007 and will be detailed in the statistical 
analysis plan. Median PFS will be 
calculated using the K -M [Kaplan -Meier 
(1958)] product -limit estimates for each 
treatment arm along with 2 -sided 95% C Is 
(estimated with a generalized Brookmeyer 
and Crowley method [Brookmeyer and 
Crowley (1982)].  The K -M estimates of 
PFS will be plotted over time. The Cox 
regression model will be used to estimate 
the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs stratified 
by the strati fication factors.  The primary 
analy sis of PFS -4m rate will be based upon 
data provided by IIR of tumor assessments.  
PFS-4m rate and their Greenwood standard 
errors will be evaluated using the K -M 
estimates from both treatment groups.  The 
statistical sig nificance of the difference in the 
2 K M PFS -4m rates comparing lenvatinib + 
chemotherapy agent (Test Arm) vs. 
chemotherapy agent alone (Control Arm) will 
be tested using a 2 -sided 80% CI.  This 2 -
sided 80% CI and a p value will be 
constructed using the di fference of these 2 K -
M PFS -4m rates and the 2 corresponding 
Greenwood standard errors.  Statistical 
significance of the difference is declared if the 
CI is entirely above 0.  This is equivalent to a 
test using a 1 -sided test at alpha=0.1.  The 2-

will be analyzed using the same methods as 
the primary efficacy analysis.  PFS censoring 
rules will follow FDA guidance of 2007, 
however, removal of baseline lesions after 
completion of Week 18 without progression is 
not a trigger for PFS censoring after 18 weeks 
(refer to Concomitant Drug/Therapy –

K-M method for the primary efficacy PFS 
analysis. PFS -4m/PFS-1y rate and their 
Greenwood standard errors will be

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 11of 147Sample size rationale: A binomial -based 
comparison of 2 proportions using correction 
for continuity was used for sample size 
estimation.  A total sample size of 72 subjects 
is estimated to achieve 80% statistical power 
at 1 sided alpha of 0.1 to detect a difference of 
30% based on the assumption that PFS -4m for 
Arm A (lenvatinib arm) is 55% and for Arm B 
is 25%.  Alpha is the type 1 error probability 
of declaring lenvatinib arm being effective 
when the true lenvatinib arm PFS -4m rate is 
only 25%. A total sample size of 72 subjec ts 
is estimated for the primary efficacy 
endpoint of PFS. Assuming a hazard ratio 
of 0.4 (median PFS of 3.5 and 8.75 months 
for the control and investigational arms, 
respectively), a one -sided type 1 error rate 
of 0.025, and power of 80%, 38 PFS events 
arerequired for the primary analysis. Statistical assumptions 
updated based on revised 
primary  endpoint.Synopsis, Sample Size 
Rationale
Section 9.7.2
Discussion of Study Design: The endpoint 
was determined as appropriate for the study, 
given the unique biology of the osteosarcoma .
(bone lesions do not shrink) and the vital role 
of surgica l resection of metastatic lesions, 
where possible, in the management of patients 
with this tumor.  Pulmonary metastases are 
most common in osteosarcoma, and the ability 
to achieve a second surgical remission has 
consistently been shown essential for long -
term survival following relapse (Kempf 
Bielack, et al., 2005; Leary, et al., 2013; 
Bacci, et al., 2005; Chou, et al., 2005; 
Hawkins and Arndt, 2003).  The protocol 
allows for surgical resection of baseline 
lesions after completion of the Week 18 tumor 
asses sment.  This timepoint allows for 
surgical resection after completion of 
chemotherapy without confounding data due 
to subjects undergoing surgery. Justification has been revised 
to align with the updated 
primary  endpoint.Section 9.2
Blood Pressure: BP that is consistently above 
the 95th percentile based on sex, age, and 
height/length for subjects <18 years old; or 
BP ≥140/90 mmHg for subjects ≥18 to 25 
years old requires further evaluation... BP

The safety, tolerability and activity of 
single -agent lenvatinib, and lenvatinib in 
combination with chemotherapy 
(ifosfamide and etoposide), have been 
assessed in E7080 -G000 -207 (Study 207), a 
phase 1/2, multicenter, open -label study in 
children, adolescents and young adults with 
solid tumors, including relapsed or 
refractory osteosarcoma, and 
radioiodine -refractory differentiated 
thyroid carcinoma.  The recommended 
phase 2 dose (RP2D) of le nvatinib was 
determined in the phase 1b portion as 14 
mg/m2 orally once daily when given as 
single -agent as well as in combination with 
etoposide (100 mg/m2 IV once daily for 
3days) + ifosfamide (3000 mg/m2 IV once 
daily for 3 days), administered on days 1 to 
3 of each 21 -day cycle, for 5 cycles. The dose 
of lenvatinib is the same as the RP2D for 
lenvatinib monotherapy, also established in 
Study 207. BSA will be used to determine 
the dose of lenvatinib for each subject. 
After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose of 
lenvatinib cannot exceed 24 mg. Please see

Study Design
E7080- G000 -230 is a multicenter, randomized, open -label, parallel -group, Phase 2 study to 
compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus 
ifosfamide and etoposide in children, adolescents, and young adults with relapsed or refractory 
osteosarcoma.  
Approximately 72 eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 2 treatment arms in a 
1:1 ratio within the strata :
Arm A:  lenvatinib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day 
(intravenously [IV], Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and etoposide 
100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)
Arm B:  ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 
5cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 
cycles)
Randomization will follow a predefined randomization scheme based on the following 
stratification factors: time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 
months]) and ag e (<18 and ≥18 years).  
The Sponsor will closely monitor enrol lment, to ensure that a minimum of 36 subjects are <17
years of age at the time of informed consent .  
The study will be conducted in 3 Phases: a Prerandomization Phase, a Randomization Phase, and 
an Extension Phase.  
ThePrerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. The 
Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days.  The Screening Period will establish 
protocol eligibility and the Baseline Period will con firm eligibility. 
The Randomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -up Period.  The 
Randomization Phase will begin at the time of randomization of the first subject and will end on 
the data cutoff date for the primary analysis (ie, when approximately 38 PFS events, as determined 
by  IIR, are observed) .  After the data cutoff date for the primary analysis has occurred , all subjects 
who are still on study treatment will enter the Extension Phase.
The Treat ment Period for each subject will begin at the time of randomization and will end at the 
completion of the Off -Treatment Visit ,which will occur within 30 days after the final dose of 
study treatment .  
Subjects will receive study treatment as continuous 2 1-day cycles in both treatment arms .
Treatment cycles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions . If chemotherapy 
administration is precluded on Day 1 of a treatment cycle, the subject may resume treatment once 
recovered at the discretion of investigator . Subsequent chemotherapy will be administered every 21 
(±1) days starting from the timepoint it was resumed.
Subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments as defined in the Sche dule of 
Procedures/Assessments.  Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib until 
disease progression (PD) confirmed by IIR, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, 
withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the spo nsor, whichever occurs first. 
Disease progression (PD) must be confirmed by IIR prior to the investigator discontinuing study 
treatment for a subject.  In situations where the investigator judges that alternative treatments must 
be instituted immediately for a subject’s safety, study drugs may be discontinued without waiting

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 19of 147for IIR confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  If possible, before discontinuation of the 
subject from the study, the investigator should consult with the sponsor.
The Follow -upPeriod begins the day after the Off -Treatment Visit and will continue for up to 2 
years after end of treatment for a subject , unless the subject withdraws consent , or is lost to follow 
up,or the sponsor terminates the study.  
Subjects may at any time withdraw consent for further study participation.  No further data will be 
collected on subjects once consent has been withdrawn, however, an investigator may consult 
public records to establish survival status if permitted by local regulations.
All adverse events (AEs) ,including serious adverse events (SAEs) ,will be captured for 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
All subjects who end study treatment  without IIR confirmed PD, will continue to undergo tumor 
assessments every 6weeks until Week 18, then every 9 weeks until Week 54, thereafter, every 12 
weeks until confirmation of disease progression by IIR as described in the tumor assessments in the 
assessment schedule ,or until another anticancer therapy is initiated .
Subjects in both Arm A and Arm B will be followed for survival every 12 weeks ( ±1 week ) and all 
subsequent anticancer treatments received will be recorded.  Subjects who are being followed for 
survival at the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis (ie, at the end of the Randomization 
Phase) will continue to be followed for survival during the Follow -up Period of the Extension 
Phase.
Extension Phase :  The Extension Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -
up Period.  
In the Treatment Period , subjects still on study treatment following the completion of the 
Randomization Phase will continue study treatment as outlined in Section 9.4.1 until disease 
progr ession, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, or 
discontinuation of study by the sponsor .  Tumor assessments will be performed according to the 
local standard of care .  Independent imaging review ( IIR) review and confirmation of radiographic 
evidence of PDwill not be required ,and scans will no longer be required to besent to the imaging 
core laboratory ( ICL) .  The Off -Treatment Visit will occur within 30 days after the final dose of 
study treatment. All AEs , including SAEs will be captured up to 30 days after last dose of study 
drug.   In case the study is discontinued by the sponsor, the sponsor will provide study drug (outside 
the study) for subjects who have not met the criteria for study drug discontinuation . 
The Follow -up Period will begin the day after the Off -Treatment Visit and will last for up to 2 
years after end of treatment for a subject, unless the study is terminated by the sponsor , or the 
subject discontinues due to withdrawal of c onsent, or is lost to follow -up.  Subjects will be treated 
by the investigator according to the prevailing local standard of care.  Subjects will be followed 
every 12 weeks (±1week) for survival and all subsequent anticancer treatments received will be 
recorded.   
The definition of end of the study, as required by certain regulatory agencies, will be the date of 
data cutoff for the final analysis or the time of last subject last visit, whichever occurs later.

Assessm ents
Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessm ent will be performed based on RECIST 1.1.  Investigator –deter mined response 
assessments will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the case report form 
(CRF).  Copies of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to an imaging core labo ratory ( ICL)
designated by the sponsor for efficacy assessment and for confirmation of PD .  Tumor assessments 
will be carried out following the guidelines provided by the ICL.  
During the Screening Period, tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of 
known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1
Day 1.  A brain scan (CT scan with contrast or MRI pre -and post -gadolinium) will be performed at 
screening as clinically indicated, and thereafter during the study as clinically indicated.  Historical 
CT or MRI scans performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used as screening scans 
(baseline scans) to demonstrate eligibility, as long as they meet minimum standards as separately 
defined by the ICL.  
If available, bone imaging obtained within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 should be sent to the 
ICL.  B one lesions noted on the screening/baseline images should be followed as non -target lesions 
with modalities other than nuclear medicine scans.
Tumor assessments will then be performed every 6weeks ±1 week following the date of 
randomization until Week 18.  Following completion of the chemotherapy treatment period (ie,
after Week 18) , the frequency of tumor assessments will be every 9 weeks ±1 week until Week 54
±1 week.  Thereafter, they wil l be performed every 12 weeks ± 2 weeks until docume ntation of PD
(please see schedule of assessments for details) .  At any point, the CT /MRI scan should be 
performed earlier than the scheduled time point, if clinically indicated.  After data cutoff for the 
primary analysis , tumor assessments should be performed following the prevailing local standard 
of care.

Eisai
FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 26of 147Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 during the randomization phase must be confirmed by IIR 
prior to the investigator discontinuing study treatment.
In the event that the investigator considers alternative treatments must be instituted immediately for 
management of urgent medical complications of PD, study drugs may be discontinued without 
waiting for independent confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  Subjects who discontinue 
study treatment without PD will continue to undergo tumor assessments according to the schedule 
until PD is documented or another anticancer therapy is initiated.
Prior to optional lenvatinib crossover, baseline tumor assessment must be re -established (i.e., n ew 
tumor asse ssment scans performed) , unless the last tumor assessment scans were performed within 
4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of the crossover treatment.
During the Optional Lenvatinib Crossover Treatment Phase, tumor assessments will be performed 
as clinically ind icated per the institutional guidelines (but no less frequently than every 12 weeks) , 
following the prevailing local standard of care. Scans are not required to be submitted to the 
independent imaging core laboratory during the Optional Lenvatinib Crossove r Treatment Phase. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for plasma concentrations of lenvatinib will be collected from all subjects from 
ArmA only as described in the Schedule of Assessments. Pharmacokinetic sampling should not be 
performed for any subject with a body weight <13 kg ( please see Section 9.5.1.3.1 ).
Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Assessments
Optional p harmacodynamic serum and archived fixed tumor tissue samples for biomarker analysis 
maybe collected from subjects randomized to Arm A only, as described in the Schedule of 
Assessments. Pharmacodynamic sampling should not be performed for any subject with a body 
weight <1 6 kg (please see Section 9.5.1.3.2 ).Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor biomarkers 
assessed in this study will be based on those identified in other l envatinib clinical studies.  
Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be performed as described in a separateanalysis plan.
Note: Providing blood samples for pharmacodynamic biomarker assessment is optional and will 
not impact subject eligibility.
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs), including all 
grades per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0 (for both increasing and decreasing 
severity), and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory evaluation for hematology, blood 
chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and physical 
examinations.
Progression of osteosarcoma and signs and symptoms clearly related to the progression of the 
osteosarcoma shou ld not be captured as an AE.  Disease progression is a study endpoint and should 
be captured in the CRF as per the guidelines for reporting disease progression.
Other Assessments
HRQoL assessment will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments.   Impact o f treatment on 
HRQoL will be assessed using the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer 
Module). 
Bioanalytical Methods
Lenvatinib in plasma will be quantified using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method.  Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be performed as 
described in a separate analysis plan.  Clinical laboratory tests will be p erformed at qualified local 
laboratories.

Primary Endpoint
PFS (progression -free survival) by IIR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of the first documentation of PD or death (whichever occurs first) as determined by 
IIR using RECIST 1.1.
Secondary Endpoints
PFS-4m rate (progression- free survival rate at 4 months) by IIR is defined as the 
percentage of subjects who are alive and without PD at 4 months from the randomization date 
as determined by IIR of radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1.  The PFS -4m rate is estimated 
using the Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) method.

Analysis Sets
The Full Analysis Set (Intent -to-Treat Analys is [ITT]) includes all randomized subjects 
regardless ofthe treatment actually received.  This is the primary analysis population used for the 
efficacy analyses which will be based on the ITTprinciple.
The Per Protocol Analysis Set includes those subjects from theITT setwho received at least 1 
dose of any study drug, had no major protocol deviations and had both baseline and at least one 
postbaseline tumor assessment.  Subjects for whom death occurred prior to the first postbaseli ne 
tumor assessment will also be included.  The per protocol analysis set will be the secondary 
analysis set for efficacy endpoints.
The Safety Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of any study drug.   This is 
the analys is population used for all safety analyses which will be based on as- treated principle.
Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set includes the subjects who have received at least 
1 dose of lenvatinib with documented dosing history and have measurable plasma levels of
lenvatinib.
The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had sufficient pharm acodynamic data (eg, at least 1 evaluable/measurable pharm acodynamic
parameter).
The HRQoL Analysis Set will consist of all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 
dose of study medication, and have at least 1 patient -reported outcome (PRO) assessment 
completed beyond baseline.  For PRO analysis, subjects will be analyzed as randomized and not 
according to treatment ac tually received.
Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the Full Analysis Set.
All primary statistical analyse s will be conducted at the data cutoff date for the primary analysis 
(ie, when approximately 38 PFS events, as determined by IIR, are observed).
Primary Analysis
Progress ion-free survival (PFS) will be analyzed and compared between the 2treatment arm susing 
the stratified log -rank test with time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late 
[≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) as strata.  PFS censoring rules will follow FDA guidance 
of 2007 and will be detailed in the statistical analysis plan. Median PFS will be calculated using the 
Kaplan -Meier (K-M ) product -limit estimates for each treatment arm along with 2 -sided 95% 
confidence  intervals ( CIs) .  The K -M estimates of PFS will be plotted over time. The Cox 
regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 95% CIs stratified by the 
stratification factors.

The PFS -4m rate and PFS -1y rate will be estimated on the Full Analysis Set using the K -M method 
for the primary efficacy PFS analysis .PFS-4m/PFS -1y rate and their Greenwood standard errors 
will be evaluated using the K -M estimates from both treatment groups.  The statistical significance

95% CI and a p-value will be constructed using the difference of these 2 K -M PFS -4m/PFS -1y 
rates and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors.    
Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arm and control arm following the same 
statistical method for the primary efficacy PFS endpoint. Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates of OS rate 
will also be presented for 4, 6, 9 ,and 12 months with 2-sided 95% CIs .
The ORR will be summarized and compared between the two treatment arms using stratified 
Miettinen and Nurminen’s method. The difference in ORR and its 2 -sided 95% confidence interval 
from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method with strata weighting by sample size will be 
reported. The stratification factors used for randomization will be applied to theanalysis. The 
ORR -4m will be summarized and compared between arms using the same approach as for ORR.
Exploratory Analys es
Median DOR among responders for each arm will be presented along with its corresponding 2 -
sided 95% CIs.  Disease Control Rate (DCR) and CBR will be summarized and compared between 
arms using the same approach as for ORR. 
Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomar ker Analyses
Pharmacodynamic, and other biomarker analyses may be performed and reported separately.  
Details of these analyses may be described in a separate analysis plan.
Blood serum samples may be analyzed using global proteomic methods, enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead -based immunoassay, or other assays/methods and 
new technology in an effort to identify biomarkers. 
Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be collected (if available) for assessment of mutations and other 
genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and progression of cancer 
as well as for potential use in diagnostic development.
Data obtained from the pharmacodynamic samples will be used for research.  The 
pharmacodynamic samples will n ot be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an 
individual subject does not currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) 
may be stored for up to 15 years to assist in any research scientific questions related to lenvatin ib 
and for potential diagnostic development.   Ifthe subject reaches the age of 18 years ( oratthe 
appropriate age per local country requirements ) while on the study, and becomes competent to give 
informed consent, his/her consent will be obtained using separate informed consent forms (ICFs) to 
continue on the study. Further analyses will not be performed on samples collected from subjects 
who do not reconsent at the age of 18 years (or at the appropriate age p er local country 
requirements).
Pharmacokinet ic Analyses
Lenvatinib concentration versus time data will be tabulated and summarized and graphically 
presented.
Lenvatinib data from Arm A of the study will be pooled with available data from other studies and 
subjected to population PK analysis.  The PK model will be parameterized in terms of clearance

Interim Analyses
No i nterim analysis is planned for this study.
The safety monitoring will be conducted by the independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC) .
The frequency of safety reviews will be defined in the IDMC charter. Minutes from the open 
meetings of the IDMC will be provided if requested by regulatory agencies. The recommendation 
whether to stop the study for safety will be reached by the IDMC based on their review of safety 
data with treatment information. The function and membership of the IDMC will be described in 
the IDMC charter.
Sample Size Rationale
A total sample size of 72 subjects is estimated for the primary efficacy endpoint of PFS. Assuming 
a hazard ratio of 0.4 (median PFS of 3.5 and 8.75 months for the control armandthe test arm , 
respectively) , a one-sided type 1 error rate of 0.025, and power of 80%, 38 PFS events are required 
for the primary analysis . The total sample size of 72 subjects is estimated to achieve 38 PFS events 
assuming the analysis occur s  approximately 32 months after the first subject is randomized 
(assuming a 20- month enrollment period), and accounts for a dropout rate of up to 40%.

5.1 Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees
The protocol, informed consent form (ICF) /assent , and appropriate related documents must 
be reviewed and approved by  an Inst itutional Review Board ( IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) consti tuted and funct ioning in accordance with theInternational Council 
for Harm onisat ion of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use ( ICH) E6 
(Good Clinical Pract ice), Secti on3, and any  local regul ations(eg, European Unio n [EU] 
Clinical Trial s Direct ive 2001/20/EC or Code of Federal Regulat ions, Ti tle 21 CFR Part 56) .  
Any protocol amendment or revisio n to the ICF will be resubmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
review and approval, except for changes invo lving only logist ical or administrative aspects of 
the study  (eg, change in clinical research associate(s) [ CRAs], change of telephone 
number[s]).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance with the ICH E6 and any local 
regul ations regarding const itution and review conduct will be provided to the sponsor.
Documented study  approval  from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the principal 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution)with a copy  to the 
sponsor before study  start and the release of any study  drug to the si te by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides to suspend or terminate the study , 
the invest igator (or if regio nally  requi red, the head of the m edical inst itution)will 
immediately  send the noti ce of study  suspensi on or terminat ion by the IRB/IEC to the 
sponsor.
Study  progress i s to be reported to IRB/IECs annually  (or as requi red) by the investigator or 
sponsor, depending on local regulatory  obligat ions.  If the invest igator is required to report to 
the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy  to the sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The invest igator (s) or the sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any  reportabl eadverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines 
and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon complet ion of the study , the invest igator will 
provi de the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study , if requi red.
At the end of the study , the sponsor should notify  the IRB/IEC and Com petent Authori ty 
(CA) within 90 days.  The definit ion of the end of the study  is the date of the data cutoff for 
the final analysis or last subject/last visit, including discont inuat ion from the study  for any  
reason, whichever occurs later.
In the case of early terminat ion/tem porary  halt of the study , the invest igator should notify the 
IRB/IEC and CA wit hin 15 calendar days, and a detailed written explanat ion of the reasons 
for the terminat ion/halt shoul d be given.
5.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
This study  will be conducted in accordanc e with standard operating procedures of the 
sponsor (or designee), which are designed to ensure adherence to GCP guidelines as required

5.3 Subject Information and Informed Consent
As part of administering the informed consent document, the invest igator must explain to 
each subject or guardian ,in accordance wit h applicable professio nal standards and local 
laws/regulat ions or legally acceptable representati ve,the nature of the study , its purpose, the 
procedures invo lved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits invo lved, any 
potenti al discomfort, potenti al alternat ive procedure (s) or course (s) of treatment available to 
the subject, and the exten t of maintaining confidentialit y of the subject’s records.  Each 
subject and the legally authorized representative must be informed that participation in the 
study  is vol untary , that he/she may withdraw from the study  at any  time, and that wi thdrawal  
of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relat ionship with the 
treating physician.
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in 
nontechnical language.  The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative shoul d 
understand the statement before signing and dating it and will be given a copy  of the si gned 
docum ent.  If a subject is unable to read or if a legally  accep table representative is unable to 
read, an impartial wit ness should be present during the ent ire informed consent discussio n.  
In countri es where specific laws for children are established for informed consent, those local 
laws will be applied.  A fter the ICF and/or assent form and any  other wri tten inform ation to 
be prov ided to subjects is read and explained to the subject or the subject’s legally accep table
representative, and after the subject or the subject’s legally accep table representative has 
orally  consented to the subject’s participation in the study  and, if capa ble o f doing so, has 
signed and personally  dated the ICF and/or assent form , the wi tness shoul d sign and 
personally date the consent form.  The subje ct and/or the subject’s parent(s) or legally

7INTRODUCTION
7.1 Osteosarcoma
Cancer i s a rel atively unco mmo n diagnosis in the pedi atric popul ation, and the overall 
incidence is low (18.6 cases per 100,000 children [ Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ]).  Solid tumors 
constitute approximately  60% of  childhood m alignancies ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ).  
Malignant bone tumors are the fifth most comm on solid tum or ty pe account ing for about 5% 
of childhood tumors ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019; Kaatsch, 2010 ). 
Osteosarcoma is the most commo nly diagnosed primar y malignancy o f the bone in children 
and y oung adul ts, and accounts for approximately 5% of childhood tumors , with an estimated
annual incidence of 4.4 cases per 1 millio n in people younger than 24 years ( Mirabello, et al., 
2009 ).  Osteosarcoma occurs predominant ly in adolescents and y oung adul ts.  The m edian 
age at diagnosis is 20 y ears, wi th the incidence peaking at 15 to 19 years of age (ESMO, 
guidelines, 2014 ).  According to the Amer ican Cancer Society , osteosarcoma in this age 
group i s8 per 1 million (Ward, et al ., 2014) .

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 44of 147There are both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that have been shown to contribute to the 
development of osteosarcoma. Studies have demonstrated that several genetic abnorm alities, 
including the overexpressio n of vascular endoth elial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 
(VEGFR) ,platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR), and c-fos, are
associ ated wi th the development of osteosarcoma in laboratory  models as well  as humans 
(Gorlick and Khanna, 2010 ).  However, osteosarcoma is not characterized by  a single 
oncogenic driver .  The vast majorit y of abnorm al oncogenes and tum or-suppressor genes 
associ ated wi th osteosarcom a are also comm on in the m ost prevalent cancers ( Gorlick and 
Khanna, 2010).  Extrinsic factors such as ionizing radiation, which is used for the treatment 
of childhood solid tumors ,havebeen well implicated in the development of a second 
malignancy, with osteosarcoma being the most likely to develop within the first 2 decades 
following treatm ent (Le Vu, et al., 198 8).
The m anagement of osteosarcoma is multimodal; pati ents not amenable to surgery  or pati ents 
at second or third relapse have a poor prognosis.  Metastatic osteosarcoma is commo n (10% 
to 20% ) (NCCN, Bone cancer guidelines, 2020 ;Casali , et al ., 2018 ),with the m ost frequent 
site being the l ung (>85%) .  In the case of iso lated lung metastases, more than a third of 
patients wi th a second surgical remissio n survive for >5 y ears(Casali, et al., 2018 ).  
Approximately  25% of  all pat ients with primary  metasta tic osteosarcoma and >40% of those 
who achieve a complete surgical remissio n may becom e long-term survivors ( Casali , et al ., 
2018 )as compared with 65% to 70% of patients wit h localized disease ( Meazza and 
Scanagatta, 2016) .
About 30% to 40% of patients with localized disease and 80% of those with metastatic 
disease experience relapse ( NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2020; Casali , et al ., 2018; 
Ferrari , 2003 ).  The presence of so litary metastasis, time to first relapse, and complete 
resectabilit y of disease at first recurrence are the most significant prognostic indicators for 
improved survival.  Patients whose tumor is not amenable to surgery , or wi th second or thi rd 
recurrence, or who have metastases to the bone, have a poor prognosis.   In general, despite 
second -line treatment, the prognosis of recurrent disease in osteosarcoma has remained poor, 
with long-term postrel apse survival of <20% (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2020; Casali, 
et al., 2018 ).  
7.2 Current Therapeutic Options
There has been no substantial progress in the treatment of osteosarcoma since the 1980s. 
Current treatment utilizes mult i-agent chemotherapy  and surgi cal resecti on of  all clinically 
detectable disease.  
Treatment of New ly Diagnosed Disease
Newly diagnosed osteosarcoma is ty pically man aged wi th neoadj uvant chem otherapy 
followed by surgical remo val of the primary  tumor and all clinically  evident m etastati c 
disease, fo llowed by  adjuvant chemotherapy .  Surgical resect ion of all clinically detectable 
sites of  disease is vital, regardless of number and site, as complete resection is predictive o f

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 45of 147survival ( Meazza and Scanagatta, 2016 ).  For patients with unresectable disease at mult iple 
sites, experimental  therapy  is also consi dered, due to the poor prognosis for these patients. 
The m ost effect ive chemotherapy regimens include the combinat ion of high -dose 
methotrexa te, doxorubicin, and cisplat in and has becom e the standard treatment for 
high-grade osteosarcoma ( NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2020; Ferrari  and Serra, 2015; 
Isakoff, et al., 20 15).
Treatment of Relapsed, Refractory, and Progressive Disease
Second- line treatment for relapsed disease consists of chemotherapy and/or surgical resect ion
(NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2020; Casali, et al., 2018 ).The rol e of second -line 
chemotherapy for recurrent osteosarcoma is much less well defined than that of surgery ,and 
there is no accepted standard regimen ( Casali, et al., 2018 ).For pati ents wi th resectable 
solitary  metastasis to the lung, surgical resect ion only  may be adequate. For those with 
recurrent pulmo nary metastases that are resectable, surgery  is advised in addit ion to 
neoadj uvant or ad juvant chem otherapy , regardless of the number of previous lung relapses 
and the number of secondary  pulm onary lesions ( Briccoli, et al., 2005). Aggressive surgical 
resection o f metastases and the abilit y to achieve a second surgical remission have 
consistent ly been shown essential for long -term survival  following rel apse ( Leary , et al ., 
2013; Kempf -Bielack, et al ., 2005; Bacci, et al., 2005; Chou, et al., 2005; Hawkins and 
Arndt, 2003 ).  
As per the European Societ y for Medi cal Onco logy (ESMO) guidelines for bone sarcoma, 
treatm ent opti onsfor recurrent osteosarcoma include ifosfamide ±etoposi de ±carbopl atin, 
and other active drugs (Casali, et al., 2018 ).Preferred regimens for second -line therapy per 
the National  Com prehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN )bone sarco ma guidelines include
ifosfamide (high dose) with or without etoposide, regorafenib, sor afenib, and sorafenib plus 
evero limus (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 2020) .
In the event of subsequent relapse, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines, 
2020 )and ESMO guidelines ( Casali, et al., 2018) strongly encourage participation in clinical 
studi es.  Otherwise, pati ents wi th disease progression or relapse after second -line therapy are 
managed wit h surgical resect ion, palliat ive radiotherapy , or best supportive care.
7.3 Lenvatinib
E7080 (l envat inib) is a potent mult iple receptor ty rosine kinase ( RTK) inhibitor (RTKI) that 
select ively inhibits VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 
(FLT4), in addit ion to other pro -angiogenic and oncogenic pathway -related RTKs, including 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 1-4, PDGF recep tor al pha (PDGFRα), KIT, 
and RET.   Therefore, lenvat inib exerts it s in vivo ant itumoural  activity based on m ultiple 
mechanisms invo lved in and through effects related to angiogenesis (including reversio n of 
resistance) and the tumor microenvironment, as we ll as direct inhibitory  action on the tumour 
cells.  Recent studies have also demonstrated lenvatinib’s immuno modulatory  activity in the 
tumor microenvironment.  This includes decreases in immunosuppressive tumor -associated

signaling.  These all contribute to lenvat inib’s ant itumor activit y in immunoco mpetent mice 
(Kato, et al., 2019; Kimura, et al., 2018 ).
7.3.1 Clinical Data on Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide 
for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma
The safet y, tolerabilit y and activit y of single -agent lenvat inib, and lenvat inib in co mbinat ion 
with chem otherapy  (ifosfamide and etoposi de), have been assessed in E7080 -G000 -207 
(hereafter referred to as Study  207), an ongoing Phase 1/2, mult icenter, open -label study in 
children ,adolescents and y oung adul ts withsolid tumors, including relapsed or refractory  
osteosarcom a, and radioiodine-refractory  differentiated thy roid carcino ma. The 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lenvat inib was determined in the Phase 1b porti onas
14 m g/m2orally  once daily when given as single -agent as well as in co mbinat ion with 
etoposide (100 mg/m2IV once daily for 3 days) + ifosfamide (3000 mg/m2IV once daily for 
3 day s), administered on days 1 to 3 of each 21 -day cycle, for 5 cycles. Safet y and efficacy
is being assessed in the Phase 2 portion of the study.
Data from Study  207 have shown that p atients with osteosarcoma may benefit from treatment 
with lenvatinib. In the single agent expansio n cohort in relapsed/refractory  osteosarcom a, 
(n=3 1; Cohort 2B), 9 of 28 evaluable pat ients (32.1%) achieved progression -free survival 
(PFS) at 4 months (PFS -4m), median PFS was 3.0 mo nths (95% CI: 1.8, 5. 5). Two out of 
29subjects (6.9%) with measurable disease had a parti al response (PR) (Gaspar, et al., 2018 ).  
Amo ng the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set for the single -agent lenvat inib 
expansio n cohort, the most commo n adverse events were: headache (48%), vomit ing (45%), 
decreased appet ite, diarrhea, and hypothy roidism  (42% each), proteinuria (39%), increased 
blood TSH, hy pertensio n, nausea, py rexia, and weig ht decreased (36% each).  Five subjects 
(16.1%) di scont inued treatment due to TEAEs ,and 8subjects (25.8%) reported TEAEs 
leading to study  drug dose reducti on.  There were no treatment -related fatal  TEAEs (Gaspar, 
et al., 2018 ).  
In a pool ed analysis o f subjects from Phase 1b and 2 receiving lenvat inib14 m g/m2in 
combinat ion with ifosfamide plus etoposi de (N=35; full analysis set ),the primary  efficacy 
endpo int, PFS -4 rate based on RECIST 1.1 by investi gator assessment, was 67.9% (95% CI: 
47.6, 84.1) . As of the data cutoff date of 23 Jul 2019, the object ive response rate (ORR) was 
12.5%, including 4 subjects with PR. Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 4.5, 12.6) , and 
median overall survival ( OS)was 16.3 months (95% CI: 12.6 , NE)(Gaspar, et al., 2019) .
Overall t reatm ent wi th lenvat inibin co mbinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide in this 
patient popul ationwas associ ated wi th a manageable safet y profile , and no unexpected 
toxicities were observed .Among the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set,the most 
frequent treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia ( 71%), nausea and 
vomiting (61% each), diarrhea (52%), neutropenia , platel et count decreased , and white blood 
cell count decreased (48%each).  The most common treatment -related g rade ≥3 TEAEs were 
anemia (52%), neutropenia (48%), platelet count decreased andwhite blood cell count

Eight subjects (25.8%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs , and 15 subjects (48.4%) 
reported TEAEs leading to study  drug dose reduction . There were no treatment -related fatal
TEAEs (Gaspar , et al ., 2019 ).
7.4 Study Rationale
Study  230, a randomized ,controlled Phase 2 study , will evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of 
lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with ifosfamide and etoposi de in children , adol escents ,and y oung 
adults wi th relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a.Eligible patients aged 2 to 2 5years old will 
receive ifo sfamide and etoposide wit h or without lenvat inib (14 mg/m2;RP2D f rom 
Study 207). Subjects rando mized to Arm A can cont inue to receive l envat inib unt il disease 
progression, intolerable toxicit y, or withdrawal of consent. Approximately 72 subjects will 
be treated in the study .  The primary  object ive of the study  is to dem onstrate that l envat inib 
in combinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide has superior efficacy co mpared to ifosfamide 
and etoposide based on PFS in children, adolescents and y oung adul ts wi th relapsed or 
refractory  osteosarcom a.
Pediatric soli d tum ors are hi ghly vasculari zed.  Angi ogenesis and vasculogenesis are the 
fundamental processes by which new blood vessels are formed.  As with normal t issue, the 
growing tumor requires an extensive network of capillaries to pr ovide the necessary nutrients 
and oxygen.  Moreover, the new intratumor blood vessels o ffer a way  for tum or cells to enter 
the circulati on and metastasi ze to di stant organs and thus play an indispensable role in so lid 
tumor growth and m etastasi s. Thus, inhibit ion of angiogenesis is a viable target for 
anticancer therapy .  Moreover, vascular norm alizati on allows reoxy genati on, hence the 
addition of  an ant i-VEGF to chemotherapy  may resul t in increased uptake of drugs into 
tumor tissue ( Tuettenberg, et al., 2 006).
7.4.1 Benefit -Risk Assessment
As di scussed in Sect ion7.3.1 , the safet y, tolerabilit y and activit y of single -agent lenvat inib, 
and lenvat inib in combination wit h chem otherapy  (ifosfamide and etoposi de), have been 
assessed in Study  207.  A pool ed analysis of pat ients enrolled in Phase 1b and Phase 2, who 
received lenvat inib at the RP2D in co mbination with chemotherapy was conducted (N=35; 
data cutoff date 23 Jul 2019). In thi s heavily  pretreated popul ation, PFS -4m was 67.9% 
(95% CI:  47.6, 84.1), median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI:  4.5, 12.6), and median overall 
survival was 16.3 months (95% CI:  12.6, NE).  The activit y of lenvatinib in co mbinat ion 
with ifosfamide plu s etoposi de, as assessed by PFS -4m is clinically meaningful, displaying 
encouraging results when compared to other agents recommended in the ESMO guidelines 
for relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a (PFS -4m from 42% to 46%) ( Casali, et al., 2018 ;
Grignani  etal., 2012 ;Berger et al., 2009).
In Study  207, no treatm ent-related fatal TEAEs were observed and safet y data indicate that 
the toxicit y of the combinati on is manageable and consistent with the known toxicit ies of 
each study  drug and the disease under stu dy.

Randomization will fo llow a predefined rando mization scheme based on the fo llowing 
stratificat ion factors: time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 mo nths] or late 
[≥18 months]) and age (<18 and ≥18 y ears).
The Sponsor will closely mo nitor enrol lment, to ensure that a minimum o f 36 subject s are 
<17years of age at the time of informed consent .  
The study  will be conducted in 3 Phases: a Pre -rando mizat ion Phase, a Rando mizat ion 
Phase, and an Extensio n Phase.  
The end o f the study  will be the date of data cutoff for the final analysis or the time of last 
subject last visit, whichever occurs later.

ThePrerando mizat ion Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline. The 
Prerandomization Phase will last no longer t han 28 days.  The Screening Period will establish 
protocol  eligibilit y and the Baseline Period will confirm eligibilit y.
Screening Period
Screening will occur between Day –28and Day  –2.  The purpose of the Screening Period is 
to obtain informed consent and to establish protocol eligibilit y.  Inform ed consent will be 
obtained after the study  has been fully  explained to each subject and before the conduct of 
any screening procedures or as sessments.  Procedures to be followed when obtaining 
inform ed consent are detailed in Section5.3.
Subjects must have a histologically or cytologic ally confirmed diagnosis of high grade 
refractory  or relapsed osteosarcoma as detailed in the Inclusio n Cri teria (Secti on 9.3.1 ).
The Screening Dis position case report form (CRF) page must be completed to indicate 
whether the subject is eligible to participate in the study and to provide reasons for screen 
failure, if applicable.
Baseline Period
The purpose of the Baseline Period is to confirm protoc ol eligibilit y as specified in the 
inclusio n/excl usion criteria (as detailed in Sect ion 9.3.1 and Section 9.3.2 ).  Resul ts of 
baseline assessments must be obtained prior to the first dose of study  drug (Cy cle 1 Day  1).  
Baseline assessments may be performed on Day - 1 or on Cycle 1 Day  1 pri or to dosing.  
Clinical laboratory  tests (Table 4), including a pregnancy test (where applicable), should be 
performed wit hin72 hours pri or to the first dose of study  drug.
Subjects who complete the Baseline Period and cont inue to meet the criteria for 
inclusio n/excl usion (as detailed in Sect ion 9.3.1 and Section 9.3.2 )will begin the 
Randomization Phase of thi s study .
9.1.2 Randomization Phase
The Rando mizat ion Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Fo llow-up Peri od.  
The Rando mizat ion Phase will begin at the time of randomizat ion of the first subject and will 
end on the data cutoff date for the primary analysis (ie, when approxi mately 38 PFS events, 
as determined by  IIR, are observed).
After the data cutoff date for the primary analysis has occurred, all subjects who are still on 
study  treatm ent will enter the Extension Phase.

Treatment Period
The Treatment Period for each subj ect will  begin at the time of randomizat ion and will end at 
the com pletion of  the Off- Treatm ent Vi sit which will  occur wi thin 30 days after the final 
dose of study  treatm ent.
Subjects will receive study  treatm ent as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatme nt arms .
Treatment cy cles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions.  If 
chemotherapy administrati on is precluded on Day 1 of a treatment cycle, the subject may 
resum e treatm ent once recovered at the discret ion of investigator.  Subseq uent chemotherapy 
will be administered every 21 (±1) days starting from the timepo int it was resumed .  Subjects 
will undergo safet y and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule o f 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 5).  Subj ects randomized to Arm A will cont inue to receive 
lenvat inib unt il disease progression (PD) confirmed by IIR, development of unacceptable 
toxicity, subject request, wi thdrawal of cons ent, or study  terminat ion by the sponsor, 
whichever occurs first. 
Disease progressi on (PD) must be confirmed by  IIR pri or to the invest igator discontinuing 
study  treatm ent for a subj ect.  In si tuations where the invest igator judges that alternative 
treatm ents m ust be inst ituted immediately  for a subject’s safet y, study  drugs may  be 
discontinued wit hout wait ing for IIR confirmat ion of radiographic evidence of PD.  If 
possible, before discontinuation of the subject from the study, the invest igator should con sult 
with the sponsor.
Follow -UpPeriod
The Fo llow-up Peri od begins the day  after the Off -Treatment Visit and will cont inue for up 
to 2 y earsafter end of treatm ent for a subject , unless the subject withdraws consent or the 
sponsor terminates the study .  
Subjects may at any  time withdraw consent for further study  parti cipat ion.  No further data 
will be co llected on subjects once consent has been withdrawn, however, an investigator may 
consult public records to establish survival status if permitted by loca l regulations.
All adverse events (AEs) , including serious adverse events (SAEs), will be captured for 30 
days after the last dose of study  drug.  
All subjects who endstudy  treatm ent without IIR confirmed PD, will cont inue to undergo 
tumor assessments every 6 weeks until Week 18, then every  9 weeks unt il Week 54, 
thereafter, every  12 weeks unt il IIR confirmati on of  radiographic evidence of PD as 
described in the tumor assessments in the assessment schedule, or until another anticancer 
therapy  is init iated .

of the Extensio n Phase . 
9.1.3 Extension Phase
The Extensio n Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Fo llow-up Peri od.  
Treatment Period
In the Treatment Period, subjects still on study  treatm entfollowing the com pletion of the 
Randomization Phase will continue to receive study treatment as outlined in Section9.1.2.1
until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicit y, subject request, withdrawal 
of consent, or di scont inuat ion of study  by the sponsor .  Tumor assessments will be performed 
according to the local standard of care .  Independent imaging review ( IIR)review and 
confirmat ion of radiographic evidence of PDwill not be required, and scans will no longer be 
requi red to besent to the imaging core laboratory ( ICL).  The Off -Treatm ent Vi sit will occur 
within 30 days after the final dose of study  treatm ent. All AEs, including SAEs will be 
captured up to 30 days after last dose of study  drug.   In case the study  is discont inued by the 
sponsor, the sponsor will provide study  drug (outside the study ) for subjects who have not 
met the cri teria for study  drug di scont inuat ion.
Follow -Up Period
The Fo llow-up Peri od will  begin the day  after the Off -Treatment Vi sit and will last for up to
2 years after end of treatment for a subject, unless the study is terminated by the sponsor, or 
the subject di scont inues due to withdrawal of consent, or is lost to fo llow-up.  Subj ects will 
be treated by  the invest igator according to the prevailing local standard of care.  Subjects will 
be followed every  12 weeks (±1week) for survival and all subsequent ant icancer treatments 
received will be recorded.
9.1.4 Optional Lenvatinib Crossover (for Subjects in Arm B Only):
Subjects in Arm B with disease progression per RECIST 1.1 may be eligible for optional 
treatm ent wi th lenvat inib±chem otherapy. Note: subjects may only receive a maximum of 5 
cycles of chemotherapy  for the durati on of  the study . Opt ional crossover treatment must be
initiated within 30 days of documented disease progressio n.
Optional lenvatinib crossover i s only  available if the following condit ions are m et:
-Subject experiences disease progressi on per RECIST 1.1 (as confirmed by IIR for all 
subjects who crossover pri or to the start of the Extensio n Phase); and
-No new sy stemic ant i-cancer medication was administered after the l ast dose of  study 
drugs; and
-The subject meets all of the safet y parameters listed in the inclusio n criteria and none 
of the safet y parameters l isted in the exclusio n criteria; and

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
The study  has been designed as an open -label,randomized study  to com pare the safet y and 
efficacy of lenvat inib in combinat ion with the ifosfamide and etoposide with ifo sfamide and 
etoposide alone in children, adolescents, and y oung adul ts wi th relapsed or refractory  
osteosarcoma. Ifosfamide and etoposide will be used as the con trol group since it is a 
recogni zed treatm entoption forpatients with relapsed osteosarcoma .
Progression -free survival (PFS) as compared to control, with blinded IIRof radiological 
imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria will be evaluated as the primary  endpoint.  The e ndpo int 
was determined as appropriate for the study , given the unique bio logy of the osteosarcom a.
To avoi d bias in efficacy  assessment, the analysis for primary endpo int is based on tumor 
assessment by  IIR, a central independent blinded assessment. Progr ession -free survival at 4 
months (PFS -4m), at 1 year (PFS -1y), ORR at 4 months , ORR, OS at 1 y ear (OS -1y), and OS 
will also be evaluated in the study as secondary  endpoints. 
Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor bio markers ident ified in other lenvat inib clinical studies 
may be assessed in samples collected from subjects enro lled in this study in the test arm only 
(Arm A: lenvatinib + ifosfamide + etoposide) and may be used for explo ratory  analysis for 
evaluat ion of response -related and/or safety -related outcom es.
The study  will also assess healt h related qualit y of life (HRQoL) using validated 
questionnaires.
Randomization will be used in this study  to avoi d bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatm ent, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg, 
demographics and baseline characterist ics) are balanced across treatment groups, an d to 
ensure the validit y of statistical  com parisons across treatm ent groups.
9.3 Selection of Study Population
Approximately  72 subjects between 2 and ≤25 years of age will be rando mized (36subjects 
in each arm ). Subjects who do not meet all of the inclusio n criteria or who m eet any  of the 
exclusio n criteria will not be eligible to receive study  drug.

Before dose administration on Day 1 of each cycle and prior to a change in dose due to dose 
reducti on, the am ount of  lenvat inib needed for eac h subject must be calculated as fo llows: 
Scheduled dose (mg/m2) ×body  surface area (BSA) (m2) = lenvatinib dose (mg)
Body surface area (B SA)will be calculated using the method that is accepted and 
custom arily used by  the clinical  site.  BSA m ust be cal culated on Day  1 of each cycle based 
on the subject’s current height and body  weight.  BSA will be used to determine the amount 
of lenvat inib for each subject.  BSA should not be corrected for amputation. The dose should 
be rounded to the nearest whole nu mber. After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose of 
lenvat inib shoul d not exceed 24 mg daily. 
Subjects will receive study  treatm ent as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatment arms .  
Treatment cy cles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interr uptions.  If 
chemotherapy administration is precluded on Day  1 of a treatm ent cy cle, the subject m ay 
resum e treatm ent once recovered at the discret ion of investigator.  Subsequent chemotherapy

Obesity  is defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles corresponding to 30 kg/m², related to the age of 
the children (Cole, et a l., 2000) or BMI ≥ the 95th percentile for children and teens of the same age and sex 
(Ogden, et al., 2002 ) (Appendix 7 and Appendix 8 ).   
e:For asy mptomatic laboratory abnormalities, such as Grade ≥3 elevations of amylase and lipase that are not 
considered clinically relevant by the investigator, continuation of treatm ent should be discussed with the

9.4.1.1.1 BLOOD PRESSURE
For children, blood pressure varies by the sex and age of the child and it is closely related to 
height and weight.  Blood pressure will be assessed in terms of percent ile for sex, age and 
height/l ength.  Gui delines to sex, age, and height -specific percent iles of blood pressure are
provi ded in Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 .  BP that is consistent ly above the 95th percentile 
based on sex, age, and height/length for subjects <18 years old; or BP ≥140/90 mmHg for

recommended for patients who develop hypertension during the study . Ideally , 
cardi ovascular assessments and the management of hypertension should be supervised by  a 
cardi ologist.  Exerci se, exci tement, coughing, crying ,and struggling may raise the sys tolic 
pressure of children as much as 40 to50mmHg greater than their usual level.  Variabilit y in 
blood pressure in children of approximately the same age and body  build shoul d be expected 
and serial measurements should always be obtained when evaluat inga pat ient with 
hypertensio n.BP values for the management of hypertension for participants 18 to 25 y ears 
old are included in parentheses in Sect ion9.4.1.1.1 .
9.4.1.1.2 MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
Hypertensio n is a recognized side -effect of treatm ent wi th drugs inhibit ing VEGF signaling.
Invest igators should therefore ensure that subjects enro lled to receive treatment with 
lenvat inib have BP <95th percentile [BP ≤150/90 mm Hg] f or sex, age, and height/length at 
the time o f study  entry  and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of 
antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1 Day 1. Early detection and 
effect ive management of hypertensio n are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose 
interrupti ons and reductions.  
Regular assessment of BP should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Hy pertensio n will be graded using CTCAE v5.0, based 
on BP m easurements only (and not on the num ber of ant ihypertensive medicat ions).
If the subject’s init ial BP m easurement is el evated (systolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [BP 
≥140 mm Hg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile [BP ≥90 mm Hg ]),the BP m easurement 
shoul d be repeated at l east 5 minutes later. The m ean value of 2 measurements at least 
5minutes apart is defined as 1BP assessment. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 
2BP m easurements ob tained at l east 5 minutes apart) is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a confirmato ry assessment shoul d be obtained at least 
30minutes later by performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean 
value.
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile [BP ≥140 mm Hg] or diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg]) is confirmed 
on 2 assessments obtained 30 minutes apart.  The cho ice of ant ihypertensive treatme nt should 
be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and fo llow standard m edical 
practi ce.  For previously  normotensive subjects, monotherapy  with one of the cl asses of 
antihypertensives should be started when systolic BP ≥95th percentile [B P ≥140 mm Hg] or 
diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg] is first observed on 2 assessments obtained 
30 minutes apart.  F or those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, treatm ent 
modificati on may be necessary  if hypertensio n persists.
Lenvat inib shoul d be wi thheld in any  instances where a subject is at imminent risk to develop 
a hypertensive crisis or has significant risk factors for severe complicat ions of uncontrolled

subject has been on the same antihypertensive medicat ions for at least 48 hours and the BP is 
controlled, lenvat inib shoul d be resumed as described bel ow. 
During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg )
or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg) must have their BP monitored on Day  15 
(or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP has been <95 th percent ile 
(≤150 mm Hg )and diastolic BP has been <95th percent ile (≤95 mm  Hg)for 2 consecut ive 
treatm ent cycles .  If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg) or 
diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg ) occurs, the subject mu st resum e the Day  15 
evaluat ion until systo lic BP has been <95th percentile (≤150 mm Hg )and di astolic BP has 
been <95th percentile (≤95 mm Hg) for 2 consecutive treatm ent cy cles.

Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy  for subjects not already 
receiving this. 
For those subjects already on ant ihypertensive medicat ion, the dose of the current agent 
may be increased, if appropriate, or 1 or more agents of a  d ifferent class of

9.4.1.1.4 MANAGEMENT OF PROTEINURIA
Regular assessment for proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Gui delines for assessment and management of 
proteinuria are sum marized as fo llows: 
Grading of Proteinuria
Grading according to CTCAE 5.0 ( Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program , 2017 ) will be 
based on the protein- creat inine ratio or 24- hour urinary protein result ,if available. For 
subjects ≥18 years of age, if the subje ct has 4+ proteinuria by dipst ick, a 24 -hour urinary 
protein result is required to confirm Grade 3 proteinuria.
Management of Proteinuria
Management of lenvat inib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria 
according to Table 1.
In the event of nephrotic syndro me, lenvatinib must be di scontinued .
Detection and Confirmat ion
Perform  urine di pstick testing per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5andTable 6)
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection i nitiated as soon as possible and 
at least wi thin 72 hours (or a n immediate spot urine protein -to-creati nine rat io [UPCR ]
test)AND for subjects <18 years of age, an immediate spot UPCR test, and if possible ,a 
24-hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) is 
requi red in the following situat ions:
-The first (init ial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while on lenvat inib
-A subsequent increase in severit y of urine dipst ick proteinuria occurring on the same 
lenvat inib dose level
-When there has been a lenvat inib dose reduction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipst ick result is ≥2+
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and 
at least wi thin 72 hours) t o verify the grade of proteinuria is required when UPCR is ≥2.4.

Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed on Day  15 
(or m ore frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 
2consecutive treatment cycles.
Proteinuria mo nitoring can be performed at the local laboratory  or invest igator site, but 
must be managed by the site physician.
9.4.1.1.5 MANAGEMENT OF HEPATOTOXICITY
Regular m onitoring of liver function tests ( ALT, AST, bilirubin levels) should be conducted 
as detailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and Table 6)and as clinically indicated. 
If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury  occur, instructi ons contained in the table for dose 
reducti on and interruptions o f the protocol should be fo llowed (see Table 1).  Appropri ate 
supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If hepat ic (any grade per 
CTCAE v5) failure occurs the study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
9.4.1.1.6 MANAGEMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS
Subjects should be advised to pay  attenti on to symptom s suggest ive of venous 
thromboembo lic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, 
cough, hemoptysis, tachy pnea, tachycardia, cyanosis, deep vein thrombosis signs including 
lower-extremit y swelling, redness and warmth to touch or tenderness. In case any of these 
symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the 
treating physician.  If a throm boembo lic event is confirmed, instructions contained in the 
table for dose reducti on and interrupti ons of the protocol should be fo llowed (see Table 1).  
Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close mo nitoring.  If a subject 
experiences a Grade 3 or a life-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reaction, including 
pulmo nary embo lism, study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
Arterial thromboembo lic events (eg, new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident) of any grade require study 
drug di scontinuati on.
9.4.1.1.7 MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCALCEMIA
Serum  calcium shoul d be m onitored m onthly  per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and 
Table 6). Corrected serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per 
CTCAE v5.0, using the fo llowing form ula: 
Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] ×0.8 + serum calcium)
The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ˃4 g/dL); in 
such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead.
Hypocalcemia shoul d be treated per i nstitutional gui delines (eg, using appr opriate calcium , 
magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.

The dose of lenvat inib, ifosfamide and etoposi dein this study  is the RP2D (14 m g/m2+ 
ifosfami de 3000 mg/m2+ etoposi de 100 m g/m2)established inStudy 207. The safet y, 
tolerabilit y and act ivity of single -agent l envat inib, and lenvat inib in combination wit h 
chemotherapy (ifosfamide and etoposide), have been assessed in Study  207, a phase 1/2, 
multicenter, open -label study in children, adolescents and young adults with so lid tumors, 
including relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a, and radi oiodine -refractory  different iated 
thyroid carcino ma.  The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lenvat inib was determined in 
the phase 1b portion as 14 mg/m2orally once daily when given as single -agent as well as in 
combinat ion with etoposi de (100 m g/m2IV once daily  for 3 days) + ifosfamide (3000 m g/m2
IV once daily for 3 day s), administered on day s 1 to 3 of each 21- day cycle, for 5 cycles. . 
BSA will be used to determine the daily dose of l envat inib for each subject. After adjust ment 
for BSA, the daily  dose of l envatinib cannot exceed 24 mg. Please see Section 7.3.1 for 
further details on the results of Study  207.
9.4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Lenvat inib capsules are to be taken orally once a day at approximately the same time in the 
morning wi thout regard to food intake for 21days from Cycle 1 onward.  If a subject misses 
a dose, it may  be taken wi thin the 12 hours following the usual t ime of the morning dose.  If 
more than 12 hours have elapsed from the time of the usual daily  dose, l envat inib shoul d be 
taken the next day  at the usual t ime in the morning.  In the event a subject vo mits after study  
drug administration, the subject should not take another dose until the next scheduled dose.  
Study  drugs should be administered at the clinic on PK sampling days. All scheduled vi sits 
must be conducted as per protocol, irrespective of treatment interruption. 
9.4.6 Blinding
The study  will not be blinded .
9.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All prior medicat ions (including over -the-counter medicat ions) administered 30 days before 
the first dose of study  drug and any  concomi tant therapy  administered to the subject during 
the course of the study  (starting at the date of informed consent) until 30 days after the final 
dose of study  drug will be recorded.  Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
procedures relating to malignancy  should be recorded.  Any  medicati on that is considered 
necessary  for the subject’s healt h and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of 
or interact with lenvatinibmay be cont inued during the study.
Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy  to ameli orate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood transfusio ns, fluid transfusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be 
given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere wi th the evaluati on 
of (or to interact with) lenvatinib.

(LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing 
factor (g-CSF) or equivalent may be used in accordance with American Societ y of Clinical  
Onco logy (ASCO), institutional, or national guidelines.  Ery thropoi etin may be used 
according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully  
monitored for increases in red blood cell ( RBC) counts.
Drug -Drug Interactions
The weak inhibitory  effect on CYP enzymes (in vitro) exhibited by lenvat inib suggests a l ow 
risk of lenvat inib interference wi th the PK of other drugs co -administe red in usual clinical 
practi ce.  There i s no clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction ( DDI)risk when lenvat inib 
is co-administered with CYP3A substrates such as midazo lam.  Simultaneous CYP3A4/P- gp 
inhibit ions by ketoconazole slight ly (15% to19%) incr eased systemic exposure to lenvat inib 
after oral  administrati on as measured by  AUC and C maxin humans.  Since no change was 
observed in half -life, t max, or t lag, the slight increase in systemic exposure is probably related 
to a decrease in first pass metab olism.  However, since the magnitude o f the change is small, 
coadministration of lenvat inib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors is not of clinical concern.  
Similarly, PK data did not suggest any major effects of rifampin on the exposure or 
disposi tion of  lenvat inib.  Following administration of a single dose of lenvat inib wit h a 
single dose of rifampin, lenvatinib exposure increased about 31%.  In contrast, fo llowing 
administration of mult iple doses of rifampin, free lenvat inib exposure was reduced about 9% 
and ab out 18% for total  lenvat inib.  These findings suggest that there is no clinically 
meaningful influence of eit her P -gp inhibit ion (singl e dose of rifampin) or simultaneous P -gp 
and CYP3A4 induction (mult iple doses of rifampin) on lenvat inib PK.
The locally approved product label or applicable SmPC for ifosfamide and etoposi de should 
be referenced for any  concomi tant therapy  use wi th ifosfamide and etoposi de.
Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs
Subjects should not receive other antitumor therapies whil e on study . If a subject receives 
additional antitumor therapi es other than the study  drug(s), such as chemotherapy , targeted 
therapi es, immunotherapy , or anti tumor intervent ions -such as surgery or palliat ive 
radiotherapy  (other than as described below), this will be judged to represent evidence of 
disease progressi on, and the study  medicati onshould be di scontinued.   
Bisphosphonates and denosumab for the treatment of osteosarcom a are not permitted.
The concomitant use of live vaccines (e.g., m easles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow 
fever, rabies, BCG, and ty phoid [oral ] vaccines) are not permitted. Seasonal influenza 
vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and therefore are permitted. 
However intranasal influenza vaccines (e .g., Fl uMist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and 
therefore are not permitted. Addit ionally, the concomitant use of live vaccines with 
chemotherapy is contraindicated in immunosuppressed pat ients.

Efficacy Assessments
9.5.1.2.1 TUMOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS
Tumor assessment will be performed based on RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 1 ).  
Invest igator -determined response assessments will be performed at each assessment time point 
andentered onto the appropriate CRF.  Copi es of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to 
an ICL designated by the sponsor for efficacy assessment and for confirmat ion of PD .  
Tumor assessments will be carried out following the guidelines provided by  the ICL.  
Subjects must have evaluable disease or measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1.
At Screening
During th e Screening Period, tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other 
areas of known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed wit hin 28 days prior 
to Cy cle 1 Day  1.  Scans of the abdo men, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be do ne 
with MRI instead of CT, but evaluat ion of the chest should be done with CT.  
Brain scans by MRI with and wit hout contrast enhancement or CT with contrast 
enhancement will be performed at screening as clinically indicated.
Historical scans (wi thin 28 da ysprior to the Cycle 1 Day  1) m ay be used to demonstrate 
eligibilit yas long as they  meet minimum standards as separately defined by the ICL. For 
subjects wi th rapidly progressive disease, it i s advised that imaging be repeated prior to 
Cycle 1 Day  1.
If available, bone imaging obtained wit hin 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day  1 shoul d be sent to 
the ICL. Bone lesio ns noted on the screening/baseline images should be fo llowed as non -
target lesio ns wit h modalities other than nuclear medicine scans.
During Treatme nt Phase
CT scans of the chest and CT/MRI of other known sites of disease, plus any areas of newly 
suspected di sease will be performed using the same methodology  as at screening every  6 
weeks ±1 week, fo llowing the date of rando mizat ion until Week 18.  Fol lowing com pletion 
of the chemotherapy  treatm ent peri od (ie, after Week 18), the frequency  of tumor 
assessments will be every 9 weeks ±1 week unt il Week 54 ±1 week.  Thereafter, they  will be 
performed every  12 weeks ±2 weeks unt il documentation of PD.  At a ny po int, scans should 
be performed earlier than the scheduled time point, if clinically indicated. Any bone imaging 
obtained during the treatment phase should be sent to the ICL. Any non -target b one l esions 
shoul d be f ollowed wi th modali ties other than nu clear medicine scans; if a non -target bone 
lesion is not eval uable (NE) for a timepoint, the lesio n shoul d be consi dered as NE, but 
timepo int response does not need to be evaluated as NE.

less than 4 weeks after the init ial response. The same methodology (CT or MRI) and scan 
acquisit ion techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as was used for the screening 
assessments should be utilized across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison o f 
lesions. After treatment discont inuat ion for a reason other than PD, tum or assessments 
shoul d cont inue to be performed as per the tumor assessment schedu leuntil documentation 
of progressi on or start of a new ant icancer agent.  Screening CT scans should be performed 
with iodinated intravenous contrast and MRI scans should be performed wit h intravenous
gadolinium chelate.  Post -screening scans may be perfor med wit hout contrast if a medical 
contraindicat ion develops while on study  treatm ent.  If i odinated intravenous contrast is 
contraindicated, chest CT should be done without intravenous contrast .  MRI should be 
perform ed for all  other body  regions (wi th gadolinium  unless contraindicated (eg, severe 
renal dysfunction).
CT scans should be diagnostic qualit y spiral/mul tidetector CT wi th iodinated intravenous
contrast, and the MRI scans should be performed with intravenous gadolinium chelate.  
Scans of the ne ck, abdo men, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be done wi th MRI 
instead of CT, but evaluat ion of the chest should be done with CT.  Spiral/mult idetector CT 
shoul d be perform ed wi th a 5-mm cont iguous slice reconstruction algorithm.  If body  MRI 
scans are performed, conti guous slices o f 5 mm should also be performed.  If a subject 
develops a contraindicat ion to CT contrast during the study , the chest evaluat ion shoul d be 
done wi th non-contrast CT, and the other body  scans shoul d be done wi th MRI wi th 
gadolinium chelate IV. 
The same imaging modalit y and image -acquisit ion protocol (including use or non -use of 
contrast) should be used consistent ly across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison of 
lesions.  Low -dose non -contrast CT transmissio n scans from a posi tron emissio n 
tomography -CT (PET -CT) combinat ion scanner are not acceptable.  Ultrasound should not 
be used for radiographic tumor assessment.  A chest x -ray or skeletal  x-ray which clearly  
demonstrates a new m etastati c lesi on may be used to do cument progression in lieu of the 
CT/MRI scans.
If subcutaneous masses or nodes are palpable (eg, bulky) and are assessable by both clinical 
and radiographic techniques, the radiographic (CT/MRI) technique should be used for the 
assessment of target and no n-target l esions.
Brain scans by MRI with and wit hout contrast enhancement or CT with contrast 
enhancement will be performed as clinically  indicated .  If protocol eligible brain metastases 
are present at screening, a CT/MRI of the brain must be performed a t all tumor assessment 
time points (eg, every  6, 9,or 12weeks).  
Disease progressi on per RECIST 1.1 during the randomizat ion phase must be confirmed by 
IIR pri or to the invest igator discont inuing study treatment for a subject.  In the event that the 
investigator consi ders al ternative treatm ents m ust be inst ituted immediately for management 
of urgent m edical  com plicat ions of PD, study  drugs m ay be discont inued without waiting for 
independent confirmat ion of radiographic evidence of PD.  Subjects who disco ntinue study

Prior to opti onal lenvat inib crossover, baseline tumor assessment must be re -established (i.e., 
new tum or assessment scans performed ), unless the l ast tum or assessment scans were 
performe d within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 of the crossover treatment.

Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all AEs, including all grades per 
National Cancer Inst itute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0 (for both increasing and decreasing severit y), 
and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory  eval uation of  hematology, blood

9.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an invest igational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study, the study drug s are lenvat inib, 
ifosfamide, and etoposide . 
The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product (Note:  Every  sign or 
sympto m shoul d not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is

Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an existing disease .However, worsening of the 
primary  disease shoul d be captured under efficacy  assessments as PD.
Any deterioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuat ion of study  drug
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory 
abnorm ality leads to any  type of  intervent ion, withdrawal  of study  drug, or wi thhol ding 
of study  drug , whether pr escrib ed in the protocol or not
All AEs, regardless of relati onship to study  drug or procedure, should be recorded beginning 
from the time the subject signs the s tudy ICF through the l ast vi sitand for 30 day safter the 
subject’s last dose .  Refer to Section 9.5.4.1 for the time period after the end of treatment for 
SAEcollect ion.  
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if the y are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they const itute 
an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment s hould be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 82of 147laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormalit y 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
Abnorm al ECG (QTcF) resul ts, if not otherwi se considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc Finterval  is more than 
450ms and there is an increase of more than 60ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormalit y 
that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.
All AEs must be fo llowed for 30days after the subject’s last study  drug dose, or until 
resol ution, whichever co mes first.  Subjects with onset of an AE or deterioration of a 
preexist ing AE during the AE co llection peri od wi ll be followed unt il reso lution to baseline, 
start of a new ant icancer treatm ent, or death.   All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if 
resol ution is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v 5.0 (Cancer Therapy 
Evaluat ion Program, 2017) .  Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both 
increasing and decreasing severit y).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study  treatm ent
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.

9.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
AnSAE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence tha t at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have cau sed death)
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect (in the child of a subject who was exposed to the 
study  drug)
Other im portant m edical  events that m ay not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error .  These events associ ated wi th special situat ions are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considere d as SAEs only if they  meet one of 
the above criteria.  All AEs associ ated wi thspecial si tuations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to sta bilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospitalizat ion:
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospi talizat ions requi red by  the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy  drug administrati on)
Hospitalization for administration of study  drug or insertion of access for adminis tration 
of study  drug
Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before study  entry

AEs assessment at least every  3 days (until improvement to < Grade 3). Refer to Table 1
(study  drug dose reducti on and interruption instructions) for the m anagement of clinically  
significant laboratory  abnorm alities. Every ef fort shoul d be made to collect samples for 
analysis at the local laboratory  at the sam e time.
A laboratory  abnorm ality may meet the cri teria to qualify  as an AE as described in this 
protocol  (seeSecti on9.5.1.4.1 and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory  abnorm ality will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF
(see Section 9.5.4.3.2 ).
9.5.1.4.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
Vital sign m easurements (i e, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory  rate [per minute]), body  temperature (in centigrade), weight (kg), and 
height (cm) will be obtained at the visit s designated in the Schedu le of Assessments ( Table 5
andTable 6) by a vali dated m ethod.  Bl ood pressure and pulse will be measured after the 
subject has been resting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the 
same arm , preferably by  the same person.  On Cy cle 1 Day  8, subjects will have a telephone 
or clinic visit to assess for the development of early  toxicity. Subjects will be provided wit h 
a BP cuff to monitor BP at home or can have the measurement done by  a local heal thcare 
provi der,and will report the C1D8 measurement at telephone contact. An unschedul ed visit 
can occur prior to C1D15 if deemed necessary  by the invest igator.
Only 1 BP measurement is needed for subjects with systolic BP <95th percent ile (BP 
<140 mm Hg )and diastolic BP <95th percent ile (BP <90 mmHg ).If the subject’s init ial BP 
measurement is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥95th percentile [≥ 140 mmHg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile [≥90 mmHg ]), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 minutes later. 
The m ean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minute s apart is defined as 1 BP assessment. If 
the BP assessment (ie, the mean o f the 2 BP m easurem ents obtained at least 5 minutes apart) 
is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥ 95th percent ile [≥140 mmHg]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile 
[≥90mm Hg ]), a confirmatory  asse ssment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by  
performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value.
9.5.1.4.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
Physical examinat ions will be performed as designated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Docum entati on of  the physical examinat ion 
will be included in the source documentation at the site.  Only changes fro m screening 
physical examinat ion findings that meet the definit ion of an AE will be recorded on the 
Adverse Events CRF.

Electrocardiograms will be obt ained as designated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5
and Table 6).  Com plete, standardi zed, 12 -lead ECG recordings that permit all 12 leads to be 
displayed on a single page with an accompanying lead II rhy thm stri p bel ow the custom ary 
3×4 l ead form at are to be used.  In addit ion to a rhyt hm strip, a minimum of 3 full co mplexes 
shoul d be recorded from  each lead simultaneously.  If possible, s ubjects must be in the 
recumbent posit ion for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG.
QTc prol ongat ion has been seen in so me lenvatinib studies. Monitor ECGs e very cycle (as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments) in participants with congenital lo ng QT syndrome, 
congest ive heart failure, bradyarrhyt hmias, or those who are taking drugs known to prolong 
the QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhyt hmic s. Drugs known to prolong the QTc 
interval  (including Class Ia and III antiarrhy thmics) must be used caut iously. Pl ease refer to 
the lenvatinib IB or lenvat inib prescribing information.
An ECG abnormalit y may meet the criteria o f an AE as described in this protocol  (see
Secti on9.5.1.4.1 ) and the CRF Co mpletion Guidelines.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abnormalit y will be record ed on the Adverse Events CRF.
For ECG abnormalit ies meet ing criteria of an SAE (see Serious Adverse Events and Other 
Events of Interest), the study  site must fax the SAE report including the ECG report to the 
number indicated in the Invest igator File using the SAE reporting form (see Section 9.5.4.1 ).
9.5.1.4.7 OTHER SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
Pregnancy Test
A serum β -hCG test will be performed for females of childbearing potential (see definit ion 
included in the Inclusio n/Exclusion criteria, Sections 9.3.1 and 9.3.2 ).  A serum  or uri ne 
pregnancy test will be performed at Screening , Baseline (or within 72 hours prior to the first 
dose of study  medication), on Day  1 of each cycle fro m Cycle 2 onwards, and at the 
Off-treatm ent V isit in wo men of childbearing potent ial. Blood and urine sam ples will be 
taken at designated time po ints as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5and
Table 6).
Echocardiogram or Multigated A cquisition (MUGA) Scan
An echocardiogram or MUGA scan to assess LVEF will be performed during the screening 
phase, every  16±2weeks fo llowing the fi rst dose of study  drug while the subject is on 
treatm ent or sooner, if clinically  indicated, and at (or within 1 week fo llowing) the off -
treatm ent assessment.  LVEFs as assessed by  the inst itution will be entered onto the CRF.  
Invest igator assessment will be based upon inst itutional reports.

Inform ation from studies in animals suggest that there is a risk of d elayed tooth format ion 
and/or physical growth and development. Therefore, dental examinat ions will be performed 
to evaluate subjects for potential ano malies in tooth format ion and eruption schedule.
Dental  examinat ion by a qualified healt hcare professio nalshoul d be conducted per local 
institutional guidelines at baseline (C1D1 ± 4 weeks), and thereafter per local standard of 
care (but no less than annually), and as part of the Off -treatm ent assessment. If the most 
recent dental examinat ion is wit hin 6 mont hs pri or to the Off -Treatment vi sit, the dental  
examinat ion is not required. Post -baseline dental examinat ions are not required for subjects 
for who m perm anent teeth (excluding third mo lars) are evaluated to be fully erupted at 
baseline.
Other Assessments
Health-related qualit y of life ( HRQoL ) assessment will be performed per the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 5andTable 6). Im pact of  treatm ent on HRQoL will be assessed using 
the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer Module).  Dat a will be collected 
as parent -report for toddlers ( ages 2to  years) and children (ages 5 to 7) ,and as self -report 
for subjects aged ≥8years.  Self-report i s the preferred data collect ionmethodfor all 
subjects aged ≥8, however to improve adherence and reduce missing data , parents or 
caregivers   will be required to report on QoL when self -report is not available ; pati ent’s 
proxy  report is still very relevant especi ally when child self -report i s not possible
The PedsQL is a modular instrument designed to measure HRQ oL in pediatric and adults 
popul ation. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are mult idimensio nal child self -report and 
parent proxy -report scal es devel oped as the generic core measure to be integrated with the 
PedsQL disease specific modules. The PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module was designed to measure 
pediatric cancer specific HRQOL .
It is best practi ce and strongly reco mmended that the PedsQL measurement modules are 
administered to randomized subjects prior to drug administration or any  other interacti on 
with sitestaff.Every  effort shoul d be m ade to administer the PedsQL quest ionnaires as soon 
as possible after the decisio n to di scont inue study treatment is made.

h.Assessments will include vital signs (resting BP, HR, RR, and body temperature) and weight.  Blood press ure that is consistently above the 95th percentile 
for sex, age, and height/length for subjects <18 years old; or BP ≥140/90 mmHg for subjects ≥18 to 25 years old requires furt her evaluatio n.  Refer to 
hypertensio n management guidelines in Section 9.4.1.1.2 .
i.On C ycle 1 Day  8, subjects will have a telephone or clinic visit to assess for the development of early toxicity. Subjects will be provided with a BP cuff to 
monitor BP at home or can have the measurement done by a local healthcare provider, and will report the C1D8 measurement at t elephone contact. An 
unscheduled visi t can occur prior to C1D15 if deemed necessary by the investigator.
j.Single 12 -lead ECG.  If possible, s ubjects must be in the recumbent position for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG.   ECG should be conducted at 
Screening, C1D1, C2D1,  D1 of ever y 4thcycle (ie, C6, C10, C14, etc.). ECG at C1D1 and C2D1 should be conducted approximately 2 hours after 
lenvatinib dose.  For high risk subjects   (as defined in lenvatinib product label) , conduct ECG in every cycle. 
k.An echocardiogram or MUGA scan isto be performed during screening, every 16±2 weeks, and at the Off -Treatment visit, or sooner if clinically indicated.
l.Clinical chemistry and hematology results must be reviewed by the investigator prior to administration of study drug on C1D1 and within 48 hour s after 
administering any study drug for all subsequent cycles.  Electrolytes such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be mon itored and abnormalities, 
when considered clinically significant, should be corrected in all participants before starting t reatment. Scheduled assessments may be performed within 72

improvement to <Grade 3).  TSH should be as sessed for all subjects. For sites in Germany: HIV and Hepatitis B/C tests are required during Screening.
m.Urine dipstick testing should be performed at Screening, Baseline, C1D15, C2D1 , C2D15, and Day 1 of ever y subsequent cycle, or more frequently as 
clinically indicated, and at the Off -treatment Visit.  For subjects with a history of proteinuria ≥2+, urine dipstick testing should be performed until the 
results have been 1+ or negative for 2treatment cycles .  If a new event of proteinuria ≥2+ occurs, refer to Section 9.4.1.1.4 for further management 
guidelines.   Urine glucose should be perf ormed as part of the urine dipstick. 
n.Sampling (one 2 mL sample per time point) for PK analysis of lenvatinib will be performed (in subjects in Arm A only) on Cycl e 1 Day  1 at 0.5 to 4 hours 
and 6 to 10 hours postdose, on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 0.5 to 4 hours and 6 to 10 hours postdose, and on Cycle 2 Day 1 at predose.  All predose samples 
are to be drawn approximately 24 hours following the dose administered on the previous day.  If dose interruption is necessar y at  these time points, please 
contact t he sponsor. Pharmacokinetic sampling should not be performed for any subject with a body weight <13 kg (please see Section 9.5.1.3.1 ).

Procedures/Assessments
o.Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib only after completion of 5 cycles with lenvatinib+ifosfamide+etoposide until progressive 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject request, study termination by the sponsor, subject noncompliance with safety or efficacy a ssessments, or withdrawal 
of consent.  Subjects randomized to Arm B will be off -treatment after 5 cycles of ifosfamide+etoposide.
p.All subjects who receive suspension formulation ,with the exception of subjects using a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, must complete the Palatability 
Questionnaire on C1D1 (or the subsequent visit) .  If the subject is unable to complete the questionnaire this must be done by their parents or their legal 
guardian.  
q.Screening :  Tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvi s, and other areas of known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed within 
28days prior to C1D1.  Scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of the body may be done with MRI instead of CT, but evalua tion of the chest should 
be done with CT.  CT scans should be performed with iodinated IV contrast and MRI scans should be performed with IV gadolinium chelate .
Treatment Phase :  Tumor assessments of the chest, and other areas of known disease at Screening or newly suspected disease should be performed ever y 
6±1 weeks from the date of randomization until Week 18 ±1 week, then every 9 ±1 weeks until Week 54± 1 week, and thereafter, every 12 ±2 weeks until 
documentation of PDduring the Treatment Phase (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) and should utilize the same methodology (CT or 
MRI) and scan acquisition techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as was used for the screening assessments.  Tum or response will be assessed 
according to RECIST 1.1.  Any CR or PR must be confirmed not less than 4 weeks following the initial achievement of the response.  Off-Treatment: 
Tumo r assessments at the Off -Treatment Visit (within 1 week of the Off -treatment Visit) are only necessary for subjects who discontinue study treatment 
without disease progression, if more than 4 weeks have passed since the previous assessment and if the s ubject will not continue with follow -up scans. 
Follow -up: For s ubjects who discontinue study treatment without disease progression, tumor assessments should continue to be performed according to the 
schedule: every 6±1 weeks until Week 18 ±1 week, then ev ery 9±1 weeks until Week 54±1 week , thereafter, to be performed ever y 12±2 weeks , until 
documentation of progression or start of a new anticancer agent. 
r.Brain CT with contrast or MRI pre -and post -gadolinium contrast will be performed at the Screening Vi sitas clinically indicated , and thereafter during 
treatment as clinically indicated.  For subjects with protocol -eligible treated brain metastases, brain CT/MRI will be performed at all tumor assessment time 
points.
s.Height will be assessed at the Baseline Visit, Day 1 of ever y 4 cycles during the Treatment Phase, at the Off -treatment Visit and ever y 3 months during the 
Post-treatment Follow -up.Assessment of height in Post -treatment Follow -up is not required once pubertal development is complete. Proximal tibial 
growth plate x- rays should be conducted for subjects aged <18 years at baseline and at the Off -treatment Visit .  If the growth plates are closed at baseline

Description of Procedures/Assessments Schedule
Refer to Table 5for schedule and descript ion of procedures in the Rando mizat ion Phase and 
Table 6for the Extensio n Phase.
9.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements
All clinical  assessments are standard measurements commo nly used in studi es of  relapsed or 
refractory  solid tum ors.
The safet y assessments to be performed in this study , including hematology analyses, blood 
chemistry  tests, urinalysis, radio logic studi es, and assessment of AEs, are standard 
evaluat ions to ensure subject safet y.  The use of RECIST 1.1 for tumor assessment s of so lid 
tumors is wi dely accepted (see  Appendix 1 )(Eisenhauer, et al ., 2009 ).
9.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associ ated 
with Special Situations
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, 
must be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no 
later than 24 hours from the date the investiga tor becomes aware of the event.
Serious adverse events, regardless of causalit y assessment, must be collected for30 day s 
after the subject’s last dose .  All SAEs must be fo llowed to resolut ion or, if resolut ion is 
unlikely , to stabilizat ion.  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be related to the study 
treatm ent or any  protocol -requi red procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of 
the length of time that has passed since study co mplet ion.
The detailed contact informat ion for reporti ng of SAEs is provided in the Invest igator Study  
File.
For urgent safety issues , please ensure all appropri ate m edical  care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate study  team  member listed in the Invest igator Study
File.
It is very  important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the init ial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causalit y.
Any relevant follow-up inform ation received on SAEs should be forwar ded within 24hours
of its recei pt.  If the relevant follow-up inform ation changes the invest igator’s assessment of 
causalit y, this shoul d also be noted on the fo llow-up SAE form .
Preliminary SAE reports should be fo llowed as soon as possible by  detailed d escripti ons 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, and other documents requested by 
the sponsor.

requi red by thei r insti tution.  A copy  of this co mmunicat ion must be forwarded to the sponsor 
and/or the designated CRO monitor to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.
Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Any pregnancy  in a female subject in which the estimated date of concept ion is either before 
the last visit or within 30 days of l ast study  treatm ent, or any  exposure to study  drug through 
breast feeding during study treatment or within 30days of last study  treatm ent, m ust be 
reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
shoul d be reported regardl ess of the length o f time that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatm ent.

drug use or subject harm while the study  drug i s in the control  of site
personnel or the subject. 
All AEs associ ated wi th overdose , misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error shoul d be captured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Secti on9.5.4.1 ) even if the AEs do not meet serious criteria.  Abuse 
and Intent ional Overdose, even if asymptomatic, are always to be captured as an AE.  If the 
AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error does not meet serious 
criteria, i t must still  be reported using th e SAE form and in an expedited manner but should 
be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.
9.5.4.3.2 REPORTING OF ABNORMAL HEPATIC TESTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST
The fo llowing combinat ion of abnormal laboratory tests *, as determined by way o f 
protocol -specified l aboratory  testi ng or unscheduled laboratory  testing and whether 
nonseri ous or seri ous,shoul d be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the 
procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events (Section 9.5.4.1 ). If the event 
does not m eet seri ous cri teria, the seri ousness cri teria on the SAE form should be indicated as 
“nonserious. ”

Alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2× the upper limit of normal
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory  guidance docum ents. The purpose 
of the cri teria is to specify a thresho ld of abnormal hepat ic tests that may require addit ional 
evaluat ion for an underlying etio logy. Inaddition to reporting the abnormal hepat ic 
laboratory  tests on a SAE form, the site should also consult the medical mo nitorfor guidance 
on assessment and fo llow-up.  At a minimum, l aboratory  testing shoul d be repeated at l east 
once weekly until improveme nt or ident ificat ion of a cause unrelated to study  drug use that is

relapse/refractory  disease (early [<18 months] or lat e [≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 
years) as strata.  PFS censoring rules will fo llow FDA guidance of 2007 and will be detailed
in the statist ical analysis plan. Median PFS will be calculated using the K -M product -limit 
estimates for each treatment arm al ong with 2-sided 95% CIs (estimated with a generalized 
Brookm eyer and Crowl ey method [Brookm eyer and Crowley  (1982)].  The K -M est imates of

Secondary  Efficacy  Analyses
The PFS -4m rate and PFS -1y rate perIIR will be estimated using the K -M method for the 
primary  efficacy  endpo int PFS per IIR . PFS-4m/PFS -1y rate and thei r Greenwood standard 
errors will be evaluated using the K -M est imates from both treatment groups.  The statistical 
significance of the difference in the 2 K -M PFS -4m rates will base on its 2 -sided 95% CI.  
This 2 -sided 95% CI and a p-value will be constructed using the difference of these 2 K -M 
PFS-4m/PFS -1y rates and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors. 
Overall survival (OS) will be co mpared between treatment arm and control arm fo llowing the 
same stati stical method fo r the primary efficacy PFS endpoint. The K-M est imates will also

frequencies (number and percentage of subjects), and changes from baseline to each 
postbaseline visit and to end of treatment will be reported using shift tables.  Percentages will 
be based on the number of subjects with both nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline 
resul ts.
Laboratory  test resul ts will be assigned a low/normal/high (LNH) cl assificat ion according to 
whether the value was below (L), wi thin (N), or above (H) the laboratory  param eter’s 
reference range.  Wit hin-treatm ent com parisons for each laboratory  param eter will be based 
on shift table s that com pare the baseline LNH classificat ion to the LNH classification at each 
postbaseline visit and at the end of treatment.  Similar shift table s will also compare the 
baseline LNH classification to the LNH classificat ion for the highest and lowest va lue during 
the treatment period.

9.7.1.9.1 HEALTH -RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE 
Descript ive statistics will be presented for all PedsQL endpo ints at each analysis t ime period 
by treatment arm.  Baseline is defined as the later value of Day -1 or at Cy cle 1 Day  1 pri or 
to treatment . 
This will be collected at baseline, at C2D 1, C3D1, Week 18, C8D1 , C18 D1 and at the 
Off-Treatment Vi sit.  Score change from baseline in PedsQL at each analysis t imepo int will 
be analyzed. Primary t imepo int for assessment i s at week 18 for all PedsQL endpo ints.

9.7.1.9.2 PALATABILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE
Measurement of palatabilit y will be assessed using a facial Hedonic scale ( Guinard, 2001 ),in 
subjects receiving the suspensio n formulation in the study .
9.7.2 Determination of Sample Size
A total sample size of 72 subjects is est imated for the primary efficacy endpo int of PFS. A 
median PFS of 3.5 months for Arm  B (control  arm) has been est imated by co mpar ing 
available PFS data from  clinically act ive agents in this pat ient populat ion (Davis, et al ., 2019; 
Palmerini, et al, 2016; Grignani, et al., 2012 ).  With respect to Arm A (lenvatinib plus 
chemotherapy arm) , a m edian PFS of 8.75 months is est imated based on the results f rom 
Study 207. 
Therefore, assuming a hazard ratio of 0.4, a 1 -sided type 1 error rate of 0.025, and power of 
80%, the required number of PFS events for the study  is 38.  The primary  PFS analysis is 
estimated to occur at approximately 32 months after the first subject is rando mized 
(assuming a 20- month enrollment period), and accounts for a dropout rate of up to 40%. 
9.7.3 Interim Analysis
No interim analysis is planned for this study .
The safet y monitoring will  be conducted by  the independent data m onitoring committee 
(IDMC).  The frequency o f the safet y reviews will be defined in the IDMC charter.  Minutes 
from the open m eetings o f the IDMC will be provided if requested by re gulatory  agencies.  
The recommendat ion of whether to stop the studyfor safet y will be reached by the IDMC 
based on their review of safet y data wi th treatm ent informat ion.  The funct ion and 
membership of the IDMC will be described in the IDMC charter.
9.7.4 Othe r Statistical/Analytical Issues
Not applicable.
9.7.5 Procedure for Revising the Statistical Analysis Plan
If the SAP needs to be revised after the study starts, the sponsor will determine how the 
revisio n impacts the study and how the revisio n shoul d be impleme nted.  The details of the 
revisio n will be documented and described in the clinical study  report.

PROCEDURES)
11.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  thesponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically 
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory  authori ties as well  as addi tional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way  prevent any  immediate 
action from being taken by  the invest igator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving 
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the invest igator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for saf ety reasons to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects , the sponsor’s medical mo nitorand the 
IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the healt h or 
regul atory  authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only  administrative aspects of the study  may not requi re 
submissio n to heal th or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory  
authori ty and IRB/IEC (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) shoul d 
be kept informed of such changes as required by lo cal regulati ons.  In these cases, the 
sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) detailing such changes.
11.2 Adherence to the Protocol
The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
11.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s.  Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The in vestigator (or if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) will  allow the CRA to inspect the 
clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy facilit ies to assure com pliance wi th GCP and l ocal 
regul atory  requi rements.  The CRFs and subject’s correspondi ng ori ginal  medical  records 
(source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s representatives at 
regul ar intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in 
accordance with local regulat ions.  All record s at the site are subject to inspect ion by the 
local audi ting agency  and to IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to,
the following:
Clinic, office, or hospital charts

CRF co mponents (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source
Electronic Pat ient-Reported Outcome by self-reporte d measures
11.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as the source docum ent.  Any  correcti on to entri es 
made on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction isdated, the 
individual making the correct is ident ified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
11.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be rec orded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  
11.6 Retention of Records
The ci rcumstances of com pletion or terminat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution or the de signated 
representative) is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but not limited to 
the protocol, copies of CRFs, the Invest igator ’s Brochure, and regulatory agency registration 
docum ents (eg, Form FDA 1572 for US sites), Investigator a nd Site Information Form  (for 
non-US si tes), ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence). The site should plan to retain study

study .
It is requested that at the completion of the requi red retenti on peri od, or shoul d the 
investigator retire or relocate, the invest igator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of  perm anent ly retaining the study  records.
11.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent conducts audi ts of clinical research activit ies in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regul ations.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study  or 
after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
11.8 Handling of Study Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a desi gnated ph armacist) by  
the sponsor.  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) 
and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug labels.  The invest igator (or a 
designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which m ust be given to the sponsor 
at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug di spensed to 
each subject must be available for i nspect ion at any t ime.  The CRA will visit the site and 
review these documents along with all other study  conduct docum ents at appropri ate 
intervals once study  drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form 
to the sponsor’s CRA (or desi gnated contractor) or, when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.
11.9 Publication of Results
All manuscripts, abstracts, or other modes of presentation arising fro m the resul ts of the 
study  must be reviewed and approved in writ ing by the sponsor in advance of submissio n 
pursuant to the terms and condit ions set forth in the executed Clinical Trial Agreement 
between the sponsor/CRO and the inst itution/investi gator.  The review is aimed at protecting

Appendix 1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) 1.1
Tumor response assessments in this clinical study will use Response Evaluat ion Cri teria in 
Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) based on the 2009 art icle by Eisenhauer et al ent itled New 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors:  revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1 ) 
(Eisenhauer, et al., 2009 ).
The so le modificat ion to RECIST 1.1 to be implemented in this study is that chest x -rays 
may not be used to fo llow disease; only  CT scans may be used to follow chest disease.  As 
requi red by RECIST 1.1, the protocol states that the minimum duration of stable disease is 
7weeks following the date of first dose of study  drug.

Genitalia:
1= The testes, scrotum and penis are about the same size and shape as they were when you were 
a child
2= The testes and scrotum are bigger.  The skin of the scrotum has changed.  The scrotum , the 
sack ho lding the testes, has gotten lower.  The penis has gotten only a litt le bigger.
3= The penis has grown in length.  The testes and scrotum have grown and dropped lower.
4= The penis has gotten even bigger.  It is wider.  The gl ans (the head of the penis) is bigger.  
The scrotum is darker than before. It is bigger because the testes are bigger.
5= The penis, scrotum, and testes are the size and shape o f an adult man.
Pubic Hair:
1= There i s no pubi c hai r at all .
2= There i s a litt le soft, long, l ightly-colored hair. Most of the hair is at the base of the penis.
This hair may  be strai ght or a litt le curly.
3= The hair is darker in this stage. It is more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a bigger 
area.
4= the hair is now as dark, curly , and course as that of an adult man.  The area that the hair 
covers i s not as bi g as that of an adult man.  The hair has NOT spread out to the legs.
5= The hair has spread out to the legs.  The hair is now like that of an adult man. It covers the 
same area as that of an adult man.

FINAL: 10 Sep 2020Confidential Page 137of 147Appendix 10 Pharmacodynamic, and Other Biomarker Research
Subjects enro lled in this clinical study may have biol ogic samples co llected for 
pharmacodynamic , and other bi omarker analysis.  These samples may be used for discovery  or 
validat ion to i dentify biomarkers that may be used for exploratory evaluat ion of response and/or 
safet y-related outcom es as well as for use in diagnostic development.
Collect ion of the pharmacodynamic , and other biomarker samples will be bound by the sample 
principles and processes outlined in the main study pro tocol .  Sam ple collect ion for 
pharmacody namic, and other bi omarker analysis is required as per the study  protocol  unless the 
collect ion and use of the samples is prohibited by  specific country  laws.
Sample Collection and Handling
Sample collect ion for pharm acodynamic analysis is optional. The sa mples will be co llected 
according to the study  flow chart.  If, for operational or medical reasons, the genomic DNA 
blood sam ple cannot be obtained at the prespecified visit, the sample can be taken at any  study  
center visit at the discret ion of the invest igator and site staff.
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or RNA extraction, genoty ping, sequencing, or other 
analysis will be performed by a laboratory  under the di rection of  the sp onsor.  Processing, 
analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory  facility to protect the validit y of 
the data and maintain subject privacy.
Samples will  only be used for the purposes described in this protocol.  Laboratories contracted to
perform  the analysis on behalf of the sponsor will not retain rights to the samples bey ond those 
necessary  to perform  the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell those samples.  The 
sponsor will not sell the samples to a third party .
Samples will be stored for up to 15 y ears after the complet ion of the study  (defined as 
submissio n of the clinical study  report to the appropriate regulatory  agencies).  At the end of the 
storage peri od, sam ples will  be destroy ed.  Sam ples m ay be stored l onger if a he alth authori ty (or 
medicinal product approval agency ) has active questi ons about the study .  In this special 
circumstance, the sam ples will  be stored until the questions have been adequately  addressed.
It is possible that future research and technological advances may ident ify geno mic variants of 
interest, or allow alternat ive types of geno mic analysis not foreseen at this t ime.  Because it is 
not possible to prospectively define every  avenue of future t esting, all samples collected will be 
single or double coded (according to the ICH E15 guidelines) in order to maintain subject 
privacy . 
Right to Withdraw
If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her consent 
forparticipation in this research, Eisai will destroy the samples.  Information fro m any assays

necessary  to protect the integri ty of the research project.
Subj ect Privacy and Return of Data
No subj ect-ident ifying informat ion (eg, init ials, date of birth, government identifying number) 
will be ass ociated wi th the sam ple.  All  pharmacodynamic and other bio marker samples will be 
single coded.  Genomic DNA samples used to explore the effects on PK, treatm ent response, and 
safet y will be single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be stored for long -term use 
(defined as 15 y ears after the comple tion of  the study ) will  be doubl e coded.  Double coding 
involves remo ving the init ial code (subject ID) and replacing wit h another code such that the 
subject can be re -ident ified by use of 2 code key s.  The code key s are usually  held by  different 
parties. The key  linking the sample ID to the subject number will be maintained separately fro m 
the sam ple.  At thi s point, the samples will  be double -coded, the first code being the subject 
number.  Laboratory  personnel performing genet ic analysis will not have a ccess to the “key.”  
Clinical data collected as part of the clinical study will be cleaned of subject ident ifying 
inform ation and linked by  use of  the sample ID “key .”
The sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidenti ality is 
maintained as far as possible.  Data from subjects enro lled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless o f location of  collect ion.
The sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organi zations involved in the conduct or oversight of this research.  These include:
Clinical research organizat ions retained by the sponsor 
Independent ethics commit tees or institutional review boards that have responsibilit y for this 
research study  
National regulatory  author ities or equivalent government agencies
At the end of the analysis, results may  be presented in a final report which can include part or all 
of the coded data, in list ing or summary format.  Other publicat ion (eg, in peer -reviewed 
scientific journals) or p ublic presentation of the study results will only include summaries o f the 
popul ation in the study , and no i dentified individual  resul ts will be disclosed.
Given the research nature of the pharmacodynamic , and other bio marker analysis, it will not be 
possi ble to return individual data to subjects.  The results that may  be generated are not currently  
anticipated to have clinical relevance to the patients or their family  members.  Therefore, these 
resul ts will  not be discl osed to the pati ents or thei r physici ans.
If at any  time, pharmacodynamic , and/or other biomarker results are ob tained that m ay have 
clinical relevance, IRB review and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate 
manner of disclosure and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory  
Improvem ent Amendments (CLIA)- certified setting will be required.  Sharing of research data

include the 2009 Schwartz equation for subjects < 18 years of age and the maxumun serum 
creatinine values are provided in µmo l/L because Standard International Units are used for 
reporting plasma creat inine in Sweden.
8.3.1 Inclusion Criteria
10. Adequate renal funct ion as evidenced by:
a. Serum  creatinine based on age/gender as below.  If serum creati nine is greater than 
maximum serum creat inine for age/gender as shown in the table below, then creat inine 
clearance (or radi oisotope gl omerul ar fil tration rate [GFR]) m ust be >70 mL/min/1.73 
m2.  If applicable, the 2009 Schwartz equation must be used to es timate GFR for subjects 
aged <18 y ears (i e, eGFR = 36.5 x height [cm]/plasma creatinine [µmol/L]) (Schwartz, et 
al., 2009).

data published by  the CDC.
b. Urine dipstick <2+ for proteinuria.  Subjects who have ≥2+ proteinuria on dipst ick 
urinalysis should undergo a spot protein -creat inine (P/C) ratio test that should be Grade <2 
per Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and if possible 
perform  a 24 -hour uri ne collection (children and adolescents ≤12 y ears of age must have 
≤500 m g of protein/24 hours and subjects >12 y ears of age m ust have ≤1 g of protein/24 
hours ).
c.  No clinical evidence of nephrotic syndrome.

8.2.1 Participant Risk and Burden 
The clinical study  protocol  will be conducted in accordance with ‘Ethical Considerations for 
Clinical Trials on M edicinal Products Conducted with the Pediatric Populat ion' in order to 
reduce the risk and burden to the participants.  The degree of burden and risk is cont inuously 
monitored and assessed by  the Invest igator through the various study assessments outlined in the 
Secti on 9.5.2 –Schedule of Procedures/Assessments, and the thresho ld for discont inuat ion is 
clearly  defined in Sect ion 9.3.3 –Removal of Subjects From Therapy or Assessment. Thus, 
shoul d the benefit/risk assessment adversely  change during the study  for a subj ect, he/s he will be 
discontinued.
Safety assessments will be conducted per Section 9.5.1.4 of the protocol to ensure participant 
safet y and reduce ri sks. Bo th safet y and efficacy  assessments have been outlined to allow for 
adequate assessment of clinical benefit, and when possible, have been gradually reduced in 
frequency  with considerat ion of minimizing pat ient burden. The summary  of measures taken to 
mitigate risk and burden within the protocol are outlined in Appendix Table 11-1.

Exclusion Criterion 20 is added:
Acontraindication to any of the study drugs
(lenvatinib, ifosfamide, and etoposide) per local 
prescribing information.An exclusion criterion due to 
contraindications to any of the 
study drugs has been added per 
health authority request.Synopsis, Section 8.3.2
Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Subjec ts should not receive other antitumor 
therapies while on study.  If a subject receives 
additional antitumor therapies other than the 
study drug(s), such as chemotherapy, targeted 
therapies, immunotherapy, or antitumor 
interventio ns -such as surgery or pal liative 
radiotherapy (other than as described below), 
this will be judged to represent evidence of 
disease progression, and continuation of 
thestudy medication should be discontinued
and further participation in the study must be 
discussed and agreed upon with the sponsor .Per health authority request,
subjects who receive other
anticancer therapy , except as 
specified in the protocol, should 
be discontinued from study 
treatment.Synopsis, Section 8.4.7.2
Vital Signs Assessment
On Cycle 1 Day 8, subjects will be contacted 
by telephone to assess for the development of 
early toxicity. Subjects will be provided with 
a BP cuff to monitor BP at home or can have 
the measurement done by a local healthcare Per health authority request , a

Study Design
E7080- G000 -230 is a multicenter, randomi zed, open -label, parallel -group, Phase 2 study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of lenvat inib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus ifosfamide 
and etoposide in children, adolescents ,and young adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma .  
Approximately 72eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 
ratio within the strata :
Arm A:  lenvatinib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (intravenously 
[IV], Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day 
(IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)
Arm B:  ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 
5cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 
cycles)
Randomization will follow a pred efined randomization scheme based on the following stratification 
factors: time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 m onths]) and age 
(<18 and ≥18 years).  
Eisai will closely monitor enrolment , to ensure that at least 32 subjects <18 years of age at the time of 
informed consent are randomized .  
The study will be conducted in 3 Phases: a Prerandomization Phase, a Randomization Phase , and an 
Extension Phase.  
ThePrerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline .The 
Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days .The Screening Period will establish 
protocol eligibility and the Baseline Period will confirm eligibility. 
The Randomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -up Period . The 
Randomization Phase will begin at the time of randomization of the first subject and will end on the 
data cut off date for the PFS- 1y and OS -1y analysis.  After the data cutoff date for the PFS-1y and 
OS-1y has occurred, all subjects who are still on study treatment will enter the Extension Phase. 
Data cutoff (for PFS-1yand OS-1yanalysis ) will occur when the last subject has completed 
18cycles of treatment or discontinues before the end of Cycle 18, whichever occurs first. 
The Treatment Period for each subject will begin at the time of randomization and will end at the 
completion of the Off -Treatment Visit which will occur within 30 days after the final dose of stu dy 
treatment   
Subjects will receive study treatment as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatment arms . Treatment 
cycles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions . If chemotherapy administration 
is preclud ed on Day 1 of a treatment cycle, the subject may resume treatment once recovered at the 
discretion of investigator .Subsequent chemotherapy will be administered every 21 (±1) days starting 
from the timepoint it was resumed.
Subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments.  Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib until 
disease progression (PD) confirmed by IIR, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, 
withdra wal of consent, or study termination by the sponsor , whichever occurs first .
Disease progression (PD) must be confirmed by IIR prior to the investigator discontinuing study 
treatment for a subject.  In situations where the investigator judges that alterna tive treatments must be

confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  If possible, before discontinuation of the subject from 
the study, the investigator should consult with the sponsor.
The Follow -upPeriod begins the day after the Off -Treatment Visit and will continue as long as the 
subject is alive , unless the subject withdraws consent ,or the sponsor terminates the study.  
Subjects may at any time withdraw consent for further study participation.  No further data will be 
collected on subjects once consent has been withdrawn, however, an investigator may consult public 
records to establish survival status if permitted by local regulations .
All advers e events ( AEs)will be captured for 30 days afte r the last dose of study drug.  
All subjects who disconti nue study treatment early for reasons other than PD, will continue to 
undergo tumor assessments every 6weeks until Week 18, then every 9 weeks until Week 54, 
thereafter, every 12 weeks until confirmation of disease progression by IIR as described in the tumor 
assessments in the assessment schedule ,or until another anticancer therapy is initiated .
Subject s in both Arm A and Arm B will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (±1 week ) and all 
subsequent anticancer treatments received will be recorded.  Subjects who are being followed for 
survival at the time of data cutoff for the for PFS -1y and OS -1y analy sis(ie, at the end of the 
Randomization Phase) will continue to be followed for survival during the Follow -up Period of the 
Extension Phase .
Extension Phase :  The Extension Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -up 
Period.  
In the Treatment Period , subjects still on lenvatinib in Arm  Afollowing the completion of the 
PFS-1y and OS -1y analysis (ie, at the end of the Randomization Phase) will continue to receive 
lenvatinib in 21 -day cycles until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject 
request, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of study by the sponsor .  Tum or assessments will 
be performed according to the local standard of care .  Independent imaging review (IIR)review and 
confirmation of radiographic evidence of PDwill not be required ,and scans will no longer be 
required to besent to the imaging core laboratory ( ICL) .  The Off -Treatment Visit will occur within 
30days after the final dose of study treatment. All AEs will be captured up to 30days after last dose 
of study drug.   In case the study is discontinued by the sponsor, the sponsor will continue to provide 
study drug (outside the study) for subjects requiring continuation of treatment. 
The Follow -up Period will begin the day after the Off -Treatment Visit and will lastuntil death or for 
2years after end of treatment for a subject, unless the study is terminated by the sponsor , or the 
subject discontinues due to withdrawal of consent , or is lost to fol low-up.  Subjects will be treated by 
the investigator according to the prevailing local standard of care. Subjects will be followed every 
12weeks (±1week) for survival and all subsequent anticancer treatments received will be recorded.   
The definition of end of the study, as required by certain regulatory agencies, will be the date of data 
cutoff for the final analysis or the time of last subject last visit, whichever occurs later.
Number of Subjects
Approximately 72 subjects will be randomised (36 subjects in each arm).
For the primary endpoint (intent –to-treat analysis) , at least 32subjects 18 years old (at the time of 
informed consent )will be randomized .

Study Treatment s
Body surface area (BSA) will be used to determine the amount of study drugs administered, and must 
be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle based on the subject ’scurrent height and body weight. The 
dose should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
Test Arm  (Arm A) :Lenvatinib + Ifosfamide + Etoposide
Lenvatinib 14 mg/m2, orally administered once daily in each 21 -day cycle.
Lenvatinib isprovided as hard capsules containing 1 mg, 4 mg, or 10 mglenvatinib. An 
extemporaneous suspension of lenvatinib capsules should be used for subjects unable to swallow 
capsules. After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose cannot exceed 24 mg QD.
Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day, IV, for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), ever y 21 days, for a maximum 
of 5cycles.
Etoposide 100 mg/m2/day, IV, for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3) , every 21 days, for a maximum of 
5cycles. 
Treatment with lenvatinib will continue in 21 -day cycles after chemotherapy is discontinued, until 
disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, or 
discontinuation of study by the sponsor .
In case the study is discontinued by the sponsor, the sponsor will continue to provide study drug 
(outside the stu dy) for subjects requiring continuation of treatment.
Control Arm  (Arm B):  Ifosfamide + Etoposide
Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day, IV, daily for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), every 21 days, for a 
maximum of 5cycles.
Etoposide 100 mg/m2/day, IV, daily for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), every 21 days, for a 
maximum of 5cycles.
Duration of Treatment
A subject will remain on study treatment until 1 or more of the following events occur(s):
Progressive disease (as confirmed by IIR)
Unacceptable toxicity
Subject request
Withdrawal of consent 
Termination of the study  by the Sponsor
Concomitant Drug/Therapy
Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs
Subjects should not receive other antitumor therapies while on study .If a subject receives additional 
antitumor therapies other than the study drug(s), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, 
immunotherapy, or antitumor interventions -such as surgery or palliative radiotherapy (other than as 
described below), this will be judged to represent evidence of dise ase progression, and the study 
medication should be discontinued .
For further information on the prohibited concomitant therapies for ifosfamide andetoposide, please 
refer to the respective prescribing i nformation.
Granulocyte -colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF)may be used to mitigate the toxicity of ifosfamide 
andetoposide.

a.Removal of existing (not new) osteosarcoma lesion ( eg, surgical, radiofrequency ablation,
cryotherapy, thermoablation, st ereotaxic ratiotherapy ,etc.) after completion of the Week 18 
tumor assessment .  Subjects in Arm A in the presence of clinical benefit, may continue treatment 
with lenvatinib after protocol permissible surgery .
b.Palliative radiotherapy is allowed for ≤2 significantly symptomatic nontarget lesions . 
If a subject receiving treatment with lenvatinib requires surgery during the study, the stop time and 
restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows:
•For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days befor e the procedure and restart it at least 
2days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
•For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and then 
restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
Any additional procedural or subject specific particularities should be discussed with the sponsor.   
Assessm ents
Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessment will be performed based on RECIST 1.1. Investigator –deter mined response 
assessments will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the case report form 
(CRF ). Copies of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to an imaging core laboratory ( ICL)
designated by the sponsor for efficacy assessment and for confirmation of PD.  Tumor assessments 
will be carried out following the guidelines provided by the ICL.  
During the Screening Period, t umor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of 
known disease or newly s uspected disease should be performed within 28 days prior to C ycle 1
Day1.  A brain scan ( CT scan with contrast or MRI pre -and post -gadolinium) will be performed at 
screening as clinically indicated, and thereafter during the study as clinically indicated.  Historical 
CT or MRI scans performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used as screening scans 
(baseline scans) to demonstrate eligibility, as long as they meet minimum standards as separately 
defined by the ICL.  
Tumor assessments will then be performed every 6weeks ±1 week following the start of treatment 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 during the chemotherapy treatment period until Week 18.  Following completion of 
the chemotherapy treatment period (ie,after Week 18) , the frequen cy of tumor assessments will be 
every9 weeks ±1 week until Week 54 ±1 week.  Thereafter, they wil l be performed every 12 weeks 
±2 weeks until documentation of PD (please see schedule of assessments for details) .  At any point, 
the CT /MRI scan should be pe rformed earlier than the scheduled time point, if clinically indicated.  
After data cutoff for PFS-1y and OS -1yanalysis , tumor assessments should beperformed following 
the prevailing local standard of care.
Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 during the randomization phase must be confirmed by IIR prior 
to the investigator discontinuing study treatment.
In the event that the investigator considers alternative treatments must be instituted immediately for 
management of urgent medical complications of PD, s tudy drugs may be discontinued without 
waiting for independent confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  Subjects who discontinue 
study treatment without PD will continue to undergo tumor assessments according to the schedule 
until PD is documented or another anticancer therapy is initiated. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for plasma concentrations of lenvatinib will be collected from all subjects from 
ArmA only as described in the Schedule of Assessments.

Eisai
FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 13of 121Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Assessments
Pharmacodynamic serum and archived fixed tumor tissue samplesfor biomarker analysis will be 
collected from subjects randomized to Arm A only, as descri bed in the Schedule of Assessments.  
Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor biomarkers assessed in this study will be based on those
identified in other lenvatinib clinical studies.  Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be 
performed as described in a separateanalysis plan. 
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs), including all 
grades per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0(for both increasing and decreasing 
severity), and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory e valuation for hematology, blood 
chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and physical 
examinations.
Progression of osteosarcoma and signs and symptoms clearly related to the progression of the 
osteosarcoma should not be ca ptured as an AE .  Disease progression is a study endpoint and should 
be captured in the CRF as per the guidelines for reporting disease progression.
Other Assessments
HRQoL assessment will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments.   Impact of treatment on 
HRQoL will be assessed using the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer Module).  
Bioanalytical Methods
Lenvatinib in plasma will be quantified using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method .  Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be performed as 
described in aseparate ana lysis plan.  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at qualified local 
laboratories.
Statistical Methods
Primary Endpoint
PFS-4m rate (progression- free survival rate at 4 m onths) by IIR is defined as the percentage 
of subjects who are alive and without PD at 4 months from the randomization date as determined 
by IIR of radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1.  The PFS -4m rate is estimated on the full 
analysis set for this study using the K -M method.  
Secondary Endpoints
PFS-1y rate (progression -free survival rate at 1 year) by IIR is defined as the percentage of 
subjects who are alive and without PD at 1 year from the randomization date as determined by 
IIRof radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1.  The PFS -1y rate is estimated on the full analysis 
set for this study using the K -M method.  
Progression -free survival (PFS) by IIR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of the first d ocumentation of PDor death (whichever occurs first) as determined by IIR 
using RECIST 1.1.  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause.  Subjects who are lost to follow -up and those who are alive at the date of data 
cutoff will be censored at the date the subject was last known alive, or date of data cutoff, 
whichever occurs first.  Overall survival rate at 1 year will be estimated.
Objective response rate (ORR) by IIR at 4 months is defined as the proportion of subjects who 
have best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by 
IIR using RECIST 1.1 within the first 4 months.
Safety will be assessed summari zing the incidence of tre atment -emer gent adverse events

Assessment of population -based PK parameters of lenvatinib .
Score changes from baseline for all PedsQL scales including Generic Core Scales and Cancer 
Module.  Scores will be calculated for total generic score, total cancer score, each physi cal 
function subscale including physical health, psychosocial health, emotional function, social 
function, school/work function in the Generic Core Scales, and each subscales in the cancer 
module.   
Palatibility and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib in subjects receiving the 
suspension formulation in the study will be assessed using the Palatability Questionnaire (see 
Appendix 5 ).
Exploratory Endpoints
Duration of response (DOR) by IIR is defined as the time from the date a response was first 
documented until the date of the first documentation of PDor date of death from any case .
Disease control rate (DCR) by IIR is the proportion of subjects who have abest overall 
response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD).  In this context, stable disease is defined as stable 
disease at ≥7weeks after randomization to be considered best overall response.
Clini cal benefit rate (CBR) by IIR is the proportion of subjects who have best overall response 
of CR or PR or durable SD (duration of SD ≥23 weeks after randomization).
Proportion of subjects who achieve complete removal of baseline lesions following completion 
of chemotherapy.
Blood and tumor biomarkers will be assessed for identifying potential correlation with clinical 
outcomes -related endpoints.
All efficacy endpo ints listed above (except OS) evaluated based on invest igator 
assessment using RECIST 1.1.
Analysis Sets
The Full Analysis Set (Inten t-to-Treat Analysis [ITT]) includes all randomized subjects regardless
ofthe treatment actually received. This is the primary analysis population used for theefficacy 
analyses which will be based on the ITTprinciple.
The Per Protocol Analysis Set includes those subjects from theITT setwho received at least 1 dose 
ofanystudy drug , had no major protocol deviations and had both baseline and at least one 
postbaseline tumor assessment. Subjects for whom dea th occurred prior to the first postbaseline 
tumor assessment will also be included . The per protocol analysis set will be the secondary analysis 
set for efficacy endpoints .
The Safety Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of anystudy drug. This is 
the analys is population used for all safety analyses which will be based on as -treated principle.
Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set includes t he subjects who have received at least 1
dose of lenvatinib with documented dosin g history and have measurable plasma levels of lenvatinib .
The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1dose of study drug 
and had sufficient pharmacodynamic data (eg, at least 1 evaluable/measurable pharmacodynamic
parameter).
The HRQoL Analysis Set will consist of all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose 
of study medication, and have completed at least 1 patient- reported outcome (PRO) assessment 
beyond baseline.  For PRO analysis, subjects will be a nalyzed as randomized and not according to 
treatment actually received.

FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 15of 121Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the Full Analysis Set.
All the statistical analysis will be conducted at the PFS-1y/OS- 1y analysis data cutoff date (ie, 
when the last subject has completed 18 cycles of treatment or discontinues before the end of 
Cycle 18, whichever occurs first ), including the an alysis of PFS -4mrate.  Additional follow -up 
analysis will be basedon th e date of data cutoff for the additional follow -up analysis for OS or at the 
time of last subject last visit, whichever occurs later.   
Primary Analysis
The primary analysis of PFS -4m rate will be based upon data provided by IIR of tumor assessments.  
PFS-4m rate and their Greenwood standard errors will be evaluated using the K -M estimates from 
both treatment groups.  The statistical significance of the difference in the 2 K -M PFS -4m rates 
comparing lenvatinib + chemotherapy agent ( TestArm) vs. chemotherapy agent alone (Control Arm) 
will be tested using a 2 -sided 80% CI.This 2-sided 80% CI and a p-value will be constructed using 
the difference of these 2 K -M PFS -4m rates and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors. 
Statistical significance of the differ ence is declared if the CI is entirely above 0. This is equivalent to 
a test using a 1 -sided test at alpha=0.1 .The 2-sided 95% CIs will also be provided for descriptive 
purpose s.PFS-4m rate will also be analyzed us ing a binomial approach as a sensitivity analysis by 
excluding subjects whose PFS arecensor ed prior to 18 weeks .
Secondary Analyses
PFS-1y rate will be analyzed using the same methods as the primary efficacy analysis. PFS 
censoring rules will follow FDA guidance of 2007, however, removal of baseline lesions after 
completion of Week 18 without progression is not a trigger for PFS censoring after 18 weeks (refer to 
Concomitant Drug/Therapy –allowed concomitant treatment/ procedures) .
Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arm and control arm using the stratified 
logrank test with time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) 
and age (<18 or≥18 years) as strata.   Media n OS with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs will be calculated 
using K -M product -limit estimates for each treatment arm ,and the K-M estimates of OS will be 
plotted over time. The Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% 
and 95% CIsstratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late 
[≥18months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) .  Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates will also be presented for 
4, 6, 9 ,and 12 months with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs.
Median PFS and 2- sided 80% and 95% (as exploratory) CIs will be presented ,and the K -M estimates 
of PFS will be plotted over time. The Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio 
and its 80% and 95% CIsstratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disea se (early [<18 months] or 
late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) .  Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates will also be presented 
for 4, 6, 9, and 12 months with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs.
The ORR will be compared between the t estand control groups using either a chi -square test or a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disease (early 
[<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) , as appropriate .  Corresponding odds 
ratios and their 2-sided 80% and 95 %CIs comparing the groups will also be presented.   The 
individual treatment g roup ORRs will also be calculated along with exact 95% confidence intervals 
using the Clopper and Pearson method.
Exploratory Analys es
Median DOR among responders for each arm will be presented along with its corresponding 2 -sided 
95% CIs. Disease Control Rate (DCR) and CBR will be calculated with exact 95% CIsusing the 
Clopper and Pearson method. The differ ences of the above rates bet ween 2groups and 
corresponding two -sided 95% CIs will be calculated respectively.

Pharmacodynamic, and other biomarker analyses may be performed and reported separately.  Details 
of these analyses may be described in a separate analysis plan.
Blood serum samples may be analyzed using global proteomic methods, enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead -based immunoassay, or other assays/methods and 
new technology in an effort to identify biom arkers. 
Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be collected (if available) for assessment of mutations and other 
genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and progression of cancer as 
well as for potential use in diagnostic devel opment.
Data obtained from the pharm acodynam icsamples will be used for research.  The pharmacodynamic
samples will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not 
currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) may be stored for up to 
15years to assist in any research scientific questions related to lenvatinib and for potential diagnostic 
development.  If the subject reaches 18 years of age prior to the date of final sample analyses they 
will b e reconsented.  No further analyses will be performed on these collected samples from subjects 
who either do not reconsent after their 18th birthday or cannot be reached for reconsenting and the 
sample will be destroyed.  When the subject reaches the age o f 18 years (or 16 years in the UK) while 
on the study, and becomes competent to give informed consent, his/her consent will be obtained 
using separate infor med consent forms (ICFs) to continue on the study.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Lenvatinib concentration versus time data will be tabulated and summarized and graphically 
presented.
Lenvatinib data from Arm A of the study will be pooled with available data from other studies and 
subjected to population PK analysis.  The PK model will be parameterized in term s of clearance and 
volume of distribution. Details of the population PK analysis will be provided in a separate analysis 
plan. 
Other Analyses
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL ):
The PedsQL for all subject s(self -and proxy- rating) will be collected atbaseline, at C2D1, C3D1, 
Week 18 , C8D1 ,C18 D1 , and at the Off -Treatment visit .
Interim Analyses
No i nterim analysis is planned for this study.
The safety monitoring will be conducted by the independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC) .
The frequency of safety reviews will be defined in the IDMC charter. Minutes from the open 
meetings of the IDMC will be provided if requested by regulatory agencies. The recommendation 
whether to stop the study for safety will be reached by the IDMC base d on their review of safety data 
with treatment information. The function and membership of the IDMC will be described in the 
IDMC charter.
Sample Size Rationale
A binomial -based comparison of 2 proportions using correction for continuity was used for sample 
size estimation.  A total sample size of 72 subjects is estimated to achieve 80% statistical power at 
1-sided alpha of 0.1 to detect a difference of 30% based on the assumption that PFS -4m for Ar m A 
(lenvatinib arm) is 55% and for Arm B is 25%.  Alp ha is the type 1 error probability of declaring 
lenvatinib arm being effective when the true lenvatini b arm  PFS -4m rate is only 25%.

Clinical Trials Direct ive 2001/20/EC or Code of Federal Regulat ions, Ti tle 21 CFR Part 56) .  
Any protocol amendment or revisio n to the ICF will be resubmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
review and approval, except for changes involving only logist ical or administrative aspects of 
the study  (eg, change in clinical resea rch associate(s) [CRAs], change of telephone 
number[s]).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance with the ICH E6 and any local 
regul ations regarding const itution and review conduct will be provided to the sponsor.
Docum ented study  approval  from the IRB/IEC ch airman m ust be sent to the principal 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution) w ith a copy  to the 
sponsor before study  start and the release of any study  drug to the si te by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides to suspend or terminate the study , 
the invest igator (or if regio nally  requi red, the head of the m edical inst itution)will 
immediately  send the noti ce of study  suspensi on or terminat ion by the IRB/IEC to the 
sponsor.
Study  progr ess is to be reported to IRB/IECs annually (or as requi red) by the investigator or 
sponsor, depending on local regulatory  obligat ions.  If the invest igator is required to report to 
the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy  to the sponsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The invest igator (s) or the sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any  reportabl eadverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines 
and local IRB/IEC standards of practice.  Upon complet ion ofthe study , the invest igator will 
provi de the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study , if requi red.
At the end of the study , the sponsor should notify  the IRB/IEC and Com petent Authori ty 
(CA) within 90 days.  The definit ion of the end of the study  is the date of the data cutoff for 
the final analysis or last subject/last visit, including discont inuat ion from the study  for any  
reason, whichever occurs later.
In the case of early terminat ion/tem porary  halt of the study , the invest igator should notify the 
IRB/IEC and CA wit hin 15 calendar days, and a detailed written explanat ion of the reasons 
for the terminat ion/halt shoul d be given.

6INTRODUCTION
6.1 Osteosarcoma
Cancer i s a rel atively unco mmo n diagnosis in the pedi atric popul ation, and the overall 
incidence is low (18.6 cases per 100,000 children [ Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ]).  Solid tumors 
constitute approximately  60% of  childhood m alignancies ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ).  
Malignant bone tumors are the fifth most comm on solid tum or ty pe account ing for about 5% 
of childhood tumors ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019; Kaatsch, 2010 ). 
Osteosarcoma is the most commo nly diagnosed primary  malignancy of the bone in children 
and y oung adul ts, and accounts for approximately 5% of childhood tumors , with an estimated
annual incidence of 4.4 cases per 1 millio n in people younger than 24 years ( Mirabello, et al., 
2009 ). Osteosarcoma occurs predominant ly in adolescents and y oung adul ts.  The m edian 
age at diagnosis is 20 y ears, wi th the incidence peaking at 15 to 19 years of age (ESMO, 
guidelines, 2014 ).  According to the Amer ican Cancer Society , osteosarcoma in this age 
group i s8 per 1 millio n (Ward, et al ., 2014) .

Eisai
FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 29of 121There are both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that have been shown to contribute to the 
development of osteosarcoma. Studies have demonstrated that several genetic abnorm alities, 
including the overexpressi on of  vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 
(VEGFR) , platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR), and c-fos, are 
associ ated wi th the development of osteosarcoma in laboratory models as well as humans 
(Gorlick and Khanna, 2010 ).  However, osteo
sarcoma is not characterized by a  single 
oncogenic driver .  The vast majorit y of abnorm al oncogenes and tum or-suppressor genes 
associ ated wi th osteosarcom a are also comm on in the m ost prevalent cancers ( Gorlick and 
Khanna, 2010). 
 Extrinsic fact ors such as io nizing radi ation, which is used  for the treatment 
of childhood solid tumors , have been well implicated in the development of a second 
malignancy, with osteosarcoma being the most likely to develop within the first 2 decades 
following treatment (Le Vu, et al., 1998).
The m anagement of osteosarcoma is multimodal; pati ents not amenable to surgery or patients 
at second or third relapse have a poor prognosis.  Metastatic osteosarcoma is commo n (10% 
to 20% ) (NCCN, Bone cancer guidelines, 2020 , Casal i, et al., 2018), wit h the m ost frequent 
site being the l ung (>85%) .  In the case of iso lated lung metastases , more than a third of 
patients wi th a second surgical remissio n survive for >5 y ears ( Casali, et al., 2018 ). 
Approximately 25% of
 all pat ients with primary metastati c osteosarcoma and >40% of those 
who achieve a complete surgical remissio n may becom e long-term survivors ( Casali , et al ., 
2018) as compared with 65% to 70% of patients wit h localized disease ( Meazza and 
Scanagatta, 2016 )
.
About 30% to 40% of patients with localized disease and 80% of those with metastatic 
d
isease experience relapse ( Casali, et al.,
 2018 ; NCCN, Bone cancer guidelines, 2020 ; 
Ferrari , 2003 ).  The presence o f solitary metastasis, time to first relapse, and co mplete 
resectabilit y of disease at fi
rst recurrence are the most significant prognostic indicators for 
improved 
survival.  Patients whose tumor is not amenable to surgery , or with second or thi rd 
recurrence, or who have metastases to t he bone, have a poor prognosis.  In general, despite 
second -line treatment, the prognosis of recurrent disease in osteosarcoma has remained poor, 
with long- term 
postrel apse survival of <20% (Casali, et al., 2018 ; NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 20 20).  
6.2 Current Therapeutic Options
There has been no substantial progress in the treatment of osteosarcoma since the 1980s . 
Current treatment utilizes mult i-agent chemotherapy and surgi cal resecti on of all cl inically 
detectable disease.  
Treatment of New ly Diagn osed Disease
Newly diagnosed osteosarcoma is ty pically managed wi th
 neoadj uvant chem otherapy 
followed by surgical remo val of the primary  tumor and all clinically  evident m etastati c 
disease, fo llowed by adjuvant chemotherapy .  Surgical resect ion of all clin ically detectable 
sites of disease is vital, reg
ardless of number and site, as complete resection is predictive of

Eisai
FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 30of 121survival ( Meazza and Scanagatta, 2016 ).  For patients with unresectable disease at mult iple 
sites, experimental  therapy  is also consi dered, d ue to the poor prognosis for these patients. 
The m ost effect ive chemotherapy regimens include the combinat ion of high -dose 
methotrexa te, doxorubicin, and cisplat in and has becom e the standard treatment for 
high-grade osteosarcoma ( Ferrari and Serra, 2015; Isakoff, et al., 2015; NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 20 20).
Treatment of Relapsed, Refractory, and Progressive Disease
Second- line treatment for relapsed disease consists of chemotherapy and/or surgical resect ion
(Casali, et al., 2018 ; NCCN Bone Cancer Gui delines , 2020 ).The rol e of second -line 
chemotherapy for recurrent osteosarcoma is much less well defined than that of surgery ,and 
there is no accepted standard regimen ( Casali, et al., 2018 ).For pati ents wi th resectable 
solitary  metastasis to the lung, surgical resection only  may be adequate. For those with 
recurrent pulmo nary metastases that are resectable, surgery  is advised in addit ion to 
neoadj uvant or ad juvant chem otherapy , regardless o f the number of previous lung relapses 
and the number of secondary  pulm onary lesions ( Briccoli, et al., 2005). Aggressive surgical 
resection o f metastases and the abilit y to achieve a second surgical remission have 
consistent ly been shown essential for lo ng-term survival  following rel apse ( Kempf -Bielack ,
et al., 2005; Leary ,et al., 2013; Bacci ,et al., 200 5; Chou ,et al., 2005; Hawkins and Arndt , 
2003 ). 
As per the European Societ y for Medi cal Onco logy(ESMO) gui delines for bone sarcoma, 
treatm ent optionsfor recurrent osteosarcoma include ifosfamide ±etoposi de ±carbopl atin, 
and other active drugs (Casali, et al., 2018 ).Preferred regimens for second -line therapy per 
the National  Com prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN )bone sarco ma guidelines include
ifosfamide (high dose) with or without etoposide, regorafenib , soraf enib, and sorafenib plus 
evero limus (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines , 2020 ).
In the event of subsequent relapse, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines ,
2020 )and ESMO guidelines ( Casali, et al., 2018 )strongly encourage participation in clinical 
studi es.  Otherwise, pati ents wi th disease progression or relapse after second -line therapy are 
managed wit h surgical resect ion, palliat ive radiotherapy , or best supportive care.
6.3 Lenvatinib
E7080 (l envat inib) is a potent multip le receptor ty rosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor (RTKI) that 
select ively inhibits VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 
(FLT4), in addit ion to other pro -angiogenic and oncogenic pathway -related RTKs, inclu ding 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 1-4, PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, 
and RET.   Therefore, lenvat inib exerts it’s in vivo ant itumoural  activity based on m ultiple 
mechanisms invo lved in and through effects related to angiogenesis (incl uding reversi on of 
resistance) and the tumor microenvironment, as well as direct inhibitory  action on the tumour 
cells.   Recent studi es have also dem onstrated lenvatinib’s immunomodulatory act ivity in the 
tumor microenvironment.  This includes decreases in immunosuppressive tumor -associated

(Kato, et al., 2019; Kimura, et al., 2018 ).
6.3.1 Clinical Data on Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide
for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma
The safet y, tolerabilit y and activit y of single -agent lenvat inib, and lenvat inib in co mbinat ion 
with chem otherapy  (ifosfamide a nd etoposide), have been assessed in E7080 -G000 -207 
(Study  207), a phase 1/2, mult icenter, open -label study in children ,adolescents and y oung 
adults withsolid tumors, including relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a, and
radioiodine -refractory  differentiat ed thy roid carcino ma. The recommended p hase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of lenvat inib was determined in the phase 1b portion as14 m g/m2orally once daily  
when given as single -agent as well as in co mbination with etoposide (100 m g/m2IVonce 
daily  for 3 days) + ifosfamide (3000 m g/m2IV once daily  for 3 day s), administered on days 1
to 3 of each 21- day cycle, for 5 cycles. Safet y and efficacy is being assessed in the Phase 2 
porti on of  the study .
Data from Study  207 have shown that patients with osteosarcoma may benefit from treatment 
with lenvatinib. In the single agent expansio n cohort in relapsed/refractory  osteosarcom a,
(n=31; Cohort 2B) , 9 of 28 evaluable pat ients (32.1%) achieved progression -free survival 
(PFS) at 4 months (PFS -4m) , median PFS was 3.0 mo nths (95% CI: 1.8, 5. 5). Two out of 
29subjects (6.9%)with measurable disease had a parti al response (PR) (Gaspar, et al., 2018 ).  
Amo ng the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set forthe single -agent lenvat inib 
expansio n cohort, the most commo n adverse events were: headache (48%), vomit ing (45%), 
decreased appet ite, diarrhea, and hypothy roidism  (42% each), proteinuria (39%), increased 
blood TSH, hy pertensio n, nausea, py rexia, and weig ht decreased (36% each).  Five subjects 
(16.1%) di scont inued treatment due to TEAEs ,and 8subjects (25.8%) reported TEAEs 
leading to study  drug dose reducti on.  There were no treatment -related fatal  TEAEs (Gaspar, 
et al., 2018 ).  
In a pool ed analysis o f subjects from Phase 1b and 2 receiving lenvat inib14 m g/m2in 
combinat ion with ifosfamide plus etoposi de (N=35; full analysis set ),the primary  efficacy 
endpo int, PFS -4 rate based on RECIST 1.1 by investi gator assessment, was 67.9% (95% CI: 
47.6, 84.1) . As of the data cutoff date of 23 Jul 2019, the object ive response rate (ORR) was 
12.5%, including 4 subjects with PR. Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 4.5, 12.6) , and 
median overall survival ( OS)was 16.3 months (95% CI: 12.6 , NE)(Gaspar, et al., 2019 ).
Overall t reatm ent wi th lenvat inibin co mbinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide in this 
patient popul ationwas associ ated wi th a manageable safet y profile , and no unexpected 
toxicities were observed .Among the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set,the most 
frequent treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia ( 71%), nausea and 
vomiting (61% each), diarrhea (52%), neutropenia , platel et count decreased , and white blood 
cell count decreased (48%each).  The most common treatment -related grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
anemia (52%), neutropenia (48%), platelet count decreased andwhite blood cell count

Eight subjects (25.8%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs , and 15 subjects (48.4 %) 
reported TEAEs leading to study  drug dose reduction . There were no treatment -related fatal
TEAEs (Gaspar , et al ., 2019 ).
6.4 Study Rationale
Study  230, a randomized ,controlled Phase 2 study , will evaluate the efficacy  and safet y of 
lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with ifosfamide and etoposi de in children , adol escents ,and y oung 
adults wi th relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a.Eligible patients aged 2 to 2 5years old will 
receive ifo sfamide and etoposide with or wi thout lenvat inib (14 mg/m2;RP2D from  
Study 207). Subjects rando mized to Arm A can cont inue to receive l envat inib unt il disease 
progression, intolerable toxicit y, or withdrawal of consent. Approximately 72 subjects will 
be treated in the study .  The primary  object ive of the study  is to dem onstrate that l envat inib 
in combinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide has superior efficacy co mpared to ifosfamide 
and etoposide based on the PFS-4mratein children, adolescents and young adults with 
relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a.
Pediatric soli d tum ors are hi ghly vasculari zed.  Angi ogenesis and vasculogenesis are the 
fundamental processes by which new blood vessels are formed.  As with normal t issue, the 
growing tumor requires an extensive network of ca pillaries to provide the necessary nutrients 
and oxygen.  Moreover, the new intratumor blood vessels o ffer a way  for tum or cells to enter 
the circulati on and metastasi ze to di stant organs and thus play an indispensable role in so lid 
tumor growth and m etastasis. Thus, inhibit ion of angiogenesis is a viable target for 
anticancer therapy .  Moreover, vascular normalisatio n allows reoxy genati on, hence the 
addition of  an ant i-VEGF to chemotherapy  may resul t in increased uptake of drugs into 
tumor tissue ( Tuetten berg, et al., 2006 ).

8.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
The study  has been designed as an open -label,randomized study  to com pare the safet y and 
efficacy  of lenvat inib in combinat ion with the ifosfamide and etoposide with ifo sfamide and 
etoposide alo ne in children, adolescents, and y oung adul ts wi th relapsed or refractory  
osteosarcoma. Ifosfamide and e toposi dewill be used as the con trol group since it is a 
recogni zed treatm entoption forpatients with relapsed osteosarcoma .
Progression -free survival (PFS) rate at 4 m onths (PFS -4m)as com pared to con trol, with 
blinded IIRof radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria will be evaluated as the 
primary  endpoint.  The endpoint was determined as appropriate for the study , given the 
unique bio logy of the osteosarcom a (bone lesio ns do not shrink) and the vital role of surgical 
resection o f metastati c lesions, where possible, in the management of patients with this 
tumor.  Pulmonary metastases are most common in osteosarcoma, and the abilit y to achieve a 
second surgical remission ha sconsistent ly been shown essent ial for long-term survival  
following relapse (Kempf Bielack ,et al., 2005; Leary ,et al., 2013 ;Bacci ,et al., 2005 ;Chou ,
et al., 2005 ;Hawkins and Arndt, 2003 ).  The protocol allows for surgical resect ion of 
baseline lesio ns after completion of the Week 18 tumor assessment .  Thistimepo int allows
for surgi cal resect ion after com pletion of  chemotherapy without confounding data due to 
subjects undergoing surgery . To avoi d bias in efficacy  assessment, the analysis for primary 
endpo int is based on tumor assessment by  IIR, a central  independent blinded assessment. 
Progression -free survival at 1 y ear(PFS -1y), PFS, and OS will also be evaluated in the study
as second ary endpoints.
Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor bio markers ident ified in other lenvat inib clinical studies
will be assessed in samples co llected fro m subjects enrolled in this study  in the test arm only 
(Arm A: lenvatinib + ifosfamide + etoposide) and may be used for exploratory  analysis for 
evaluat ion of response -related and/or safety -related outcom es.
The study  will also assess healt h related qualit y of life (HRQoL) using validated 
questionnaires.
Randomization will be used in this study  to avoi d bias in the assignment of subjects to 
treatm ent, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,

Before dose administration on Day 1 of each cycle and prior to a change in dose due to dose 
reducti on, the am ount of  lenvat inib needed for each subject must be calculated as fo llows: 
Scheduled dose (mg/m2) ×body  surface area (BSA) (m2) = lenvatinib dose (mg)
Body surface area (B SA)will be calculated using the method that is accepted and 
custom arily used by  the clinical  site.  BSA m ust be cal culated on Day  1 of each cycle based 
on the subject’s current height and body  weight.  BSA will be used to determine the amount 
of lenvat inib for each subject.  BSA should not be corrected for amputation. The dose should 
be rounded to the nearest whole number. After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose of 
lenvat inib shoul d not exceed 24 mg daily.
Subjects will receive study  treatm ent as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatment arms . 
Treatment cy cles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions.  If 
chemotherapy administration is precluded on Day  1 of a treatm ent cy cle, the subject m ay 
resum e treatm ent once recovered at the discret ion of investigator.  Subsequent chemo therapy

still above normal BMI, they can restart the study treatment at a lower dose once the weight has been 
stable for at least 1 week).  Normal BMI should be used as the new baseline for further dose reductions.    
Obesity  is defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles corresponding to 30 kg/m², related to the age of

For children, blood pressure varies by the sex and age of the child and it is closely related to 
height and weight.  Blood pressure will be assessed in terms of percent ile for sex, age and 
height/l ength.  Gui delines to sex, age, and height -specific percent iles of blood pressure are

develop hypertensio n during the study . Ideally , cardi ovascular assessments and the 
management of hypertensio n shoul d be supervised by  a cardi ologist.  Exerci se, exci tement, 
coughing, crying, and struggling may rais e the systolic pressure of children as much as 
40to50mmHg greater than their usual level.  Variabilit y in blood pressure in children of 
approximately  the same age and body  build shoul d be expected and serial measurements 
shoul d always be obtained when e valuating a pat ient with hypertensio n.
8.4.1.1.2 MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
Hypertensio n is a recognized side -effect of treatm ent wi th drugs inhibit ing VEGF signaling.
Invest igators should therefore ensure that subjects enro lled to receive treatment with 
lenvat inibhave BP <95th percentile [BP ≤150/90 mmHg] for sex, age, and height/length at 
the time o f study  entry  and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of 
antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1 Day 1. Early detection and 
effect ive management of hypertensio n are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose 
interrupti ons and reductions.  
Regular assessment of BP should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Hy pertensio n will be graded using CTCAE v5.0, based 
on BP m easurements only (and not on t he number of ant ihypertensive medicat ions).
If the subject’s init ial BP m easurement is el evated (systolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [BP 
≥140 mm Hg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile[BP ≥90 mm Hg ]),the BP m easurement 
shoul d be repeated at l east 5 minutes later. The mean value of 2 measurements at least 
5minutes apart is defined as 1BP assessment. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 
2BP m easurements ob tained at l east 5 minutes apart) is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a conf irmatory  assessment shoul d be obtained at least 
30minutes later by performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean 
value.
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile [BP ≥140 mm Hg ] or diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg]) is confirmed 
on 2 assessments obtained 30 minutes apart.  The cho ice of ant ihypertensive treatment should 
be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and fo llow standard m edical 
practi ce.  For p reviously normotensive subjects, monotherapy  with one of the cl asses of 
antihypertensives should be started when systolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥140 mm Hg] or 
diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg] is first observed on 2 assessments obtained 
30 minutes apart.  F or those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, treatm ent 
modificati on may be necessary  if hypertensio n persists.
Lenvat inibshoul d be wi thheld in any  instances where a subject is at imminent risk to develop 
a hypertensive crisis or has si gnificant ri sk factors for severe complicat ions of uncontrolled 
hypertensio n (eg, BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160/100 mm Hg], significant risk factors for 
cardi ac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant comorbidit ies). Once the

controlled, lenvatinibshoul d be resumed as described below. 
During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg )
or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg) must have their BP monitored on Day  15 
(or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP has been <95th percent ile 
(≤150 mm Hg )and diastolic BP has been <95th percent ile(≤95 mm  Hg)for 2consecut ive 
treatm entcycles .  If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg) or 
diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg )occurs, the subject must resume the Day  15 
evaluat ion until systo lic BP has been <95th percentile (≤150 mm Hg )and di astolic BP has
been <95th percentile (≤95 mm Hg) for 2consecutive treatm ent cy cles. 
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for the m anagement of systolic BP ≥99th 
percent ile (BP ≥160 mm Hg )or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg) confirmed 
on repeat measurements after at least 30 minutes : 
Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy  for subjects not already 
receiving this. 
For those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, the dose of the current 
agent may be increased, if appropri ate, or 1 or more agents of a  different class of 
antihypertensive should be added. 
If systolic BP ≥99th percent ile (BP ≥160 mm Hg)or diastolic BP ≥99th percent ile
(BP ≥100 mm Hg)persists despite maximal antihypertensive therapy ,then lenvatinib 
administration shoul d be interrupted and restarted at a l ower dose QD (one dose l evel 
reducti on [20%]) only when systolic BP <95th percent ile (BP ≤150 mm Hg)and 
diastolic BP <95th percent ile (BP ≤95 mm Hg)and the subject has been on a stable 
dose of ant ihypertensive medication for at least 48 hours. 
-If systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm H g)or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile 
(BP ≥100 mm H g)recurs on the first dose reduction despite optimal management 
of hypertensio n with antihyperte nsive m edicat ions (ei ther by  dose increase or the 
addition of  a different cl ass of ant ihypertensive), then lenvat inibadministrati on 
shoul d be interrupted and restarted at a n addit ional dose reduction only when 
systolic BP <95th percentile (BP ≤150 mm Hg) and diastolic BP <95th percent ile 
(BP ≤95 mm Hg )and the subject has been on a stable dose of ant ihypertensive

(BP ≥100 mm Hg )recurs on the second dose reduction despite optimal 
management of hypertensio n with antihypertensive medicat ions (either by  dose 
increase or the addit ion of a different class of antihypertensive), then lenvat inib 
administration should be interrupted and restarte d at a third dose reduction only

Regular assessment for proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Gui delines for assessment and management of 
proteinuria are summarized as fo llows: 
Gradi ng of Proteinuria
Grading according to CTCAE 5.0(Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program , 2017 )will be 
based on the protein- creat inine ratio or24-hour urinary protein result ,if available .For 
subjects ≥18 years of age, i f the subject has 4+ proteinuria by d ipstick, a 24 -hour urinary 
protein result is required to confirm Grade 3 proteinuria.
Management of Proteinuria
Management of lenvat inib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria 
according to Table 1.
In the event of nephrotic syndro me, lenvatinib must be di scontinued .
Detection and Confirmat ion
Perform  urine di pstick testing per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5andTable 6)
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection init iated as soon as possible and
at least wi thin 72 hours (or a n immediate spot urine protein -to-creati nine rat io [UPCR ]
test)AND for subjects <18 years of age, an immediate spot UPCR test, and if possible ,a 
24-hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) is 
requi red in the following situat ions:
-The first (init ial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while on lenvat inib
-A subsequent increase in severit y of urine dipst ick proteinuria occurring on the same 
lenvat inib dose level
-When there has been a l envat inib dose reduction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipst ick result is ≥2+
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and 
at least wi thin 72 hours) to verify the grade of prot einuri a is requi red when UPCR i s ≥2.4.
Moni toring
Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed on Day  15 
(or m ore frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 
2consecutive treatment cycles.

8.4.1.1.5 MANAGEMENT OF HEPATOTOXICITY
Regular m onitoring of liver function tests ( ALT, AST, bilirubin levels) should be conducted 
as det ailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and Table 6)and as clinically ind icated. 
If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury  occur, instructi ons contained in the table for dose 
reducti on and interruptions o f the protocol should be fo llowed ( seeTable 1).  Appropri ate 
supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If hepat ic failure occurs 
the study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
8.4.1.1.6 MANAGEMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS
Subjects should be advised to pay  attenti on to symptom s suggest ive of venous 
thromboembo lic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, 
cough, hemoptysis, tachy pnea, tachycardia, cy anosis, deep vein thrombosis signs including 
lower-extremit y swelling, redness and warmth to touch or ten derness. In case any of these 
symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the 
treating physician.  If a thromboembo lic event is confirmed, instructions contained in the 
table for dose reducti on and interrupti ons of t he protocol should be fo llowed (see Table 1).  
Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close mo nitoring.  If a subject 
experiences a Grade 3 or alife-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reaction, including 
pulmo nary embo lism, study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
Arterial thromboembo lic events (eg, new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrov ascular acci dent) of  any grade requi re study  
drug di scontinuati on.
8.4.1.1.7 MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCALCEMIA
Serum  calcium shoul d be m onitored m onthly  per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and 
Table 6). Corrected serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per 
CTCAE v5.0, using the fo llowing form ula: 
Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] ×0.8 + serum calcium)
The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ˃4 g/dL); in 
such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead.
Hypocalcemia shoul d be treated per institutional gui delines (eg, using appropriate calcium, 
magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.
8.4.1.1.8 MANAGEMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS AND ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN
Initial management of acute abdominal pain in these study  subjects shoul d be focused on 
treating the underlying cause where possible, ensuring appropriate hydrat ion/rehydration, and 
symptom atic pain improvement consistent with subject’s age and in accordance to local and

events believed related to lenvat inib that result in the symptom of abdominal pain, follow 
instructi ons contained in Table 1regarding study  treatm ent dose reducti on and interruption.  
For Grade 4 adverse events that result in abdo minal pain, study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea should be managed by providing symptomatic 
treatm ent. If the symptoms persist (eg, diarrhea for more than 10 days) ,dose m odificati on 
guideline sshoul d be f ollowed as per Table 1. Gastroi ntestinal symptom s shoul d be 
monitored cl osely  and evaluated using CT, contrast -enhanced MRI, ultrasound, or other 
diagnosti c imaging if clinically indicated, at theinvestigator’s discret ion. 
Lenvat inibshoul d be discont inued in any subject who develops gastrointestinal perforation
of any grade or Grade ≥4fistula.  
8.4.1.1.9 MANAGEMENT OFHEMORRHAGE
Dose m odificat ion gui delines as per Table 1for lenvat inibrelated adverse events should be 
followed for the management of hemorrhage. Either resum e lenvatinibat a reduced dose or 
discontinue lenvat inib, depending on the severit yand persiste nce of hemorrhage.
8.4.1.2 Management of Ifosfamide -Etoposide Associated Toxicity
Blood counts shoul d be cl osely  monitored during and pri or to the next cy cle of 
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy -associ ated myel osuppressi on shoul d be managed by  
granulocy te-colony stimulat ing factor ( G-CSF). It is reco mmended that pegylated G -CSF or 
G-CSF be administered at least 24 to 72 hours after complet ion of ifo sfamide -etoposi de 
chemotherapy; use of G -CSF i s reco mmended until white blood cell  (WBC )counts are 
≥1×109/L. Guidelines for dose modificat ion for ifosfamide and etoposide associated 
toxicities are provi ded in the Table 2below . 
Details o f ifosfamide and etoposide dose interru ption and reduction as well as management 
of toxicity can be found in the Summary  of Product Characteri stics (SmPC), and may be 
followed as per l ocal and inst itutional guidelines. The Sm PC will be provi ded to the study

regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) is responsible for ensuring that the 
temperature is m onitored throughout the total duration of the study  and that records are 
maintained.  The temperature should be monitored continuously by using eit her an in -house 
validated data acquisit ion system, a mechanical recording device, such as a cali brated chart 
recorder, or by  manual means, such that minimum and maximum thermo metric values over a 
specific t ime period can be recorded and retrieved as required.
8.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label study .  All subjects who provide signed informed consent and/or assent 
to parti cipate in thi s study  and sat isfy all eligibilit y requirements (see Secti on8.3) will be
assigned to treatm ents based on a computer -generated randomization scheme that will be 
reviewed and approved by an independent statistician.  The randomizat ion scheme and 
ident ificat ion for each subject will be included in the final clinical study  report for thi s study .
After the Baseline Period, subjects will be rando mized to 1 of the fo llowing 2 treatm ent arm s 
in a 1:1 rati o:
Arm A:  lenvat inib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifo sfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, 
Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles ) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day 
(IV, Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)
Arm B: ifosfamide 3000 m g/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to
5 cycles) and etoposi de 100 m g/m2/day ( IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle fo r a total  of up 
to 5 cycles)
Randomization will be performed centrally by an I VRS.  Randomizat ion will fo llow a 
predefined rando mizat ion scheme based on the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: time to first 
relapse/refractory  disease (early [<18 months] or l ate [≥18months])and age (<18 and

Lenvat inib capsule s are to be taken orally  once a day  at approximately the same time in the 
morning wi thout regard to food intake for 21days from Cycle 1 onward.  If a subject misses 
a dose, it may  be taken wi thin the 12 hours following the usual t ime of the morning dose. If 
more than 12 hours have elapsed from the time of the usual daily  dose, l envat inib shoul d be 
taken the next day  at the usual  time in the morning.  In the event a subject vo mits after study  
drug administration, the subject should not take another dose un til the next scheduled dose.  
Study  drugs should be administered at the clinic on PK sampling days. All scheduled visits 
must be conducted as per protocol, irrespective of treatment interruption. 
8.4.6 Blinding
The study  will not be blinded .
8.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All prior medicat ions (including over -the-counter medicat ions) administered 30 days before 
the first dose of study  drug and any  concomi tant therapy  administered to the subject during 
the course of the study  (starting at the date of info rmed consent) until 30 days after the final 
dose of study  drug will be recorded.  Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
procedures relating to malignancy  should be recorded.  Any  medicati on that is considered 
necessary  for the subject’s he alth and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of 
or interact with lenvatinibmay be cont inued during the study.
Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy  to ameli orate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood transfusio ns, fluid trans fusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be 
given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation 
of (or to interact with) lenvatinib.
Aspirin, nonsteroi dal antiinflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), and low-m olecular -weight heparin 
(LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing 
factor (g-CSF) or equivalent may be used in accordance with American Societ y of Clinical  
Onco logy (ASCO), institutional, or national guidelines.   Erythropoiet in may be used 
according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully 
monitored for increases in red blood cell (RBC) counts.
8.4.7.1 Drug -Drug Interactions
The weak inhibitory  effect on CYP enzymes (in vitro) e xhibited by lenvat inib suggests a l ow 
risk of lenvat inib interference wi th the PK of other drugs co -administered in usual clinical 
practi ce.  There is no clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction ( DDI)risk when lenvat inib 
is co-administered with CYP3A s ubstrates such as midazolam .  Simultaneous CYP3A4/P -gp 
inhibit ions by ketoconazole slight ly (15% to19%) increased systemic exposure to lenvat inib 
after oral  administrati on as measured by  AUC and C maxin humans.  Since no change was 
observed in half -life, tmax, or t lag, the slight increase in systemic exposure is probably related

Eisai
FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 56of 121to a decrease in first pass metabo lism.  However, since the magnitude o f the change is small, 
coadministration of lenvat inib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors is not of clinical concern.   
Similarly, PK data did not suggest any major effects of rifampin on the exposure or 
disposi tion of  lenvat inib.  Following administration of a single dose of lenvat inib wit h a 
single dose of rifampin, lenvatinib exposure increased about 31%.  In contrast, following 
administration of mult iple doses of rifampin, free lenvat inib exposure was reduced about 9% 
and about 18% for total lenvat inib.  These findings suggest that there is no clinically 
meaningful influence of eit her P -gp inhibit ion (singl e dose of ri fampin) or simultaneous P -gp 
and CYP3A4 induction (mult iple doses of rifampin) on l envat inib PK.
The locally approved product label or applicable SmPC for ifosfamide and etoposi de should 
be referenced for any  concomi tant therapy  use wi th ifosfamide and etoposi de.
8.4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs
Subjects should not receive other antitumor therapies while on study . If a subject receives 
additional antitumor therapi es other than the study  drug(s), such as chemotherapy , targeted 
therapi es, immuno therapy , or anti tumor intervent ions -such as surgery or palliat ive 
radiotherapy  (other than as described below), this will be judged to represent evidence of 
disease progressi on, and the study  medicati onshould be di scontinued.   
For further information o n the prohibited concomit ant therapies for ifosfamide and etoposide, 
please refer to the respective prescribing informat ion.
8.4.7.3 Permitted Concomitant Treatment /Procedures
The fo llowing concomitant treatments/procedures are allowed:
a.Removal of exist ing (not new) osteosarcoma lesio n (eg, surgical, radio frequency 
ablat ion, cryotherapy , therm oablati on, stereotaxi c rati otherapy ,etc.) after complet ion of 
the Week 18 tumor assessment .  Subjects in Arm A in the presence o f clinical benefit, 
may cont inue treatment w ith lenvat inib after protocol permissible surgery .
b.Palliat ive radiotherapy is allowed for ≤2 significantly symptomatic nontarget lesio ns. 
If asubject receiving treatm ent with lenvatinib requi res surgery  during the study , the stop 
time and restart time of lenvat inib shoul d be as follows:
For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at 
least 2 day s after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk o f bleeding. 
For m ajor procedures: stop l envat inib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery  and 
then restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence o f adequate healing and no risk 
of bleeding. 
Any addit ional procedural  or subject specific particularit ies should be discussed with the

CT/MRI scans of, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease plus any areas of 
newly suspec ted disease will be performed using the same methodology as at screening every 
6 weeks ±1 week , following the start of treatment on Cy cle 1 Day  1 during the chemotherapy 
treatm ent peri od until Week 18.   Following completion of the chemotherapy treatment pe riod
(ie, after Week 18) , the frequency o f tumor assessments will be every  9 weeks ±1 week unt il 
Week 54 ±1 week.  Thereafter, they  will be perf ormed every  12 weeks ±2 weeks unt il 
docum entati on of  PD.  At any  point, scans shoul d be perform ed earlier than t he scheduled 
time point, if clinically indicated.
An initial assessment of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by IIR not 
less than 4 weeks after the init ial response. The same methodology (CT or MRI) and scan 
acquisit ion techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as was used for the screening 
assessments should be utilized across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison o f 
lesions. After treatment disco ntinuat ion for a reason other than PD, tum or assessments 
shoul d cont inue to be performed as per the tumor assessment schedule until documentation 
of progressi on or start of a new ant icancer agent.  Screening CT scans should be performed 
with oral and i odinated intravenous contrast and MRI scans should be performed with 
intravenous gadolinium chelate.  Post -screening scans may be performed without contrast if a 
medical contraindicat ion develops while on study  treatm ent.  If i odinated intravenous
contrast i s contraindicated, chest CT should be done without intravenous contrast .  MRI 
shoul d be perform ed for all  other body  regions (with gadolinium unless contraindicated ( eg, 
severe renal dysfunct ion).
CT scans should be diagnostic qualit y spiral/mul tidetector CT with oral  and i odinated 
intravenous contrast, and the MRI scans should be performed wit h intravenous gadolinium 
chelate.  Scans of the neck, abdo men, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be done wi th 
MRI instead of CT, but evaluat ion of the chest shoul d be done wi th CT.  Spi ral/mul tidetector 
CT shoul d be perform ed wi th a 5-mmcontiguous slice reconstruction algorithm.  If body 
MRI scans are performed, contiguous slices o f 5 mm shoul d also be performed.  If a subject 
develops a contraindicat ion to CT con trast during the study , the chest evaluat ion shoul d be 
done wi th non-contrast CT, and the other body  scans shoul d be done wi th MRI wi th 
gadolinium chelate IV. 
The same imaging modalit y and image -acquisit ion protocol (including use or non -use of 
contrast) shoul d be used consistent ly across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison of 
lesions.  Low -dose non -contrast CT transmissio n scans fro m a posi tron emissio n 
tomography -CT (PET -CT) combinat ion scanner are not acceptable.  Ultrasound should not 
be used f or radi ographic tum or assessment.  A chest x -ray or skeletal  x-ray which clearly  
demonstrates a new m etastati c lesi on may be used to document progression in lieu of the 
CT/MRI scans.
If subcutaneous masses or nodes are palpable (eg, bulky) and are asses sable by both clinical 
and radiographic techniques, the radiographic (CT/MRI) technique should be used for the 
assessment of target and non -target l esions.

FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 63of 1218.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a patientor clinical investigation subject 
administered an invest igational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study , the study  drug islenvatini b. 
The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease tem porally  associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product (Note:  Every  sign or 
symptom  shoul d not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE)
Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an existing disease .However, worsening of the 
primary  disease shoul d be captured under efficacy  assessments as PD.
Any deterioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in trea tment, or 
discontinuat ion of study  drug
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory 
abnorm ality leads to any  type o f intervent ion, withdrawal  of study  drug, or wi thhol ding 
of study  drug , whether pr escribed in the protocol or not
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be recorded beginning 
from the time the subject signs the s tudy ICF through the last visit and for 30 day safter the 
subject’s last dose .  Refer to Section 8.5.4.1 for the time period after the end of treatment for 
SAEcollect ion.  
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in al l subjects and determine if they  consti tute 
an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated 
laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormalit y
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
Abnorm al ECG (QTcF) resul ts, if not otherwi se considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc Finterval  is more than 
450ms and there is an increase of morethan 60ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormalit y 
that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.
All AEs must be fo llowed for 30days after the subject’s last study  drug dose, or until 
resol ution, whichever co mes first.  Subjects with o nset of an AE or deterioration of a 
preexist ing AE during the AE co llection peri od will be fo llowed unt il reso lution to baseline, 
start of a new ant icancer treatm ent, or death. All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if 
resol ution is unlikely, to stab ilizat ion.

FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 64of 121Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v5.0 (Cancer Therapy 
Evaluat ion Program, 2017).  Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both 
increasing and decreasing severit y).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
Wheth er the event i s known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  berecorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.
No (not related) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s not a 
reasonable possibilit y.
8.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIA TED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
AnSAE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y

Other important medical events that may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject o r may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error .  These events associ ated wi th special situa tions are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet one of 
the above criteria.  All AEs associ ated withspecial si tuations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolut ion or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospital ization:
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy  drug administrati on)
Hospitalization for administration of study  drug or insertion of access for administration 
of study  drug
Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before study  entry

Vital sign m easurements (i e, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory  rate [per minute]), body  temperature (in centigrade), w eight (kg), and 
height (cm) will be obtained at the visit s designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5
andTable 6) by a validated method.  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after the 
subject has bee n resting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the 
same arm , preferably by  the same person.  On Cy cle 1 Day  8, subjects will be contacted by  
telephone to assess for the development of early toxicit y. Subjects will be provided with a 
BP cuff to monitor BP at home or can have the measurement done by a local healt hcare 
provi der, and will report the C1D8 measurement at telephone contact. An unscheduled visit 
can occur prior to C1D15 if deemed necessary  by the invest igator.
Only 1 BP meas urement i s needed for subjects with systolic BP < 95th percent ile(BP 
<140 mm Hg )and diastolic BP < 95th percent ile(BP <90 mmHg ).If the subject’s init ial BP 
measurement is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [≥140 mmHg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile [≥90 mmHg ]), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 minutes later. 
The m ean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart is defined as 1 BP assessment. If 
the BP assessment (ie, the mean o f the 2 BP m easurem ents obtained at least 5 minutes apart) 
is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥ 95th percent ile[≥140 mmHg]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile
[≥90mm Hg ]), a confirmatory  assessment should be obtained at least 30 m inutes l ater by  
performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean value.
8.5.1.4.5 PHYSICAL EXAMINATIONS
Physical examinat ions will be performed as designated in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Docum entati on of  the physical examinat ion 
will be included in the source documentation at the site.  On ly changes fro m screening 
physical examinat ion findings that meet the definit ion of an AE will be recorded on the 
Adverse Events CRF.
8.5.1.4.6 ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS
Electrocardiograms will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5
and Table 6).  Com plete, standardi zed, 12 -lead ECG recordings that permit all 12 leads to be 
displayed on a single page with an accompanying lead II rhy thm stri p bel ow the custom ary 
3×4 l ead form at are to be used.  In addit ion to a rhyt hm strip, a minimum of 3 full co mplexes 
shoul d be recorded from  each lead simultaneously.  If possible, s ubjects must be in the 
recumbent posit ion for a period of 5 minutes prior to the ECG.
An ECG abnormalit y may meet the c riteria of an AE as described in this protocol (see
Secti on8.5.1.4.1 ) and the CRF Co mpletion Guidelines.  In these instances, the AE 
corresponding to the ECG abno rmality will be recorded on the Adverse Events CRF.

8.5.1.4.7 OTHER SAFETY ASSESSMENTS
Pregnancy Test
A serum β -hCG test will be performed for females of childbearing potential (see definit ion 
included in the Inclusio n/Exclusion criteria, Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 ).  A serum  or uri ne 
pregnancy test will be performed at Screening , Baseline (or within 72 hours prior to the first 
dose of study  medicat ion), on Day  1 of each cycle from Cycle 2 onwards ,and at the 
Off-treatm ent Visit in wo men of childbearing potent ial. Blood and urine sam ples will be 
taken at designated time po ints as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and
Table 6).
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram to assess LVEF will be performed during the screening phase, every 
16weeks following the first dose of study  drug while the subject is on treatment or soone r, if 
clinically indicated, and at (or within 1 week fo llowing) the off -treatment assessment.  
LVEFs as assessed by the inst itution will be entered onto the CRF.  Investigator assessment 
will be based upon inst itutional reports.
8.5.1.5 Other Assessments
Health-related qualit y of life ( HRQoL )assessment will be performed per the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5andTable 6).Impact of  treatm ent on HRQoL will be assessed using 
the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer Module).  Data will be collected 
as parent -report for toddlers (2 to 4 y ears) andas se lf-report for subjects aged ≥5 years .  
Self-report i s the preferred data collect ion for all subjects aged ≥5, however to improve 
adherence of participat ion, it is also acceptable to collect the data as proxy  report by  
observers including parents a nd caregivers.
The PedsQL is a modular instrument designed to measure HRQ oL in pediatric and adults 
popul ation. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are mult idimensio nal child self -report and 
parent proxy -report scal es devel oped as the generic core measure to be integrated with the 
PedsQL disease specific modules. The PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module was designed to measure 
pediatric cancer specific HRQOL .
It is best practi ce and strongly recommended that the PedsQL measurement modules are 
administered to randomize d subjects prior to drug administration or any  other interacti on 
with site staff .

m.Clinical chemistry and hematology results must be reviewed by the investig ator prior to administration of study drug on C1D1 and within 48 hours after 
administering any study drug for all subsequent cycles.  Scheduled assessments may be performed within 72 hours prior to the visit.  If ≥Grade 3 
hematologic or clinical chemistry toxicity, repeat laboratory test and AEs assessment at least ever y 3 day s (until improvement to <Grade 3).  TSH should be 
assessed for all subjects.
n.Urine dipstick testing should be performed at Screening, Baseline, C1D15, C2D1 , C2D15, and Day 1 of ever y subsequent cycle, or more frequently as 
clinically indicated, and at the Off -treatment Visit.  For subjects with a history of proteinuria ≥2+, urine dipstick testing should be performed until the result s 
have been 1+ or negative for 2treatment cycles .  If a new event of proteinuria ≥2+ occurs, refer to Section 8.4.1.1.4 for further management guidelines.   
Urine glucose should be performed as part of the urine dipstick.  
o.Sampling (one 2 mL sample per time point) for PK analysis of lenvatinib will be performed (in subjects in Arm A only) on Cy cle 1 Day  1 at 0.5 to 4 hours 
and 6 to 10 hours postdose, on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 0.5 to 4 hours and 6 to 10 hours postdose, and on Cycle 2 Day 1 at predose.  All predose samples 
are to be drawn approximately 24 hours following the dose administered on the previous day.  If dose interruption is necessar y at  these time points, please 
contact the sponsor.
p.Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib only after completion of 5 cycles with lenvatinib+ifosfamide +etoposide until progressive 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject request, study termination by the sponsor, subject noncomplian ce with safety or efficacy assessments, or withdrawal

8.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations
8.5.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, 
must be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no 
later than 24 hours from the date the investigator becomes aware of the event.
Serious adve rse events, regardless of causalit y assessment, must be collected for30 day s 
after the subject’s last dose .  All SAEs must be fo llowed to resolut ion or, if resolut ion is 
unlikely , to stabilizat ion.  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be related to the study  
treatm ent or any  protocol -requi red procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of 
the length of time that has passed since study  compl etion.
The detailed contact informat ion for reporti ng of SAEs is provided in the Invest igator Study  
File.
For urgent safety issues ,please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate study  team  member listed in the Invest igator Study  File.
It is very  important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the 
time of the init ial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causalit y.
Any relevant follow-up inform ation received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24hours
of its recei pt.  If the relevant follow-up inform ation changes the invest igator’s assessment of 
causalit y, this shoul d also be noted on the fo llow-up SAE form .
Preliminary SAE reports should be fo llowed as soon as possible by  detailed descripti ons 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy  reports, and other documents requested by 
the sponsor.

and/or the designated CRO monitor to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.
8.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Any pregnancy  in a female subject in which the estimated date of concept ion is either before 
the last visit or within 30 days of last study  treatm ent, or any  exposure to study  drug through 
breast feeding during study  treatm ent or wi thin 30days of last study  treatm ent, m ust be 
reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, this 
shou ld be reported regardless of the length o f time that has passed since the exposure to study  
treatm ent.
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, a spontaneous abortion or an induced 
aborti on done due to safet y concerns for ei ther mother or fetus are considered to be an SAE 
and should be reported in the same time frame and in the same format as all other SAEs (see
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events [ Section 8.5.4.1 ]).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by  fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours from the date the invest igator becomes 
aware of the pregnancy .  The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies and 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Invest igator Study File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used f or reporti ng.  All pregnancies must be fo llowed to 
outcom e.  The outcom e of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 24 hours from the date the invest igator becomes aware of the outcome.
A subject who becomes pregnant must be wi thdrawn from  the study .

MISUSE , ABUSE ,OR MEDICATION ERROR
Adverse e vents associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medic ation error 
refer to AEs associated with uses of the study  drug outsi de of that specified by  the protocol .  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medicat ion error are defined as fo llows:
Overdose Accidental  or intent ional use of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with

drug use or subject harm while the study  drug i s in the control  of site
personnel or the subject. 
All AEs associ ated wi th overdose ,misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error shoul d be captured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Secti on8.5.4.1 ) even if the AEs do not m eet seri ous cri teria.  Abuse 
and Intent ional Overdose, even if asymptomatic, are always to be captured as an AE.  If the 
AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error does not meet serious 
criteria, i t must still  be rep orted using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should 
be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.
8.5.4.3.2 REPORTING OF ABNORMAL HEPATIC TESTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST
The fo llowing combinat ion of abnormal laboratory tests *, as determined by way  of 
protocol -specified laboratory  testi ng or unscheduled laboratory  testing and whether 
nonseri ous or seri ous,shoul d be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the 
procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events ( Section 8.5.4.1 ). If the event 
does not m eet seri ous cri teria, the seri ousness criteria on the SAE form should be indicated as 
“nonserious .”  
Elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3 ×the upper limit of 
norm al 
AND
Elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2× the upper limit of 
norm al 
AND AT THE SAME TIME
Alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2× theupper limit of normal
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory  guidance docum ents. The purpose 
of the cri teria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepat ic tests that may require addit ional 
evaluat ion for an underlying etio logy. In add ition to reporting the abnormal hepat ic 
laboratory  tests on a SAE form , the si te shoul d also consul t the m edical m onitorfor guidance 
on assessment and fo llow-up.  At a minimum, laboratory  testing shoul d be repeated at l east 
once weekly until improvement o r ident ificat ion of a cause unrelated to study  drug use that is

8.5.4.4 Expedited Reporting
The sponsor must inform invest igators and regulatory  authori ties of repor tableevents, in 
compliance wi th applicable regulatory  requi rements, on an expedi ted basis (ie, within 
specific t ime frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide co mplete SAE

The invest igator will pro mptly explain to the subject (or subject’s parent or guardian) 
involved that the study  will be discont inued for that subject and provide appropriate medical 
treatm ent and other necessary  measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return 
for visits will be fo llowed up by  mail, phone, or other m eans to gather information such as 
the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment compliance, the prese nce or absence of 
AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms.  
Subjects who discont inue early fro m the study  will be discontinued for 1 of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, progression of disease, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, study terminated by sponsor, or administrative/other.  In addit ion to the 
primary  reason, the subject may  indicate 1 or m ore secondary  reason(s) for discontinuation.

discontinued prematurely will also be summ arized by  reason for discont inuat ion.
8.7.1.4 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographic and other baseline characterist ics for the FullAnalysis Set will be summarized 
using descript ive statist ics.  Conti nuous demographic and baseline variables (includ ingage, 
sex, race, height, and weight )will be summarized using n (number of subjects with available 
data), m ean, standard deviat ion, median, quartiles 1 and 3, and range (minimum and

8.7.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All invest igator terms for medications recorded in the CRF will be coded to an 11 -digit code 
using the World Healt h Organization Drug Dict ionary (WHO DD).  Concomitant 
medicat ions will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical Therapeut ic Chemical 
(ATC) cl ass indicating therapeut ic classificat ion.  Pri or medicat ions will be defined as 
medicat ions that started prior to the first dose of study  drug and were ei ther continued during

at the time of the first dose of study drug, or (2) started on or after the date of the first dose of 
study drug up to 30 day s after the subject’s last dose.  All medicat ions will be will be 
summarized and listed by drug and drug class and by treatm ent arm .
8.7.1.6 Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the Ful l Analysis Set .
All the statistical analysis will be conducted at the PFS -1y/OS- 1y analysis data cutoff date
(ie, when the l ast subject has completed 18 cycles of treatm ent or di scont inues before the end 
of Cycle 18, whichever occurs first) , including the analysis of PFS -4mrate.  Additional 
follow-up analysis will base don th e date of data cutoff for the addit ional follow-up analysis

FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 86of 12180% CI anda p-value will be constructed using the difference of these 2 K -M PFS -4m rates 
and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors. Statist ical significance of the difference 
is declared if the CI is ent irely above 0. This is equivalent to a test using a 1 -sided tes t at 
alpha=0.1. The 2 -sided 95% CIs will also be provided for descript ive purposes. PFS-4m 
rate will also be analyzed using a binomial approach as a sensi tivity analysis by excluding 
subjects whose PFS are censored prior to 18 weeks .
8.7.1.6.2 SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES
PFS-1y rate will  be analyzed using the same methods as the primary  efficacy analysis.   PFS 
censoring rules will fo llow FDA gui dance of 2007, however, removal of baseline lesio ns 
after com pletion of Week 18 without progression is not a trigger for PFS censoring after 
18weeks .(refer to Section 8.4.7.3 for allowed concomitant treatments/procedure in the 
study ).
Overall survival (OS) will be co mpared between tre atment arm  and control  arm using the 
stratified logrank test with time to first relapse/refractory  disease (early  [<18 m onths] or l ate 
[≥18 months]) and age (<18 or≥18 y ears) as strata.  Median OS with 2 -sided 80% and 
95% CIs will be calculated using K -M product -limit est imates for each treatment arm, and 
the K-M est imates of OS will be plotted over time.  The Cox regression model will be used 
to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% and 95% CIs stratified by time to first 
relapse/refractory  disease (early [<18 m onths] or late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or 
≥18years) .  Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates will also be presented for 4, 6, 9 and 12 months 
with 2-sided 80% and 95% CIs.
Overall PFS will be analyzed similarly to OS. Medi an PFS and 2 -sided 80% and 95% (as 
exploratory ) CIs will be presented ,and the K -M estimates of PFS will be plotted over time.  
The Cox regressio n model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% and 95% CIs 
stratified by time to first relapse/refractory  disease (early  [<18 m onths] or l ate [≥18 months]) 
and age (<18 or ≥18 y ears) .  K-M est imates will also be presented for 4, 6, 9 ,and 12 months 
with 2-sided 80% and 95% CIs.
The ORR will be co mpared between the testand control groups using either a chi -square test 
or a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified bytime to first relapse/refractory  disease (early 
[<18 m onths] or l ate [≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) , as appropriate .  
Corresponding odds ratios and their 2- sided 80% and 95% CIs comparing the groups will 
also b e presented.  The individual treatment group ORRs will also be calculated along with 
exact 95% confidence intervals using the Clopper and Pearson method .
8.7.1.6.3 EXPLORATORY EFFICACY ANALYSES
Median DOR among responders for each arm will be presented along with it s corresponding 
2-sided 95% CIs.  Di sease Control  Rate (DCR) and CBR will be calculated with exact 
95% CIs using the Clopper and Pearson method.  The differences of the above rates between 
2groups and corresponding two -sided 95% CIs will be calculated respect ively.

Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be co llected (if availabl e) for assessment of m utations and 
other genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and 
progression of cancer as well as for potential use in diagnostic development.
Data obtained fro m the pharmacodynamic samples will be used for research.  The 
pharmacodynamic samples will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an 
individual subject does not currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and 
protein) m ay be stored for up to 15 y ears to assist in any  research scient ific questions related 
to lenvatinib and for potential diagnostic development.  If the subject reaches 18 y ears of age 
prior to the date of final sample analyses they  will be reconsented.  No further analyses will 
be perform ed on these colle cted samples from  subjects who ei ther do not reconsent after their 
18th birthday or cannot be reached for reconsent ing and the sample will be destroyed.  When

PROCEDURES)
10.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically  
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory  authori ties as well  asadditional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way  prevent any  immediate 
action from being ta ken by  the invest igator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving 
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the invest igator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for saf ety reasons to 
elimin ate an immediate hazard to the subjects , the sponsor’s medical mo nitorand the 
IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the healt h or 
regul atory  authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study  may not requi re 
submissio n to health or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory  
authori ty and IRB /IEC (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) shoul d 
be kept inform ed of such changes as required by  local regulati ons.  In these cases, the 
sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) detailing such changes.
10.2 Adhere nce to the Protocol
The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
10.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s.  Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator (or if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) will allow the CRA to inspe ct the 
clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy facilit ies to assure com pliance wi th GCP and l ocal 
regul atory  requi rements.  The CRFs and subject’s corresponding original medical records 
(source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s re presentatives at 
regul ar intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in 
accordance with local regulat ions.  All records at the site are subject to inspect ion by the 
local audi ting agency  and to IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to,
the following :
Clinic, office, or hospital charts

these images are stored, including micro fiche and photographic negatives
Pain, qualit y of life, or m edical history  questionnaires completed by  subjects
Records of telephone contacts
Diaries or eval uation checklists
Drug distribut ion and accountabilit y logs maintained in ph armacies or by  research 
personnel
Laboratory  resul ts and other laboratory  test outputs (eg, urine pregnancy test result

Correspondence regarding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or memoranda 
sent to the IRBs/IECs
CRF co mponents (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source
Electronic Pat ient-Reported Outcome by self-reported m easures
10.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as the source document.  Any  correcti on to entri es 
made on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction isdated, the 
individual making the correct is ident ified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only  data requi red by  the protocol  for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
10.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  
10.6 Retention of Records
The circumstances of com pletion or terminat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution or the desi gnated 
representative) is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but no t limited to 
the protocol, copies of CRFs, the Invest igator ’s Brochure, and regulatory agency registration 
docum ents (eg, Form FDA 1572 for US sites), Investigator and Site Information Form  (for 
non-US si tes), ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence). The site s hould plan to retain study

study .
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the inves tigator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of  perm anent ly retaining the study  records.
10.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent conducts audi ts of clinical research activit ies in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regul ations.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study  or 
after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
10.8 Handling of Study Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a desi gnated pharm acist) by  
the sponsor.  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) 
and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug labels.  The invest igator (or a 
designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which must be given to the sponsor 
at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug di spensed to 
each subject must be available for inspect ion at any t ime.  The CRA will visit the site and 
review these documents along with a ll other study  conduct docum ents at appropri ate 
intervals once study  drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug lab els or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug l abels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form 
to the sponsor’s CRA (or desi gnated contractor) or, when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.
10.9 Publication of Results
All manuscripts, abstracts, or othe r modes of presentati on arising fro m the resul ts of the 
study  must be reviewed and approved in writ ing by the sponsor in advance of submissio n 
pursuant to the terms and condit ions set forth in the executed Clinical Trial Agreement 
between the sponsor/CRO a nd the inst itution/investi gator.  The review is aimed at protecting 
the sponsor's proprietary  informat ion exist ing eit her at the date of the commencement of the

a child
2= The testes and scrotum are bigger.  The skin of the scrotum has changed.  The scrotum, the 
sack ho lding the testes, has g otten l ower.  The penis has gotten only a litt le bigger.
3= The penis has grown in length.  The testes and scrotum have grown and dropped lower.
4= The penis has gotten even bigger.  It is sider.  The glans (the head of the penis) is bigger.  The 
scrotum  is darker than before. It is bigger because the testes are bigger.
5= The penis, scrotum, and testes are the size and shape o f an adult man.
Pubic Hair:
1= There i s no pubi c hai r at all .
2= There i s a litt le soft, long, light ly-colored hair. Most of the hai r is at the base of the penis.
This hair may  be strai ght or a litt le curly.
3= The hair is darker in this stage. It is more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a bigger 
area.
4= the hair is now as dark, curly , and course as that of an adult man.  The area that the hair 
covers i s not as bi g as that of an adult man.  The hair has NOT spread out to the legs.
5= The hair has spread out to the legs.  The hair is now like that of an adult man. It covers the 
same area as that of an adult man.

FINAL: 09 Mar 2020Confidential Page 117of 121Appendix 11 Pharmacodynamic, and Other Biomarker Research
Subjects enro lled in this clinical study will have biologic samples collected for 
pharmacodynamic (PD), and other bio marker analysis.  These samples may be u sed f or 
discovery  or validat ion to i dentify biomarkers that may be used for exploratory  evaluati on of  
response and/or safet y-related outcomes as well as for use in diagnost ic development.
Collect ion of the PD, and other bio marker samples will be bound by t he sample principles and 
processes outlined in the main study  protocol .  Sample collect ion for PD, and other bio marker 
analysis is required as per the study  protocol  unless the collect ion and use o f the sam ples is 
prohibited by specific country  laws.
Sampl e Collection and Handling
The samples will be co llected according to the study  flow chart.  If, for operational or medical 
reasons, the genomic DNA blood sample cannot be obtained at the prespecified visit, the sample 
can be taken at any  study  center vi sitat the di scret ion of the invest igator and site staff.
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or RNA extraction, genoty ping, sequencing, or other 
analysis will be performed by a laborato ry under the di rection of  the sponsor.  Processing, 
analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory  facility to protect the validit y of 
the data and maintain subject privacy.
Samples will  only be used for the purposes described in this proto col.  Laboratori es contracted to 
perform  the analysis on behalf of the sponsor will not retain rights to the samples bey ond those 
necessary  to perform  the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell those samples.  The 
sponsor will not sell the sample s to a thi rd party .
Samples will  be stored for up to 15 y ears after the complet ion of the study  (defined as 
submissio n of the clinical study  report to the appropriate regulatory  agencies).  At the end of the 
storage peri od, sam ples will  be destroy ed.  Sam ples m ay be stored l onger if a healt h authorit y (or 
medicinal product approval agency ) has active questi ons about the study .  In this special 
circumstance, the sam ples will  be stored until the questions have been adequately  addressed.
It is possible that future research and technological advances may ident ify geno mic variants of 
interest, or allow alternat ive types of geno mic analysis not foreseen at this t ime.  Because it is 
not possible to prospectively define every  avenue of future t esting, all samples collected will be 
single or double coded (according to the ICH E15 guidelines) in order to maintain subject 
privacy . 
Right to Withdraw
If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her consent 
forparticipation in this research, Eisai will destroy the samples.  Information fro m any assays

necessary  to protect the integri ty of the research project.
Subj ect Privacy and Return of Data
No subj ect-ident ifying informat ion (eg, init ials, date of birth, government identifying number) 
will be associated with the sample.  All PD and other bio marker samples will be single coded.  
Geno mic DNA samples used to explor e the effects on PK, treatm ent response, and safet y will be 
single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be stored for long -term use (defined as 15 y ears 
after the com pletion of the study ) will be doubl e coded.  Doubl e coding invo lves remo ving the 
initial code (subject ID) and replacing wit h another code such that the subject can be re -
ident ified by use of 2 code keys.  The code key s are usually held by different parties.  The key  
linking the sample ID to the subject number will be maintained separately fro m the sam ple.  At 
this point, the samples will be double -coded, the first code being the subject number.  Laboratory  
personnel performing genetic analysis will not have access to the “key.”  Clinical data collected 
as part of the clinical study will be cle aned of subject i dentifying informat ion and linked by use 
of the sam ple ID “key.”
The sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidentialit y is 
maintained as far as possible.  Data from subjects enro lled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless o f location of  collect ion.
The sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organi zations involved in the conduct or oversight of this research.  These include:
Clinical research organi zations retained by the sponsor 
Independent ethics commit tees or institutional review boards that have responsibilit y for this 
research study  
National regulatory  authori ties or equivalent government agencies
At the end of the analysis, results may  be pre sented in a final report which can include part or all 
of the coded data, in list ing or summary format.  Other publicat ion (eg, in peer -reviewed 
scientific journals) or public presentation of the study  resul ts will only  include summaries of the 
popul ation in the study , and no i dentified individual  resul ts will be disclosed.
Given the research nature of the PD, and other biomarker analysis, it will not be possible to 
return individual data to subjects.  The results that may be generated are not currently ant icipated 
to have clinical relevance to the patients or their family  members.  Therefore, these results will 
not be di sclosed to the pati ents or thei r physicians.
If at any  time, PD, and/or other bio marker results are obtained that may have clinical relevan ce, 
IRB review and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate manner of disclo sure 
and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Am endments 
(CLIA) -certified setting will be required.  Sharing of research dat a with individual patients

Study Design
E7080- G000 -230 is a multicenter, randomi zed, open -label, parallel -group, Phase 2 study to compare 
the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus ifosfamide 
and etoposide in children, adolescents ,and young adults with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma .  
Approximately 72eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of the following 2 treatment arms in a 1:1 
ratio within the strata :
Arm A:  lenvatinib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (intravenously 
[IV], Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and etopos ide 100 mg/m2/day 
(IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)
Arm B:  ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 
5cycles) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 
cycles)
Randomization will follow a pred efined randomization scheme based on the following stratification 
factors: time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 m onths]) and age 
(<18 and ≥18 years).  
Eisai will close ly monitor enrolment , to ensure that at least 32 subjects <18 years of age at the time of 
informed consent are randomized .  
The study will be conducted in 3 Phases: a Prerandomization Phase, a Randomization Phase , and an 
Extension Phase.  
ThePrerandomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Screening and Baseline .The 
Prerandomization Phase will last no longer than 28 days .The Screening Period will establish 
protocol eligibility and the Baseline Period will confirm eligibility. 
The Randomization Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -up Period . The 
Randomization Phase will begin at the time of randomization of the first subject and will end on the 
data cut off date for the PFS- 1y and OS -1y analysis.  After the data cutoff date for the PFS-1y and 
OS-1y has occurred, all subjects who are still on study treatment will enter the Extension Phase. 
Data cutoff (for PFS-1yand OS-1yanalysis ) will occur when the last subject has completed 
18cycles of treatment or discontinues before the end of Cycle 18, whichever occurs first. 
The Treatment Period for each subject will begin at the time of randomization and will end at the 
completion of the Off -Treatment Visit which will occur within 30 days after the final dose of study 
treatment   
Subjects will receive study treatment as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatment arms . Treatment 
cycles will be counted continuously regardless of dose interruptions . If chemotherapy administration 
is precluded on Day 1 of a treatment cycle, the subject may resume treatment once recovered at the 
discretion of investigator .Subsequent chemotherapy will be administered every 21 (±1) days starting 
from the timepoint it was resumed.
Subjects will undergo safety and efficacy assessments as defined in the Schedule of 
Procedures/Assessments.  Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib until 
disease progression (PD) confirmed by IIR, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, 
withdrawal of consent, or study termination by the sponsor , whichever occurs first .
Disease progression (PD) must be confirmed by IIR prior to the investigator discontinuing study 
treatment for a subject.  In situat ions wher e the investigator judges that alternative treatments must be

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 4of 119instituted immediately for a subject’ s safety, study drug smay be discontinued without waiting for IIR
confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  If possible, before discontinuation of the subject from 
the study, the investigator should consult with the sponsor.
The Follow -upPeriod begins the day after the Off -Treatment Visit and will continue as long as the 
subject is alive , unless the subject withdraws consent ,or the sponsor termi nates the study.  
Subjects may at any time withdraw consent for further study participation.  No further data will be 
collected on subjects once consent has been withdrawn, however, an investigator may consult public 
records to establish survival status i f permitted by local regulations .
All adverse events ( AEs)will be captured for 30 days afte r the last dose of study drug.  
All subjects who disconti nue study treatment early for reasons other than PD, will continue to 
undergo tumor assessments every 6weeks until Week 18, then every 9 weeks until Week 54, 
thereafter, every 12 weeks until confirmation of disease progression by IIR as described in the tumor 
assessments in the assessment schedule ,or until another anticancer therapy is initiated .
Subject sin both Arm A and Arm B will be followed for survival every 12 weeks (±1 week ) and all 
subsequent anticancer treatments received will be recorded.  Subjects who are being followed for 
survival at the time of data cutoff for the for PFS -1y and OS -1y analys is(ie, at the end of the 
Randomization Phase) will continue to be followed for survival during the Follow -up Period of the 
Extension Phase .
Extension Phase :  The Extension Phase will consist of 2 periods: Treatment Period and Follow -up 
Period.  
In the Treatment Period , subjects still on lenvatinib in Arm  Afollowing the completion of the 
PFS-1y and OS -1y analysis (ie, at the end of the Randomization Phase) will continue to receive 
lenvatinib in 21 -day cycles until disease progression, development of una cceptable toxicity, subject 
request, withdrawal of consent, or discontinuation of study by the sponsor .  Tum or assessments will 
be performed according to the local standard of care .  Independent imaging review (IIR)review and 
confirmation of radiographic evidence of PDwill not be required ,and scans will no longer be 
required to besent to the imaging core laboratory ( ICL) .  The Off -Treatment Visit will occur within 
30days after the final dose of study treatment. All AEs will be captured up to 30days after last dose 
of study drug.   In case the study is discontinued by the sponsor, the sponsor will continue to provide 
study drug (outside the study) for subjects requiring continuation of treatment. 
The Follow -up Period will begin the day after th e Off -Treatment Visit and will lastuntil death or for 
2years after end of treatment for a subject, unless the study is terminated by the sponsor , or the 
subject discontinues due to withdrawal of consent , or is lost to follow -up.  Subjects will be treated by 
the investigator according to the prevailing local standard of care. Subjects will be followed every 
12weeks (±1week) for survival and all subsequent anticancer treatments received will be recorded.   
The definition of end of the study, as required by certain regulatory agencies, will be the date of data 
cutoff for the final analysis or the time of last subject last visit, whichever occurs later.
Number of Subjects
Approximately 72 subjects will be randomised (36 subjects in each arm).
For the primary endpoint (intent –to-treat analysis) , at least 32subjects 18 years old (at the time of 
informed consent )will be randomized .

Study Treatment s
Body surface area (BSA) will be used to determine the amount of study drugs admi nistered, and must 
be calculated on Day 1 of each cycle based on the subject ’scurrent height and body weight. The 
dose should be rounded to the nearest whole number. 
Test Arm  (Arm A) :Lenvatinib + Ifosfamide + Etoposide
Lenvatinib 14 mg/m2, orally administered once daily in each 21 -day cycle.
Lenvatinib isprovided as hard capsules containing 1 mg, 4 mg, or 10 mg lenvatinib. An 
extemporaneous suspension of lenvatinib capsules should be used for subjects unable to swallow 
capsules. After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose cannot exceed 24 mg QD.
Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day, IV, for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), every 21 days, for a maximum 
of 5cycles.
Etoposide 100 mg/m2/day, IV, for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3) , every 21 days, for a maximum o f 
5cycles. 
Treatment with lenvatinib will continue in 21 -day cycles after chemotherapy is discontinued, until 
disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, subject request, withdrawal of consent, or 
discontinuation of study by the sponsor .
In case the study is discontinued by the sponsor, the sponsor will continue to provide study drug 
(outside the study) for subjects requiring continuation of treatment.
Control Arm  (Arm B):  Ifosfamide + Etoposide
Ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day, IV, daily for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), every 21 days, for a 
maximum of 5cycles.
Etoposide 100 mg/m2/day, IV, daily for 3 consecutive days (Day 1 to 3), every 21 days, for a 
maximum of 5cycles.
Duration of Treatment
A subject will remain on study treatment until 1 or more of the following events occur(s):
Progressive disease (as confirmed by IIR)
Unacceptable toxicity
Subject request
Withdrawal of consent 
Termination of the study  by the Sponsor
Concomitant Drug/Therapy
Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs
Subjects should not receive other antitumor therapies while on study .If a subject receives additional 
antitumor therapies other than the study drug(s), such as chemotherapy, targeted therapies, 
immunotherapy, or antitumor interventions -such as surgery or palliative radiotherapy (other than as 
described below), this will be judged to represent evidence of disease progression, and continuation 
of the study medication and further participation in the study must be discussed and agreed upon with 
the sponsor .  
For further information on the prohibited concomitant therapies for ifosfamide andetoposide, please 
refer to the respective prescribing i nformation.
Granulocyte -colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF)may be used to mitigate the toxicity of ifosfamide

The following concomitant treatments/procedures are allowed:
a.Removal of existing (not new) osteosarcoma lesion ( eg, surgical, radiofrequency ablation,
cryotherapy, thermoablation, stereotaxic ratiotherapy ,etc.) after completion of the Week 18 
tumor assessment .  Subjects in Arm A in the presence of clinical benefit, may continue treatment 
with lenvatinib after protocol permissible surgery .
b.Palliative radiotherapy is allowed for ≤2 significantly symptomatic nontarget lesions . 
If a subject receiving treatment with lenvatinib requires surgery during the study, the stop time and 
restart time of lenvatinib should be as follows:
•For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at least 
2days after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
•For major procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery and then 
restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence of adequate healing and no risk of bleeding.
Any additional procedural or subject specific particularities should be discussed with the sponsor.   
Assessm ents
Efficacy Assessments
Tumor assessment will be performed based on RECIST 1.1. Investigator –deter mined response 
assessments will be performed at each assessment time point and entered onto the case report form 
(CRF ). Copies of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to an imaging core laboratory ( ICL)
designated by the sponsor for efficacy assessment and for confirmation of PD.  Tumor assessmen ts 
will be carried out following the guidelines provided by the ICL.  
During the Screening Period, t umor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of 
known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed within 28 days prior to C ycle1
Day1.  A brain scan ( CT scan with contrast or MRI pre -and post -gadolinium) will be performed at 
screening as clinically indicated, and thereafter during the study as clinically indicated.  Historical 
CT or MRI scans performed within 28 days prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 may be used as screening scans 
(baseline scans) to demonstrate eligibility, as long as they meet minimum standards as separately 
defined by the ICL.  
Tumor assessments will then be performed every 6weeks ±1 week following the start of treatment 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 during the chemotherapy treatment period until Week 18.  Following completion of 
the chemotherapy treatment period (ie,after Week 18) , the frequency of tumor assessments wi ll be 
every9 weeks ±1 week until Week 54 ±1 week.  Thereafter, they wil l be performed every 12 weeks 
±2 weeks until documentation of PD (please see schedule of assessments for details) .  At any point, 
the CT /MRI scan should be performed earlier than the scheduled time point, if clinically indicated.  
After data cutoff for PFS-1y and OS -1yanalysis , tumor assessments should beperformed following 
the prevailing local standard of care.
Disease progression per RECIST 1.1 during the randomization phase must be confirmed by IIR prior 
to the investigator discontinuing study treatment.
In the event that the investigator considers alternative treatments must be instituted immediately for 
management of urgent medical complications of PD, study drugs may be discontin ued without 
waiting for independent confirmation of radiographic evidence of PD.  Subjects who discontinue 
study treatment without PD will continue to undergo tumor assessments according to the schedule 
until PD is documented or another anticancer therapy is initiated. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Blood samples for plasma concentrations of lenvatinib will be collected from all subjects from 
Page 278 of 388

Eisai
FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 10of 119ArmA only as described in the Schedule of Assessments.
Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Assessments
Pharmacodynam ic serum and archived fixed tumor tissue samplesfor biomarker analysis will be 
collected from subjects randomized to Arm A only, as descri bed in the Schedule of Assessments.  
Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor biomarkers assessed in this study will be based on those
identified in other lenvatinib clinical studies.  Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be 
performed as described in a separateanalysis plan. 
Safety Assessments
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording all adverse events (AEs), including all 
grades per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v5.0(for both increasing and decreasing 
severity), and serious adverse events (SAEs); regular laboratory e valuation for hematology, blood 
chemistry, and urine values; periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and physical 
examinations.
Progression of osteosarcoma and signs and symptoms clearly related to the progression of the 
osteosarcoma should not be ca ptured as an AE .  Disease progression is a study endpoint and should 
be captured in the CRF as per the guidelines for reporting disease progression.
Other Assessments
HRQoL assessment will be performed per the Schedule of Assessments.   Impact of treatment on 
HRQoL will be assessed using the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer Module).  
Bioanalytical Methods
Lenvatinib in plasma will be quantified using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) method .  Pharmacodynamic biomarker analysis will be performed as 
described in aseparate ana lysis plan.  Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at qualified local 
laboratories.
Statistical Methods
Primary Endpoint
PFS-4m rate (progression- free survival rate at 4 m onths) by IIR is defined as the percentage 
of subjects who are alive and without PD at 4 months from the randomization date as determined 
by IIR of radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1.  The PFS -4m rate is estimated on the full 
analysis set for this study using the K -M method.  
Secondary Endpoints
PFS-1y rate (progression -free survival rate at 1 year) by IIR is defined as the percentage of 
subjects who are alive and without PD at 1 year from the randomization date as determined by 
IIRof rad iological imaging using RECIST 1.1.  The PFS -1y rate is estimated on the full analysis 
set for this study using the K -M method.  
Progression -free survival (PFS) by IIR is defined as the time from the date of randomization to 
the date of the first document ation of PDor death (whichever occurs first) as determined by IIR 
using RECIST 1.1.  
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death 
from any cause.  Subjects who are lost to follow -up and those who are al ive at the date of data 
cutoff will be censored at the date the subject was last known alive, or date of data cutoff, 
whichever occurs first.  Overall survival rate at 1 year will be estimated.
Objective response rate (ORR) by IIR at 4 months is defined as the proportion of subjects who 
have best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by 
IIR using RECIST 1.1 within the first 4 months.

Module.  Scores will be calculated for total generic score, total cancer score, each physi cal 
function subscale including physical health, psychosocial health, emotional function, social 
function, school/work function in the Generic Core Scales, and each subscales in the cancer 
module.   
Palatibility and acceptability of the suspension formulation of lenvatinib in subjects receiving the 
suspension formulation in the study will be assessed using the Palatability Questionnaire (see 
Appendix 5 ).
Exploratory Endpoints
Duration of response (DOR) by IIR is defined as the time from the date a response was first 
documented until the date of the first documentation of PDor date of death from any case .
Disease control rate (DCR) by IIR is the proportion of subjects who have abest overall 
response of CR or PR or stable disease (SD).  In this context, stable disease is defined as stable 
disease at ≥7weeks after randomization to be considered best overall response.
Clini cal benefit rate (CBR) by IIR is the proportion of subjects who have best overall response 
of CR or PR or durable SD (duration of SD ≥23 weeks after randomization).
Proportion of subjects who achieve complete removal of baseline lesions following completion 
of chemotherapy.
Blood and tumor biomarkers will be assessed for identifying potential correlation with clinical 
outcomes -related endpoints.
All efficacy endpo ints listed above (except OS) evaluated based on invest igator 
assessment using RECIST 1.1.
Analysis Sets
The Full Analysis Set (Inten t-to-Treat Analysis [ITT]) includes all randomized subjects regardless
ofthe treatment actually received. This is the primary analysis population used for theefficacy 
analyses which will be based on the ITTprinciple.
The Per Protocol Analysis Set includes those subjects from theITT setwho received at least 1 dose 
ofanystudy drug , had no major protocol deviations and had both baseline and at least one 
postbaseline tumor assessment. Subjects for whom dea th occurred prior to the first postbaseline 
tumor assessment will also be included . The per protocol analysis set will be the secondary analysis 
set for efficacy endpoints .
The Safety Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1 dose of anystudy drug. This is 
the analys is population used for all safety analyses which will be based on as -treated principle.
Population Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set includes t he subjects who have received at least 1
dose of lenvatinib with documented dosin g history and have measurable plasma levels of lenvatinib .
The Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set includes subjects who received at least 1dose of study drug 
and had sufficient pharmacodynamic data (eg, at least 1 evaluable/measurable pharmacodynamic
parameter).
The HRQoL Analysis Set will consist of all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose 
of study medication, and have completed at least 1 patient- reported outcome (PRO) assessment 
beyond baseline.  For PRO analysis, subjects will be a nalyzed as randomized and not according to 
treatment actually received.

Eisai
FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 12of 119Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the Full Analysis Set.
All the statistical analysis will be conducted at the PFS-1y/OS- 1y analysis data cutoff date (ie, 
when the last subject has completed 18 cycles of treatment or discontinues before the end of 
Cycle 18, whichever occurs first ), including the an alysis of PFS -4mrate.  Additional follow -up 
analysis will be basedon th e date of data cutoff for the additiona l follow -up analysis for OS or at the 
time of last subject last visit, whichever occurs later.   
Primary Analysis
The primary analysis of PFS -4m rate will be based upon data provided by IIR of tumor assessments.  
PFS-4m rate and their Greenwood standard errors will be evaluated using the K -M estimates from 
both treatment groups.  The statistical significance of the difference in the 2 K -M PFS -4m rates 
comparing lenvatinib + chemotherapy agent ( TestArm) vs. chemotherapy agent alone (Control Arm) 
will be tested using a 2 -sided 80% CI.This 2-sided 80% CI and a p-value will be constructed using 
the difference of these 2 K -M PFS -4m rates and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors. 
Statistical significance of the differ ence is declared if the CI is entirely above 0. This is equivalent to 
a test using a 1 -sided test at alpha=0.1 .The 2-sided 95% CIs will also be provided for descriptive 
purpose s.PFS-4m rate will also be analyzed us ing a binomial approach as a sensitivity analysis by 
excluding subjects whose PFS arecensor ed prior to 18 weeks .
Secondary Analyses
PFS-1y rate will be analyzed using the same methods as the primary efficacy analysis. PFS 
censoring rules will follow FDA guidance of 2007, however, removal of baseline lesions after 
completion of Week 18 without progression is not a trigger for PFS censoring after 18 weeks (refer to 
Concomitant Drug/Therapy –allowed concomitant treatment/ procedures) .
Overall survival (OS) will be compared between treatment arm and control arm using the stratified 
logrank test with time to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) 
and age (<18 or≥18 years) as strata.   Media n OS with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs will be calculated 
using K -M product -limit estimates for each treatment arm ,and the K-M estimates of OS will be 
plotted over time. The Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% 
and 95% CIsstratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or late 
[≥18months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) .  K-M estimates will also be presented for 4, 6, 9 ,and 
12months with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs.
Median PFS and 2- sided 80% and 95% (as exploratory) CIs will be presented ,and the K -M estimates 
of PFS will be plotted over time. The Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio 
and its 80% and 95% CIsstratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disease (early [<18 months] or 
late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) .  Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates will also be presented 
for 4, 6, 9, and 12 months with 2 -sided 80% and 95% CIs.
The ORR will be compared between the t estand control groups using either a chi -square test or a 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified bytime to first relapse/refractory disease (early 
[<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) , as appropriate .  Corresponding odds 
ratios and their 2-sided 80% and 95 %CIs comparing the groups will also be presented.   The 
individual treatment g roup ORRs will also be calculated along with exact 95% confidence intervals 
using the Clopper and Pearson method.
Exploratory Analys es
Median DOR among responders for each arm will be presented along with its corresponding 2 -sided 
95% CIs. Disease Control Rate (DCR) and CBR will be calculated with exact 95% CIsusing the 
Clopper and Pearson method. The differ ences of the above rates bet ween 2groups and 
corresponding two -sided 95% CIs will be calculated respectively.

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 13of 119Pharmacodynamic and Other Biomarker Analyses
Pharmacodynamic, and other biomarker analyses may be performed and reported separately.  Details 
of these analyses may be descri bed in a separate analysis plan.
Blood serum samples may be analyzed using global proteomic methods, enzyme -linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex bead -based immunoassay, or other assays/methods and 
new technology in an effort to identify biomarkers . 
Archived, fixed tumor tissue will be collected (if available) for assessment of mutations and other 
genetic alterations or proteins that may be important in the development and progression of cancer as 
well as for potential use in diagnostic development .
Data obtained from the pharm acodynam icsamples will be used for research.  The pharmacodynamic
samples will not be used to determine or predict risks for diseases that an individual subject does not 
currently have.  Any sample or derivatives (DNA, RNA, and protein) may be stored for up to 
15years to assist in any research scientific questions rela ted to lenvatinib and for potential diagnostic 
development.  If the subject reaches 18 years of age prior to the date of final sample analyses they 
will be reconsented.  No further analyses will be performed on these collected samples from subjects 
who eit her do not reconsent after their 18th birthday or cannot be reached for reconsenting and the 
sample will be destroyed.  When the subject reaches the age of 18 years (or 16 years in the UK) while 
on the study, and becomes competent to give informed consent, his/her consent will be obtained 
using separate infor med consent forms (ICFs) to continue on the study.
Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Lenvatinib concentration versus time data will be tabulated and summarized and graphically 
presented.
Lenvatinib data from ArmA of the study will be pooled with available data from other studies and 
subjected to population PK analysis.  The PK model will be parameterized in terms of clearance and 
volume of distribution. Details of the population PK analysis will be provided in a separate analysis 
plan. 
Other Analyses
Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL ):
The PedsQL for all subject s(self -and proxy- rating) will be collected atbaseline, at C2D1, C3D1, 
Week 18 , C8D1 ,C18 D1 , and at the Off -Treatment visit .
Interim Analyses
No i nterim analysis is planned for this study.
The safety monitoring will be conducted by the independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC) .
The frequency of safety reviews will be defined in the IDMC charter. Minutes from the open 
meetings of the IDMC will be provided if requested by regulatory agencies. The recommendation 
whether to stop the study for safety will be reached by the IDMC based on their review of safety data 
with treatment information. The function and membership of the IDMC will be described in the 
IDMC charter.
Sample Size Rationale
A binomial -based comparison of 2 proportions using correction for continuity was used for sample 
size estimation.  A total sample size of 72 subjects is estimated to achieve 80% statistical power at 
1-sided alpha of 0.1 to detect a difference of 30% based on the assumption that PFS -4m for Ar m A 
(lenvatinib arm) is 55% and for Arm B is 25%.  Alpha is the type 1 error probability of declaring 
lenvatinib arm being effective when the true lenvatini b arm  PFS -4m rate is only 25%.

4.1 Institutional Review Boards/Independent Ethics Committees
The protocol, informed consent form (ICF) /assen t, and appropriate related documents must 
be reviewed and approved by  an Inst itutional Review Board ( IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) constituted and funct ioning in accordance with theInternational Council 
for Harm onisat ion of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceut icals for Hum an Use ( ICH) E6 
(Good Clinical Pract ice), Secti on3, and any  local regul ations(eg, European Unio n [EU] 
Clinical Trials Direct ive 2001/20/E C or Code of Federal Regulat ions, Ti tle 21 CFR Part 56) .  
Any protocol amendment or revisio n to the ICF will be resubmitted to the IRB/IEC for 
review and approval, except for changes involving only logist ical or administrative aspects of 
the study  (eg, change in clinical research associate(s) [CRAs], change of telephone 
number[s]).  Documentation of IRB/IEC compliance with the ICH E6 and any local 
regul ations regarding const itution and review conduct will be provided to the sponsor.
Docum ented study  approval  from the IRB/IEC chairman must be sent to the principal 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution) w ith a copy  to the 
sponsor before study  start and the release of any study  drug to the si te by  the sponsor or i ts 
designee (ICH E6, Section 4.4).  If the IRB/IEC decides to suspend or terminate the study , 
the invest igator (or if regio nally  requi red, the head of the m edical inst itution)will 
immediately  send the noti ce of study  suspensi on or terminat ion by the IRB/IEC t o the 
sponsor.
Study  progress i s to be reported to IRB/IECs annually  (or as requi red) by the investigator or 
sponsor, depending on local regulatory  obligat ions.  If the invest igator is required to report to 
the IRB/IEC, he/she will forward a copy  to the sp onsor at the time of each periodic report.  
The invest igator (s) or the sponsor will submit, depending on local regulations, periodic 
reports and inform the IRB/IEC of any  reportabl eadverse events (AEs) per ICH guidelines 
and local IRB/IEC standards of pra ctice.  Upon complet ion of the study , the invest igator will 
provi de the IRB/IEC with a brief report of the outcome of the study , if requi red.
At the end of the study , the sponsor should notify  the IRB/IEC and Com petent Authori ty 
(CA) within 90 days.  The d efinit ion of the end of the study  is the date of the data cutoff for 
the final analysis or last subject/last visit, including discont inuat ion from the study  for any  
reason, whichever occurs later.
In the case of early terminat ion/tem porary  halt of the stud y, the invest igator should notify the 
IRB/IEC and CA wit hin 15 calendar days, and a detailed written explanat ion of the reasons 
for the terminat ion/halt shoul d be given.
4.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
This study  will be conducted in accordance wit h standard operating procedures of the

4.3 Subject Information and Informe d Consent
As part of administering the informed consent document, the invest igator must explain to 
each subject or guardian ,in accordance wit h applicable professio nal standards and local 
laws/regulat ions or legally acceptable representati ve,the nature of the study , its purpose, the 
procedures invo lved, the expected duration, the potential risks and benefits invo lved, any 
potenti al discomfort, potenti al alternat ive procedure (s) or course (s) of treatment available to 
the subject, and the extent of maintaini ng confidenti ality of the subject’s records.  Each 
subject and the legally authorized representative must be informed that participation in the 
study  is vol untary , that he/she may withdraw from the study  at any  time, and that wi thdrawal  
of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical treatment or relat ionship with the 
treating physician.
This informed consent should be given by means of a standard written statement, written in 
nontechnical language.  The subject or the subject’s legally acceptable rep resentative shoul d 
understand the statement before signing and dating it and will be given a copy  of the si gned 
docum ent.  If a subject is unable to read or if a legally  accep table representative is unable to 
read, an impartial wit ness should be present during the ent ire informed consent discussio n.  
In countri es where specific laws for children are established for informed consent, those local 
laws will be applied.  A fter the ICF and/or assent form and any  other wri tten inform ation to 
be provided to subjects is read and explained to the subject or the subject’s legally accep table
representative, and after the subject or the subject’s legally accep table representative has 
orally  cons ented to the subject’s participation in the study  and, if capable of doing so, has 
signed and personally  dated the ICF and/or assent form , the wi tness shoul d sign and 
personally date the consent form.  The subje ct and/or the subject’s parent(s) or legally 
authori zed representative(s) will be asked to sign an ICF and/or assent form before any  study -

6INTRODUCTION
6.1 Osteosarcoma
Cancer i s a rel atively unco mmo n diagnosis in the pediatric popul ation, and the overall 
incidence is low (18.6 cases per 100,000 children [ Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ]).  Solid tumors 
constitute approximately  60% of  childhood m alignancies ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019 ).  
Malignant bone tumors are the fifth most comm on solid tum or ty pe account ing for about 5% 
of childhood tumors ( Howl ader, et al ., 2019; Kaatsch, 2010 ). 
Osteosarcoma is the most commo nly diagnosed primary  malignancy of the bone in children 
and y oung adul ts, and accounts for approximately 5% of childhoo d tum ors, with an estimated
annual incidence of 4.4 cases per 1 millio n in people younger than 24 years ( Mirabello, et al., 
2009 ).  Osteosarcoma occurs predominant ly in adolescents and y oung adul ts.  The m edian 
age at diagnosis is 20 y ears, wi th the incide nce peaking at 15 to 19 years of age (ESMO, 
guidelines, 2014 ).  According to the Amer ican Cancer Society , osteosarcoma in this age

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 26of 119There are both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that have been shown to contribute to the 
development of osteosarcoma. Studies have demonstrated that several genetic abnorm alities, 
including the overexpressio n of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 
(VEGFR) ,platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor (PDGFR), and c-fos, are
associ ated wi th the development of osteosarcoma in laboratory  models as well  as humans 
(Gorlick and Khanna, 2010 ).  However, osteosarcoma is not characterized by a single 
oncogenic driver .  The vast majorit y of abnorm al oncogenes and tum or-suppressor genes 
associ ated wi th osteosarcom a are also comm on in the m ost prevalent cancers ( Gorlick and 
Khanna, 2010).  Extrinsic factors such as ionizing radi ation, which is used forthe treatment 
of childhood solid tumors ,havebeen well implicated in the development of a second 
malignancy, with osteosarcoma being the most likely to develop within the first 2 decades 
following treatm ent (Le Vu, et al., 1988 ).
The m anagement of osteos arcoma is multimodal; pati ents not amenable to surgery  or pati ents 
at second or third relapse have a poor prognosis.  Metastatic osteosarcoma is commo n (10% 
to 20% ) (NCCN, Bone cancer guidelines, 2020 , Casali, et al., 2018 ),with the m ost frequent 
site being the lung (>85%).  In the case of iso lated lung metastases ,more than a third of 
patients wi th a second surgical remissio n survive for >5 y ears(Casali, et al., 2018 ).
Approximately  25% of  all pat ients with primary  metastati c osteosarcoma and >40% of those 
who achieve a complete surgical remissio n may becom e long-term survivors ( Casali , et al ., 
2018 )as compared with 65% to 70% of patients wit h localized disease ( Meazza and 
Scanagatta, 2016 ).
About 30% to 40% of patients with localized disease and 80% of those wi th metastati c 
disease experience relapse ( Casali, et al., 2018 ; NCCN, Bone cancer guidelines, 2020 ; 
Ferrari , 2003 ).  The presence of so litary metastasis, time to first relapse, and complete 
resectabilit y of disease at first recurrence are the m ost significant prognostic indicators for 
improved survival.  Patients whose tumor is not amenable to surgery , or wi th second or thi rd 
recurrence, or who have metastases to the bone, have a poor prognosis.   In general, despite 
second -line treatment, the pr ognosis of recurrent disease in osteosarcoma has remained poor, 
with long-term postrel apse survival of <20% (Casali, et al., 2018 ; NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 20 20).  
6.2 Current Therapeutic Options
There has been no substantial progress in the treatment of osteosarcom a since the 1980s . 
Current treatment utilizes mult i-agent chemotherapy  and surgi cal resecti on of  all clinically 
detectable disease.  
Treatment of New ly Diagnosed Disease
Newly diagnosed osteosarcoma is ty pically managed wi th neoadj uvant chem otherapy 
followed by surgical remo val of the primary  tumor and all clinically  evident m etastati c 
disease, fo llowed by  adjuvant chemotherapy .  Surgical resect ion of all clinically detect able 
sites of  disease is vital, regardless of number and site, as complete resection is predictive of 
Page 295 of 388

Eisai
FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 27of 119survival ( Meazza and Scanagatta, 2016 ).  For patients with unresectable disease at mult iple 
sites, experimental  therapy  is also consi dered, due to the poo r prognosis for these patients. 
The m ost effect ive chemotherapy regimens include the combinat ion of high -dose 
methotrexa te, doxorubicin, and cisplat in and has becom e the standard treatment for 
high-grade osteosarcoma ( Ferrari  and Serra, 2015; Isakoff, et al., 2015; NCCN Bone Cancer 
Guidelines, 20 20).
Treatment of Relapsed, Refractory, and Progressive Disease
Second- line treatment for relapsed disease consists of chemotherapy and/or surgical resect ion
(Casali, et al., 2018 ; NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines , 2020 ).The rol e of second -line 
chemotherapy for recurrent osteosarcoma is much less well defined than that of surgery ,and 
there is no accepted standard regimen ( Casali, et al., 2018 ).For pati ents wi th resectable 
solitary  metastasis to the lung, surgical re section only  may be adequate. For those with 
recurrent pulmo nary metastases that are resectable, surgery  is advised in addit ion to 
neoadj uvant or ad juvant chem otherapy , regardless of the number of previous lung relapses 
and the number of secondary  pulm onary lesions ( Briccoli, et al., 2005). Aggressive surgical 
resection o f metastases and the abilit y to achieve a second surgical remission have 
consistent ly been shown essential for long -term survival  following rel apse ( Kempf -Bielack ,
et al., 2005; Leary ,et al., 2013; Bacci ,et al., 200 5; Chou ,et al., 2005; Hawkins and Arndt , 
2003 ). 
As per the European Societ y for Medi cal Onco logy(ESMO) gui delines for bone sarcoma, 
treatm ent opti onsfor recurrent osteosarcoma include ifosfamide ±etoposi de ±carbopl atin, 
and other active drugs (Casali, et al., 2018 ).Preferred regimens for second -line therapy per 
the National  Com prehensive Cancer Network (NCCN )bone sarco ma guidelines include
ifosfamide (high dose) with or without etoposide, regorafenib , soraf enib, and sorafenib plus 
evero limus (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines , 2020 ).
In the event of subsequent relapse, the NCCN guidelines (NCCN Bone Cancer Guidelines ,
2020 )and ESMO guidelines ( Casali, et al., 2018 )strongly encourage participation in clinical 
studi es.  Otherwise, pati ents wi th disease progression or relapse after second -line therapy are 
managed wit h surgical resect ion, palliat ive radiotherapy , or best supportive care.
6.3 Lenvatinib
E7080 (l envat inib) is a potent multip le receptor ty rosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor (RTKI) that 
select ively inhibits VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 
(FLT4), in addit ion to other pro -angiogenic and oncogenic pathway -related RTKs, including 
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) 1-4, PDGF rece ptor al pha (PDGFRα), KIT, 
and RET.   Therefore, lenvat inib exerts it’s in vivo ant itumoural  activity based on m ultiple 
mechanisms invo lved in and through effects related to angiogenesis (including reversio n of 
resistance) and the tumor microenvironment, as well as direct inhibitory act ion on the tumour 
cells.   Recent studi es have also dem onstrated lenvatinib’s immunomodulatory act ivity in the 
tumor microenvironment.  This includes decreases in immunosuppressive tumor -associated

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 28of 119macrophages, activated cy totox ic T cell increases, and act ivation of interferon -gamma  
signaling.  These all contribute to lenvat inib’s ant itumor activit y in immunoco mpetent mice 
(Kato, et al., 2019; Kimura, et al., 2018 ).
6.3.1 Clinical Data on Lenvatinib in Combination with Ifosfamide and Etoposide
for Treatment of Relapsed or Refractory Osteosarcoma
The safet y, tolerabilit y and activit y of single -agent lenvat inib, and lenvat inib in co mbinat ion 
with chem otherapy  (ifosfamide and etoposide), have been assessed in E7080 -G000 -207 
(Study  207), aphase 1/2, mult icenter, open -label study in children ,adolescents and y oung 
adults withsolid tumors, including relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a, and
radioiodine -refractory  differentiated thy roid carcino ma. The recommended p hase 2 dose 
(RP2D) of lenvatinib was determined in the phase 1b portion as14 m g/m2orally once daily  
when given as single -agent as well as in co mbination with etoposide (100 m g/m2IVonce 
daily  for 3 days) + ifosfamide (3000 m g/m2IV once daily  for 3 day s), administered on day s 1
to 3 of each 21- day cycle, for 5 cycles. Safet y and efficacy is being assessed in the Phase 2 
porti on of  the study .
Data from Study  207 have shown that patients with osteosarcoma may benefit from treatment 
with lenvatinib. In the single agent expansi on cohort in rel apsed/refractory  osteosarcom a,
(n=31; Cohort 2B) , 9 of 28 evaluable pat ients (32.1%) achieved progression -free survival 
(PFS) at 4 months (PFS -4m) , median PFS was 3.0 mo nths (95% CI: 1.8, 5. 5). Two out of 
29subjects (6.9%)with measurable disease had a parti al response (PR) (Gaspar, et al., 2018 ).  
Amo ng the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set forthe single -agent lenvat inib 
expansio n cohort, the most commo n adverse events were: headache (48%), vomit ing (45%), 
decreased appet ite, diarrhea, and hypothy roidism  (42% each), proteinuria (39%), increased 
blood TSH, hy pertensio n, nausea, py rexia, and weig ht decreased (36% each).  Five subjects 
(16.1%) di scont inued treatment due to TEAEs ,and 8subjects (25.8%) reported TEAEs 
leading to study  drug dose reducti on.  There were no treatment -related fatal  TEAEs (Gaspar, 
et al., 2018 ).  
In a pool ed analysis o f subjects from Phase 1b and 2 receiving lenvat inib14 m g/m2in 
combinat ion with ifosfamide plus etoposi de (N=35; full analysis set ),the primary  efficacy 
endpo int, PFS -4 rate based on RECIST 1.1 by investi gator assessment, was 67.9% (95% CI: 
47.6, 84.1) . As of the data cutoff date of 23 Jul 2019, the object ive response rate (ORR) was 
12.5%, including 4 subjects with PR. Median PFS was 11.1 months (95% CI: 4.5, 12.6) , and 
median overall survival ( OS)was 16.3 months (95% CI: 12.6 , NE)(Gaspar, et al., 2019 ).
Overall t reatm ent wi th lenvat inibin co mbinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide in this 
patient popul ationwas associ ated wi th a manageable safet y profile , and no unexpected 
toxicities were observed .Among the 31 subjects included in the safet y analysis set,the most 
frequent treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were anemia ( 71%), nausea and 
vomiting (61% each), diarrhea (52%), neutropenia , platel et count decreased , and white blood 
cell count decreased (48%each).  The most common treatment -related grade ≥3 TEAEs were 
anemia (52%), neutropenia (48%), platelet count decreased andwhite blood cell count

Eight subjects (25.8%) discontinued treatment due to TEAEs , and 15 subjects (48.4 %) 
reported TEAEs leading to study  drug dose reduction . There were no treatment -related fatal
TEAEs (Gaspar , et al ., 2019 ).
6.4 Study Rationale
Study  230, a randomized ,controlled Phase 2 study , will evaluat e the efficacy and safet y of 
lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with ifosfamide and etoposi de in children , adol escents ,and y oung 
adults wi th relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a.Eligible patients aged 2 to 2 5years old will 
receive ifo sfamide and etoposide wit h or without lenvat inib (14 mg/m2;RP2D from  
Study 207). Subjects rando mized to Arm A can cont inue to receive l envat inib unt il disease 
progression, intolerable toxicit y, or withdrawal of consent. Approx imately 72 subjects will 
be treated in the study .  The primary  object ive of the study  is to dem onstrate that l envat inib 
in combinat ionwith ifosfamide and etoposide has superior efficacy co mpared to ifosfamide 
and etoposide based on the PFS-4mratein chil dren, adol escents and y oung adul ts wi th 
relapsed or refractory  osteosarcom a.
Pediatric soli d tum ors are hi ghly vasculari zed.  Angi ogenesis and vasculogenesis are the 
fundamental processes by which new blood vessels are formed.  As with normal t issue, the 
growing tumor requires an extensive network of capillaries to provide the necessary nutrients 
and oxygen.  Moreover, the new intratumor blood vessels o ffer a way  for tum or cells to enter 
the circulati on and metastasi ze to di stant organs and thus play an ind ispensable rol e in so lid 
tumor growth and m etastasi s. Thus, inhibit ion of angiogenesis is a viable target for 
anticancer therapy .  Moreover, vascular normalisatio n allows reoxy genati on, hence the 
addition of  an ant i-VEGF to chemotherapy  may resul t in increased uptake of drugs into 
tumor tissue ( Tuettenberg, et al., 2006).

8INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
8.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, randomi zed, open -label, parallel -group, Phase 2 study to com pare the 
efficacy  and safety  of lenvat inib in co mbinat ion with ifosfamide and etoposide versus 
ifosfamide and etoposide in children, adolescents ,and y oung adul ts with relapsed or 
refractory  osteosarcom a.
Approximately  72eligible subjects will be rando mized to 1 of the fo llowing 2 treatm ent arm s 
in a 1:1 rati owithin the strata :
Arm A:  lenvat inib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifo sfamide 3000 mg/m2/day 
(intravenously [IV] , Day  1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles) and 
etoposide 100 mg/m2/day (IV, Day  1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles )
Arm B:  ifosfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, Day  1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 
5 cycles) and etoposi de 100 m g/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle for a total of up

8.2 Discussion of Study Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
The study  has been designed as an open -label,randomized study  to com pare the safet y and 
efficacy  of lenvat inib in combinat ion with the ifosfamide and etoposide with ifo sfamide and 
etoposide alo ne in children, adolescents, and y oung adul ts wi th relapsed or refractory  
osteosarcoma. Ifosfamide and e toposi dewill be used as the con trol group since it is a 
recogni zed treatm entoption forpatients with relapsed osteosarcoma .
Progression -free survival (PFS) rate at 4 m onths (PFS -4m)as com pared to con trol, with 
blinded IIRof radiological imaging using RECIST 1.1 criteria will be evaluated as the 
primary  endpoint.  The endpoint was determined as appropriate for the study , given the 
unique bio logy of the osteosarcom a (bone lesio ns do not shrink) and the vital role of surgical 
resection o f metastati c lesions, where possible, in the management of patients with this 
tumor.  Pulmonary metastases are most common in osteosarcoma, and the abilit y to achieve a 
second surgical remission ha sconsistent ly been shown essent ial for long-term survival  
following relapse (Kempf Bielack ,et al., 2005; Leary ,et al., 2013 ;Bacci ,et al., 2005 ;Chou ,
et al., 2005 ;Hawkins and Arndt, 2003 ).  The protocol allows for surgical resect ion of 
baseline lesio ns after completion of the Week 18 tumor assessment .  Thistimepo int allows
for surgi cal resect ion after com pletion of  chemotherapy without confounding data due to 
subjects undergoing surgery . To avoi d bias in efficacy  assessment, the analysis for primary 
endpo int is based on tumor assessment by  IIR, a central  independent blinded assessment. 
Progression -free survival at 1 y ear(PFS -1y), PFS, and OS will also be evaluated in the study
as second ary endpoints.
Pharmacodynamic serum and tumor bio markers ident ified in other lenvat inib clinical studies

Before dose administration on Day 1 of each cycle and prior to a change in dose due to dose 
reducti on, the am ount of  lenvat inib needed for each subject must be calculated as fo llows: 
Scheduled dose (mg/m2) ×body  surface area (BSA) (m2) = lenvatinib dose (mg)
Body surface area (B SA)will be calculated using the method that is accepted and 
custom arily used by  the clinical  site.  BSA m ust be calculated on Day  1 of each cycle based 
on the subject’s current height and body  weight.  BSA will be used to determine the amount 
of lenvat inib for each subject.  BSA should not be corrected for amputation. The dose should 
be rounded to the nearest whole number. After adjustment for BSA, the daily dose of 
lenvat inib shoul d not exceed 24 mg daily.
Subjects will receive study  treatm ent as continuous 21 -day cycles in both treatment arms . 
Treatment cy cles will be counted continuously regardless of dose int errupti ons.  If 
chemotherapy administration is precluded on Day  1 of a treatm ent cy cle, the subject m ay 
resum e treatm ent once recovered at the discret ion of investigator.  Subsequent chemotherapy 
will be administered every 21 (±1) days starting from the timepo int it wasresum ed.

remai ns stable for at least 1 week and they reached the normal BMI (if the weight loss occurred but it is 
still above normal BMI, they can restart the study treatment at a lower dose once the weight has been 
stable for at least 1 week).  Normal BMI should be used as the new baseline for further dose reductions.    
Obesity  is defined as body mass index (BMI) percentiles corresponding to 30 kg/m², related to the age of

For children, blood pressure varies by the sex and age of the child and it is closely related to 
height and weight.  Blood pressure will be assessed in terms of percent ile for sex, age and 
height/l ength.  Gui delines to sex, age, and height -specific percent iles of blood pressure are

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 43of 119requi res further evaluat ion.  A referral to a card iologist is recommended for patients who 
develop hypertensio n during the study . Ideally , cardi ovascular assessments and the 
management of hypertensio n shoul d be supervised by  a cardi ologist.  Exerci se, exci tement, 
coughing, crying, and struggling may rais e the systolic pressure of children as much as 
40to50mmHg greater than their usual level.  Variabilit y in blood pressure in children of 
approximately  the same age and body  build shoul d be expected and serial measurements 
shoul d always be obtained when e valuating a pat ient with hypertensio n.
8.4.1.1.2 MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION
Hypertensio n is a recognized side -effect of treatm ent wi th drugs inhibit ing VEGF signaling.
Invest igators should therefore ensure that subjects enro lled to receive treatment with 
lenvat inibhave BP <95th percentile [BP ≤150/90 mmHg] for sex, age, and height/length at 
the time o f study  entry  and, if known to be hypertensive, have been on a stable dose of 
antihypertensive therapy for at least 1 week before Cycle 1 Day 1. Early detection and 
effect ive management of hypertensio n are important to minimize the need for lenvatinib dose 
interrupti ons and reductions.  
Regular assessment of BP should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures/
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Hy pertensio n will be graded using CTCAE v5.0, based 
on BP m easurements only (and not on t he number of ant ihypertensive medicat ions).
If the subject’s init ial BP m easurement is el evated (systolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [BP 
≥140 mm Hg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile[BP ≥90 mm Hg ]),the BP m easurement 
shoul d be repeated at l east 5 minutes later. The mean value of 2 measurements at least 
5minutes apart is defined as 1BP assessment. If the BP assessment (ie, the mean of the 
2BP m easurements ob tained at l east 5 minutes apart) is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥140 mm Hg 
or diastolic BP ≥90 mm Hg), a conf irmatory  assessment shoul d be obtained at least 
30minutes later by performing 2 measurements (at least 5 minutes apart) to yield a mean 
value.
Antihypertensive agents should be started as soon as elevated BP (systolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile [BP ≥140 mm Hg ] or diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg]) is confirmed 
on 2 assessments obtained 30 minutes apart.  The cho ice of ant ihypertensive treatment should 
be individualized to the subject’s clinical circumstances and fo llow standard m edical 
practi ce.  For p reviously normotensive subjects, monotherapy  with one of the cl asses of 
antihypertensives should be started when systolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥140 mm Hg] or 
diastolic BP ≥95th percentile [BP ≥90 mm Hg] is first observed on 2 assessments obtained 
30 minutes apart.  F or those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, treatm ent 
modificati on may be necessary  if hypertensio n persists.
Lenvat inibshoul d be wi thheld in any  instances where a subject is at imminent risk to develop 
a hypertensive crisis or has si gnificant ri sk factors for severe complicat ions of uncontrolled 
hypertensio n (eg, BP ≥99th percentile [BP ≥160/100 mm Hg], significant risk factors for 
cardi ac disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, or other significant comorbidit ies). Once the

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 44of 119subject has been on the same antihypertensive medicat ions for at least 48 hours and the BP is 
controlled, lenvatinibshoul d be resumed as described below. 
During the Treatment Period, subjects with systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg )
or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg) must have their BP monitored on Day  15 
(or more frequently as clinically indicated) until systolic BP has been <95th percent ile 
(≤150 mm Hg )and diastolic BP has been <95th percent ile(≤95 mm  Hg)for 2consecut ive 
treatm entcycles .  If a repeat event of systolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥160 mm Hg) or 
diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg )occurs, the subject must resume the Day  15 
evaluat ion until systo lic BP has been <95th percentile (≤150 mm Hg )and di astolic BP has
been <95th percentile (≤95 mm Hg) for 2consecutive treatm ent cy cles. 
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for the m anagement of systolic BP ≥99th 
percent ile (BP ≥160 mm Hg )or diastolic BP ≥99th percentile (BP ≥100 mm Hg) confirmed 
on repeat measurements after at least 30 minutes : 
Continue lenvatinib and institute antihypertensive therapy  for subjects not already 
receiving this. 
For those subjects already on antihypertensive medicat ion, the dose of the current 
agent may be increased, if appropri ate, or 1 or more agents of a  different class of 
antihypertensive should be added. 
If systolic BP ≥99th percent ile (BP ≥160 mm Hg)or diastolic BP ≥99th percent ile
(BP ≥100 mm Hg)persists despite maximal antihypertensive therapy ,then lenvatinib 
administration shoul d be interrupted and restarted at a l ower dose QD (one dose l evel

subjects wi th signs or symptom s of PRES/RPLS, dose modificat ion gui delines as per Table 1
shoul d be f ollowed.
8.4.1.1.4 MANAGEMENT OF PROTEINURIA
Regular assessment for proteinuria should be conducted as detailed in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5and Table 6).  Gui delines for assessment and management of 
proteinuria are summarized as fo llows: 
Gradi ng of Proteinuria
Grading according to CTCAE 5.0(Cancer Therapy Evaluat ion Program , 2017 )will be 
based on the protein- creat inine ratio or24-hour urinary protein result ,if available .For 
subjects ≥18 years of age, i f the subject has 4+ proteinuria by d ipstick, a 24 -hour urinary 
protein result is required to confirm Grade 3 proteinuria.
Management of Proteinuria
Management of lenvat inib administration will be based on the grade of proteinuria 
according to Table 1.
In the event of nephrotic syndro me, lenvatinib must be di scontinued .
Detection and Confirmat ion
Perform  urine di pstick testing per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5andTable 6)
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection init iated as soon as possible and
at least wi thin 72 hours (or a n immediate spot urine protein -to-creati nine rat io [UPCR ]
test)AND for subjects <18 years of age, an immediate spot UPCR test, and if possible ,a 
24-hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and at least within 72 hours) is 
requi red in the following situat ions:
-The first (init ial) occurrence of ≥2+ proteinuria on urine dipstick while on lenvat inib
-A subsequent increase in severit y of urine dipst ick proteinuria occurring on the same 
lenvat inib dose level
-When there has been a l envat inib dose reduction and at the new dose level the urine 
protein dipst ick result is ≥2+
For subjects ≥18 years of age, a 24 -hour urine co llection (init iated as soon as possible and 
at least wi thin 72 hours) to verify the grade of prot einuri a is requi red when UPCR i s ≥2.4.
Moni toring
Urine dipstick testing for subjects with proteinuria ≥2+ should be performed on Day  15 
(or m ore frequently as clinically indicated) until the results have been 1+ or negative for 
2consecutive treatment cycles.

must be managed by the site physician.
8.4.1.1.5 MANAGEMENT OF HEPATOTOXICITY
Regular m onitoring of liver function tests ( ALT, AST, bilirubin levels) should be conducted 
as det ailed in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and Table 6)and as clinically ind icated. 
If signs/symptoms indicating liver injury  occur, instructi ons contained in the table for dose 
reducti on and interruptions o f the protocol should be fo llowed ( seeTable 1).  Appropri ate 
supportive care should be provided together with close monitoring.  If hepat ic failure occurs 
the study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
8.4.1.1.6 MANAGEMENT OF THROMBOEMBOLIC EVENTS
Subjects should be advised to pay  attenti on to symptom s suggest ive of venous 
thromboembo lic events which include acute onset of shortness of breath, dyspnea, chest pain, 
cough, hemoptysis, tachy pnea, tachycardia, cy anosis, deep vein thrombosis signs including 
lower-extremit y swelling, redness and warmth to touch or ten derness. In case any of these 
symptoms appear, subjects should be instructed to report such symptoms promptly to the 
treating physician.  If a thromboembo lic event is confirmed, instructions contained in the 
table for dose reducti on and interrupti ons of t he protocol should be fo llowed (see Table 1).  
Appropriate supportive care should be provided together with close mo nitoring.  If a subject 
experiences a Grade 3 or alife-threatening (Grade 4) thromboembolic reaction, including 
pulmo nary embo lism, study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
Arterial thromboembo lic events (eg, new onset, worsening, or unstable angina, myocardial 
infarction, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrov ascular acci dent) of  any grade requi re study  
drug di scontinuati on.
8.4.1.1.7 MANAGEMENT OF HYPOCALCEMIA
Serum  calcium shoul d be m onitored m onthly  per the Schedule of Assessments (Table 5and 
Table 6). Corrected serum calcium should be used to assess the grade of hypocalcemia per 
CTCAE v5.0, using the fo llowing form ula: 
Corrected calcium = ([4 –serum albumin in g/dL] ×0.8 + serum calcium)
The formula is not applicable when serum albumin concentration is normal ( ˃4 g/dL); in 
such situations, the total (uncorrected) serum calcium should be used instead.
Hypocalcemia shoul d be treated per institutional gui delines (eg, using appropriate calcium, 
magnesium, and Vitamin D supplementation) until resolution.
8.4.1.1.8 MANAGEMENT OF GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS AND ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN
Initial management of acute abdominal pain in these study  subjects shoul d be focused on 
treating the underlying cause where possible, ensuring appropriate hydrat ion/rehydration, and 
symptom atic pain improvement consistent with subject’s age and in accordance to local and

For adverse events of abdo minal pain believed related to lenvatinib or more specific adverse 
events believed related to lenvat inib that result in the symptom of abdominal pain, follow 
instructi ons contained in Table 1regarding study  treatm ent dose reducti on and interruption.  
For Grade 4 adverse events that result in abdo minal pain, study  drug m ust be di scont inued.
Gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea should be managed by providing symptomatic 
treatm ent. If the symptoms persist (eg, diarrhea for more than 10 days) ,dose m odificati on 
guideline sshoul d be f ollowed as per Table 1. Gastroi ntestinal symptom s shoul d be 
monitored cl osely  and evaluated using CT, contrast -enhanced MRI, ultrasound, or other 
diagnosti c imaging if clinically indicated, at theinvestigator’s discret ion. 
Lenvat inibshoul d be discont inued in any subject who develops gastrointestinal perforation
of any grade or Grade ≥4fistula.  
8.4.1.1.9 MANAGEMENT OFHEMORRHAGE
Dose m odificat ion gui delines as per Table 1for lenvat inibrelated adverse events should be 
followed for the management of hemorrhage. Either resum e lenvatinibat a reduced dose or 
discontinue lenvat inib, depending on the severit yand persiste nce of hemorrhage.
8.4.1.2 Management of Ifosfamide -Etoposide Associated Toxicity
Blood counts shoul d be cl osely  monitored during and pri or to the next cy cle of 
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy -associ ated myel osuppressi on shoul d be managed by  
granulocy te-colony stimulat ing factor ( G-CSF). It is reco mmended that pegylated G -CSF or 
G-CSF be administered at least 24 to 72 hours after complet ion of ifo sfamide -etoposi de 
chemotherapy; use of G -CSF i s reco mmended until white blood cell  (WBC )counts are 
≥1×109/L. Guidelines for dose modificat ion for ifosfamide and etoposide associated 
toxicities are provi ded in the Table 2below . 
Details o f ifosfamide and etoposide dose interru ption and reduction as well as management 
of toxicity can be found in the Summary  of Product Characteri stics (SmPC), and may be 
followed as per l ocal and inst itutional guidelines. The Sm PC will be provi ded to the study

8.4.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
This is an open -label study .  All subjects who provide signed informed consent and/or assent 
to parti cipate in thi s study  and sat isfy all eligibilit y requirements (see Secti on8.3) will be
assigned to treatm ents based on a computer -generated randomization scheme that will be 
reviewed and approved by an independent statistician.  The randomizat ion scheme and 
ident ificat ion for each subject will be included in the final clinical study  report for thi s study .
After the Baseline Period, subjects will be rando mized to 1 of the fo llowing 2 treatm ent arm s 
in a 1:1 rati o:
Arm A:  lenvat inib 14 mg/m2(orally, once daily) plus ifo sfamide 3000 mg/m2/day (IV, 
Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles ) and etoposide 100 mg/m2/day 
(IV, Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to 5 cycles)
Arm B: ifosfamide 3000 m g/m2/day (IV, Day 1 to Day  3 of each cycle for a total of up to
5 cycles) and etoposi de 100 m g/m2/day ( IV, Day 1 to Day 3 of each cycle fo r a total  of up 
to 5 cycles)
Randomization will be performed centrally by an I VRS.  Randomizat ion will fo llow a 
predefined rando mizat ion scheme based on the fo llowing stratificat ion factors: time to first 
relapse/refractory  disease (early [<18 months] or l ate [≥18months])and age (<18 and

Lenvat inib capsule s are to be taken orally  once a day  at approximately the same time in the 
morning wi thout regard to food intake for 21days from Cycle 1 onward.  If a subject misses 
a dose, it may  be taken wi thin the 12 hours following the usual t ime of the morning dose. If 
more than 12 hours have elapsed from the time of the usual daily  dose, l envat inib shoul d be 
taken the next day  at the usual  time in the morning.  In the event a subject vo mits after study  
drug administration, the subject should not take another dose un til the next scheduled dose.  
Study  drugs should be administered at the clinic on PK sampling days. All scheduled visits 
must be conducted as per protocol, irrespective of treatment interruption. 
8.4.6 Blinding
The study  will not be blinded .
8.4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All prior medicat ions (including over -the-counter medicat ions) administered 30 days before 
the first dose of study  drug and any  concomi tant therapy  administered to the subject during 
the course of the study  (starting at the date of info rmed consent) until 30 days after the final 
dose of study  drug will be recorded.  Additionally, all diagnostic, therapeutic, or surgical 
procedures relating to malignancy  should be recorded.  Any  medicati on that is considered 
necessary  for the subject’s he alth and that is not expected to interfere with the evaluation of 
or interact with lenvatinibmay be cont inued during the study.
Treatment of complicat ions or AEs, or therapy  to ameli orate symptoms (including blood 
products, blood transfusio ns, fluid trans fusio ns, antibiotics, and ant idiarrheal drugs), may be 
given at the discret ion of the investigator, unless it is expected to interfere with the evaluation 
of (or to interact with) lenvatinib.
Aspirin, nonsteroi dal antiinflammatory  drugs (NSAIDs), and low-m olecular -weight heparin 
(LMWH) are permissible but should be used with caution.  Granulocyte colony -stimulat ing 
factor (g-CSF) or equivalent may be used in accordance with American Societ y of Clinical  
Onco logy (ASCO), institutional, or national guidelines.   Erythropoiet in may be used 
according to ASCO, institutional, or national guidelines, but the subject should be carefully 
monitored for increases in red blood cell (RBC) counts.
8.4.7.1 Drug -Drug Interactions
The weak inhibitory  effect on CYP enzymes (in vitro) e xhibited by lenvat inib suggests a l ow 
risk of lenvat inib interference wi th the PK of other drugs co -administered in usual clinical 
practi ce.  There is no clinically meaningful drug-drug interaction ( DDI)risk when lenvat inib 
is co-administered with CYP3A s ubstrates such as midazolam .  Simultaneous CYP3A4/P -gp 
inhibit ions by ketoconazole slight ly (15% to19%) increased systemic exposure to lenvat inib 
after oral  administrati on as measured by  AUC and C maxin humans.  Since no change was 
observed in half -life, tmax, or t lag, the slight increase in systemic exposure is probably related 
Page 321 of 388
Clinical Study  Protocol E7080 -G000 -230
Eisai
FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 53of 119to a decrease in first pass metabo lism.  However, since the magnitude o f the change is small, 
coadministration of lenvat inib wit h CYP3A4/P -gp inhibitors is not of clinical concern.   
Similarly, PK data did not suggest any major effects of rifampin on the exposure or 
disposi tion of  lenvat inib.  Following administration of a single dose of lenvat inib wit h a 
single dose of rifampin, lenvatinib exposure increased about 31%.  In contrast, following 
administration of mult iple doses of rifampin, free lenvat inib exposure was reduced about 9% 
and about 18% for total lenvat inib.  These findings suggest that there is no clinically 
meaningful influence of eit her P -gp inhibit ion (singl e dose of ri fampin) or simultaneous P -gp 
and CYP3A4 induction (mult iple doses of rifampin) on l envat inib PK.
The locally approved product label or applicable SmPC for ifosfamide and etoposi de should 
be referenced for any  concomi tant therapy  use wi th ifosfamide and etoposi de.
8.4.7.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapies and Drugs
Subjects should not receive other antitumor therapies while on study . If a subject receives 
additional antitumor therapi es other than the study  drug(s), such as chemotherapy , targeted 
therapi es, immuno therapy , or anti tumor intervent ions -such as surgery or palliat ive 
radiotherapy  (other than as described below), this will be judged to represent evidence of 
disease progressi on, and cont inuat ion of the study  medicat ion and further participation in the 
study must be discussed and agreed upon with the sponsor.  
For further information on the prohibited concomit ant therapies for ifosfamide and etoposide, 
please refer to the respective prescribing informat ion.
8.4.7.3 Permitted Concomitant Treatment /Procedures
The following concomitant treatments/procedures are allowed:
a.Removal of exist ing (not new) osteosarcoma lesio n (eg, surgical, radio frequency 
ablat ion, cryotherapy , therm oablati on, stereotaxi c rati otherapy ,etc.) after complet ion of 
the Week 18 tumor assessment .  Subjects in Arm A in the presence o f clinical benefit, 
may cont inue treatment with lenvat inib after protocol permissible surgery .
b.Palliat ive radiotherapy is allowed for ≤2 significantly symptomatic nontarget lesio ns. 
If asubject receiving treatm ent with lenvatinib requi res surgery  during the study , the stop 
time and restart time of lenvat inib shoul d be as follows:
For minor procedures: stop lenvatinib at least 2 days before the procedure and restart it at 
least 2 day s after, once there is evidence of a dequate healing and no risk o f bleeding. 
For m ajor procedures: stop l envat inib at least 1 week (5 half -lives) prior to surgery  and 
then restart it at least 1 week after, once there is evidence o f adequate healing and no risk 
of bleeding. 
Any addit ional procedural  or subject specific particularit ies should be discussed with the

8.5.1.2 Efficacy Assessments
8.5.1.2.1 TUMOR RESPONSE ASSESSMENTS
Tumor assessment will be performed based on RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 1 ).  
Invest igator -determined response assessments will be performed at each assessment time point 
andentered onto the appropriate CRF.  Copi es of all tumor assessment scans will be sent to 
an ICL designated by the sponsor for efficacy assessment and for confirmat ion of PD .  
Tumor assessments will be carried out following the guidelines provided by  the ICL.  
Subjects m ust have evaluable disease or measurable disease based on RECIST 1.1 .
At Screening
During the Screening Peri od, tum or assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other 
areas of known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed wit hin 28 days prior 
to Cy cle 1 Day  1.  Scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be done 
with MRI inst ead of CT, but evaluat ion of the chest should be done with CT.  
Brain scans by MRI with and wit hout contrast enhancement or CT with contrast 
enhancement will be performed at screening as clinically indicated .
Historical scans (wi thin 28 days prior to the Cycle 1 Day 1) may be used to dem onstrate 
eligibilit yas long as they  meet minimum standards as separately defined by the ICL .

CT/MRI scans of, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other known sites of disease plus any areas of 
newly suspec ted disease will be performed using the same methodology as at screening every 
6 weeks ±1 week , following the start of treatment on Cy cle 1 Day  1 during the chemotherapy 
treatm ent peri od until Week 18.   Following completion of the chemotherapy treatment pe riod
(ie, after Week 18) , the frequency o f tumor assessments will be every  9 weeks ±1 week unt il 
Week 54 ±1 week.  Thereafter, they  will be perf ormed every  12 weeks ±2 weeks unt il 
docum entati on of  PD.  At any  point, scans shoul d be perform ed earlier than t he scheduled 
time point, if clinically indicated.
An initial assessment of CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 must be confirmed by IIR not 
less than 4 weeks after the init ial response. The same methodology (CT or MRI) and scan 
acquisit ion techniques (including use or nonuse of IV contrast) as was used for the screening 
assessments should be utilized across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison o f 
lesions. After treatment disco ntinuat ion for a reason other than PD, tum or assessments 
shoul d cont inue to be performed as per the tumor assessment schedule until documentation 
of progressi on or start of a new ant icancer agent.  Screening CT scans should be performed 
with oral and i odinated intravenous contrast and MRI scans should be performed with 
intravenous gadolinium chelate.  Post -screening scans may be performed without contrast if a 
medical contraindicat ion develops while on study  treatm ent.  If i odinated intravenous
contrast i s contraindicated, chest CT should be done without intravenous contrast .  MRI 
shoul d be perform ed for all  other body  regions (with gadolinium unless contraindicated ( eg, 
severe renal dysfunct ion).
CT scans should be diagnostic qualit y spiral/mul tidetector CT with oral  and i odinated 
intravenous contrast, and the MRI scans should be performed wit h intravenous gadolinium 
chelate.  Scans of the neck, abdo men, pelvis, and other areas of the body  may be done wi th 
MRI instead of CT, but evaluat ion of the chest shoul d be done wi th CT.  Spi ral/mul tidetector 
CT shoul d be perform ed wi th a 5-mmcontiguous slice reconstruction algorithm.  If body 
MRI scans are performed, contiguous slices o f 5 mm shoul d also be performed.  If a subject 
develops a contraindicat ion to CT con trast during the study , the chest evaluat ion shoul d be 
done wi th non-contrast CT, and the other body  scans shoul d be done wi th MRI wi th 
gadolinium chelate IV. 
The same imaging modalit y and image -acquisit ion protocol (including use or non -use of 
contrast) shoul d be used consistent ly across all t ime points to allow consistent comparison of 
lesions.  Low -dose non -contrast CT transmissio n scans fro m a posi tron emissio n 
tomography -CT (PET -CT) combinat ion scanner are not acceptable.  Ultrasound should not 
be used f or radi ographic tum or assessment.  A chest x -ray or skeletal  x-ray which clearly  
demonstrates a new m etastati c lesi on may be used to document progression in lieu of the 
CT/MRI scans.
If subcutaneous masses or nodes are palpable (eg, bulky) and are asses sable by both clinical 
and radiographic techniques, the radiographic (CT/MRI) technique should be used for the 
assessment of target and non -target l esions.

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 60of 1198.5.1.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS
An AE is any  untoward m edical occurrence in a patientor clinical investigation subject 
administered an invest igational product.  An AE does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the medicinal product.  For this study , the study  drug islenvatini b. 
The cri teria for identifying AEs in this study  are:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory  finding), 
symptom, or disease tem porally  associated wi th the use of an invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product (Note:  Every  sign or 
symptom  shoul d not be listed as a separate AE if the applicable disease [diagnosis] is 
being reported as an AE)
Any new disease or exacerbat ion of an existing disease .However, worsening of the 
primary  disease shoul d be captured under efficacy  assessments as PD.
Any deterioration in nonprotocol -requi red m easurements of a l aboratory  value or other 
clinical test (eg, ECG or x -ray) that resul ts in symptom s, a change in trea tment, or 
discontinuat ion of study  drug
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condit ion (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
An abnormal laboratory  test resul t shoul d be considered an AE if the ident ified laboratory 
abnorm ality leads to any  type o f intervent ion, withdrawal  of study  drug, or wi thhol ding 
of study  drug , whether pr escribed in the protocol or not
All AEs, regardless of relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be recorded beginning 
from the time the subject signs the s tudy ICF through the last visit and for 30 day safter the 
subject’s last dose .  Refer to Section 8.5.4.1 for the time period after the end of treatment for 
SAEcollect ion.  
Abnorm al laboratory  values shoul d not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndro me that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibilit y of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in al l subjects and determine if they  consti tute 
an AE.  Medical and scient ific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an iso lated 
laboratory  abnorm ality shoul d be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormalit y
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF. 
Abnorm al ECG (QTcF) resul ts, if not otherwi se considered part of a clinical symptom that is 
being reported as an AE, should be considered an AE if the QTc Finterval  is more than 
450ms and there is an increase of morethan 60ms from baseline.  Any ECG abnormalit y 
that the investigator considers as an AE should be reported as such.
All AEs must be fo llowed for 30days after the subject’s last study  drug dose, or until 
resol ution, whichever co mes first.  Subjects with o nset of an AE or deterioration of a 
preexist ing AE during the AE co llection peri od will be fo llowed unt il reso lution to baseline, 
start of a new ant icancer treatm ent, or death. All SAEs must be fo llowed to resol ution or, if 
resol ution is unlikely, to stab ilizat ion.

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 61of 119Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
Assessing Severity of Adverse Events
Adverse events will be graded on a 5- point scale according to CTCAE v5.0 (Cancer Therapy 
Evaluat ion Program, 2017).  Investigators will report CTCAE grades for all AEs (for both 
increasing and decreasing severit y).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study  treatm ent are:
Temporal  relati onship of the onset of the event to the init iation of the study  treatm ent
The course of the event, especially the effect of discontinuat ion of study  treatm ent or 
reintroduction of study  treatment, as applicable
Wheth er the event i s known to be associated with the study  treatm ent or wi th other 
similar treatments
The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
The presence of nonstudy , treatm ent-related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classification of Causality
The rel ationship of each AE to the study  drug will  berecorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibilit y that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (rel ated) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s a reasonable 
possibilit y.
No (not related) A causal relat ionship between the study  drug and the AE i s not a 
reasonable possibilit y.
8.5.1.4.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIA TED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
AnSAE is any  untoward m edical  occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue, might have caused death)
Requi res inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on
Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y

Other important medical events that may  not be immediately life- threatening or resul t in 
death or hospitalizat ion but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject o r may require intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes in the definit ion of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situat ions. 
In addit ion to the above, events associated with special situat ions include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error .  These events associ ated wi th special situa tions are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs only if they meet one of 
the above criteria.  All AEs associ ated withspecial si tuations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they  meet the cri teria for SAEs.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolut ion or, if resolut ion is unlikely, to stabilizat ion.
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” (ie, there i s no untoward m edical occurrence) associated with the hospital ization:
Hospitalizations for respite care 
Planned hospi talizat ions required by the protocol
Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condit ion requiring the 
hospi talizati on has not changed afterstudy  drug administrati on)
Hospitalization for administration of study  drug or insertion of access for administration 
of study  drug
Hospitalization for routine maintenance o f a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before study  entry

subject has been resting for 5 minutes.  All BP measurements should be performed on the 
same arm , preferably by  the same person.  
Only 1 BP measurement is needed for subjects with systolic BP < 95th percent ile(BP 
<140 mmHg)and diastolic BP < 95th percent ile(BP <90 mmHg ).If the subject’s init ial BP 
measurement is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥ 95th percentile [≥140 mmHg ]or diastolic BP ≥95th 
percent ile[≥90 mmHg ]), the BP measurement should be repeated at least 5 minutes later. 
The m ean value of 2 measurements at least 5 minutes apart is defined as 1 BP assessment. If 
the BP assessment (ie, the mean o f the 2 BP m easurem ents obtained at least 5 minutes apart) 
is elevated (sy stolic BP ≥ 95th percent ile[≥140 mmHg]or diastolic BP ≥95th percent ile
[≥90mm Hg ]), a confirmatory  assessment should be obtained at least 30 minutes later by

Pregnancy Test
A serum β -hCG test will be performed for females of childbearing potential (see definit ion 
included in the Inclusio n/Exclusion criteria, Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2 ).  A serum  or uri ne 
pregnancy test will be performed at Screening , Baseline (or within 72 hours prior to the first 
dose of study  medicat ion), on Day  1 of each cycle from Cycle 2 onwards ,and at the 
Off-treatm ent Visit in wo men of childbearing potent ial. Blood and urine sam ples will be 
taken at designated time po ints as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 5and
Table 6).
Echocardiogram
An echocardiogram to assess LVEF will be performed during the screening phase, every 
16weeks following the first dose of study  drug while the subject is on treatment or soone r, if 
clinically indicated, and at (or within 1 week fo llowing) the off -treatment assessment.  
LVEFs as assessed by the inst itution will be entered onto the CRF.  Investigator assessment 
will be based upon inst itutional reports.
8.5.1.5 Other Assessments
Health-related qualit y of life ( HRQoL )assessment will be performed per the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 5andTable 6).Impact of  treatm ent on HRQoL will be assessed using 
the PedsQL (including the Generic Core Scales and Cancer Module).  Data will be collected 
as parent -report for toddlers (2 to 4 y ears) andas se lf-report for subjects aged ≥5 years .  
Self-report i s the preferred data collect ion for all subjects aged ≥5, however to improve 
adherence of participat ion, it is also acceptable to collect the data as proxy  report by  
observers including parents a nd caregivers.
The PedsQL is a modular instrument designed to measure HRQ oL in pediatric and adults 
popul ation. The PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales are mult idimensio nal child self -report and 
parent proxy -report scal es devel oped as the generic core measure to be integrated with the 
PedsQL disease specific modules. The PedsQL 3.0 Cancer Module was designed to measure 
pediatric cancer specific HRQOL .
It is best practi ce and strongly recommended that the PedsQL measurement modules are 
administered to randomize d subjects prior to drug administration or any  other interacti on 
with site staff .

l.Clinical chemistry and hematology results must be reviewed by the investigator prior to administration of study drug on C1D1 and within 48 hours after 
administering any study drug for all subsequent cycl es.  Scheduled assessments may be performed within 72 hours prior to the visit.  If ≥Grade 3 
hematologic or clinical chemistry toxicity, repeat laboratory test and AEs assessment at least ever y 3 day s (until improvement to <Grade 3).  TSH should be 
assesse d for all subjects.
m.Urine dipstick testing should be performed at Screening, Baseline, C1D15, C2D1 , C2D15, and Day 1 of ever y subsequent cycle, or more frequently as 
clinically indicated, and at the Off -treatment Visit.  For subjects with a history of proteinuria ≥2+, urine dipstick testing should be performed until the result s 
have been 1+ or negative for 2treatment cycles .  If a new event of proteinuria ≥2+ occurs, refer to Section 8.4.1.1.4 for further management guidelines.   
Urine glucose should be perf ormed as part of the urine dipstick.  
n.Sampling (one 2 mL sample per time point) for PK analysis of lenvatinib will be performed (in subjects in Arm A only) on Cy cle 1 Day  1 at 0.5 to 4 hours 
and 6 to 10 hours postdose, on Cycle 1 Day 15 at predose, 0.5 to 4 hours and 6 to 10 hours postdose, and on Cycle 2 Day 1 at predose.  All predose samples 
are to be drawn approximately 24 hours following the dose administered on the previous day.  If dose interruption is necessar y at  these time points, please 
contact the sponsor.
o.Subjects randomized to Arm A will continue to receive lenvatinib only after completion of 5 cycles with lenvatinib+ifosfamide +etoposide until progressive 
disease, unacceptable toxicity, subject request, study termination by the sponsor, subjec t noncompliance with safety or efficacy assessments, or withdrawal 
of consent.  Subjects randomized to Arm B will be off -treatment after 5 cycles of ifosfamide+etoposide.
p.All subjects who receive suspension formulation ,with the exception of subjects using a nasogastric or gastrostomy tube, must complete the Palatability 
Questionnaire according to the Schedule of Assessments.  If the subject is unable to complete the questionnaire this must be done by their parents or their 
legal guardian.  
q.Screening :  Tumor assessments of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of known disease or newly suspected disease should be performed within 
28days prior to C1D1.  Scans of the abdomen, pelvis, and other areas of the body may be done with MRI instead of CT, bu t evaluatio n of the chest should 
be done with CT.  CT scans should be performed with oral and iodinated IV contrast and MRI scans should be performed with IV gadolinium chelate .
Treatment Phase :  Tumor assessments of the chest, and other areas of known di sease at Screening or newly suspected disease should be performed ever y 
6±1 weeks from C1D1 until Week 18 ±1 week, then every 9 ±1 weeks until Week 54± 1 week, and thereafter, every 12± 2 weeks until documentation of PD
during the Treatment Phase (or sooner if there is evidence of progressive disease) and should utilize the same methodology (CT or MRI) and scan

8.5.3 Appropriateness of Measurements
All clinical assessments are standard measurements commo nly used in studi es of  relapsed or 
refractory  solid tum ors.
The safet y assessments to be performed in this study , including hematology analyses, blood 
chemistry  tests, urinalysis, radio logic studi es, and assessment of AEs, are standard 
evaluat ions to ensure subject safet y.  The use of RECIST 1.1 for tumor assessments of so lid 
tumors is wi dely accepted (see Appendix 1 )(Eisenhauer, et al ., 2009 ).
8.5.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events, Pregnancy, and Events Associated 
with Special Situations
8.5.4.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
All SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study treatment, 
must be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no 
later than 24 hours from the date the investigator becomes aware of the event.
Serious adverse events, regardless of causalit y assessment, must be collected for30 day s 
after the subject’s last dose .  All SAEs must be fo llowed to resolut ion or, if resolut ion is 
unlikely , to stabilizat ion.  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be rel ated to the study  
treatm ent or any  protocol -requi red procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of 
the length of time that has passed since study  compl etion.
The detailed contact informat ion for reporti ng of SAEs is provided in the Invest igator Study  
File.
For urgent safety issues ,please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate study  team  member listed in the Invest igator Study  File.
It is very  important that the SAE report form be filled o ut as completely as possible at the 
time of the init ial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causalit y.
Any relevant follow-up inform ation received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24hours
of its recei pt.  If the relevant follow-up in formation changes the invest igator’s assessment of 
causalit y, this shoul d also be noted on the fo llow-up SAE form .
Preliminary SAE reports should be fo llowed as soon as possible by  detailed descripti ons 
including copies of hospital case reports, autopsy  reports, and other documents requested by  
the sponsor.

requi red by their inst itution.  A copy  of this communicat ion must be forwarded to the sponsor 
and/or the designate d CRO m onitor to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.
8.5.4.2 Reporting of Pregnancy and Exposure to Study Drug Through Breastfeeding
Any pregnancy  in a female subject in which the estimated date of concept ion is either before 
the last visit or within 30 days of last study  treatm ent, or any  exposure to study  drug through 
breast feeding during study  treatm ent or wi thin 30days of last study  treatm ent, m ust be 
reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy is suspected to be related to study drug exposure, th is 
shoul d be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study  
treatm ent.
A congenital anomaly, death during perinatal period, a spontaneous abortion or an induced 
aborti on done due to safet y concerns for ei ther mother or fetus are considered to be an SAE 
and should be reported in the same time frame and in the same format as all other SAEs (see
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events [ Section 8.5.4.1 ]).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by  fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours from the date the invest igator becomes 
aware of the pregnancy .  The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies and 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Invest igator Study File.  The 
Pregnancy Report Form must be used for report ing.  All pregnancies must be fo llowed to 
outcom e.  The outcom e of the pregnancy must be reported as soon as possible but no later 
than 24 hours from the date the invest igator becomes aware of the outcome.
A subject who beco mes pregnant must be withdrawn f rom the study .

8.5.4.3.1 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH STUDY DRUG OVERDOSE ,
MISUSE , ABUSE ,OR MEDICATION ERROR
Adverse e vents associated with study drug overdose, misuse, abuse, and medicat ion error 
refer to AEs associated with uses of the study  drug outsi de of that specified by  the protocol .  
Overdose, misuse, abuse, and medicat ion error are defined as fo llows:
Overdose Accidental  or intent ional us e of the study  drug in an amount higher 
than the protocol -defined dose
Misuse Intentional and inappropriate use of study  drug not in accordance with 
theprotocol
Abuse Sporadi c or persi stent intent ional excessive use o f study  drug

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 78of 119Medicat ion error Any unintentional event that causes or leads to inappropriate study  
drug use or subject harm while the study  drug i s in the control  of site
personnel or the subject. 
All AEs associ ated wi th overdose ,misus e, abuse, or medicat ion error shoul d be captured on 
the Adverse Event CRF and also reported using the procedures detailed in Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events (Secti on8.5.4.1 ) even if the AEs do not m eet seri ous cri teria.  Abuse 
and Intent ional Overdose, even if asymptomatic, are always to be captured as an AE.  If the 
AE associated with an overdose, misuse, abuse, or medicat ion error does not meet serious 
criteria, i t must still  be reported using the SAE form and in an expedited manner but should 
be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.
8.5.4.3.2 REPORTING OF ABNORMAL HEPATIC TESTS OF CLINICAL INTEREST
The fo llowing combinat ion of abnormal laboratory tests *, as determined by way o f 
protocol -specified laboratory  testi ng or unscheduled laboratory  testing and whether 
nonseri ous or seri ous,shoul d be entered on the Adverse Event CRF and reported using the 
procedures detailed in Reporting of Serious Adverse Events ( Section 8.5.4.1 ). If the event 
does not m eet seri ous cri teria, the seri ousness criteria on the SAE form should be indicated as 
“nonserious .”  
Elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3 ×the upper limit of 
norm al 
AND
Elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2× the upper limit of 
norm al 
AND AT THE SAME TIME
Alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2× the upper limit of normal
*Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory  guidance docum ents. The purpose 
of the cri teria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepat ic tests that may require addit ional 
evaluat ion for an underlying etio logy. In addit ion to reporting the abnormal hepat ic 
laboratory  tests on a SAE form , the si te shoul d also con sult the m edical m onitorfor guidance 
on assessment and fo llow-up.  At a minimum, laboratory  testing shoul d be repeated at l east 
once weekly until improvement or ident ificat ion of a cause unrelated to study  drug use that is 
unlikely  to im prove.
8.5.4.4 Expedited R eporting
The sponsor must inform invest igators and regulatory  authori ties of repor tableevents, in 
compliance wi th applicable regulatory  requi rements, on an expedited basis (ie, within 
specific t ime frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites pr ovide com plete SAE

The invest igator will pro mptly explain to the subject (or subject’s parent or guardian) 
involved that the study  will be discont inued for that subject and provide appropriate medical 
treatm ent and other necessary  measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return 
for visits wi ll be followed up by  mail, phone, or other m eans to gather information such as 
the reason for failure to return, the status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of 
AEs, and clinical courses of signs and symptoms.  
Subjects who discont inue earl y from the study  will be discontinued for 1 of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, progression of disease, withdrawal of 
consent, pregnancy, study  terminated by  sponsor, or administrative/other.  In addit ion to the

8.7.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All invest igator terms for medications recorded in the CRF will be coded to an 11 -digit code 
using the Worl d Heal th Organizati on Drug Di ctionary (WHO DD).  Concomitant 
medicat ions will be further coded to the appropriate Anatomical Therapeut ic Chemical 
(ATC) cl ass indicating therapeut ic classificat ion.  Pri or medicat ions will be defined as 
medicat ions that started pri or to the first dose of study  drug and were ei ther continued during

summarized and listed by drug and drug class and by treatm ent arm .
8.7.1.6 Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses will be based primarily on the Full Analysis Set .
All the statistical analysis will b e conducted at the PFS -1y/OS- 1y analysis data cutoff date
(ie, when the l ast subject has completed 18 cycles of treatm ent or di scont inues before the end 
of Cycle 18, whichever occurs first) , including the an alysis of PFS -4mrate.  Additional 
follow-up anal ysis will base don th e date of data cutoff for the addit ional follow-up analysis

8.7.1.6.1 PRIMARY EFFICACY ANALYS IS
The primary  analysis of PFS -4m rate will be based upon data provided by  IIR of  tumor 
assessments.  PFS -4m rate and their Greenwood standard errors will be evaluated using the 
K-M est imates from both treatment group s.  The statist ical significance of the difference in 
the 2 K -M PFS -4m rates com paring l envatinib + chemotherapy  agent ( Test Arm) vs. 
chemotherapy agent alone (Control Arm) will be tested using a 2 -sided 80% CI. This 2-sided

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 84of 11980% CI anda p-value will be constructed using the difference of these 2 K -M PFS -4m rates 
and the 2 corresponding Greenwood standard errors. S tatistical significance of the difference 
is declared if the CI is ent irely above 0. This is equivalent to a test using a 1 -sided test at 
alpha=0.1. The 2 -sided 95% CIs will also be provided for descript ive purposes. PFS-4m 
rate will also be analyzed us ing a binomial approach as a sensi tivity analysis by excluding 
subjects whose PFS are censored prior to 18 weeks .
8.7.1.6.2 SECONDARY EFFICACY ANALYSES
PFS-1y rate will  be analyzed using the same methods as the primary  efficacy analysis.   PFS 
censoring rules will fo llow FDA gui dance of 2007, however, removal of baseline lesio ns 
after com pletion of Week 18 without progression is not a trigger for PFS censoring after 
18weeks .(refer to Section 8.4.7.3 for allowed concomitant treatments/procedure in the 
study ).
Overall survival (OS) will be co mpared between treatment arm and control arm using the 
stratified logrank test with time to first relapse/refracto ry disease (early  [<18 m onths] or l ate 
[≥18 months]) and age (<18 or≥18 y ears) as strata.  Median OS with 2 -sided 80% and 
95% CIs will be calculated using K -M product -limit est imates for each treatment arm, and 
the K-M est imates of OS will be plotted over time.  The Cox regression model will be used 
to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% and 95% CIs stratified by time to first 
relapse/refractory  disease (early [<18 months] or late [ ≥18 months]) and age (<18 or 
≥18years) .  Kaplan -Meier ( K-M) estimates wi ll also be presented for 4, 6, 9 and 12 months 
with 2-sided 80% and 95% CIs.
Overall PFS will be analyzed similarly to OS. Medi an PFS and 2 -sided 80% and 95% (as 
exploratory ) CIs will be presented ,and the K -M estimates of PFS will be plotted over time.  
The Cox regressio n model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio and its 80% and 95% CIs 
stratified by time to first relapse/refractory  disease (early  [<18 m onths] or l ate [≥18 months]) 
and age (<18 or ≥18 y ears) .  K-M est imates will also be presented fo r 4, 6, 9 ,and 12 months 
with 2-sided 80% and 95% CIs.
The ORR will be co mpared between the testand control groups using either a chi -square test 
or a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified bytime to first relapse/refractory  disease (early 
[<18 m onths] or late [≥18 months]) and age (<18 or ≥18 years) , as appropriate .  
Corresponding odds ratios and their 2- sided 80% and 95% CIs comparing the groups will 
also be presented.  The individual treatment group ORRs will also be calculated along with 
exact 95% co nfidence intervals using the Clopper and Pearson method .
8.7.1.6.3 EXPLORATORY EFFICACY ANALYSES
Median DOR among responders for each arm will be presented along with its corresponding 
2-sided 95% CIs.  Di sease Control  Rate (DCR) and CBR will be calculated with exac t 
95% CIs using the Clopper and Pearson method.  The differences of the above rates between 
2groups and corresponding two -sided 95% CIs will be calculated respect ively.

reference range.  Wit hin-treatm ent com parisons for each laboratory  param eter will be based 
on shift table s that com pare the baseline LNH classificat ion to the LNH classification at each 
postbaseline visit and at the end of treatment.  Similar shift table s will also compare the 
baseline LNH classification to the LNH classificat ion for the highest and lowest value during 
the treatment period.

A binomial-based comparison of 2 proportions using correction for con tinuit y was used for 
sample size est imation.  A total sample size of 72 subjects is estimated to achieve 80% 
statist ical power at 1 -sided alpha of 0.1 to detect a difference of 30% based on the 
assumpt ion that PFS -4m for Arm  A (lenvatinib arm) i s 55% and for Arm B is 25%.  Alpha is 
the type 1 error probabilit y of declaring lenvat inib arm being effective when the true 
lenvat inib arm PFS -4m rate is only 25% .
8.7.3 Interim Analysis
No interim analysis is planned for this study .
The safet y monitoring will  be conducted by  the independent data m onitoring committee 
(IDMC).  The frequency o f the safet y reviews will be defined in the IDMC charter.  Minutes 
from the open m eetings o f the IDMC will be provided if requested by regulatory  agencies.  
The recommendat ion of whether to stop the studyfor safet y will be reached by the IDMC

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 93of 11910PROCEDURES AND INSTR UCTIONS (ADMINISTRATIV E 
PROCEDURES)
10.1 Changes to the Protocol
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by  the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specifically  
affect ing the safet y of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scient ific qualit y of the 
study  requi re submissi on to heal th or regul atory  authori ties as well  asadditional approval  by 
the applicable IRBs/IECs.  These requirements should in no way  prevent any  immediate 
action from being ta ken by  the invest igator, or by  the sponsor, in the interest of preserving 
the safet y of all subjects included in the study .  If the invest igator determines that an 
immediate change to or deviat ion from the protocol is necessary  for saf ety reasons to 
elimin ate an immediate hazard to the subjects , the sponsor’s medical mo nitorand the 
IRB/IEC for the site must be notified immediately.  The sponsor must notify the healt h or 
regul atory  authori ty as requi red per l ocal regulat ions.
Protocol  amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study  may not requi re 
submissio n to health or regulatory  authori ty or the IRB/IEC, but the healt h or regulatory  
authori ty and IRB /IEC (or if regionally required, the head of the medical inst itution) shoul d 
be kept inform ed of such changes as required by  local regulati ons.  In these cases, the 
sponsor m ay be requi red to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and the Competent Authorities (or, if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) detailing such changes.
10.2 Adhere nce to the Protocol
The invest igator will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to 
ICH E6, Section 4.5).
10.3 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the invest igator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visit s.  Moni toring visits to each site will be 
conducted by  the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator (or if 
regionally  required, the head of the medical inst itution) will allow the CRA to inspe ct the 
clinical, laboratory , and pharmacy facilit ies to assure com pliance wi th GCP and l ocal 
regul atory  requi rements.  The CRFs and subject’s corresponding original medical records 
(source documents) are to be fully available for review by the sponsor’s re presentatives at 
regul ar intervals.  These reviews verify  adherence to study  protocol  and data accuracy  in 
accordance with local regulat ions.  All records at the site are subject to inspect ion by the 
local audi ting agency  and to IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to,
the following :
Clinic, office, or hospital charts

these images are stored, including micro fiche and photographic negatives
Pain, qualit y of life, or m edical history  questionnaires completed by  subjects
Records of telephone contacts
Diaries or eval uation checklists
Drug distribut ion and accountabilit y logs maintained in ph armacies or by  research 
personnel
Laboratory  resul ts and other laboratory  test outputs (eg, urine pregnancy test result 
docum entati on and urine dip- sticks)
Correspondence regarding a study  subject’s treatment between physicians or memoranda 
sent to the IRBs/IECs
CRF co mponents (eg, questionnaires) that are completed directly by subjects and serve as 
their own source
Electronic Pat ient-Reported Outcome by self-reported m easures
10.4 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be co mpleted for each subject by  qualified and authori zed 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a sectionof the CRF i tself is used as the source document.  Any  correcti on to entri es 
made on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction isdated, the 
individual making the correct is ident ified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original  data are not obscured.  Only  data requi red by  the protocol  for the purposes of the 
study  shoul d be collected.
The invest igator must sign each CRF.  The invest igator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a copy  of the CRFs.
10.5 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents.  
10.6 Retention of Records
The circumstances of com pletion or terminat ion of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator (or if regio nally required, the head of the medical inst itution or the desi gnated 
representative) is responsible for retaining all study documents, including but no t limited to 
the protocol, copies of CRFs, the Invest igator ’s Brochure, and regulatory agency registration 
docum ents (eg, Form FDA 1572 for US sites), Investigator and Site Information Form  (for 
non-US si tes), ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence). The site s hould plan to retain study

study .
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the inves tigator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of  perm anent ly retaining the study  records.
10.7 Auditing Procedures and Inspection
In addit ion to routi ne monitoring procedures, the sponsor’s Clinical Qualit y Assurance 
departm ent conducts audi ts of clinical research activit ies in accordance with the sponsor’s 
SOPs to evaluate compliance wit h the principles of ICH GCP and all applicable local 
regul ations.  If a government regulatory  authori ty requests an inspect ion during the study  or 
after its com pletion, the invest igator must inform the sponsor immediately.
10.8 Handling of Study Drug
All study  drug will be supplied to the principal investigator (or a desi gnated pharm acist) by  
the sponsor.  Drug supplies must be kept in an appropriate secure area (eg, locked cabinet) 
and stored according to the condit ions specified on the drug labels.  The invest igator (or a 
designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of 
the study  drug in a drug accountabilit y ledger, a copy  of which must be given to the sponsor 
at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of study  drug di spensed to 
each subject must be available for inspect ion at any t ime.  The CRA will visit the site and 
review these documents along with a ll other study  conduct docum ents at appropri ate 
intervals once study  drug has been received by the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any  other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug lab els or any  partly used or unused 
drug supply before approval to do so by  the sponsor.  At the conclusio n of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the invest igator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug l abels, and a copy  of the com pleted drug di sposi tion form 
to the sponsor’s CRA (or desi gnated contractor) or, when approval is given by  the sponsor, 
will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.
10.9 Publication of Results
All manuscripts, abstracts, or othe r modes of presentati on arising fro m the resul ts of the 
study  must be reviewed and approved in writ ing by the sponsor in advance of submissio n 
pursuant to the terms and condit ions set forth in the executed Clinical Trial Agreement 
between the sponsor/CRO a nd the inst itution/investi gator.  The review is aimed at protecting 
the sponsor's proprietary  informat ion exist ing eit her at the date of the commencement of the

Boys Tanner Stage progression scale*
Genitalia:
1= The testes, scrotum and penis are about the same size and shape as they were when you were 
a child
2= The testes and scrotum are bigger.  The skin of the scrotum has changed.  The scrotum, the 
sack ho lding the testes, has gotten lower.  The penis has gotten o nly a little bigger.
3= The penis has grown in length.  The testes and scrotum have grown and dropped lower.
4= The penis has gotten even bigger.  It is sider.  The glans (the head of the penis) is bigger.  The 
scrotum  is darker than before. It is bigger b ecause the testes are bigger.
5= The penis, scrotum, and testes are the size and shape o f an adult man.
Pubic Hair:
1= There i s no pubi c hai r at all .
2= There i s a litt le soft, long, light ly-colored hair. Most of the hair is at the base of the penis.
This hair may  be strai ght or a litt le curly.
3= The hair is darker in this stage. It is more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers a bigger 
area.
4= the hair is now as dark, curly , and course as that of an adult man.  The area that the hair 
covers i s not as big as that of an adult man.  The hair has NOT spread out to the legs.
5= The hair has spread out to the legs.  The hair is now like that of an adult man. It covers the 
same area as that of an adult man.
Girls Tanner Stage progression scale
Breast:
1= The nipple is raised a little. The rest of the breast is st ill flat.
2= This i s the breast bud stage.  In this stage, the nipple is raised more than in stage 1.  The 
breast i s a small  mound.  The areol a is l arger than stage 1.
3= The breast and areola are both l arger than in stage 2.  The areola does not stick out away  from 
the breast.

5= This i s the mature adul t stage.  The breasts are fully  devel oped. Only  the nipple sticks out in 
this stage.  The areola has mo ved back in the general shape o f the breast.
Pubic Hair:
1= There i s no pubi c hai r at all .
2=There i s a litt le soft, long lightly -colored hair.  This hair may  be strai ght or a litt le curly.
3= The hair is darker in this stage. It is coarser more curled. It has spread out and thinly covers 
a bigger area.
4= the hair is now as dark, curly , and co urse as that of an adult female. The area that the hair 
covers i s not as bi g as that of an adult female. The hair has NOT spread out to the legs.
5= The hair is now like that of an adult female. It covers the same area as that of an adult 
female. The h air usually form s a tri angular (V) pattern as it spreads out to the legs.

FINAL: 08 Oct 2019Confidential Page 115of 119Appendix 11 Pharmacodynamic, and Other Biomarker Research
Subjects enro lled in this clinical study will have biologic samples collected for 
pharmacodynamic (PD), and other bio marker analysis.  These samples may be used for 
discovery  or validat ion to i dentify biomarkers that may be used for exploratory  evaluati on of  
response and/or safet y-related outcomes as well as for use in diagnost ic development.
Collect ion of the PD, and other biomarker samples will be bound by the sample principles and 
processes o utlined in the main study protocol.  Sample co llection for PD, and other bio marker 
analysis is required as per the study  protocol  unless the collect ion and use o f the sam ples is 
prohibited by specific country  laws.
Sample Collection and Handling
The sample s will  be collected according to the study  flow chart.  If, for operational or medical 
reasons, the genomic DNA blood sample cannot be obtained at the prespecified visit, the sample 
can be taken at any  study  center vi sit at the di scret ion of the invest igator and site staff.
Security of the Samples, Use of the Samples, Retention of the Samples
Sample processing, for example DNA and/or RNA extraction, genoty ping, sequencing, or other 
analysis will be performed by a laboratory  under the di rection of  the sponso r.  Processing, 
analysis, and storage will be performed at a secure laboratory  facility to protect the validit y of 
the data and maintain subject privacy.
Samples will  only be used for the purposes described in this protocol.  Laboratories contracted to 
perform the analysis on behalf of the sponsor will not retain rights to the samples bey ond those 
necessary  to perform  the specified analysis and will not transfer or sell those samples.  The 
sponsor will not sell the samples to a third party .
Samples will  be stored for up to 15 y ears after the complet ion of the study  (defined as 
submissio n of the clinical study  report to the appropriate regulatory  agencies).  At the end of the 
storage peri od, sam ples will  be destroy ed.  Sam ples m ay be stored l onger if a healt hauthori ty (or 
medicinal product approval agency ) has active questi ons about the study .  In this special 
circumstance, the sam ples will  be stored until the questions have been adequately  addressed.
It is possible that future research and technological advances may ident ify geno mic variants of 
interest, or allow alternat ive types of geno mic analysis not foreseen at this t ime.  Because it is 
not possible to prospectively define every  avenue of future t esting, all samples collected will be 
single or double coded (according to the ICH E15 guidelines) in order to maintain subject 
privacy . 
Right to Withdraw
If, during the time the samples are stored, a participant would like to withdraw his/her consent 
forparticipation in this research, Eisai will destroy the samples.  Information fro m any assays

necessary  to protect the integri ty of the research project.
Subj ect Privacy and Return of Data
No subj ect-ident ifying informat ion (eg, init ials, date of birth, government identifying number) 
will be associated with the sample.  All PD and other bio marker samples will be single coded.  
Geno mic DNA samples used to explor e the effects on PK, treatm ent response, and safet y will be 
single coded .  Genomic DNA samples that will be stored for long -term use (defined as 15 y ears 
after the com pletion of the study ) will be doubl e coded.  Doubl e coding invo lves remo ving the 
initial code (subject ID) and replacing wit h another code such that the subject can be re -
ident ified by use of 2 code keys.  The code key s are usually held by different parties.  The key  
linking the sample ID to the subject number will be maintained separately fro m the sam ple.  At 
this point, the samples will be double -coded, the first code being the subject number.  Laboratory  
personnel performing genetic analysis will not have access to the “key.”  Clinical data collected 
as part of the clinical study will be cle aned of subject i dentifying informat ion and linked by use 
of the sam ple ID “key.”
The sponsor will take steps to ensure that data are protected accordingly and confidentialit y is 
maintained as far as possible.  Data from subjects enro lled in this study may be analyzed 
worldwide, regardless o f location of  collect ion.
The sponsor and its representatives and agents may share coded data with persons and 
organi zations involved in the conduct or oversight of this research.  These include:
Clinical research organi zations retained by the sponsor 
Independent ethics commit tees or institutional review boards that have responsibilit y for this 
research study  
National regulatory  authori ties or equivalent government agencies
At the end of the analysis, results may  be pre sented in a final report which can include part or all 
of the coded data, in list ing or summary format.  Other publicat ion (eg, in peer -reviewed 
scientific journals) or public presentation of the study  resul ts will only  include summaries of the 
popul ation in the study , and no i dentified individual  resul ts will be disclosed.
Given the research nature of the PD, and other biomarker analysis, it will not be possible to 
return individual data to subjects.  The results that may be generated are not currently ant icipated 
to have clinical relevance to the patients or their family  members.  Therefore, these results will 
not be di sclosed to the pati ents or thei r physicians.
If at any  time, PD, and/or other bio marker results are obtained that may have clinical relevan ce, 
IRB review and approval will be sought to determine the most appropriate manner of disclo sure 
and to determine whether or not validation in a Clinical Laboratory  Improvement Am endments 
(CLIA) -certified setting will be required.  Sharing of research dat a with individual patients

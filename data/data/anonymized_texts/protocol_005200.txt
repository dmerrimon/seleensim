9.2 Study Assessments  Revised Table 9 -1 Schedule of Assessments as follows: 
Migraine history (including MBS for the co- primary analysis) and 
current treatment status  
9.2.1.1  Screening (Visit 
1) (Day -21 to Day -1)Clarification that subjects w ere to collect at least 1 migraine episode 
during the screening period as follows:  
An eDiary will be dispensed at V1 to collect at least 1  migraine 
episode during the screening period and, if eligible , the subject 
will be  is randomized (V2) and will continue to collect migraine data 
through end of treatment (V4/ET).   
Clarification of the following  Screening Visit assessment : 
Demographics, medical history, prior medications, and migraine
history (including associated s
ymptoms  and MBS for the co-
primary analysis , medications taken for migraine management,
satisfaction and headache pain relief with current medication)
9.2.1.4.1  Efficacy 
Assessments Using 
eDiary  Clarification that subjects w ere to  collect at least 1 migraine episode 
during the screening period. Added clarification to eDiary 
assessment process.   
Subjects will be provided with an eDiary at screening (V1) to collect 
at least 1 migraine attack during the screening period. 
The migraine episode may be treated with medication the 
subject currently uses for a migrai
ne during this period, unless 
otherwise instructed by the Investigator. After at least 1 
migraine attack has been recorded in the eDiary, as instructed, 
the subject will contact the study site to schedule Visit 2 (V2). 
At V2 (randomization), it will be determined if subjects meet all 
study requirements and are eligible to continue in the study. If 
a subject does not meet all requirements, they must return all study equipment that was provided at the Screening Visit.  If 
randomized, subjects will  continue to collect migraine data (for a 
migraine attack treated with study drug), study drug, last food intake 
and fat content, and any rescue medication used to treat a migraine. 
Subjects will record migraine predose assessments, study drug date 
and time taken, and postdose efficacy data in real time in the 2 DB 
periods through V4/ET:  
Addition of the following statement: 
MBS will also be collected during Screening via Migraine 
History evaluation and this Screening MBS will be used for the

Each DB treatment period will have a Randomized Set. The randomized set for DB1 will include all subjects 
who give 
informed consent and are eligible for and randomized into the 
DB1 treatment period. The randomized set for DB2 will include 
all subjects in the randomized set for DB1 who are eligible for 
and are re- randomized into the DB2 treatment period.

•Revised: The proportion of subjects who have pain relief
(defined as a reduction in migraine pain from predose severe
[Grade 3] or moderate [Grade 2]  to mild [Grade 1], or none
[Grade 0] pain, respectively)  at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1,
1.5, 2, 4, and 24 hours postdose compared between DFN -15
and placebo in each DB period; added definition of headachepain relief as follows:  Headache pain relief is defined for DB1
as a reduction from moderate or severe pain prior to dosing
reduced to mild or none postdose, and for DB2 as moderate
or severe pain predose  reduced to mild or none postdose,
or mild pain predose  reduced to none postdose
•Revised: The p ropor tion of subjects with their predose
Screening MBS ( and have this symptom predose) absent at
15, 30, and 45 minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2 (DB2 period), 4, and 24
hours postdose compared between DFN -15 and placebo in each
DB period
•Revised: To assess the proportion of subjects who have
sustained pain relief at 2 to 24 hours, postdose (i.e., pain-free
relief  at 2 hours postdose, with no use of rescue medication and
no recurrence of headache pain within 2 to 24 hours postdose
compared between DFN- 15 and placebo in each DB period
•Revised: Treatment satisfaction at 2 hours and 4 hours postdoseas determined on a 7- point scale compared between DFN- 15
and placebo in each DB period. DFN- 15 will also be compared
to the same question in the baseline PPMQ -R
10.5.1  Primary Efficacy 
Analysis  Modified: The first co -primary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of 
subjects who are free from headache pain at 2  hours after the first 
dose of study drug taken for a migraine attack with moderate to 
severe headache pain during the DB1 period, will be analyzed using 
Fisher’s exact test. The second co- primary efficacy endpoint of the 
proportion of subjects who are free from their Screening MBS 
among nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2  hours postdose 
during the DB1 period will be similarly analyzed using Fisher’s exact 
test. A subject’s MBS will be obtained at Screening via Migraine 
History assessment and, for the analysis of the co- primary 
endpoint, that symptom must be present predose but does not 
have to be designated as the MBS at predose.  
10.5.3  Explo ratory 
Analysis  Revised:  No exploratory analysis is planned . Exploratory analyses 
based on predose pain level and predose MBS are planned and 
details will be provided in the SAP.

CONFIDENTIAL  Sample Size  The second co -primary endpoint is the comparison of the proportion 
of subjects who are free from their Screening  MBS among nausea, 
photophobia, and phonophobia at 2  hours after the first dose of 
study drug. It is assumed that 28.2% of placebo and 44.7% of 
DFN- 15 (treated) subjects will be free from their Screening MBS at 
2 hours. A sample size of 480  subjects will provide 94% power to 
detect this assumed difference between placebo and DFN -15 at a 
5% (2- sided) level of significance and with a 15% dropout rat e.

Title:  A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -
Controlled, Efficacy, Tolerability , and Safety Study of DFN- 15 
in Episodic Migraine With or Without Aura  
Study Drug/ 
Investigational Product:  DFN- 15, Celecoxib Oral Solution, 120 mg (25 mg/mL)  
Country:  United States of America  
Phase : 3 
Co-Primary Objectives: To assess the proportion of subjects who are pain- free at 
2 hours postdose (first treated DB1 attack)  
To asses
s the proportion of subjects who are free from their 
Screening most
 bothersome symptom (MBS) among nausea, 
photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours postdose (first 
treated DB1 attack)   
Number of Subject s: Approximately 600 subject s will be randomized . Subject s who 
discontinue study participation prior to completing the study 
will not be replaced.  
Study Design:  This is a randomized, 2 double -blind (DB) treatment period 
study, to be conducted at approximately 45 centers in the 
United States. Male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years old 
(inclusive), previously diagnosed with at least 12 months ’ 
medical history prior to screening of episodic migraine (per 
International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition 
[beta version]1 [ICHD- 3]), who do no t have medication 
overuse, who experience 2 to 8 migraine attacks (with or 
without aura) per month, with 14 or fewer headache days per 
month, who can demonstrate 48 hours of headache- free time 
between migraine attacks, and who meet all inclusion and 
none o f the exclusion criteria and successfully complete all 
screening procedures, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in a 
DB fashion to receive orally either DFN -15 or matching 
placebo, to be used in one migraine attack.  
During the first double- blind (DB1) period, 1 migraine attack 
will be treated with study drug as soon as (and no more than 
1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe pain level. 
Subjects will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days of the first treatment and, if continuing to be elig ible, will be re -
randomized into a second double- blind (DB2) period to treat 
another attack at any pain level. They will then return to the 
study site within 2 to 7 days of the second treatment  at the

CONFIDENTIAL  final visit (V isit 4/early termination [ V4/ET]). 
Study  drug should only be used to treat a new migraine 
attack, not a recurrence, and there should be at least 48 
hours of pain and symptom freedom from a previous attack. 
Once randomized, the total duration of each subject’s 
participation in the study would be up to 10 weeks from 
baseline.  
During the treatment periods, data regarding the study drug 
effect and the associated impact on migraine pain, symptoms, 
functional disability, and subjects’ satisfaction with treatment 
will be collected in real-time in an ele ctronic diary (eDiary) 
(Section 9.2.1.4.1 ). After study completion or discontinuation, 
subjects should be referred to their usual healthcare 
professional to resume pre-study standard of care, as per the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
During the 2 treatment periods of the study, subjects will have 
an option, if required, to take rescue medication after the 
2 hours postdose time point efficacy data have  been recorded 
in the eDiary. Rescue medication will be decided between the 
Investigator and the subject , exclusive of study prohibited 
medications. Rescue medication will not be provided by the 
Sponsor, and its use should be managed by the subject and 
their Investigator . 
Treatment:  For the DB1 period, all subject s will be randomly assigned in 
a 1:1 ratio to receive either  DFN- 15 or a matching placebo t o 
be used to treat 1 migraine attack as soon as (and no more 
than within 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe 
pain. Eligible subject s will then be re -randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
into the DB2 period to receive either DFN- 15 or a matching 
placebo to treat another migraine attack  at any pain level. The 
migraine attacks and associated treatment and assessments 
are to be  recorded in an eDiary.  
Study Duration:  The duration of study participation will be up to approximately  
13 weeks, including a screening period of approximately 
3 weeks  (wherein subjects may be randomized earlier if they 
meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and headache assessment 
criteria; the screening period may also be extended based on 
Investigator judgment and in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor ), 2 DB treatment periods with up to 4 weeks allowed 
to experience and treat a migraine attack in each, and 2 to 7 days to return to the site after treatment . Once randomized, 
the total duration of each subject’s participation in the study 
would be up to 10 weeks from b aseline.  
Study Population:  Male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years old (inclusive),

CONFIDENTIAL  3 Introduction  
Acute migraine is a disabling neurological disorder with clinical findings of headache, often 
associated with nausea and vomiting. In the United States ( US), about 17% of all women and 
6% of all men suffer from migraine. 
Although the exact mechanism of migraine is not known, the pathophysiology involves a 
combination of vascular and neurologic events in the brain and cranial meninges brain l eading 
to trigeminal -vas
cular activation and release of vasoactive peptides .2 Radiologic findings in 
migraine patients are characterized by hyper -excitation of neuronal networks in multiple cortical 
regions, the brainstem, and the trigeminal nerve ganglion.2-4  
Typical clinical characteristics of migraine headache are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain, aggravation by routine physical  activity, and association with nausea 
and/or 
photophobia and phonophobia. It is important to initiate pharmacotherapy as early as 
possible to abort the migraine before it becomes more resistant to treatment.  
Triptans are the mainstay of acute migraine tr eatment .5 A current challenge with oral and nasal 
triptans is a relatively slow ra te of absorption with corresponding lag in onset of action result ing 
in slower pain relief for some migraine patients .6 Sumatriptan subcutaneous injections have a 
faster onset of action, but tolerability and patient acceptance are lower than for oral triptans .7,8 
Opioids are another treatment option, but they have a high rate of adverse events (AEs) and 
abuse potential .9-11 Guidelines published in 2012 by the American Society of Anesthesiology 
Task Force on Acute Pain Management recommend minimizing opioids and maximizing non-opioid agents in the contr ol of acute pain.
12 
Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs ) are a group of drugs with analgesic, antipyretic, 
and ant
i-inflammatory effects t hat act by inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis through 
isoenzymes, cyclooxygenase ( COX )-1 and COX -2.13 NSAIDs that selectively inhibit the COX -2 
enzyme target those prostaglandins that are responsible for inflammation and pain (synthesized 
involving COX -2) while sparing the prostaglandins that are responsible for the maintenance and 
protection of the gastr ointestinal ( GI) tract (synthesized involving COX -1). Thus, the analgesic 
efficacy of NSAIDs is associated with inhibition of COX -2, whereas a majority of GI adverse 
effects, including bleeding and ulcers of the stomach and intestine appear to be relat ed to the 
inhibition of COX- 1. The use of COX -2–selective NSAIDs may provide a therapeutic advantage 
over non- selective NSAIDs for the acute management of migraine due to reduced incidence of 
upper GI ulcer s and bleeds and less GI upset.  Celecoxib, a selective COX -2 inhibitor, is 
available as an oral capsule in several dosage strengths marketed in the US by Pf izer, Inc. 
under the brand name Celebrex® for the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, 
ankylosing spondylitis, acute pain, and primary dysmenorrhea.  
NSAIDs can produce analgesia that is comparable with that observed with opioid administration, while sparing patients many of the opioid- associated side effects such as sedation, nausea 
and 
vomiting. The analgesic effect of celecoxib is similar to  other NSAIDs. 
There is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved oral liquid formulation of 
celecoxib. DFN- 15 is a new oral liquid formulation containin
g the COX -2–selective NSAID, 
celecoxib. It is proposed that DFN -15 will be administered to migraine patients as an oral liquid 
in a single dose of 120 mg. Celecoxib is the only active ingredient in the formulation.

CONFIDENTIAL  DFN- 15 or DFN -15 pr ot otypes were investigated in 5 clinical trials that include d 3 bioavailability 
studies (DFN- 15-CD-001, DFN- 15-CD-003, and DFN -15-CD-004) conducted in healthy 
volunteers, 1 food-effect study (DFN- 15-CD-005) in healthy volunteers, and 1 proof -of-concept 
Phase 2, placebo- controlled, double- blind  (DB), crossover study (DFN- 15-CD-002) to 
demonstrate the tolerability, safety,  and efficacy of DFN -15 for the treatment of acute migraine 
headaches (with or without aura).  Details are provided in the DFN -15 Investigator’s Brochure.14 
The rationale for performing clinical studies with DFN- 15 is to demonstrate i ts tolerability, safety, 
and efficacy for the acute relief of migraine with or without aura. The ultimate aim is to provide 
an alternative oral liqui d NSAID for migraine patients. Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories will seek an 
indication for DFN- 15 for the acute treatment  of episodic migraine with or without aura.

5 Investigational Plan 
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a randomized, 2 DB treatment period study, to be conducted at multiple centers in the 
US. Male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years old (inclusive), previously diagnosed with at least 
12 months ’ medical history prior to screening  of episodic migraine ( as defined by International 
Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition [beta version]1 [ICHD- 3]), who do not have 
medication overuse, who experience 2 to 8 migraine attacks (with or without aura) per month, 
with 14 or fewer headache days per month, who can demonstrate 48 hours of headache -free 
time between migraine attacks, and who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria 
and successfully complete all screening procedures, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in a DB 
fashion to receive orally either DFN- 15 or matching placebo, to be used in one migraine attack.  
During the first double -blind (DB1) period, 1 migraine attack will be treated with study drug as 
soon as (and no more than 1 hour after) experiencing moderate to severe pain level. Subjects 
will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days of the first treatment and, if continuing  to be 
eligible,  will be re -randomized into a second double- blind (DB2) period to treat another attack at 
any pain level. They will then return to the study site within 2 to 7 days of the second treatment  
for the final visit (V isit 4/early termination [ V4/ET]). See Figure 5-1. 
Study drug should only be used to treat
 a new migraine attack, not a recurrence, and there 
should be at least 48 hours of pain and s
ymptom freedom from a previous attack . Once 
randomized, the total duration of each subject’s participation in the study would be up to 10 weeks  from b aseline . 
During the treatment periods, data regarding the study drug effect and the associated impact on migraine pain, symptoms, functional di
sability, and subjects’ satisfaction with treatment will be 
collected in real-time in an electronic diary (eDiary)  (Section 9.2.1.4.1 ). After study completion or 
discontinuation, subjects should be r
eferred to their usual healthcare professional to resume 
pre-study standard of care, as per the Investigator’s discretion.  
During the 2 treatment periods of the study, subjects will have an option, if required, to take rescue medication after the 2 hours 
postdose time point efficacy data have  been recorded in the 
eDiary. Rescue medication will be decided between the Investigator and the subject, exclusive of study prohibited medications. Rescue medication will not be provided by the Sponsor, and its use should be managed by the subject and their Investigator .

5.2 Discussion 
of Study Design  
The current study desi g
n was chosen to determine the efficacy of DFN-15 for the acute 
treatment of episodic  migraine with or without aura. A screening per iod will allow sufficient time 
for screening laboratory test results availability and verification tha t subject s meet the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria.  
Subject s will be randomized in a blinded fashion to receive DFN- 15 or matching placebo and 
s
elf-administer when experiencing a migraine attack to determine whether  DFN- 15 can relieve 
migraine pain and symptoms and disability  compared with placebo. For the first treated acute 
migraine attack  (DB1 period) , subject s will treat moderate or severe pain to meet regulatory 
requirement s for efficacy determination; for the second attack  (DB2 period) , subject s will treat  
migraine at any pain level to determine if efficacy is achieved throughout the pain level range.  
During the treatment periods, subjects will have an option, if required, to take rescue medication 
after the 2 hours post
dose time  point efficacy data has been recorded in the eDiary. Rescue 
medication will be decided between the Investigator and the subject to provide subject  comfort 
while support ing clinically relevant data collection  (see Section 8.5.2 ). Rescue medication will 
not be provided by the Sponsor, 
and its use should be managed by the subject and their 
Investigator . 
6 Selection of Subject s and Criteria for Withdrawal  
6.1 Number of P lanned Subject s 
Approximately 600 subject s will be r andomized. Subject s who do not qualify for enrollment  after 
the screening period will be terminated as screen failures  and will be replaced. Randomized 
subject s who discontinue study participation before study completion will not be replaced.

6.3.1  Addit
ional Exclusion Criteria  Clarification  for SBP/DBP and QTcF  
S
ubjects  presenting with a history of hypertension that is uncontrolled during screening (i.e., 
SBP/ DBP ˃ 140/90 mmHg), whether on treatment 
or not, will be excluded. Subjects  who had 
high or uncontrolled blood pressures  in the past  and are  currently controlled with given 
therapies  would be eligible for this study.  
Independent of past history, if a subject has a sustained resting SBP/DBP  ˃ 140/90  mmHg  at 
V1 or V2 they should be excluded. If a subject has a sustained SBP/DBP ˃ 140/90 mmHg at a 
visit after V2, they should be discontinued from the study . Any subject  without  a known history 
of hypertension that presents at screening with SBP/DBP ˃ 140/90 mmHg should be excluded 
(if at V1 or V2) or discontinued (if at a visit after V2) if the blood pressure  reading is due to 
suspected hypertension or another pathological condition, not if due to a transient fluctuation , 
based on the Investigator’s evaluation. If the Investigator believes the blood pressure is falsely

CONFIDENTIAL  elevated, they should repeat the assessment 2 to 3 tim es with the subject  in a semi -reclined 
position in a quiet room. Subjects  with persistent elevations , despite repeat assessments , 
should be excluded and referred to an appropriate healthcare provider for further assessment . 
For subjects presenting at screening with an ECG QTcF > 450 msec (based on central ECG 
interpretation), the following procedures should be conducted:  
1.Wait until all other inclusion and exclusion criteria have been satisfied.
2.If the subject otherwise appears eligible for the study, with prior Medical Monitor approval,
have the subject 
return and conduct 2  ECGs with a minimum of 5 minutes  between tracings.
3.Transmit these additional ECGs to  for central interpretation.
4. Based on the central reader interpretation, if both repeat ECGs show a QTcF ≤450 msec,
the subject may
 continue in the study at the Investigator's discretion. If one or both repeat
ECGs show QTcF >450 msec, the subject must be screen failed based on Exclusion Criteria
#20.
At Visit 2 or Visit 3, a dditional clarif ication for QTcF >450 msec (based on  interpretation)  is 
as follows:   
1. For QTcF between 451 msec and 460 msec (inclusive) , the subjec t may continue in the
study if the Investigator assesses the ECG as not clinically significant (NCS).
2. For QTcF >460 msec:
a)Instruct t
he subject not to take the study drug u ntil further notice.
b)If the Investigator has assessed the ECG as NCS, have the subject return, after
Medical Monitor
 approval, to conduct 2 ECGs with a minimum of 5 minutes between
tracings.
c)Transmit these additional ECGs to for central interpretation.
d)If one or bo
th ECGs again shows QTcF >460 msec, based on the central reader,
then the subject must be discontinued from the study .
6.4 Removal of Subject s from Therapy or Assess ments  
Subject s are free to withdraw from the study at any time without providing any reason(s) fo r 
wi
thdrawal and without prejudice to further treatment. If a subject  is to be withdrawn from the 
study by the Investigator, the Investigator should first alert the Medical Monitor, if safety allows, 
or as soon as possible thereafter.  
Subjects  may be withdrawn from the study  for any of the following reasons, and the date and 
reason(s) for withdrawal will be documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF ): 
1. A subject  develops any sig nificant illness, or needs to undergo any acute major surgery,
during the course of the study.
2. A subject  was enrolled and observed to violate any protocol requirement that may affect
the outcome of the study.
3. A subject  withdraws con sent.
4. The Investigator deems it may not be safe or proper for the subject to continue i n the
study.

CONFIDENTIAL  8.1.1  Screening (Visit 1)  
After 
written informed consent is obtained and the subject  has been confirmed as qualifying to 
enter the screening period, the Investigator  or designee will contact the designated interactive 
web response system (IWRS)  to obtain a unique subject  identification  (ID) number  to be used 
throughout the study . This subject  ID number will not be reused for any other participant in the 
study . This unique  identifier  comprises the numerical order of the subject s screened and will be 
used to identify the subject  on the eCRF. 
8.1.2  Randomization  (Visit 2)  
Once a subject ’s eligibilit
y for enrollment has been confirmed at the end of the screening period, 
the Investigator (or designee) should contact the IWRS  centralized randomization c enter to 
receive the subject  study drug kit assignment . Subject s who do not meet eligibility criteria will be 
registered as screen failures. It is important that the study  staff reconfirm the subject ’s 
willingness to continue in the study before  randomizing the subject  to a treatment.  
The planned treatment given to individual subject s will be determined by a randomizati on 
scheme prepared by the biostatistics group of . For both DB periods, all subject s 
will receive orally DFN- 15 or a matching placebo in a randomized 1:1 treatment sequencing. As 
detailed in Section 5.1, subject s will treat 1 migraine attac k in the DB1 period and, if eligible, be 
re-randomized to enter into the DB2 period. The IWRS will assign the appropriate study drug  kit 
to each subject  for each treatment period. If a subject  discontinues from the study after 
randomization, the subject  ID number will not be reused, and the subject  will not be allowed to 
re-enter the study.  Subject s will be required to return unused study drug  and the eDiary  
provided by the site.  
8.2 Dose Selection  
Test doses of DFN- 15, Cel
ecoxib Oral Solution, 120 mg to 240 mg (50 mg/mL ) exhibited dose 
proportional bioavailability. The median time to peak concentration of celecoxib oral solution 
was faster (0.67 h) compared to Celebrex (2 h).  The mean maximum concentration values and 
mean of partial areas under the curve (AUCs ) (from AUC 0-0.25 to AUC 0-2.00) of DFN- 15, Celecoxib 
Oral Solution 50 mg/mL  were higher than Celebrex.  
DFN- 15, Celecoxib Oral Solution 50 mg/mL showed 60% lower maximum  concentration 
following administration of celecoxib under fed conditions than those following administration under fasting conditions. Overall bioavailability in terms of AUC was comparable under fasting 
and fed conditions.  
A proof -of-concept, randomized, placebo- co
 ntrolled, DB, crossover study in patients with 
migraine headaches (with or without aura) showed an increased response with use of DFN -15, 
with the greatest response in the 120 mg DFN -15 treatment group, although the differences 
from 240 mg were not statistically significant , suggesting a ceiling effect at 120 mg.  
DFN- 15, Celecoxib Oral Solution 50 mg/mL was shown to be safe and well tolerated in all 
studies.  Subsequently, DFN -15 is
 now being developed as a 25 mg/mL oral solution and, 
considering the outcome from the proof of concept study, a dose of 120  mg for the active arm 
was selected for the Phase 3 studies . See the DFN-15 Investigator’s Brochure for additional 
information  on the completed studies .14

CONFIDENTIAL  8.3 Selection and Timin g of Dose for Each Subject  
At the end of the screening period, eligible subject s will be randomized to receive study drug 
(DFN- 15 or a matchi
ng placebo) as described in Section 5.1. Information about use of study 
drug, predos e and postdos e assessments , and any rescue medi
cation taken during the study 
will be recorded in the eDiary. For dosing information, see Section 7.1.  
8.4 Blinding  
In order to blind the study treatment,  study drug ki
ts with identical labeling appearance will be 
as
signed unique kit numbers by IWRS and the kits will be distributed by  to 
the site  before  the start of dosing . 
This is a DB study. All randomization data will be kept stric tly confidential and accessible only to 
authorized personnel until the time of unblinding after database lock at the end of study . 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in th e event of a medical 
emergency for an individual subject , in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical 
to the subject ’s management, the blind for the subject  may be broken by the Investigator  (or 
designee)  by contacting IWRS . Before unblinding, the Investigator  (or designee)  should have 
determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the subject ’s immediate 
management, and must make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor before  unblinding. In 
many cases, especially if the  emergency is clearly not related to study treatment, the problem 
may be properly managed without unblinding by assuming that the subject  is receiving active 
treatment. In cases of accidental unblinding or when the Medical Monitor cannot be contacted 
befor e unblinding, the Medical Monitor should be contacted as soon as possible after the 
breaking of the blind and every attempt to preserve the blind for all other study staff should be made.  
8.5 Prior and C oncomitant Therapy 
Investigators should document in the  
eCRF all prior medications for neurological illnesses and 
conditions that the subject  has experienced anytime in the 
past, and other prior medications that 
were taken within 12 weeks before  screening. In addition, a ll concomitant and ongoing 
medications are to be documented in the eCRF.  (See also Section 6.3 Exclusion Criteria and 
Section 8.5.3  Prohibited and Allowed Medications .) 
8.5.
1 Medication History  
No chan
ge in any prophylactic migraine medications 
will be allowed during the study.  
Subject s will be able to continue their prescribed medications for mild, chronic medical 
conditions as long as the doses of these medications 
have been stabilized for at least 30 days  
before  screening and the medications are not otherwise prohibited or restricted in the protocol.  
See Section 8.5.3  for Prohibited and Allowed M edications.  
Washout periods : Subject s should not have taken the 
following medications in the time period 
described:

8.5.2  Rescue Med
ication  
When a subject gets a mig
raine attack, the study drug should not be taken if the subject has 
treated an episodic migraine att
ack acutely with any other medication within the past 48 hours, 
or if the subject  has used an analgesic for non- migraine pain acutely within the past 48 hours.  
If a subject  does not experience sufficient or any pain relief from the study drug, he/she may 
take rescue medication, if needed,  after 2 hours or more after taking the study dr ug, and only 
after completing the 2 hour s postdose assessments  in the eDiary . The specific rescue 
medication will initially be decided between the Investigator and the subject  before  or at V 2, but 
may be adjusted as needed during the treatment period, with the Investigator ensuring that 
prohibited medications ( Section 8.5.3 ) are not assigned and consulting with the Medical Monitor , 
if needed. Rescue medication will
 not be provided by the Sponsor, and its use should be 
managed by the subject  and their Investigator. Rescue medication related decisions should be 
detailed in the source documents. 
Rescue medication, including NSAIDs or other  migraine medications , prescription or 
non-prescription drugs, vitamins, herbal, and dietary supplements (including St John’s Wort) , 
should be taken as described above.  Subject s should not take prohibited medications listed in 
Section 8.5.3  as a rescue medication.  
8.5.3  Prohibited and Allowed Med
ications  
The following medications 
should not be taken during the study: 
•Antipsychotics  (within 30 days prior to randomi zation; if used for non- psychiatric conditions,
should be evaluated on a case- by-case basis with the Medical Monitor)
•Opioids  are prohibited  if used for ≥ 4 days per month
•CYP2C9 inducers (i.e. , carbamazepine, enzalutamide, nevirapi ne, phenobarbital, rifampin,
secobarbital, St. John’s wort) ; drugs in this category must not be taken within 7 days prior to
randomization and throughout the study.
•CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window (i.e. , thioridazine) ; drugs in th is
category must not be taken within 7 days prior to randomization and throughout the study
•Celecoxib  should not be taken concomitantl y with study drug or used as rescue medication
for study migraines

9 Study Procedures  
9.1 Duration of Treatment  
The duration of study participation will be up to approximately  13 weeks, including a screening 
period of approximately 3 weeks ( wherein subject s may be randomized earlier than 3 weeks 
provided they meet inclusion/exc
lusion criteria and headache assessment criteria; the screeni ng 
period may also be  exten ded beyond 3 weeks based on Investigator judgment and in 
consultation with the Medical Monitor), 2 DB treatment periods with up to 4 weeks (each period) 
for subject s to experience and treat migraine attacks, and 2  to 7 days for subject s to return to 
the site after each treatment. Once randomized, the total duration of each subject’s participation 
in the study would be up to 10  weeks from baseline.  Migraine attacks and associated treatment 
and assessments will be recorded in an eD iary (see Section 9.2.1.4.1 ). 
9.1.1  Data Recording U sing eDiary  
The eDiar y will be used to record migraine attack assessment data in real-time by subject s as 
described in Section 5.1 and Section 9.2.1
.4.1, and as shown in Table 9
-2. Due to the episodic 
nature of the condition, i t is important and  compulsory for all subject s to check -in the eDiar

2 Subject s who do not complete both DB periods will complete an ET visit.  
3 Subject s may be randomized earlier during this period if they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and headache assessment criteria. The screening period may also 
be extended based on Investigator judgment and in consultation with the Medical Monitor . 
4 Before eDiary dispensing, initial screening should determine to the extent possible that the subject  may be elig ble for the study and is able, willing, and 
understands after being instructed how to use the eDiary ; eDiary will be dispensed once if the subject  is randomized and used throughout the DB periods. At V2, 
randomized subject s will be instructed and re-trained on the eDiary usage to ensure real-time  entry of predose a nd postdos e assessments and the level of 
migraine pain to treat (moderate or severe for first treatment and of any pain level for the second).  Thereafter, randomized subjects will be reinstructed on eDiary 
usage, and re-trained on instructions as needed.   
5 Physical examination data will be recorded in the source at screening  (V1). A complete physical examination will be performed, including examination of head, 
eyes, ears, nose, and throat [HEENT], heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. At other visits, 
symptom-driven limited physical examination will be performed. Any subsequent untoward change during the study will be recorded as an AE.  Suicidal ity risk  will 
be determined and recorded at screening (V1)  and checked at all subsequent visits . Significant suicide risk, in the opinion of the Investigator , is exclusionary at 
V1 and V2. A  randomi zed subject will be discontinued if a significant suicide risk is determined at subsequent visits. At any visit, subjects who are a suicide risk 
should be referred to a mental health specialist. The Medical Monitor should also be notified.   
6 Weight only.  
7 Serum pregnancy test will be performed at screening (V1) for all female subject s of childbearing potential. 
8 Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at all study visits after screening for all female subject s of childbearing potential.  
9 Subject s will be instructed by the study site staff on the proper administration of study drug to ensure compliance. Written instructions for use of the study drug 
will be distributed to Investigator sites and subject s should be confirmed to have, or be provided with, the instructions every time study drug is dispensed.  
10 Unused study drug returned by subject s should not be redispensed.  
11 When the subject  experiences a migraine episode they should contact the site within 1 day  of treating with study drug to schedule their next visit. The eDiary will 
be used to record all migraine attacks treated with study drug during the study period.  
12 Screening eDiary information will be kept in the source. It is compulsory for al l subject s to check -in the eDiary every day during the entire study period. If a 
subject  does not consistently check -in or does not report a migraine attack in the eDiary for 2-3 weeks, it is recommended they should be contacted by study 
staff to check if the subject  has technical difficulties or confirm they have not experienced a migraine.  
13 Arrangements should be made by the site for a timely return of the eDiary device for subject s who screen fail.

fficacy  Assessments 
Subject s 
will be provided with an eDiar y at screening (V1) to collect at least 1 migraine attack  
during the screening period. Th e migraine episode may be treated with medication the subject 
currently  uses for a migraine during this period, unless otherwise instructed by the Investigator . 
After at least 1 migraine attack has been recorded in the eDiary,  as instructed, the subject will 
contact the study site to schedule Visit 2 (V2). At V 2 (randomization), it will be determined if 
subjects  meet all study requirements  and are eligible to continue in the study. If a subject  does  
not meet all requirements, they must return all study equipment that was provided at the 
Screening Visit.  If randomized, subjects will continue to collect migraine dat a (for a migraine 
attack treated with study drug ), study drug, last food intake and fat content, and any rescue 
medication used to treat a migraine . Subjects will rec ord migraine predose assessments, study 
drug date and time taken , and postdose efficacy data in real time in the 2 DB periods through 
V4/ET:  
•Level of headache pain at predose and at various time points postdose (Levels:  0 =
none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe)
•Time to meaningful pain relief (based on subject’s perception) and time to
pain- freedom  after stu
dy drug
•Migraine symptoms and MBS  other than pain: naus ea, photophobia, and
phonophobia at predose and at various time  points postdose; allodynia
•Functional disability at predose and at various tim e points postdose ; scale : 0 = no
disability, able to function normally; 1 = performance of daily activities mildly
impaired, can still do everything but with difficulty; 2 = performance of daily activitiesmoderately impaired, unable to do some things; 3 = performance of  daily activities
severely impaired, cannot do all or most things, bed rest may be necessary
•Treatment satisfaction (7 -point scale)

CONFIDENTIAL  Visits may be scheduled as needed for AE management. Adverse event and concomitant 
medication review should be performed at each unscheduled visit. Any protocol -specified safety 
assessment may be repeated or conducted unscheduled as necessary to ensure subject  safety.  
9.2.2.1  Physical Examination  and Suicidality  Check 
A complete physical ex
amination will be performed at screening (V1) by the Investigator, or 
medically qualified designee, and will inc
lude examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and 
throat [HEENT], heart, lungs, abdomen, skin, cervical and axillary lymph nodes, neurological, 
and musculoskeletal systems. All findings will be kept in the source  document . At all subsequent 
visits, symptom -driven limited physical examination will be performed and recorded. Any 
subsequent untoward change during the study will be recorded as an AE. In addition, medical 
history will be recorded at screening, including smoking history, if applicable.  
A suicidality  check  will be performed at screening (V1), ba seline (V2) , and at all other visits . In 
the event a subject is evaluated to be at risk  at V1 or V2 , in the opinion of the Investigator , the 
subject  will be excluded from the s tudy. A randomized subject will be discontinued if a 
significant suicide risk is determined at subsequent visits. At any visit, subjects who are found to 
be a suicide risk will be referred to a mental health specialist . The Medical Monitor should also 
be notified.  
9.2.2.2  Pregnancy 
All female subject s of childbearing pot
ential will be requi red to undergo a serum pregnancy test 
(hCG) at screening (V1), and a urine pregnancy test (beta hCG) at all subsequent study visits . 
All subject s confirmed to be pregnant at any  time during the study should be immediately 
discontinued. Female s ubject s of childbearing potential will be required to use an acceptable 
form of birth control from screening through the end of participation in the study. Although pregnancy is not an SAE,  the procedures to report pregnancies will be the same as the 
procedures detailed for reporting SAEs ( Section 9.2.2.7 ). Any pregnancy that occurs i n a female 
subject  (or female partner of 
 a male subject ) during the study, or within 30 days after taking the 
last dose of study drug , should be reported to Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories as described in Section 
9.2.2.7 . Pregnancies will be followed to the end, whether successful live birth or premature 
termination, type and date of delivery, any c
ongenital malformations or birth defects, or any 
other adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes, and reported on a follow -up Pregnancy Report. 
Sponsor will be notified of all the above pregnancy outcomes. Pregnancy will not be considered 
an AE.  
Male subject s (with female partner) must agree to practice a reliable form o f contraception or 
abstinence during the study.  
9.2.2.3  Clinical Laboratory Evaluation  
The following clinical laboratory
 evaluations will be performed in accordance with assessment 
time points outlined in Table 9-1.

visit (or at any other time during the study if needed to confirm a suspected pregnancy after a positive urine 
pregnancy test). A urine pregnancy test will be performed onsite at other time points for all female subjects of 
childbearing potential .  
Hematology  (including HbA1c), clinical chemistry , and  urinalysis  may be repeated during the study as needed to 
evaluate a patient’s condition. Tests not specified in the protocol may be allowed after discussion with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor or designee.

14624) . Reference ranges will be supplied by the central lab and will be used by the Investigator 
to assess the laboratory data for clinical significance and pathological changes.  
9.2.2.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs, incl
uding pulse rate, sitting SBP/DBP, and body temperature, will be collected at 
screening (V1) and a
t each study visit. Vital signs will be recorded after the subject  has rested in 
the sitting position for 5 minutes. (See additional exclusio n criteria for SBP/DBP screenings in 
Section 6.3.1 ). 
Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. 
Body  weight (without sho
es) will be recorded at screening and V4/ET, and height (without 
shoes) will be recorded at screening only.  
Start and stop dates of last menstrual cycle for all female subjects  of childbearing potential will 
be recorded at screening and at each study visit.

CONFIDENTIAL  Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant per the Investigator’s judgment 
or if machine/equipment errors occur. Out -of-range blood pressure, pulse rate, and body 
temperature measurements will be repeated at the Investigator’s discretion. Any confirmed clinically significant vital sign measurement in the Investigator’s opinion must be recorded as 
medical history or an AE, as applicable.  
9.2.2.5  Twelve -Lead Electrocardiogram  
A 12-lead resting ECG will be performed at screening (V1), and at every scheduled study visit , 
and will be reviewed initially by the Investigator for any immediate concerns, and then by a 
central reader,  
 At screeni ng, the Investigator will examine the ECG trac ings for signs of cardiac 
disease that could exclude the subject from the study. ECGs will be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  will provide ECG reports  to 
the sites and  via a portal . With the exception of QTc F evaluation as specified in 
Section 6.3.1 , the overall interpretation and determination of the clinical relevance of ECG 
findings will be the responsibility of the Investigator , taking into account the central reader’s 
evaluation,  and will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.  
9.2.2.6  Adverse Events  
Adverse Event D efinition 
An AE is 
defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject  administered a 
study
 drug  and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  A 
TEAE is an AE  with a start date on or after the initial dose of study drug  and up to 5 days after 
the last dose of study drug. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not related to the study drug. This includes an exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant 
worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded elsewhere in the eCRF . 
Anticipated fluctuations of pre- existing conditions, including the disease under study , that do not 
represent a clinically significant exacerbation or worsening need not be considered AEs . 
Migraine headaches will not be captured as AEs.  Migraine headaches will be captured by 
the subject  in the eDiary  provided to them .  
For the purpose of the site’s data collection r
 esponsibilities, any untoward event that started or 
worsened after the ICF was signed until the final end- of-study visit (inclusive) is to be 
considered an AE.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator  to document all AEs that  occur during the study. 
Adverse events  will be elicited by asking the subject  a non- leading question, for example, “Have 
you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since your last visit?”  
Adverse events  should be reported on the appropriate page of the eCRF .

Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd.  
DFN-15-CD-006  Protocol Amendment 1  Page 44 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL  Assessment of Severity 
Each AE will be assigned a category by the Investigator  as follows:  
Mild An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject , causes minimal 
discomfort , and does not interfere with everyday activities.  
Moderate  An AE that  is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities; intervention may be needed.  
Severe  An AE that prevents normal everyday activities; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed.  
If there is a change in severity of an AE, it must be recorded as a separate event.  
Assessment of C ausality 
Every
 effort will be made by the Investigator  t o assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the 
study drug. Causality should be assessed using the categories presented in the following table:  
Not Related  The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e .g., diseases, 
environment ), which should be s pecif ied if known ; or the event is 
most likely produced by other factors such as the subject ’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions , or concomitant therapy and does 
not follow a known response pattern to the study drug . 
Possibl y Related  The event is temporally related to study drug  use but can be 
explained by another etiology. Information on the effect of study 
product withdrawal may be lacking.  
Probabl y Related  The event is temporally related to study drug  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study drug and/or improves upon 
withdrawal of the study drug . 
Definitely Related  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study drug  administration and/or follows a known response pattern 
to the study drug and could not have been produced by other 
factors s uch as the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic intervention, 
or concomitant therapy and either occurs immediately following 
study drug  administration or improves on stopping the medication 
or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
Action Taken  
The Investigator  will report  the act ion taken in the appropriate section of the eCRF , as follows:  
•Dose not changed
•Drug interrupted
•Drug withdrawn
•Not applicable
•Unknown

CONFIDENTIAL  Follow -up of Adverse Events  
The Investigator  should follo w up on subject s with AEs until the event s are resolved or until, in 
the opinion of the Investigator , the event s have stabiliz ed or are determined to be chronic. 
Details of AE resolution must be documented in the eCRF . Subject s who have ongoing AEs at 
the time of study completi on or ET should be followed up for 30  days after receiving the last 
dose of study drug  or until the event s resolve, are stabilized, or determined to be chronic, 
whichever occurs first.  
Documentation and Reporting of Adverse  Events 
Adverse events  will be reported and documented in accordance with the procedures outlined in 
this section. Adverse event s will be reported from the time of informed consent  through V4/ET 
and documented on the relevant eCRF  pages.  The following data should be documented for 
each AE:  
•Description of the symptom event
•Classificat
ion of “serious” or “not serious ”
•Severity
•Dat
e of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicabl e)
•Action taken
•Causal relationship
•Outcome of event (unknown, recovered, not yet recovered, recovered with sequelae,
death [with dat
e and cause reported])
•Name and contact details of reporter
9.2.2.7  Ser
ious A
dverse Events 
Serious Adverse Event Def
inition  
An S
AE is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that, at any  dose:  
•Results in death.
•Is life-threatening . An AE is life -threatening if the subject  is at immediate risk of deat h from
the event as it occurs (i.e., it does not include a reaction that might have caused death if it
had occurred in a more serious form) .
•Requires or prolongs i npatient hospitalization. C omplicat ions occurring during
hospitaliz ation are AEs and are SAEs if they cause prolongation of the current
hospitalization.  Hospitaliz ation for elective treatment of a pre -existing non -worsening
condition is not, however, considered an AE.  The details of such hospitalizations must be
recorded on the medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF .
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . An AE is inc apacitating or disabling
if it results in a substantial or  permanent disruption of the subject ’s ability to c arry out
normal life functions.
•Is a c ongenital anom aly/birth defect.
In addition, medical and scientific judgment  is required to  decide if prompt notification is required 
in situations other than those de fined for SAEs above (i.e. , any event that the Investigator  
regards as serious that did not strictly meet the criteria above but that may have jeopardiz ed the 
subject  or required intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or that would

CONFIDENTIAL  Follow -up of Adverse Events 
All follow -up reports will  be subject to the same reporting timelines as the Initial Reports. Within 
24 hours of receipt of new information, the updated follow -up SAE form, along with any 
supporting documentation (e.g., subject  discharge summary or autopsy reports), should be 
faxed or emailed to the Sponsor.  
The Sponsor must be notified within 5 days if any subject  is wit hdrawn or discontinued study 
drug use due to an AE.  
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespectiv e of the suspected causality, will be monitored until 
the AEs have resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to baseline or stabilized 
at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor, until there is a satisfactory 
explanation for the changes observed, until the subject  is lost to follow -up, until the subject  has 
died, or until 30 days after the last dose of the study drug upon which subject s will be referred to 
their primary medical provider for follow -up. 
Unblinding Instructions 
Breaking the Blind 
The blind shoul
d be broken for all SAE IND safety reports that  are judged t o be expedited 
reports for submission to FDA.  
The unblinding procedures and follow -up will be perfo rmed in accordance with the protocol and 
the Sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs). 
Blinding is critical to the integrity of this clinical study; however, in the event of a medical 
emergency for 
an individual subject, in which knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical 
to the subject’s management, the blind for the subject may be broken by the Investigator (or designee) by contacting IWRS. Before unblinding, the Investigator (or designee) should have determined that the treatment information is necessary to decide the subject’s immediate 
management, and must make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor before  unblinding. In 
many cases, especially if the emergency is clearly not related to study treatment, the problem may be properly managed without unblinding by assuming that the subject is receiving active 
treatment. In cases of  accidental unblinding or when the Medical Monitor cannot be contacted 
before  unblinding, the Medical Monitor should be contacted as soon as possible after the 
breaking of the blind and every attempt to preserve the blind for all other study staff should be made.  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the subject ’s source
  
record, eCRF, and any associated AE report.  
If an Investigator, site personnel performing assessments, or subject  is unblinded, the 
unbl
inding incident and unblinded subject  must be listed as a major protocol deviation.  
A subject  for whom the blind is broken will discontinue study drug and be scheduled f or a safety 
follow -up visit and then discontinued from the study. The subject  will be encouraged to stay in 
the study until the AE is resolved or stabilized.

DFN-15-CD-006  Protocol Amendment 1  Page 48 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL  For all SAEs observed in the study considered to be drug related , a suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reaction ( SUSAR) will be reported by the Sponsor to the FDA as an unblinded 
IND Safety Report. All Investigators and the IRB will receive blinded reports. However, on the 
request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded reports directly to the IRB.  
Laboratory and Vital Signs Variables  
Vital signs and laboratory abnormalities should be reported as AEs if they are considered to be 
clinically signific
ant, as per the Investigator’s judgment. If an abnormal laboratory value is 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign/symptom should be reported as an AE , 
and the associated abnormal laboratory  result should be considered additional information.  
Pregnancy  
Although pregnancy is not an SAE, the procedures to report pregnancies will be the same as the procedures detailed 
above for reporting SAEs.  
Female subject s should not be pregnant  when entering  the study and must not become 
pregnant during the study; see Section 9.2.2.2  for additional details. Following administration of 
study drug, any k
nown cases of pregnancy in female subject s or male subject s who impregnate 
their female partners will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of occurrence. All female 
subject s will be withdrawn from the study and administration of study drug will be stopped. The 
pregnancy will be reported immediately by phone and by faxing/emailing a completed Pregnancy Report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The 
pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the Invest igator will follow the subject 
until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30  days after completion of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the 
Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow -up Pregnancy Report. If 
the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to 
be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator will report 
the event by phone and by faxing a completed SAE form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 
hours of knowledge of the event.  
Overdose 
Overdose is not anticipated in this study as sites will provide randomized subjects with only 1 
dose of study drug pe
r visit.   
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study drug within 
24 hours of becoming awar
e of the overdose. In the event an overdose leads to an SAE, it will 
be reported to the regulatory board, and medical management will be done by the Investigator 
on a case -by-case basis.  
Symptoms following acute NSAID overdose are usually limited to lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigas
tric pain, which are generally reversible with supportive care. 
Gastrointestinal bleeding can occur. Hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, 
and coma may occur, but are rare. Anaphylactoid reactions have been reported with therapeutic 
ingestion of NSAIDs, and may occur following an overdose.

CONFIDENTIAL  No overdoses of celecoxib were reported during clinical trials. Doses up to 2400 mg/day for up 
to 10 days in 12 patients did not result in serious toxicity. No information is available regarding 
the removal of celecoxib by hemodialysis, but based on its high degree of plasma protein 
binding (> 97%) , dialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose.  
Subject s should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an NSAID 
overdosage; there are n
o specific antidotes. Consider emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 to 
100 grams in adults, 1 to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients) and/or osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients seen within 4 hours of ingestion or in subjec ts with a lar ge 
overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage). Forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful due to high protein binding.  
For further details, refer to the full celecoxib package insert .

9.2.2.8  Unexpected Adverse Reactions  
Unexpected Adverse Reaction Def
inition  
An unexpected adverse 
reaction is any untoward and unintended response that is related to the 
administration of a
 study drug at any dose that is not consistent with the applicable product 
information (e.g., Investigator’s B rochure for an unauthorized study drug or approved 
prescribing information/summary of product characteristics for an authoriz ed product).  
All SUSARs will be subject to expedited report ing. The Sponsor  and/or  shall 
ensure that all relevant information about a SUSAR that is fatal or life -threatening is reported to 
the relevant competent authorities and the IRB  within 7 days after knowledge by the Sponsor  of 
such a case and that relevant follow -up information is communicated within an additional 
8 days.  All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA and the IRB  within 15 days after 
knowledge by the Sponsor  of such case s. The Investigator should follow up on each SUSAR 
until the event is resolved or until, in the opinion of the Investigator , the event is stabili zed or 
determined to be chronic.  Post-study SUSARs that occur within 30 days after the subject  has 
completed the clinical study mu st be reported by the Investigator  to the Sponsor . 
Warnings and Precautions 
The following warnings and precautions  have been issued for celecoxib : 
Do not use this product if you had an allergic reaction (including asthma), urticaria, or other 
allergic -type reactions af
ter taking celecoxib, aspirin, or other NSAID , or right before or after 
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)  surgery . Use caution if you have a history of ulcers or 
other stomach problems, kidney or liver disease, anemia, aspirin- sensitive asthma, high blood 
pressure, congestive heart failure or other heart or circulation problems. This medicine may 
cause the following problems: serious liver problem; bleeding in your stomach or intestines; and 
increased risk f or a heart attack or stroke. For further details, refer to the full celecoxib package

CONFIDENTIAL  10 Statisti cal Methods  
The statistical analysis methods planned for this study are described below . Additional details 
will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized before database 
lock and unblinding of the data . 
In general, descri ptive statistical methods will be used to summarize the data from this study , 
with hypothesis testing performed for the co-primary  and all secondary  efficacy endpoints . 
Unless stated otherwise, the term “descriptive statistics” refers to number of subject s (n), mean,  
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for continuous data and frequencies and percentages for categorical data. The term “treatment group” refers to treatment assignment: 
DFN- 15 or placebo. All data collected during the study will be included in subject data listings. 
Unless otherwise noted, the data will be sorted first by treatment assignment, subject  number , 
and then by date within each subject  number.  
All statistical analyses are described in Section 10.6. Unless specified otherwise, all statistical 
testing and  confidence 
intervals will be 2- sided and will be performed using a significance 
(alpha) level of 0.05.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® software package version 9.3 or higher. 
10.1 Statistical Analysis  Plan 
A SAP w
ill be created and approved before database lock. T his document will provide further 
details regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case 
of differences.  
A blinded data review will be conducted before  unblinding of subject ’s
  treatment assignment at 
database lock. This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject  evaluability, and appropriateness of the planned statistical methods.  
10.2 Analysis Datasets or Populations 
Screened Set  
The 
Screened Set will include  all screened subjects.  The set of analyses , including subject 
listings and summary tables of subject disposition, w ill be analyzed based on all eligible 
screened subjects who are databased for the study.  
Randomized Set  
Each DB treatment period will have a Randomized Set. The random ized set for DB1 will include 
all subjects who g ive informed consent and are eligible for and randomized into the DB1 
treatment period. The randomized set for DB2 will include all subjects in the randomized set for 
DB1 who are eligible for and are re-randomized into the DB2 treatment period. 
Full Analysis Set  
Each DB treatment period will have a full analysis set (FAS), which will include all randomized subjects who during t
he treatment period took at least one dose of study drug  and have at least

CONFIDENTIAL  1 post-baseline efficacy assessment  for either pain or symptom (among nausea, photophobia, 
phonophobia) . Subjects in DB1 will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment. 
Subjects in DB2 will be analyzed according to their re- randomized treatment. The FAS will be 
used for all analyses of efficacy endpoints.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all subject s who rec eive at least one dose of DB study drug  
during one or both treatment periods  and have it recorded in their eDiary . Each DB treatment 
period will have a safety population which will include all subjects who were randomized in the 
DB treatment period and who received at least one dose of DB study drug during the treatment 
period. 
Additional info rmation is inc luded in the SAP. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the 
protocol and supersedes it in case of differences.  
Per-Protocol  Population 
The per-prot
ocol (P P) population will include all DB1 FAS subject s who have at least 1 post-
baseline endpoint assessment for both co -primary endpoints  (observed and last observation 
carried forward [LOCF]) , and who have no significant protocol deviations that will impact the 
collection or interpretation of the co-primary  endpoint s data during the DB1 period. Identification 
of all subject s in the PP population will be determined before the database lock and unblinding.  
10.3 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Subject  disposit
ion and demographic s will be presented and described in the SAP.  
Demographics and baseline charact eristics will be summarized descriptively, and all collected

10.5 Methods 
of Analysis  
10.5.1  Primary Ef
ficacy Anal ysis 
Efficacy analyses for the co-primary  and secondar y endpoints will be based on the FAS 
population.  
The first co-primary efficacy endpoint  of the proportion of subject s who are free from headache 
pain at 2  hours after the first dose of study drug taken for a migraine attack with moderate to 
severe headache pain during the DB1 period, will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. The

CONFIDENTIAL  second co-primary efficacy endpoint of the proportion of subjects who are free from their 
Screening MBS among nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours postdose during the 
DB1 period will be similarly analyzed using Fisher’s exact test.  A subject’s MBS will be  obtained 
at Screening via Migraine History assessment and, for the analysis of the co- primary endpoint , 
that symptom must be present predose but does not have to be designated as the MBS at 
predose.  
Analys es will be performed using the  last observ ation carried forward ( LOCF ) and observed 
data in the FAS population and PP population.  
10.5.2  Secondary E ndpoint  Analysis  
The anal
ysis and presentation of the secondary efficacy endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
10.5.3  Explorator
y Analysis  
Exploratory analyses based on predose pain level and predose MBS are planned and details 
w
ill be provided in the SAP.  
10.5.4  Subgroup Analysis  
Subgroup analys
es will be performed as needed,  and details will be documented in the SAP. 
10.5.5  Additional Efficacy A nalyses  
Other pos
sible analyses and further statistical detai ls, if applicable,  w ill be provided in the SAP.  
10.5.6  Safety Analysis  
All AEs 
will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) vers
ion 19.0 or higher. A TEAE is an AE with a start date on or after the initial dose 
of study drug and up to 5 days after the last dose of study drug. Only TEAEs will be included in 
summary tables. Migraine headaches will not be captured as AEs. Migraine headaches w ill be 
captured by the subject  in the eDiary provided to them  at screening. The  information will then be 
entered into the appropriate eCRF page.  
The incidence of all TEAEs will be tabulated by treatment received. These TEAEs will be classified by
 system or gan class ( SOC ) and preferred term (PT ). For incidence reporting, if a 
subject  reported more than one AE that was coded to the same SOC or PT, the subject  will be 
counted only once for that specific SOC or PT.  
An overview of AEs, which includes subject  incidence of TE AEs, headache or migraine- related 
TEAEs, study drug -related TEAEs, and SAEs, will be presented. The subject  incidence of 
TEAEs, headache - or migraine -related TEAEs, study drug- related TEAEs, and SAEs will be 
summarized by SOC and PT.  
Treatment -emergent advers e events will also be summarized in a table by severity. For TEAEs 
presented by severity, the worst severity during the study  will be presented for each subject , 
SOC, and PT.

DFN-15-CD-006  Protocol Amendment 1  Page 54 of 61 
CONFIDENTIAL  Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be summarized in a table by relationship to study 
drug. For TEAEs presented by relationship to study drug, the strongest relationship to study 
drug during the study  will be presented for each subject , SOC, and PT.  
All AEs will also be presented in a by -subject  data lis ting. 
All prior and concomitant medications will be classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic 
Chemical (AT
C) classification and preferred drug names from the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD), version March 2016 or later. Medications will be c onsidered 
concomitant if they were taken at any time between the date of first dose and the date of last dose of study drug, inclusive. Medications will be considered as prior if stopped before the date 
of first dose of study drug  during the DB1 period. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized in separate tables by ATC level 2 and 
preferred 
drug name for the safety population.  
One combined listing w ill be provided for prior and concomitant medications. An identifier will be 
provided to show if a  medication is prior or concomitant. 
Electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs measurements will be summarized 
by treatment gr
oup and time point along with the change from baseline (V2).  During the DB 
period, V2 will be considered as baseline, (i.e., the visit occurring just before treatment ). If a 
subject misses a V2 assessment but has a V1 assessment, V1 will be considered as baseline. All ECG data, clinical laboratory data, vital signs, physical examinations, study drug use, and 
concomitant medication use will also be presented in by -subject  data listings. 
10.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim anal
ysis is planned.  
10.7 Determination of Sample Size 
Approxi
mately 600 subjects will  be randomized for the DB1 period. Subject s who discontinue 
participation without completing the study protocol will not be replaced.  
The first co -primary endpoi nt is the comparison of the proportion of subjects who are pain- free 
at 2 hours after the first dose of study drug. It is assumed that 17.6% of placebo and 29.2% of DFN- 15 (treated) subjects will be pain- free at 2 hours. A sample size of 600 subjects will provide 
88% power to detect this assumed difference between placebo and DFN -15 at a 5% (2- sided) 
level of significance and with a 15% dropout rate. 
The second co- prima ry endpoint 
 is the comparison of the proportion of subjects who are free 
from their Screening MBS among nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia at 2 hours after the 
first dose of study drug. It is assumed that 28.2% of placebo and 44.7% of DFN -15 (treated) 
subjects will be free from their Screening MBS at 2 hours. A sample size of 480  subjects will 
provide 94% power to detect this assumed difference between placebo and DFN -15 at a 5% (2 -
sided) level of significance and with a 15% dropout rate.  
Since the sample size for t he first co -primary endpoint is larger than that of the second co -
primary endpoint, the larger sample size will be used for the study.

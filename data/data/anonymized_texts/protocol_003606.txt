Amendment Rationale  
The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo® is based on the primary 
standardization performed by the US National Institute of S tandards and Technology (NIST).  
The NIST Standard Reference Material is used to calibrate the instruments in production and 
quality control of both the drug substance and drug product.  Additionally, the calibrated instruments in production at the Institu te for Energy Technology (IFE, Norway) are used to 
prepare the NIST traceable radium -223 reference material, which are then sent to the 
treatment sites (e.g., nuclear medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial setting of their dose calibrators , to allow verification of the patient dose.  A reassessment of the primary 
standardization was initiated by the NIST.  A discrepancy of approximately 10% between the published NIST primary standardization (Cessna, 2010, NIST 2010) and current measurements was confirmed and a revised NIST primary reference standard has been issued (Zimmerman, 2015, NIST update).  As a result of the revised NIST primary standardization, an adaption of the numerical description of patient dose and the description of radioacti ve 
concentration of the drug product solution becomes necessary.  This concerns Xofigo® for commercial use and product used in clinical trials.   
After the implementation of the new standard (NIST update) the numerical description of the 
patient dose will be adjusted from 50 kBq/kg to 55 kBq/kg, and the numerical description of 
the radioactivity in the vial will be changed from 1,000 kBq/mL to 1,100 kBq/mL  
The values in this protocol have been revised as per the United States National Institute of 
Standards  and Technology (NIST) standardization update.  
Bayer has submitted a variation application to the FDA.   The current standard (NIST 2010), dial setting and dose will remain in effect until  Bayer has confirmed  the unique implementation date in the 2nd qua rter of  2016 as agreed with FDA and notified  the 
principal investigator Naoto T. Ueno, MD at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer 
Center.

1. Introduction  
 1.1 Background  
Breast Cancer Bone metastasis:  
Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer, and bone metastases develop 
in 65- 75% of patients with metastatic breast cancer .1, 2 These metast ases can result in 
substantial morbidity in the form of skeletal- related events (SREs) that are defined as 
pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, hypercalcemia, or pain that requires 
radiation or surgery of the bone. Once bone metastases become e stablished, they are 
usually incurable and the goal of treatment becomes focused on palliation and prevention of SREs. 
 
Treatment for Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis  
Modalities used to treat breast cancer that has metastasized to the bone include 
chemotherap y, hormonal therapy, analgesics, radiotherapy, and orthopedic surgery. 
Because breast cancer patients who have bone metastasis may face severe reduced quality of life due to bone -related complications, there is a need for development of 
bone targeting ther apy for patients with hormone positive breast cancer. There is 
currently no bone metastasis targeted specific treatment in breast cancer. Strontium -89 
and samarium -153 are FDA -approved radiopharmaceutical agents indicated for severe 
bone pain due to bone m etastasis. But they are not indicated for a treatment of breast 
cancer bone metastasis.  
 
Role of Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Breast Cancer:  
The FDA -approved CellSearch System (Veridex, Raritan, NJ) is the first diagnostic test 
to identify and enumerate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream of patients 
with metastatic breast cancer. The analysis is based on the enumeration of epithelial 
cells, which are isolated from the blood by anti- EpCAM coated ferrous nanoparticles 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   10 of 45 
    
and stained with antibodies to cytokeratin (CK) and common leukocyte antigen (CD45) 
and DAPI.  CTCs are characterized as cells with a nucleus (DAPI+) that express surface 
EpCAM, cytoplasmic CK, and lack expression of CD45. CTC are an independent 
prognostic factor for progression -free and overall survival in metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC). Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells of epithelial origin that are found in the peripheral blood (PB) and are believed to be shed from primary lesions.  In 
patients with MBC, t he number of CTCs in the PB before and during treatment is an 
independent predictor of PFS and OS .
3, 4 Superior PFS and OS were observed among 
patients with fewer than 5 CTCs per 7.5 mL of peripheral blood regardless of primary 
tumor histology, hormone receptor and HER2/neu st atus, sites of first metastases, or 
whether the patient had recurrent or de novo metastatic disease. Between 10% and 30% of patients with stage I to III breast cancer and 50% to 70% of women with metastatic 
breast cancer have detectable CTCs.
3-5 In both cases, presence and elevation of CTCs 
are associated with worse prognosis. In the metastatic setting, persistent CTC after 3 to 5 weeks of a new therapy seem to indicate lack of activity of that regimen, and an 
ongoing prospective randomized clinical trial is addressing the relative worth of changing to an alternative treatment rather than waiting for classic clinical and 
radiologic evidence of progression. Early studies a lready suggest a role of CTCs in 
selected patients with metastatic disease. Coupled with an increasing understanding of the need for well -designed and well -conducted trials, better understanding of the 
biology of CTC will result in their becoming a routine  part of the clinical evaluation of 
at least patients with metastatic breast and other cancers, and perhaps even in early stage 
disease.  
 
Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition of CTC  
In order to metastasize to distant organs, breast cancer cells must detach from the primary tumor, traverse the peripheral circulation, extravasate into the parenchyma, and 
establish a new tumor.  A number of studies have shown that carcinoma cells often 
activate a transdifferentiation program, termed epithelial- mesenchymal transit ion 
(EMT), to acquire the traits needed to execute the multiple steps of metastasis.  Through this EMT process, epithelial cells lose cell -cell contacts and cell polarity, downregulate 
epithelial- associated genes, acquire mesenchymal gene expression, and u ndergo major 
changes in their cytoskeleton.  This cellular process culminates in a mesenchymal 
appearance and increased motility and invasiveness. Cancer cells can be induced to 
undergo EMT by several signaling pathways, most notably those involving the 
cooperation between TGF -β1 signaling and oncogenic Ras or other receptor tyrosine 
kinases, as well as Wnt, Notch, and the signaling activated by Hedgehog.  In addition, certain transcription factors, including TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, ZEB1, and FOXC2 
can induce  EMT in mammary epithelial cells and/or breast cancer cells.  In addition, 
blocking the expression of Twist in the highly metastatic 4T1 murine mammary cell 
line reduced both metastatic burden and the number of CTCs in mice bearing xenograft 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   11 of 45 
    
mammary tumors  thus linking EMT, metastasis, and the presence of CTCs.  These 
findings suggest that the expression of epithelial -cell surface markers, such as EpCAM, 
may not be optimal for detecting heterogeneous CTC population due to a 
subpopulation(s) with mesenchymal  phenotype.  We recently demonstrated that 
CellSearch is incapable of detecting CTC undergoing EMT (EMT -CTC) and have 
developed a PCR -based assay to detect EMT -inducing transcription factors (EMT -TFs) 
in breast cancer patients.6  
 
Imaging of Bone Metastasis Ability of PET/CT to detect the tumor response  
2-[Fluorine -18]fluoro -2-deoxy- D-glucose (FDG) –positron emission tomography 
(PET) is more sensitive  than conventional imaging in the detection of breast cancer 
metastases at any site. PET has the potential to revolutionize the definition of 
measurable tumors because it introduces imaging criteria based on function. The 
regular, well -defined tumor margin s that are necessary for reproducible anatomic 
measurements are of lesser importance in functional imaging. FDG is a radiolabeled form of glucose that cannot be metabolized and therefore accumulates in cells, which take up the molecules as if they were nor mal glucose. Through this accumulation, FDG 
activity acts as a surrogate for glucose metabolism.   
Since many malignancies are highly metabolic and accumulate FDG, it is the most 
commonly used PET agent for oncologic indications. FDG –PET/computed tomography 
(CT) allows for fusion of functional and anatomic datasets, resulting in more accurate evaluation of disease, which has resulted in a better detection and reflection of the tumor 
activity in MBC, in particular of bone metastases.  Recent prospective stud y, a possible 
correlation between>5 CTCs at baseline and the presence of bone metastases as detected by whole -body bone scan was noted. The superiority of FEG -PET/CT over 
bone scan in specificity and sensitivity for detection of bone metastases is well documented. So there is a possibility to detect the response of radium -223 accompanied 
with the reduction of CTCs in FDG -PET/CT.  
 
The most widely used criteria are based on the anatomic measurement of solid tumors. 
Because bone metastases are typically located in irregularly shaped bones and are difficult to measure with rulers, they have been previously considered unmeasurable 
disease.  New developments in cancer response criteria have increased awareness of the 
importance of the response of bone metastases t o therapy. The recently updated 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) now consider bone metastases with soft tissue masses > 10 mm to be measurable disease.  Response criteria 
specific to bone metastases have been developed at The University of Texas MD 
Anderson Cancer Center (MDA criteria) and can be used to assess therapeutic response in numerous types of bone metastases. Functional imaging criteria, such as the recently 
developed Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   12 of 45 
    
(PERCIST) allow response to be measured in the absence of anatomic change through 
assessment of metabolic activity .7-10  
 As monitoring tumor response of bone metastases becomes more important in the 
management of cancer, so does the demand on radiologists and nuclear medicine 
physicians for accurate interpretation of the behavior of these lesions. The WHO criteria 
include ra diograph- based guidelines for the interpretation of bone metastases; however, 
RECIST or RECIST 1.1 did not adopt these guidelines. The resultant void regarding the evaluation of bone metastases led to the development of bone -specific response 
criteria at M D Anderson Cancer Center in 2004.  
 
The MDA criteria updated the UICC and WHO bone response criteria by expanding 
radiographic assessment and incorporating both CT and MRI. In a study comparing the 
MDA, UICC, and WHO criteria in 41 breast cancer patients w ith bone -only metastases, 
the MDA criteria were shown to better differentiate responders to chemotherapy from nonresponders and were the only set of criteria to correspond to progression -free 
survival. According to the MDA criteria, time to disease progres sion was 5.5 months 
for nonresponders and 23.3 months for responders (P = 0.025), compared with 10.4 months and 12.4 months, respectively, according to the WHO criteria (P = 0.55). The 
MDA criteria identified nonresponders earlier and better correlated wit h clinical 
response in the first 2 -6 months of therapy than did the WHO criteria. Early signs of 
disease progression are valuable, allowing the halting of ineffective therapy in a timely 
fashion and the possible substitution of effective therapy. In additi on to their utility for 
guiding treatment decisions, the MDA bone response criteria closely reflect the behavior of bone metastases on radiography and CT and can be used as guidelines for 
the interpretation of these studies whether or not a patient is enro lled in a therapeutic 
trial
10 
1.2 Rationale of the study  
The objective of this protocol is to determine the progression events at 9 months by Ra -
223 dichloride + hormonal agent + denosumab. Currently Ra -223 dichloride is 
approved by FDA only for castration resistant prostate cancer  and for breast cancer the 
drug has been still under clinical experiments. The clinical safety of Ra -223 dichloride  
was evaluated in advanced breast cancer patients. 11Its efficacy has been evaluated in 
castration -resistant prostate canc er patients with bone metastases in phase III 
multicenter study (ALSYMPCA), wh ich demonstrated  a significant survival benefit 
from Ra -223 dichloride. 12  
After determin ing its efficacy, we will plan for a definitive randomized study in SWOG. 
Denosumab is a FDA -approved bone modification agent. Use of denosumab and 
hormonal therapy for bone metastasis dominant breast cancer is considered a standard of care.  
 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   13 of 45 
    
We will use progression events (the total number of events of progression among the 
participating patients within  9 months) instead of determining progression- free survival 
as the primary endpoint so that we can complete the study in a timely manner. The 9-month timeframe was chosen because our group reported that  the median progression-
free survival duration for patients  diagnosed with hormone -positive bone -only 
metastatic breast cancer is 12 to 18 months and that for patients with HER -2 positive is 
10 to 24 months .
1 This data suggest that there will be no progressive of disease about 
70% at 9 months when bone only metastatic disease is treated with endocrine therapy 
alone.  
 
We will also use FDG PET -CT scans at 6 months and 9 months to evaluate the tumor 
response using PERCIST criteria .8 The assessment of the tumor response is a secondary 
objective . 
 
1.3    Ra -223 dichloride  
          1.3.1  Mechanism of Action   
 Radium -223 dichloride is a therapeutic alpha particle -emitting pharmaceutical with 
targeted anti-tumor effect on bone metastases. Ra- 223 dichloride mimics calcium and 
selectively targets bone, specifically areas of bone metastases, by forming complexes 
with the bone mineral hydroxyapatite. The high linear energy transfer of alpha emitters (80 keV /micrometer) leads to a high frequency of double -strand DNA breaks in 
adjacent cells, resulting in a potent and localized anti -tumor effect. The alpha particle 
range from radium -223 is less than 100 micrometers (less than 10 cell diameters), which 
minimize s damage to the surrounding normal tissue.  
 
1.3.2   NIST Standardization  
 The quantification of radium -223 radioactivity in Xofigo (radium -223 dichloride;BAY 
88-8223) is based on the primary standardization performed by the US NIST.  National 
Institue of Standards and Technology prepares the standard reference material (SRM) using an official dial setting (primary standardization) as published. The NIST SRM is used to calibrate the instrucments in production and quality control for both the drug substance and drug product. Additionally, the NIST SRM is used to prepare the NIST 
traceable Ra- 223 reference materials which are then sent to the end -users (e.g., nuclear 
medicine laboratory physicians or technicians) for dial -setting of their dose calibrators, 
to allow verification of the patient dose. In 2014, NIST performed a re -assessment of 
the primary standardization based on preliminary information suggesting a potential discrepancy of approximately 8 -10% between the published NIST primary 
standardization and results obtained by other national metrology institutes (United 
Kingdom, Germany and Japan).  After completion of the re -assessment, NIST reported 
their findings and had to issued a revised NIST SRM in 2015. The discrepancy in the 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   14 of 45 
    
NIST standardization was  determined to be - 9.5 % between activity values obtained 
using the old reference standard relative to the new primary standardization.  
 
Consequently, the current numerical values need to be corrected by approximately + 
10. 5 %. The current NIST standard for radium- 223 dichloride will remain in effect until 
the FDA has fully approved the regulatory variation submitted for Xofigo and is 
anticipated in the 2nd quarter of 2016.  
The change in the numerical description of the patient’s dose, product strength and 
labeled vial activity does not impact the safety or efficacy of Xofigo, The change in the 
NIST radium- 223 standard has no impact on subjects; dose subjects  are receiving, and 
will continue to receive.  
 
Subjects will receive the same actual dose and volume that was studied in Study 15245 
(BC1 -06 dosimetry study) and is associated with the proven safety and efficacy of 
radium- 223 dichloride, though the stated nominal radiation dose received is being 
updated to reflect the new standard.

In single and repeated dose toxicity studies in rats, the main findings were reduced body 
weight gain, hematological changes, reduced serum alkaline phosphatase and microscopic findings in the bone marrow (depletion of hematopoietic cells, fibrosis), spleen (second ary e xtra-medullary hematopoiesis) and bone (depletion of osteocytes, 
osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibro -osseous lesions, disruption/disorganization of the 
physis/growth line). These findings  were related to radiation -induced impairment of 
hematopoiesis and a redu ction of osteogenesis and and started at the lowest dose of  of 
20 (0.00056 mCi) – 80 kBq (0.0022 mCi) per kg body weight, (22 (0. 00061 mCi) - 
88kBq (0.0024m Ci after implementation of the NIST)  with the exception of body 
weight decreases.   
Dose -limiting my elotoxicity was seen in dogs after single administration of 450 kBq 
(0.012 mCi)  (497 kBq/kg after implementation of NIST update)  Ra-223 dichloride per 
kg body weight  (9 times the clinically recommended dose).    
Osteosarcomas, a known effect of bone- seeking  radionuclides, were observed at 
clinically relevant doses in rats 7 – 12 months after start of treatment. Osteosarcomas 
were not observed in dog studies. The presence of neoplastic changes, other than osteosarcomas, was also reported in the longer term (1 2 to 15 months) rat toxicity 
studies. Due to its mode of action, and as seen with conventional radiotherapy and other radiotherapeutics, radium- 223 dichloride may have the potential to induce secondary 
malignancies.  No case of osteosarcoma has been reported in clinical studies with Ra -
223 dichloride. The risk for patients to develop osteosarcomas with exposure to Ra -223 
dichloride is unknown at present   
 Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity have not been performed. Since Ra -
223 dichloride  binds to bone, the potential risk for toxic effects in the male gonads in 
cancer patients with castration -resistant prostate cancer is very low, but cannot be 
excluded. Studies on the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of Ra -223 dichloride 
have not been perf ormed.

No histological changes were observed in organs involved in the excretion of Ra -223 
dichloride. No significant effects were seen on vital organ systems, i.e. cardiovascular 
(dog), respiratory or central nervous systems (rat), after single dos e admi nistration of 
450 to 1,000 kBq (0.012  to 0.027 mCi)  corresponding to 497 -1100kBq ( 0.014 to 0.03 
mCi)  per kg body weight  after implementation of the NIST  (9 (dog) to 20 (rat) times 
the clinically recommended dose.  
 
            1.3.4  Clinical Experience Summary12, 17-20 
 
The clinical development of R a-223 dichloride  includes phase I and phase I I studies in 
prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. The results of these completed studies 
indicated that safety and tolerability of R a-223 dichloride in CRPC/HRPC patients with 
bone metastases was well tolerated, and that there was evidence of  dose related efficacy 
against bone markers and other markers of disease. In addition there was an effect on 
median overall survival in a Phase II (BC1 -02) placebo- controlled study. These studies 
enabled the initiation of the Phase III ALSYMPCA (ALpharadin in SYMptomatic 
Prostate CAncer ) study.  
 
The clinical safety and efficacy of Ra- 223 dichloride have been evaluated in a double -
blind, randomized, multiple dose, phase III  multicenter study (ALSYMPCA) in 
castration -resistant prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. The primary efficacy 
endpoint was Overall Survival (OS).  
At the cut -off date of the pre -planned interim analysis, a total of 809 patients were 
randomized 2:1 to receive Ra-223 dichloride  50kBq (0.0012mCi) ( 55 kBq (0.0014 
mCi)/kg after implementation of the NIST intravenously every 4 weeks for 6 cycles 
(N=541) plus best standard of care or matching placebo plus best standard of care 
(N=268). Best standard of care included e.g. local external  beam radiotherapy, 
corticosteroids, antiandrogens, estrogens, estramustine or ketoconazole.  
 
An updated descriptive analysis of safety and of OS was performed in 921 randomized 
patients prior to implementing crossover (i. e. offering patients in the placebo group to 
receive Ra -223 dichloride  treatment).  
The results of both, interim and updated analysis, revealed that OS was significantly 
longer in patients treated with Ra -223 dichloride plus best standard of care compared t o 
patients treated with placebo plus best standard of care. For the updated analysis, an 
increase in median overall survival of 3.6 months was seen with Ra -223 dichloride plus 
best standard of care compared to placebo plus best standard of care (HR =0.695 (95% CI 0.581/0.832), median OS 14.9 months versus 11.3 months, respectively). 
In the ALSYMPCA study, the results of the interim analysis and the updated analysis 
showed also a significant improvement in all main secondary endpoints in the Ra -223 
dichlorid e arm compared to the placebo arm:  
 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   16 of 45 
    
Time to first SRE (defined as time to EBRT, time to first pathological bone fracture, 
time to spinal cord compression and time to surgical intervention) was statistically 
significantly longer in the radium -223 chloride group compared to placebo (median 
number of months=15.6 for radium -223 chloride versus 9.8 months for placebo 
(HR=0.658, 95 CI 0.522–0.830, p=  0.00037). 
Time to total ALP progression (defined as ≥ 25% increase compared to baseline/nadir)  
was statistically s ignificantly longer in the radium -223 chloride group 7.4 months 
compared to placebo 3.8 months  ( HR = 0.167, 95% CI 0.129 – 0.217; p=  <0.00001).  
Time to PSA progression (defined as a ≥ 25% increase and an increase in absolute value of ≥ 2 ng/mL compared to baseline/nadir ) was also significantly prolonged in patients receiving Ra -223 dichloride  compared to patients receiving placebo (HR  = 0.643, 95% 
CI 0.539,0.768; p  = <0.00001)  
A total ALP  response ( defined as a confirmed ≥ 30% or ≥ 50% reduction compared to 
baseline) at week 12 was observed in higher proportions of subjects who were treated with radium -223 chloride group (47%  and 3% respectively ) compared to those in the 
placebo ( 3% and < 1% respectively)  group.  
 
Subgroup survival analysis showed a consistent survival benefit for treatment with Ra -
223 dichloride, independent of total alkaline phosphatase (ALP), current use of 
bisphosphonates, pri or use of docetaxel and baseline ECOG status. The results from the 
phase III ALSYMCA study regarding time to external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for pain relief and fewer patients reporting bone pain as an adverse event in the Ra -223 
dichloride group indicate a positive effect on bone pain.  
 
Most common hematologic adverse events all grades were anemia (31.2%), neutropenia 
(5%) and thrombocytopenia (11.5%). Most common non- hematologic all grades 
adverse events occurring in more than 15% of patients were : bone pain, diarrhea, 
nausea, vomiting and constipation.  
Table 1 shows adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients and for which the rate for Ra -223 dichloride exceeds the rate for placebo.

An additional clinically important adverse reaction observed in less than 1% of Ra -223 
dichloride -treated patients and at a higher incidence than in placebo -treated patients was 
lymphopenia (0.8% vs. 0.3%).  
 
Secondary malignant neoplasms  
No cases of radia tion-induced cancer have been reported in reported in clinical trials with 
radium- 223 dichloride in follow -up of up to three years. However, the radiation dose 
resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher incidence of cancer (e.g. sarcomas 
of the bone, or leukemia), mutations and a potential for development of hereditary defects . 
First clinical experience with alpha -emitting Ra -223 in the treatment of skeletal metastases 
of bone was well tolerated
. Ten breast cancer patients was enrolled in a ph ase I trial received 
a single i.v. injection of Ra -223. Pain relief was reported by 52%, 60%, and 56% of the 
patients after 7 days, 4, and 8 weeks, respectively. 223Ra cleared rapidly from blood and 
was below 1% of initial level at 24 hours.21

• The subject is non -compliant with study drug and  trial procedures, or both; 
including the use of anti -cancer therapy not prescribed by the study protocol.  
• Pregnancy.  Pregnancy will be reported as an SAE.  (Note: subjects who have been 
withdrawn from treatment with study drug because of pregnancy should not 
undergo CT scans [with contrast]/M RI or bone scans while pregnant. )

a “dropout” if the subject has already been randomized ; assigned to treatment/run -
in/wash -out and administered  at least one dose of study drug.  
A subject who, for any reason ( e.g. failure to satisfy the selection criteria), terminates 
the study before the time point used for the definition of “dropout” (see above) is 
regarded a “screening failure”.

 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   23 of 45 
    
6.2.2 Identity of study treatment  
The alpha -pharmaceutical Ra- 223 dichloride is a ready- to-use, sterile, non- pyrogenic, 
clear and colorless aqueous solution of Ra -223 dichloride (223RaCl 2) for I V 
administration. Ra -223 dichloride is an alpha particle emitter with a physical half -life 
of 11.4 days. The product is isotonic and has a pH of 6.0- 8.0. The radioactive 
concentration at the reference date is  1000kBq/ml(  1,100 kBq/mL  after implementation 
of NIST) . The product has a pre -calibration of 14 days. When administered on a day 
other than the reference day, the volume should be corrected according to the physical 
decay table.  
 
Radium Ra 223 dichloride, is manufactured by Bayer  Healthcare LLC will provide Ra -
223 dichloride, which will be manufactured by Algeta’s contract manufacturer: Institute for Energy Technology, Isotope laboratories, Kjeller, Norway. The product is produced according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). Th e product will be delivered in a 
glass vial, ready -to-use with a certified activity. Ra- 223 dichloride is shipped in a lead 
container and Type A radioactive package according to international transportation guidelines for radioactive materials.  
  
The volume per vial is 6 mL, corresponding to 6 MBq (6.6 MBq after implementation of NIST update) at the reference day . Radium Ra-223 dichloride has a shelf life of 28 
days from production day, when stored at ambient temperature.  The shelf life has been 
demonstrat ed for temperatures from cold storage (2- 8°C) up to 40°C . In addition, it has 
been shown that the product quality is not jeopardized upon freezing.  
 All study drugs will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and legislation. For all study d rugs, a system of numbering in accordance with all 
requirements of GMP will be used, ensuring that each dose of study drug can be traced back to the respective bulkware of the ingredients.   
6.2.3 Instructions for use / handling  
6.2.3.1  General warning  
Radium 223 dichloride should be received, used and administered only by authorized 
persons in designated clinical settings. The receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal 
Radium 223 dichloride are subject to the regulations and/or appropriate licenses of the 
compet ent official organization. Radium 223dichloride should be handled by the user 
in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken.  
6.2.3.2  Radiation protection  
The administration of Ra -223 dichloride is associated with potential risks for other 
persons (e.g. medical staff, caregivers and members of the patient’s family) from 
radiation or contamination from spills of body fluids such as urine, feces, or vomit. Therefore, radiatio n protection precautions must be taken in accordance with national 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   24 of 45 
    
and local regulations. Radium -223 is primarily an alpha emitter,  with a 95.3% fraction 
of energy emitted as alpha -particles. The fraction emitted as beta -particles is 3.6%, and 
the fraction  emitted as gamma- radiation is 1.1%. The external radiation exposure 
associated with handling of patient doses is considerably lower in comparison to other 
radiopharmaceuticals for therapeutic purposes as the administered radioactivity will usually be below  usually be below  8 MBq (0.216 mCi) corresponding to 
8.8MBq(0.238mCi)  after implementation of the  NIST update. 8.8 MBq (0.216 238 mCi).  In keeping with the A s Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle , for 
minimization of radiation exposure, it is recommended to minimize the time spent in radiation areas, to maximize the distance to radiation sources, and to use adequate shielding. Any unused product or materials used in connection with the preparation or administration are to be treated as radioactive waste and should be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.  
The gamma radiation associated with the decay of radium -223 and its daughters allows 
for the radioactivity measurement of Ra -223 dichloride and the detection of 
contamination with standard instruments.  
 
6.2.4 Dose calibration  
Ra-223 dichloride can be measured in a normal dose calibrator instrument. When 
written  approvals for the use of Ra -223 dichloride  from the Radiation Protection 
Agency for the specific  center have been received by the  sponsor, a vial of Ra -223 
dichloride for technical use will be s ent to the study center. A new reference vial will 
be sent to each center corresponding to the updated NIST reference material.  
 
Different clinical study centers possess dose calibrators fr om various suppliers thus, the 
isotope calibration factor may differ from center to center.  Consequently, each center 
must perform the Ra -223 dichloride dial setting on their relevant dose calib rator(s)  
(upon notification by Bayer each center  is required to update dial settings to correspond 
to the new NIST standard) . The current dial settings are to remain in effect until Bayer 
obtains FULL approval from the FDA for implementation. In preparation for implemen tation of the NEW dial setting,  the clinical study center will receive a sealed 
vial labeled NIST standard containing a Radium Ra-223 dichloride solution for 
calibration only. The vial is identical to the vials used for study treatme nt. The amount 
of Radium Ra-223 dichloride in the vial wi ll be stated on the label. Instructions for the 
dial setting , including the calibration log form will be enclosed with the dispatch of the 
calibration sample.  All sites will be notified by Bayer when FINAL regulatory approval 
from the FDA is in place and the updated NIST standardization is to be implemented.  
 
6.2.5 Dosimetry  
 The absorbed radiation dose calculation was performed based on clinical biodistribution data. Calculations of absorbed doses were performed using OLINDA/EXM (Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment/EXponential Modeling), a 
software based on the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) algorithm  which is 
widely used for established beta and gamma emitting radionuclides. For radium -223, 
which is primarily an alpha emitter, additional assumptions wer e made for the intestine, 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   25 of 45 
    
red marrow and bone/osteogenic cells to provide the best possible absorbed dose 
calculations for Ra- 223 dichloride  considering its observed biodistribution and specific 
characteristics.  
For an administered activity of 3.65 MBq (0.0987 Ci) 55  kBq ( .0015 mCi) per kg body 
weight to a 73- kg adult)  after implementation  of the NIST , the calculated absorbed 
doses to the bone (osteogenic cells) is 4.2050 Gy (420.5 rad) and to the red marrow is 0.5066 Gy (50.66 rad). The calculated absorbed doses to the main excretory organs are 0.0265 Gy (2.65 rad) for the small intestine wall, 0.1180 Gy (11.8 rad) for the upper 
large intestine wall and 0.1696 Gy (16.96 rad) for the lower large intestine wall.  
The calculated absorbed doses to other organs are low, e.g. heart wall (0.0063 Gy, 0.63 rad), lung (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), liver (0.0109 Gy, 1.09 rad), kidneys (0.0117 Gy, 1.17 rad), urinary bladder wall (0.0147 Gy, 1.47 rad), testes (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad), and spleen (0.0003 Gy, 0.03 rad).  
The hematological adverse drug reactions observed in the clinical studies with Ra -223  
are much lower in fre quency and severity than what could be expected from the 
calculated absorbed doses to the red marrow. This may be related to spatial distribution of alpha particle radiation resulting in non- uniform radiation dose to the red marrow.  
6.2.6 Dose handling  
The Ra -223 dichloride vials must be stored inside their lead container in a secure 
facility. The study drug should be used within 28 days of production. Ra -223 dichloride 
is an alpha -pharmaceutical and should be handled by individuals who are qualified by 
training and experience in the safe handling of radionuclides. One dedicated person and a back -up designee will have responsibility as assigned from the Primary Investigator 
for handling and storage of Ra -223 dichloride . All administrations of Ra -223 dichl oride 
are based on the certified activity of Ra -223 dichloride  at the calibration date.  
 
6.2.7 Dose calculation  
After implementation  of the NIST , the dosage of Radium Ra-223 dichloride  is 55 
kBq/kg body weight. The patient dose is calculated  based on date of injection, a decay 
correc tion factor (DK) specific to number of days from reference date applied to correct 
for physical decay of  radium 223, and patient weight. A table with DK  values  according  
to physical decay of the study medication will be provided with every shipment of 
Radium Ra-223 dichloride .  Radium -223 is an alpha particle emitter with a physical t 
½  of 11.4 days. The radioactive concentration at the reference date  adjusted to 
correspond to the new NIST standard is 1,100 kBq/m L. The volume to be administered 
for the current dose is calculated as follows: Body weight (kg) X  dose (55kBq/kg body 
weight)/DK factor X  1100kBq(0.0297 mCi)/mL . 
Data regarding activity should be recorded on the appropri ate electronic case report 
form (eCRF) page.  
 
6.2.8 Dose preparation  
Personnel should use the  appropriate  protective clothing (i.e. medical gloves/protective  
glasses)  and equipment during syringe filling and application to preve nt contamination 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   26 of 45 
    
with the radioactive solution . The individual responsible for study drug preparation will 
draw the correct volume of study drug into a syringe. The size of the syringe should be 
chosen according to the applied volume to reach the required dosing accuracy. Ra -223 
dichloride should not b e diluted or mixed with any solutions. Do not store above 40°C 
(104°F). If the vials have been stored in a refrigerator, they should be left at room temperature for 1 hour prior to use, since cold material should not be injected in a patient.
 Store Ra -223 dichloride in the original container or equivalent radiation 
shielding. This preparation is approved for use by persons under license by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or the relevant regulatory authority of an Agreement State.  
  
6.2.9 Dose administration  
Before administration of study drug, the patient must be well hydrated; the patient 
should be  instructed to drink ad libitum.  Aseptic technique should be used in the 
administration of Ra -223 dichloride  by the individual who will perform the injection. 
The study medication will be  administered as a bolus  intravenous (IV) injection  (up to 
1 minute). After administration, the equipment  that was used in preparation and 
administration of the study drug, should  be treated as radioactive waste and disposed 
in accordance with local  procedure for the  handling of radioactive material.  
           6.2.10 Dose Modification  
Every effort should be made to administer the full dosing regimen  of Ra -223 dichloride .  
Adjustment of dose level is not permitted.   
Study visits during the treatment period should occur at 4 weeks intervals (within a window of +/ - 7 days).  Dosing delays may be instituted under the following 
circumstances:  
 
Myelosuppression:   
Treatment -related changes in hematology parameters may occur.  
• If a patient experiences CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
or anemia , the administration of study drug should be delayed until recovery to Grade 
2 or better.  
• If a patient experiences CTCAE v4.03 Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
or anemia lasting > 14 days, further study drug administrations must be discontinued.  
•  Blood transfusion is acceptable between study drug administrations but not prior to 
the start of the study.  Use of biologic response modifiers, such as G -CSF or GM -CSF, 
is allowed in the management of acute toxicity.  
Gastrointestinal events: 
Diarrhea should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of study medication 
should not be given before diarrhea is recovered to CTCAE v4.03 Grade 2 or baseline levels.  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   27 of 45 
    
Nausea or vomiting should be treated as per local practice.  A further dose of study 
medication should not be given before nausea or vomiting is recovered to CTCAE v.4.03 Grade 2 or baseline levels.  
Spinal Cord Compression:  
If the patient experiences spinal cord compression during the treatment period, the patient should be treated for the event , and may receive further study drug 
administration if adequately recovered.  
Surgical Intervention:  
If surgery is required, the pati ent should continue with study treatment  if this is 
considered safe in the treating Investigator’s opinion.  The surgeon should be notified  
that the patient has been given radioactive drug, and should  follow the guidelines for 
radioactive protection.   
Non-pathological fractures:  
For traumatic fractures in weight- bearing bones during treatment phase, the study drug 
administration should be delayed for 2- 4 weeks from the time of fracture.  
Pathological fractures:  
Pathological fractures may occur as the resu lt of either progressive disease or increased 
physical activity associated with significant pain palliation.  Pathologic fractures are to 
be treated in a manner that attempts to maintain the best functional status and quality of life. Study treatment may c ontinue as planned.  
Any Other Toxicity:   
Local practice will apply.  
 
6.3 Drug logistics and accountability  
All study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) requirements . 
The instructions will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  
6.3.1 Accountability  
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by the investigator, must maintain a 
careful record of the inventory and disposition of the agent in accordance with 
institutional requirements.  
6.3.2 Destruction and Return  
At the end of the study, unused supplies  of Ra 223 dichloride  should be destroyed 
according to institutional policies. Destruction will be documented in the Drug 
Accountability Record Form. The certificate of destruction should be sent to Bayer.  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   28 of 45 
    
6.4 Treatment compliance  
An adequate record of receipt , distribution, and destruction of all study drugs must be 
kept in the form of a Drug Accountability Form.  
Subject compliance with the treatment and protocol includes willingness to comply with 
all aspects of the protocol, and to have blood collected for all safety evaluations.  At the discretion of the principal investigator, a subject may be discontinued from the trial for non-compliance with follow -up visits or study drug. 
6.5 Prior and concomitant therapy - 
All medication that is considered necessary for th e subject’s welfare, and not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment may be given at the discretion of the investigator.  All medications (including contrast media) taken within 2 weeks prior to the start of the study and during the study must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation and in the CRF (including start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication).  
 
 Permitted  
• Treatment with non -conventional therapies ( e.g., herbs [with the exception of St. 
John’s Wart ], acupuncture) and vitamin/mineral supplements is acceptable 
provided that , in the opinion of the investigator, such treatment will not interfere 
with the trial endpoints.  
• Subjects may receive standard of care for any underlying illness.  
• In the event of neutropenia, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, subjects may receive 
appropriate supportive care (e.g., transfusion, biologic response modifiers such as 
G-CSF or GM -CSF, prophylactic antibiotics, antifungals and/or antivirals, 
hematopoietic growth factors).  This supportive care should not substitute a recommended dose modification.  
• Blood transfusions and erythropoietin are allowed during the study period but not within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.  
• If surgery is required during study drug treatment, the surgeon needs to be notified 
that the patient has been treated with a radioactive product and adequate precautions for radioactive protection should be applied during the surgical procedure.  The patient s hould continue with study treatment if considered safe in the treating 
Investigator's opinion.

Adverse reactions are identified using MedDRA version 14.1 and graded according to      
CTCAE version 4.03.  
7.1.2 Timing of assessments  
Hematology assessments  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   30 of 45 
    
Hematology assessment will include a complete blood count with differential, and 
chemistry (bilirubin, creatinine, ALT, AST, BUN, serum creatinine, sodium, 
magnesium, potassium, albumin, total bilirubin,  and alkaline phosphatase, chloride, 
bicarbonate, to tal protein, glucose, calcium, and phosphrus .

Urine NTx is to be performed at the time points indicated in sections 7.1.1. 
 
 
MRI  
If spinal cord compression is clinically suspected or PET -CT cannot determine the 
existence of the bone metastases, patients will require an MRI of the spine. If MRI could 
only detect the bone metastases, MRI will be used  to monitor the response at 6 and 9 
months.  
 
Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy  
If bone marrow involvement by breast cancer is suspected or radiographical diagnosis 
of bone metastases is not reliable, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy should be 
performed.  (See the details in section 5.1.1 Inclusion criteria) If the bone marrow 
involvement by breast cancer is detected then, the patient will require to be tested for the bone marrow aspiration and biopsy at 6 and 9 months.  
 
CTC  
7.5ml Peripheral blood at baseline,  cycle 6 and end of study will be collected in 
CellSave collection tubes for enumeration of CTC by CellSearch.   
 
Translational research studies:  
5.0 ml of peripheral blood at baseline,  cycle 6 and end of study will be collected in 
AdnaCollect tubes f or the detection of CTCs using AdnaTest, a PCR -based assay that 
measures the expression of CTC -related gene transcripts, EpCAM, MUC1, and Her2 in 
EpCAM -enriched cells.

assessed for the presence of EMT -TFs by qRT -PCR.   
 
7.1.3 Medical history  
Medical history findings (i.e. previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) meeting all 
criteria listed below will be collected:  
• Not pertaining to the study indication 
• Start before signing of the informed consent  
• Considered relevant to the study.  
Detailed instructions on t he differentiation between (i) medical history and (ii)  adverse 
events can be found in Section 0.1.  
  
 7.1.4  Efficacy  
 All subjects who receive at l east one dose of study treatment will be valid for the 
efficacy analysis. Efficacy  evaluation will be done by bone scan and PET- CT. This trial 
will use the PERCIST criteria for assessment of efficacy in both primary and secondary 
endpoints .
8 The disease control rate at 9 months will be recorded as primary endpoint 
and the duration until progression and tumor response rate at 6 months as secondary efficacy endpoint.  
 
7.1.5   Radiographical Methodology  
 PET- CT will be used to assess the treatment efficacy. PERCIST criteria will be used 
 for efficacy  evaluation for the patients with bone -metastasis only . If new lesions are 
 detected, the disease will be defined as progression according to RECIST 1.1. Patients 
 who require radiotherapy for a bone metastasis should be scored as a disease 
 progression.

7.2  Safety  
The sponsor is responsible to comply with the local regulation and legislation for adverse events reporting.  
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment will be valid for the safety analysis.  
All observations pertinent to the safety of the study treatment will be recorded and included in the final repor t. 
All AEs whether considered drug -related or not, will be reported with a diagnosis, 
start/stop dates, action taken, whether treatment was discontinued, any corrective measures taken, outcome, and other possible causes.  For all events, the relationship t o 
treatment and the intensity of the event will be determined by the investigator.  
This trial will use the NCI- CTCAE v4.0 3 criteria for assessment of toxicity and SAE 
reporting with regard to toxicity grade.  
Safety variables may include but not limited to  the following: laboratory changes 
(complete blood counts, electrolytes, chemistry, and coagulation), changes in vital signs 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature) and ECG and, in some instances, changes in chest x -ray images, as p roduced at the investigator’s discretion 
(e.g., for evaluation for pneumonia).  
           7.2.1 Adverse events  
Investigators should refer to the Safety Information section of the current IB for Ra 223 dichloride, including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the expected 
side effects of Ra 223 dichloride.  As with any agent, there is always the potential for unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB will be updated if any new relevant safety data are obtained.  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   33 of 45 
    
Therapeutic  monitoring should be performed following dose selection of Ra 223 
dichloride in a manner consistent with the local clinical standard of care.  In general, 
subjects should be closely monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications regardless of t he path of drug elimination.  
All concomitant medications must be recorded in the subject’s source documentation.  
Subjects must be carefully monitored for AEs.  This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory tests.  Adverse events should be assessed in t erms of their seriousness, 
intensity, and relationship to the study drug, or other chemotherapy/treatment.  
7.2.1.1 Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of 
a medicinal (investigational) product.  
Adverse events will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03.  IF CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, and life -threatening, correspondent to grades 1 -4.  The PI 
or physician designee is responsible for verifying and providing source documentation for all adverse events and assigning attribution for each event for all subjects enroll ed on the study.  
PDMS/CORe will be used as the electronic case report form for this protocol.  
 
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by any physician treating 
the subject should not be recorded as AE (however, the condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE  if the condition worsens compared to baseline ). 
 
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms 
or treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are recorded as medical 
history ( e.g. seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
• Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medica l history  (e.g. allergic pollinosis).  
• Conditions that started or deteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
It is the responsibility of the PI and the research teams to ens ure serious adverse events are 
reported according to the Code of Federal Regulations, Good Clinical Practices, the protocol 
guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy. 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   34 of 45 
    
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threa tening.  
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was 
at risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hosp italization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
A hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization will not be regarded as an SAE if 
at least one of the following exceptions is met:  
- The admission results in a hospital stay of less than 12  hours . 
- The admission is pre -planned.  
(i.e. elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to the start of the study)  
- The admissi on is not associated with an AE. 
(e.g. social hospitalization for purposes of respite care).  
However, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospitalization may 
fulfill the criterion of ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities 
specifically require a more stringent definitio n, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity . 
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly / birth defect . 
f. Is another m edically important serious event as judged by the investigator . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring inte nsive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32). 
a. Important medical events as defined above, may also be co nsidered serious adverse 
events. Any important medical event can and should be reported as an SAE if deemed 
appropriate by the Principal Investigator or the INDIND Sponsor, IND Office.  
b. All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures 
outlined in “The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional 
Review Board Policy for Investigators on Reporting Unanticipated Adverse Events for 
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   35 of 45 
    
Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise in the protocol, all SAEs, expected or 
unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 
working days of knowledge of the event).  
c. All life -threatening or fatal events, that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, 
must have a written report submitted within 24 hours (next working day) of knowledge 
of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
d. Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE ) will be utilized for 
safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
e. Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific 
intervention, until 30 days after the last dose of drug, unless the participant withdraws 
consent . Serious adverse events must be followed until clinical recovery is complete 
and laboratory tests have returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event.  
f. Additionally, any serious adverse e vents that occur after the 30 day time period that are 
related to the study treatment must be reported to the IND Office. This may include the 
development of a secondary malignancy.  
    7.2.1.2  Classifications for adverse event assessment 
7.2.1.2.1  Inten sity 
The intensity of the AE is classified according to the CTCAEv4.03.  Grade refers to 
the severity (intensity) of the AE:  
CTCAEv4 .03 Grade 1 : mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention is not indicated.  
CTCAEv4 .03 Grade 2 : moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention is 
indicated; limiting to age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL; 
instrumental ADL refers to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, usin g 
the telephone, managing money, etc. ). 
CTCAEv4 .03 Grade 3 : Severe or medically significant but not immediately life 
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization is indicated; disabling; limiting to self care ADL (self care ADL refers to  bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden).  
CTCAEv4 .03 Grade 4 : life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention is indicated. 
CTCAEv4 .03 Grade 5 : death due to an AE. 
7.2.1.2.2  Causal relationship  
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of treatment is a clinical decision based on all a vailable information . 
The causality assessment should be done separately for each study treatment . 
The assessment  is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal 
relationship” to the study treatment in question.  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   36 of 45 
    
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”.  
An assessment of “no” would include:  
1. The existence of a clear alternative explanation, e.g. mechanical  bleeding at surgical 
site. 
or 
     2.  Non -plausibility, e.g. the subject is struck by an automobile when there is no 
indication that the drug caused disorientation that may have caused the event; cancer 
developing a few days after the first drug administration.  
An assessment of “yes” indicates that there is a reaso nable suspicion that the AE is      
associated with the use of the study treatment.  
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment   
include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug 
is given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re -introduction (re -
challenge):  
- Subject’s response after de-challenge or subjects response after re -challenge should be 
considered in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question. 
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural hist ory and course of the 
disease being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined to determine whether any of them ma y be suspected to cause the event in 
question.  
- The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the study treatment, coupled with the individual subject’s pharmacodynamics should be considered.  
[Causal relationship to protocol -required procedure(s)]  
The assessment of a possible causal relationship between the AE and protocol -required 
procedure(s) is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” 
to protocol -required procedure(s).  
Possible answers are “yes” or “no”.  
 7.2.1.2.3  Action taken with study treatment  
    Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories  
    listed below.      
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   37 of 45 
    
   The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment.  
־ Drug withdrawn 
־ Drug interrupted  
־ Dose not changed 
־ Dose increased  
־ Not applicable  
־ Unknown  
7.2.1.2.4  Other specific treatment(s) of adverse events  
־ None 
־ Remedial drug therapy  
־ Other  
 7.2.1.2.5  Outcome  
The outcome of the AE is to be documented as follows:  
־ Recovered/resolved  
־ Recovering/resolving  
־ Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
־ Not recovered/not resolved 
־ Fatal  
־ Unknown  
  
7.2.1.3  Reporting  of serious  adverse events  
The definition of serious adverse events (SAEs) is given in Section  0.1. 
Each serious adverse event must be followed up until resolution or stabilization, by submission 
of updated reports to the designated person. An isolated laboratory abnormality that is assi gned 
grade 4, according to CTC definition, is not reportable as an SAE;  unless the investigator 
assesses that the event meets standard ICH criteria for an SAE.  CTC grade 4 baseline laboratory abnormalities that are part of the disease profile should not b e reported as an SAE, 
specifically when they are allowed or not excluded by the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria.   
 Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by the IND Sponsor (Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 312.32. Whe n required, and according to local law and 
regulations, serious adverse events must be reported to the Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authorities.

7.2.1.4  Ex pected adverse events  
For this study, the applicable reference document is the most current version of the 
investigator’s brochure (IB) / summary of product characteristics.  
Overview listings of frequent events that have occurred so far in the cl inical development are 
shown in the current IB.  If relevant new safety information is identified, the information will be integrated into an update of the IB and distributed to all participating sites.  
The expectedness of AEs will be determined by Bayer  according to the applicable reference 
document and according to all local regulations.  
7.2.2  Pregnancies  
The investigator must report to Bayer any pregnancy occurring in a study subject, or in his 
partner, during the subject’s participation in this study.  The report should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE .   
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully, and any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. 
For the pregnancy of a study subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar 
information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.  
For all reports, the forms provided are to be used.  
7.2.3  Further safety  
Death  
If any subject dies du ring the trial or within 30 days of the end- of-treatment visit, the 
investigator will inform Bayer  and record the cause of death in detail (using the SAE Form) 
within 24 hours.  
 
7.3  Appropriateness of procedures/measurements  
The assessments described in t he previous sections are widely used and generally recognized 
as reliable, accurate, and relevant for determining the safety and efficacy of therapies in this disease.

8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size 
This is a single- arm, open label, p hase II trial to assess the ability of Ra- 223 dichloride + 
Hormonal agent + Denosumab responsiveness in patients with Hormone -Positive Bone -
Dominant Metastatic Breast Carcinoma.  
 
 
The primary endpoint is disease control rate at 9 months . With 36 patients, we will have an 85 % 
power to detect the disease control  rate of 90% against 70% based on our previous report with  
a two -sided exact binomial test at a significance level of 5%  (See section  1.2 for details) .1 
 . 
 
The severe toxicity events defined as  irreversible grade 3 and  any grade 4  or greater adverse 
events according to CTC definition  will be monitored  at cohorts of 5. Toxicity rate of 20% or 
higher will be considered unacceptable. Bayesian beta- binomial posterior probability will be 
evaluated in determining the toxicity stopping boundaries. The prior distribution of toxicity 
rate is assumed to follow a Beta (0. 2, 0.8) distribution with o ne patient worth of information. 
At any time after 5 patients have completed toxicity evaluations, the trial will be stopped if the 
following statement is true  
 
Pr[toxicity rate > 20% | data]  > 0.90 , 
 
which means that the trial will be stopped for toxicity if the posterior probability of the toxicity 
rate being greater than 20% is greater than 90%. The early stopping boundaries for toxicity, 
shown in the format of  
 (The number of patients with severe toxicities) / (The number of patients treated),  
 are ≥ 3/5, 4/ 10,  6/15, 7/ 20,  8/25, 10/ 30,  and 11/ 35.

The toxicity monitoring boundaries and the operating characteristics are provided using Multc 
Lean V2.1 developed by the Department of Biostatistics at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.  
 By the end of study, patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics such as frequency distribution, mean (± s.d.) and 
median (range).  Due to the small scale of the stu dy, exploratory results will be summarized 
based on descriptive analysis.  
 
Disease control rate will be estimated with 95% confidence interval.   
  
Time -to-event outcomes, including progression free survival and overall survival , will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.   
 
Toxicity data will be summarized by frequency tables, which will include any patient who 
received the treatment regardless of the eligibility nor the duration or dose of the treatment 
received.  
Exploratory Research Analysis  
The obtained data in all patient groups will be summarized with use of descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, median, and range. Any discrete measurements of markers 
will be analyzed by using the Chi -square test or Fisher exact t est, depending on distributions.  
9. Data handling and quality assurance 
9.1  Data recording  
 
It is the expectation that all data has source documentation available at the site.  The site must 
implement processes to ensure this happens.  Data collected from the study will be entered in 
PDMS/CORe. The Principal Investigator is responsible for assuring that the data entered into the database is complete, accurate, and that entry is performed in a timely manner.
 
 
9.2 Audit and Inspection  
Inspectio ns by regulatory health authority representatives  i.e. FDA  and IEC(s)/IRB(s) are 
possible.  The investigator should notify Bayer  immediately of any such inspection.  
9.3 Archiving  
 
Essential documents shall be archived safely and securely in such a way that  ensures that they 
are readily available upon authorities’ request.  
    
 23     January 2018  Version :  10 Page:   42 of 45 
    
Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations and in accordance with 
the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, in stitution or private practice.  
 
10.  Premature termination of the study  
• If risk -benefit ratio becomes unacceptable owing to, for example,  
- Safety findings from this study (e.g. SAEs)  
- Results of any interim analysis  
- Results of parallel clinical studies  
- Results of parallel animal studies  
(on e.g. toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenicity or reproduction toxicity). 
• If the study conduct (e.g. recruitment rate; drop- out rate; data quality; protocol 
compliance) does not suggest a proper completion of the tri al within a reasonable time 
frame.  
The investigator has the right to close his/her center at any time.  
For any of the above closures, the following applies:  
• Closures should occur only after consultation between involved parties.  
• All affected institutions (e.g. IEC(s)/IRB(s); competent authority(ies); study center; head of study center) must be informed as applicable according to local law. 
• In case of a partial study closure, ongoing subjects, including those in post study follow -
up, must be taken care of in an ethical manner.  
Details for individual subject's withdrawal can be found in Section 5.2.1.  
11.  Ethical and legal aspects  
11.1 Ethical and legal conduct of the study

Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by the investigator without 
discussion and agreement by Bayer .  However, the investig ator may implement a deviation 
from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the trial subjects without prior IEC/IRB/Bayer  approval/favorable opinion.  As soon as possible, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for i t and if appropriate the proposed protocol 
amendment should be submitted to the IEC/IRB/ head of medical institution .  Any deviations 
from the protocol must be explained and documented by the investigator.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the c onduct of the clinical trial at the site in 
accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations and/or the Declaration of Helsinki.  The Principal Investigator is responsible for personally overseeing the treatment of all study patients.  The Princ ipal Investigator must assure that all study site personnel, including sub -
investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study protocol and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during and after study comple tion. 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring that all the required data will be collected and properly documented.  
Publications and NIST  
 
Bayer recommends inclusion of the new NIST standard in abstracts/ pub lications submitted 
OR pending  publication January 2016 onwards    from IIRs and other non-  Bayer supported 
abstracts/publications for consistency. Investigators may choose to add a footnote to the publication or within the body of the publication include  the new NIST standard.

Study Description:  
This is an open -label, multicenter study des igned to assess the safe -use conditions for administration 
of ZULRESSO in a home setting to women with postpartum depression ( PPD) with the overall goal 
to improve patient access to ZULRESSO treatment. The safety monitoring plan for this study 
incorporates  safe-use conditions that are aligned with that of the FDA -approved ZULRESSO Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) and ZULRESSO prescribing information. A home 
infusion provider is responsible for implementing the safe -use conditions for administe ring 
ZULRESSO in the home setting.  
This study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days and a 60 -hour home infusion of 
ZULRESSO (Days 1 through 3). A home infusion provider will provide, oversee, and train pharmacy 
staff, home healthcare provider s, and other home healthcare provider staff involved in dispensing and 
administering ZULRESSO in this study. All investigators and all pharmacy and home healthcare 
provider staff involved in dispensing and administering ZULRESSO will be trained regarding th e risk 
of serious harm resulting from excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness during the 
administration of ZULRESSO. Home healthcare  providers  will also counsel participants regarding 
this risk and the importance of reporting any symptoms to a healthcare provider. Use of telehealth by 
the investigator is permitted for screening and remote assessments for monitoring or oversight of 
participants during the ZULRESSO infusion, as required.  
All necessary equipment and supplies (eg, pulse oximeter, bo dy weight scale, etc) used to conduct the 
study will be delivered by a home healthcare provider or shipped to the participant’s home.  
The screening period begins with the informed consent process, which may be conducted 
electronically. Consented participan ts will undergo remote or in -person screening procedures to 
determine eligibility.  
During the treatment period, a home healthcare  provider  will arrive at the eligible participant’s home 
on Day  1 to initiate the 60 -hour intravenous (IV) infusion of ZULRESSO . The home healthcare 
provider  must confirm that the participant continues to meet all of the eligibility criteria  and complete 
any predose assessments per Table 3 prior to administering the infusion.  
The open -label 60 -hour infusion will be administered as follows: 30  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 0 to 4), then 
60 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 4 to 24), then 90  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 24 to 52), followed by 60  mcg/kg/hour 
(Hour 52 to 56) , and 30  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 56 to 60). A programmable peristaltic infusion pump with 
alarm is to be used to ensure accurate delivery of ZULRESSO. The pump will be pre programmed  by 
home infusion provider pharmacy staff. If necessary, the home healthcare  provider  may re program  
the pump in consultation with home infusion provider pharmacy staff for any issues unrelated to 
safety. If the pump must be reprogrammed during the infusion due to safety, the home healthcare 
provider  must consult the investigator an d if necessary, the pharmacist  or qualified designee . 
Due to the risk of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, for the duration of the 
infusion, participants must be monitored for hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry equipped with 
an alar m and must be assessed for excessive sedation by a home healthcare provider every 2  hours 
during planned non sleep  periods. At least one home healthcare provider  must be continuously 
available on site in the participant’s home for the duration of the ZULRES SO infusion to monitor the 
participant and intervene as necessary. The p articipant must not be the primary caregiver of her 
dependent(s) and must be accompanied by another adult (other than the home healthcare provider) 
during any interactions with their c hild(ren) that occur during the infusion. If the participant becomes 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
8 the primary caregiver of dependent(s) at any point during the infusion, the infusion must be stopped 
and will not be resumed.  
All home healthcare providers will have 24 hour/day access to  home infusion nursing and pharmacy 
staff via telephone for any problems with the infusion pump, IV lines, or other equipment 
malfunctions. The investigator will be available 24 hour/day to address protocol -related 
queries/issues in addition to safety -related concerns.  
If excessive sedation or loss of consciousness occur at any time during the infusion, the infusion will 
be stopped until the symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as 
deemed clinically appropriate by the inve stigator.  
The infusion will be immediately stopped if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. After an episode of 
hypoxia, the infusion should not be resumed. For any potentially serious adverse reaction, the home 
healthcare provider must assess the participant, a dminister oxygen in case of hypoxia, and should 
contact local emergency services  and the investigator , if warranted.  
A fall precaution protocol must be in place for the duration of the ZULRESSO infusion.  
For lactating participants, the investigator and par ticipant should weigh the developmental and health 
benefits of breastfeeding against any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from 
ZULRESSO or from the underlying maternal condition. Participants may continue to breastfeed or 
express milk to fe ed their infant during the infusion if the benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk.  
Participants will also be monitored during the infusion for worsening of depressive symptoms or 
emergent suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  
In addition to local monitoring in the home, oxygen saturation , respiratory rate,  blood pressure,  and 
heart rate will also be remotely monitored throughout the duration of the infusion using a wearable 
device.   
Compliance to safe -use conditions, processes, and procedures will be assessed by  human factors (HF) 
researchers. Throughout the duration of the infusion, home healthcare provider staff will complete 
checklists and/or journals at the end of each day and/or shift to document any use -related issues. Any 
use-related issues determined to b e critical in nature will be followed up immediately by an HF team 
member so that the information is recent and can be reported and root caused adequately.  
Upon completion of the infusion, an HF team member will conduct a post -infusion remote interview 
with the home healthcare provider  to assess their comprehension of and compliance to processes and 
procedures and to identify potential procedural changes specifically for ZULRESSO administration in 
a home setting, with the goal of further mitigating any use -related issues or errors from occurring in 
the home setting.  Situations such as difficulties performing the tasks required to administer the 
infusion, procedural challenges, and unforeseen circumstances (eg, childcare issues, participant  
attempts to drive) will be documented.  
After completing or discontinuing the ZULRESSO infusion, the participants’ level of sedation should 
be assessed. Participants will be cautioned against engaging in potentially hazardous activities 
requiring mental al ertness, such as driving, until any sedative effects have dissipated. The home 
healthcare provider  who completes the infusion must not leave the participant’s home until she or he, 
in consultation with the investigator as needed, determines that any sedati ve effects have resolved and 
there are no safety risks to the participant. The home healthcare provider  must also ensure that the 
SAE/AESI form(s), if applicable, have been completed and submitted  to the investigator  prior to 
leaving the participant’s home .

Statistical Methods:  
A separate statistical analysis plan ( SAP) will provide a detailed description of the analyses to be 
performed in the study . The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock . 
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is def ined as the last 
measurement prior to initiation of the IP infusion.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each time 
point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will include 
counts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Safety Set will include all participants administered IP. 
All statistical analyses will be based on summarized data.  
Safety Analysis  
Incidence  of TEAEs will be summarized using descriptive statistics . All analysis will be based on the 
Safety Set.  
Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size is based on assuming a 7% incidence rate of TEAEs leading to IP disco ntinuation or 
interruption, which is the rate observed in the post -marketing setting. With 50 participants who 
receive ZULRESSO, the probability is 0.87 for observing at least 2 events; 0.69 for observing at least 
3 events, and 0.47 for observing at least 4 events.

    5. INTRODUCTION  
Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mood disorder estimated to affect approximately 
10% to 20 % of women giving birth globally. In the United States, estimates of new mothers 
identified with PPD each year vary by state from 10% to 24% with an overall average of 
13.2% (Bauman  2020 ). PPD is defined in both the Internation al Classification of 
Diseases  (ICD )-10 (World Health Organization 2010 ) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders (DSM -5 2013 ) as a major depressive episode in the postpartum period with 
marked impairment in functioning. PPD often co -occurs with anxiety. PPD is a leading cause of 
maternal mortality (Savitz 2011 ) and, by affecting maternal functioning , poses serious risks to 
the emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and physical development of the infant and siblings 
(CPS 2004 ; Noorlander 2008 ). Findings from several studies implicate that peripar tum 
fluctuations in reproductive hormones (in particular, the major progesterone metabolite, 
allopregnanolone) have a pivotal pathophysiological role in PPD  (Bloch 2000 ; Kanes 2017 ; 
Shule 2014 ). 
Allopregnanolone is a metabolite of progesterone created by the actions of 5 -α reductase and 
3-α hydroxy -steroid dehydrogenase.  Allopregnanolone  is a potent positive allosteric modulator 
of synaptic and extrasynaptic γ -aminobutyric acid -ligand gated chlori de channel (GABA A) 
receptors . Plasma allopregnanolone concentrations rise in concert with progesterone throughout 
pregnancy, reaching the highest physiological concentrations in the third trimester 
(Maguire  2009 ). After childb irth, these concentrations decrease abruptly (Nappi 2001 ). Failure of 
GABA A receptors to adapt to these changes at parturition has been postulated to have a role in 
triggering PPD (Maguire 2008 ). Allopregnanolone and pharmacologically similar compounds 
have been shown to have profound effects on anxiety and depression in animal models 
(Paul 1992 ; Maguire 2008 ). 
5.1. Brexanolone  (ZULRESSO®) 
Brexanolone injection  is approved by the US FDA under the trade name ZULRESSO for the 
treatment of PPD in adults.  
The brexanolone drug product is a proprietary formulation of brexanolone drug substance 
(chemically identical  to endogenous  allopregnanolone) and excipients.  
In clinical studies with ZULRESSO, r apid improvements in depressive symptoms were observed 
by the end of a 60-hour infusion, and these improvements were observed out to 4 weeks beyond 
the end of the infusion. For details on the pharmaceutic al properties of brexanolone, and results 
from nonclinical and clinical studies, see the brexanolone Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.2. Study Rationale  
In the US, ZULRESSO is available commercially only through a restricted program called the 
ZULRESSO Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) due to the risk of serious harm 
resulting from excessive sedation or sudden loss of consciousness during the infusion.  The 
requirement for ZULRESSO to be administered only to patients in a medically supervised 
healthcare setting limits  patient  access to ZULRESSO  for the treatment of PPD . There is , 
therefore , a need to increas e patient access to ZULRESSO while assuring safe use.  Use of 
ZULRESSO in the home setting has the potential to increase patient access to ZULRESSO while 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL

    maintaining the appropriate REMS requirements with elements to assure safe use in the home 
(eg, educatio n of patients and healthcare providers on the risk of excessive sedation and loss of 
consciousness, monitoring of patients for excessive sedation by a healthcare provider, and 
collection of safety data for any events of excessive sedation or loss of consci ousness).  
5.3. Dose Justification  
The dose for this study is consistent with the recommended dose in the FDA -approved US 
Prescribing Information , which is a continuous 60 -hour IV infusion, administered as follows:  
•  0 to 4 hours: Initiate with a dosage of 30  mcg/kg/h  
•  4 to 24 hours: Increase dosage to 60 mcg/kg/h  
•  24 to 52 hours: Increase dosage to 90 mcg/kg/h (a reduction in dosage to 
60 mcg/kg/h may be considered during this time period for pa rticipants  who do not 
tolerate 90 mcg/kg/h)  
•  52 to 56 hours: Decre ase dosage to 60 mcg/kg/h  
•  56 to 60 hours: Decrease dosage to 30  mcg/kg/h

    7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is an open -label, multicenter study designed to assess the safe -use conditions for 
administration of ZULRE SSO in a home setting to women with PPD with the overall goal to 
improve patient access to ZULRESSO treatment. The safety monitoring plan for this study 
incorporates safe -use conditions that are aligned with that of the FDA -approved ZULRESSO 
REMS and ZULRE SSO prescribing information. A home infusion provider is responsible for 
implementing the safe -use conditions for administering ZULRESSO in the home setting.  An 
overview of r oles and responsibilities of study personnel is provided in Table  2. 
This study consists of a screening period of up to 28 days and a 60 -hour home infusio n of 
ZULRESSO (Days 1 through 3). A home infusion provider will provide, oversee, and train 
pharmacy staff and home healthcare provider staff involved in dispensing and administering 
ZULRESSO in this study. All investigators and all pharmacy and home healt hcare provider staff 
involved in dispensing and administering ZULRESSO will be trained regarding the risk of 
serious harm resulting from excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness during the 
administration of ZULRESSO. Home healthcare providers  will also counsel participants 
regarding this risk and the importance of reporting any symptoms to a healthcare provider. Use 
of telehealth by the investigator is permitted for screening and remote assessments for 
monitoring or oversight of participants duri ng the ZULRESSO infusion, as required.  
All necessary equipment  and supplies (eg, pulse oximeter,  body weight scale,  etc) used to 
conduct the study will be delivered by a home healthcare provider or shipped to the participant ’s 
home.  
The screening period be gins with the informed consent process, which may be conducted 
electronically. Consented participants will undergo remote or in -person screening procedures to 
determine eligibility.  
During the treatment period, a home healthcare provider  will arrive at th e eligible  participant’s 
home on Day  1 to initiate the 60 -hour intravenous (IV) infusion of ZULRESSO.  The home 
healthcare provider  must confirm that the participant continues to meet all of the eligibility 
criteria  and complete any predose assessments per Table 3 prior to administering the infusion.  
The open -label 60 -hour infusion will be administered as follows: 30  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 0 to 4), 
then 60  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 4 to 24), then 90  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 24 to 52), followed by 
60 mcg/kg/hour (Hour 52 to 56), and 30  mcg/kg/hour (Hour 56 to 60). A programmable 
peristaltic infusion pump with alarm  is to be used to ensure accurate delivery of ZULRESSO.  
The pum p will be preprogrammed  by home infusion provider pharmacy staff. If necessary, the 
home healthcare provider  may reprogram  the pump as described in Section  10.5. 
Due to the risk of excessive sedation and sudden loss of consciousness, for the duration of the 
infusion, participants must be monitored for hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry equipped 
with an alarm and must be assessed for excessive sedati on by a home healthcare provider every 
2 hours during planned nonsleep  periods. At least 1 home healthcare provider  must be  
continuously available on site in the participant’s home for the duration of the ZULRESSO 
infusion to monitor the participant and intervene as necessary. The p articipant must not be the 
primary caregiver of her dependent(s) and must be accompanied by another adult (oth er than the 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  
    home healthcare provider) during any interactions with her child(ren) that occur during the 
infusion. If the participant becomes the primary caregiver of dependent(s) at any point during the 
infusion, the infusion must be stopped and will not b e resumed.  
All home healthcare providers will have 24 hours/day access to home infusion nursing and 
pharmacy staff via telephone for any problems with the infusion pump, IV lines, or other 
equipment malfunctions. The investigator will be available 24 hours /day to address 
protocol -related queries/issues in addition to safety -related concerns.  
If excessive sedation  or loss of consciousness  occur at any time during the infusion, the infusion 
will be stopped until the symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resum ed at the same or lower 
dose as deemed clinically appropriate  by the investigator . 
The infusion will be immediately stopped if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. After an episode of 
hypoxia, the infusion should not be resumed.  For any potentially serious adve rse reaction, the 
home healthcare provider must assess the participant, administer oxygen in case of hypoxia, and 
should contact local emergency services  and the investigator , if warranted.  
A fall precaution protocol must be in place for the duration of th e ZULRESSO infusion.  
For lactating  participants , the investigator  and participant  should weigh the developmental and 
health benefits of breastfeeding against any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from 
ZULRESSO or from the underlying maternal  condition. Participants  may continue to breastfeed 
or express milk to feed their infant during the infusion if the benefit is deemed to outweigh the 
risk. 
Participants will also be monitored during the infusion for worsening of depressive symptoms or 
emer gent suicidal thoughts and behaviors  (see Section  12.1.7 ). 
In addition to local monitoring in the home, oxygen saturation and heart rate will also be 
remotely monitored throughout the duration of the infusion using a wearable device.  
Compliance to safe -use conditions, processes, and procedures will be assessed by h uman factors 
(HF) researchers  through evaluation of daily and/or end -of-shift checklists a nd/or journals 
completed by home healthcare provider staff (see Section  12.1.10 ). 
Upon completion of the infusion, an HF team member will conduct a post -infusion remote 
interview with the home healthcare provider  to assess their comprehension of and compliance to 
processes and procedures and to identify potential procedural changes spec ifically for 
ZULRESSO administration in a home setting, with the goal of further mitigating any use -related 
issues or errors from occurring in the home setting  (see Section  12.1.11 ). 
After completi ng or discontinuing the ZULRESSO infusion , the participants ’ level of sedation 
should be assessed. Participants  will be cautioned against engaging in potentially hazardous 
activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving, until any sedative effects have dissipated. 
The home healthcare provider  who is present when the participant  completes the infusion must 
not leave the participant’s home until she or he, in consultation with the investigator as needed, 
determines that any sedative effects have resolved and there are no safety risks to the participant. 
The home healthcare provider  must also ensure that the SAE /AESI form(s), if applicable, have 
been completed and submitted  to the investigator  as described in Section  12.2.3  prior to leaving 
the participant’s h ome.

7.2. Number of Participant s 
Up to  50 participants may participate.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
In this open -label study, participants will be administered a single, continuous, 60 -hour, IV 
infusion of ZULRESSO  starting on Day 1.  
7.4. Dose Adjustment  Criteria  
If excessive sedation occurs at any time during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped until the 
symptoms resolve. The infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically 
appropriate.  The infusion will be i mmediately stop ped if pulse oximetry reveals hypoxia. After 
an episode of hypoxia, the infusion should not be resumed.  
For pa rticipants  who do not tolerate  the 90 mcg/kg/hour dose for reasons other than hypoxia , a 
reduction to 60  mcg/kg/hour may be considered  during the time period that the 90 mcg/kg/hour  
is scheduled to occur . 
Any sedation -related AEs that lead to dose interruption, termination, or reduction should be 
recorded as AESIs, and should be reported in an expedited manner as outlined in  Section  12.2.3 . 
If other intolerable AEs occur, the infusion will be st opped until the symptoms resolve. The 
infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically appropriate . 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons , includi ng the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participants, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator. Investigational sites must p romptly notify 
their IRB/ Independent E thics Committee  (IEC) , where required,  and initiate withdrawal 
procedures for participating participants.

will be kept in the study files.  
The pharmacist or qualified  designee will ship the prepared infusion bags  and ancillary supplies 
(see Section  10.8) to the participant’s home. Participants will be instructed not to open 
shipments . Upon arrival at the participant’s home on Day 1, t he home healthcare  provider will be 
responsible for opening  and assessing the shipped supplies.  
The home healthcare provider  should check the prepared infusion bags and ancillary supplies 
and verify proper identity, quantity, integrity , and temperature con ditions, and report any 
deviations, dispensing errors , or discrepancies  to the sponsor , the investigator , and the home 
infusion provider  immediately.  
The h ome healthcare provider  will access the telemedicine platform upon arrival to the 
participant’s home prior to initiation of the IP infusion . Via the telemedicine platform, the home 
healthcare provider will provide the necessary participant -identifying information, including the 
participant identification number assigned at screening , and obtain the medication identification 
number for the IP  to be dispensed and the  weight -based dosing information  for that participant. 
The medication ID number that was received at the participant’s home must be recorded.

    The IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator , pharmacist  or 
qualified designee, and other home infusion  provider staff involved in disp ensing and 
administering the IP infusion  must keep a record of all IP and ancillary supplies (see 
Section  10.8) received, used , and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability reconciliation.  
The investigator, pharmacist or qualified designee , and other home infusion  provider staff are  
responsible for IP and ancillary supply  accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance 
(ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
At the end of the infusion for each participant , all used and unused IV  bags will be returned to 
the home infusion provider  for destruction per the home infusion provider’s  procedures; 
disposition of IP will be documented.  IP may not be destroyed until accountability and 
reconciliation procedures have been completed.  
10.7. Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfaction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness , or performance (applicable 
for approved marketed products) of a drug pr oduct after it is released for distribution.  
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall notify Sage within 24 hours by 
forwarding the product com plaint information via the contact information listed in  Table 1 and in 
the pharmacy manual . Where possible, personnel should segregate and retain any product, 
materials, or packaging associated with the product complaint until further instruction is 
provided by Sage or its designated representative(s).  
10.8. Ancillary Supplies  
The home infusion provider will provide  PVC, non -DEHP, nonlatex infusion set s and a 
programmable peristaltic infusion pump  with alarm  for each participant . The pharmacist or 
qualified designee will ship the infusion set s and preprogrammed infusion pump to the 
participant’s home  prior to Day  1. At the end of the  infusion for each participant , the infusion 
set(s) and pump will be returned to the home infusion provider  per the home infusion provider’s 
procedures; disposition of ancillary supplies  will be docum ented.

    12. SAFETY  ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be recorded at the time points summarized in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 3). 
12.1.1.  Demograph y and Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, sex, ethnicity) and a full medical and surgical  history 
will be documented.  
Information regarding diagnosis , isolation, and/or hospitalization due to COVID -19 will be 
documented as part of medical history, AE collection, and prior/concomitant 
medication/procedure collection at screening and throughout the  study.  
12.1.2.  Weight  and Height  
After the participant provides informed consent, a body weight scale will be delivered to the 
participant’s home. The participant will weigh herself on the scale approximately 7 days prior to 
Day 1  and report her body weight to s tudy personnel. Body weight at screening/baseline is used 
to calculate ZULRESSO dose and is to be confirmed by the home healthcare provider on Day  1 
prior to dosing  to determine whether any change to ZULRESSO dose is required.  
12.1.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs inclu de blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Blood 
pressure should be collected in the supine position at all scheduled time points.  Respiratory rate, 
heart rate, and oxygen saturation will be monitored  continuously  through a  wearable device . The 
wearable device  may also track additional patient parameters such as body temperature and step 
count  that will not be collected  in the telemedicine platform  or study database .  
Additionally,  vital signs  should be collected f or any participant who  experiences an AESI 
(defined in  Section  12.2.3 ) as soon as is feasible after the onset of the event and recorded as 
unscheduled  in the eCRF. Collection of vital signs should occur per local clinical practice, at a 
minimum until the participant  is considered to have recover ed from the event .  
12.1.4.  Oxygen Saturation  
Participants  will be monitored for hypoxia using continuous pulse oximetry equipped with an 
alarm. Oxygen saturation  will only be  recorded in the event of excessive sedation, loss of 
consciousness, hypoxia,  or AESI . The infusion will be i mmediately stop ped if pulse ox imetry 
reveals hypoxia. After an episode of hypoxia, the infusion  should  not be resumed.  
For any potentially serious adverse reaction, the home healthcare provider must assess the 
participant and administer oxygen in case of hypoxia  and should contact loca l emergency 
services and the investigator, if warranted.  
12.1.5.  Remote Monitoring of Oxygen Saturation and Vital Signs  
In addition to local monitoring in the home, oxygen saturation and vital signs will also be 
remotely monitored continuously throughout the duration of the infusion using a wireless,

 34  
     
 
 
 
12.1.6.  Monitoring for Excessive Sedation  
For the duration of the infusion, participants  must be assess ed for excessive sedation by a 
healthcare provider every 2 hours during planned nonsleep  periods.  If excessive sedation occurs 
at any time during the infusion, the infusion will be stopped until the symptoms resolve . The 
infusion may be resumed at the same or lower dose as clinically a ppropriate (see Section  7.4), 
and an AESI is to be reported  (see Section  12.2.3 ). 
For any potentially serious adverse reaction, the home healthcare provider must assess the 
participant and should contact local emergency services  and the investigator , if warranted.  
12.1.7.  Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior s 
Participants should be counseled before the start of the ZULRESSO infusion to pay close 
attention to any changes  related to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, especially sudden changes in 
mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings ; participants should tell the healthcare provider right away 
if she has any new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts, or feelings.  
The investigator should c onsider changing the therapeutic regimen, including discontinuing 
ZULRESSO, in pa rticipant s whose depression becomes worse or who experience emergent 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors.  
12.1.8.  Pregnancy Screen  
A urine pregnancy test will be conducted for all participants at screening; a urine pregnancy test 
will be conducted on Day 1 prior to the start o f the infusion.  
12.1.9.  Nonadherence  with the Safe -use Conditions for Administration of ZULRESSO  
A secondary endpoint of this study is incidence of nonadherence  with the safe -use conditions for 
administration of ZULRESSO. Nonadherence  with safe -use conditions for administration of 
ZULRESSO in the home setting is defined by any of the following:  
• Failure of the home infusion provider to train all pharmacy and home healthcare 
provider staff involved in dispensing and administration of Z ULRESSO  on risk of 
excessive sed ation and loss of consciousness  
• Failure of home healthcare providers  to counsel participants on risk of excessive 
sedation and loss of consciousness  
• Failure of home infusion provider to deliver Z ULRESSO  as per protocol 
requirements  
• Failure to provide preprogrammed  peristaltic pump with alarm  
• Failure by the home healthcare provider to assess for excessive sedation every 
2 hours during planned nonsleep  periods  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 35  
    • Failure to have at least one home healthcare provider continuously available on site in 
the particip ant’s home for the duration of the ZULRESSO infusion  
• Failure to have fall protocol in place  
• Failure to continuously monitor participants with pulse oximeter with alarm  
• Failure to stop infusion when participant is primary caregiver of dependents  
• Failure by the home healthcare provider to change the infusion bag according to the 
protocol  
• Failure to stop the  infusion upon identification of excessive sedation , loss of 
consciousness,  or hypoxic episode  
• Infusion resumed after an episode of hypoxia  
• Failure to caution participants post -infusion against engaging in potentially hazardous 
activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving, until any sedative effects have 
dissipated  
• Failure to complete the AESI/SAE form(s), as applicable  
12.1.10.  Daily  and/or End-of-Shift Checklist/ Journal  
Throughout the duration of the infusion, home healthcare provider staff  will complete checklists 
and/or journals at the end of each day and/or shift to document any use -related issues , including 
how the issues were ad dressed an d followed -up. Any use -related issues determined to be critical 
in nature will be followed up immediately by a remote HF team member so that the information 
is recent and can be reported adequately and analyzed for root cause s. This also include s 
nonadherence  issues in relation to safe -use conditions for administration of Z ULRESSO  as 
described in  Section  12.1.9 . 
12.1.11.  Post-infusion Interview of Home Healthcare Providers  
An HF team member will conduct a post -infusion remote interview  (no more than 3 days after 
completion of the infusion)  with the home healthcare provider  to assess their comprehension of 
and compliance to processes and  procedures and to identify potential procedural changes 
specifically for ZULRESSO administration in a home setting.  Situations such as difficulties 
performing the tasks required to administer the infusion, procedural challenges, and unforeseen 
circumstanc es (eg, childcare issues, participant attempts to drive) will be documented.

12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Adverse Event  Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharm aceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as an adverse event with onset after the start of IP, or any worsening of a pre -
existing medical condition/adverse event with onset after the start of IP and throughout the study. 
The term IP includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical study . 
Laboratory abnormalities and changes from baseline in vital signs, and ECGs are considered AEs 
if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic m edical 
intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) or if the investigator considers them to 
be clinically significant. Any abnormalities that meet the criteria for a serious adverse event 
(SAE) should be reported in an expedited manner  (see Section  12.2.6 ). Laboratory abnormalities 
and changes from baseline in vital signs  and ECGs  that are clearly attributable to another  AE do 
not require discrete reporting (eg , electrolyte disturbances in the context of dehydration, 
chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the context of sepsis) . 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 38  
    All AEs that occur after any participant  has signed the informed consent and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
Participants  who discontinue the IP due to an AE, regardless of investigator -determined 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator 
determines the event is no longer clinically significant. Any AEs that are unresolved at the 
participant’s  last AE assessment in the st udy are followed u p by the investigator for as long as 
medically indicated, but without further recording in the  eCRF  (which includes the telemedicine 
platform) . The sponsor or its representative retains the right to request additional information for  
any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary . 
12.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threaten ing event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incap acity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator  
may jeopardize the participant  or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above  (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require 
an inpatient hos pitalization) . 
All SAEs that occur after any participant  has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study , whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE /AESI  report 
form provided by Sage Therapeutics . Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant  completes 
their final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status , or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up . 
A prescheduled or elective pr ocedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a wai ting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the o pinion of an 
Investigator, between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.

547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 39  
    12.2.3.  Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An AESI is an AE/SAE of scientific and/or medical concern, specific to the product or program 
for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor is 
required. Such adverse events normally require thorough documentation and investigation in 
order to characterize them.  
The following events ar e considered AESIs and should be reported on the SAE/ AESI form 
within 72  hours.  
• Excessive sedation  
• Loss of consciousness  
• Any sedation -related AE  that lead s to dose reduction, interruption, or termination  
If the AESI also qualifies as an SAE , the SAE /AESI  form should be submitted per the guidelines 
per Section  12.2.6 . At the end of the ZULRESSO infusion, the home healthcare provider  must 
ensure the SAE /AESI form(s) , if applicable, have been submitted  prior to leaving the 
participant’s home.  
12.2.4.  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each adverse event 
(not related, related). The fol lowing definitions should be considered when evaluating the 
relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the pres ence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point toward s this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reducti on, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.5.  Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study. The AE 
term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the 
investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), resolution (date and tim e), 
intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if applicable), and whether the AE 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
547-PPD-404, Version 2.0  CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  
    resulted in IP dose reduction  or interruption , discontinuation of the IP , or withdraw al from the 
study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a suffici ent severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
signi ficant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of inte nsity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.6.  Reporting  Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the investigator  
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, s ign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage or designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be  sent to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  
Serious adverse events occurring after the designated foll ow-up time for the study, should be 
reported to Sage or designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator 
considers the SAE related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain  
events. It is the Principal Investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur in participants who are under  his or her oversight.  Investigators will also be notified of all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) t hat occur during the clinical study. 
IRBs/IECs  will be notified of SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by local law.  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory repor ting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARS to Investigators in a blinded fashion.

 41  
    12.3. Pregnancy  
Based on findings from animal studies of other  drugs that enhance GABAergic inhibition, 
ZULRESSO  may cause fetal harm. If a participant becomes pregnant after the first 
administration of IP, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy 
Form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Details will be 
collected for all pregnancies for which conception was likely to have occurred after the start of 
IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following the last administration of IP or until the 
comp letion of the study whichever is longer. Any pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be 
followed until delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  
The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The outcome of all 
pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal birth) must be followed and 
documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. The investigator will collect 
follow -up information on the participant and the neonate, and the information will be forwarded 
to Sage or designee. Generally, follow  up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks 
beyond the estimated delivery date. An y termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of 
fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with the eff ectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre -eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose  
Overdoses in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms should not be recorded as a  separate  
AE on the eCRF; however, all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage 
or designee within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. An overdose must be 
reported to Sage or designee even if the overdose does not result in a n AE. If an overdose results 
in an AE, the AE must be recorded.  
12.5. Medication Error  
Medication error is any preventable event that may cause or lead to inappropriate medication use 
or patient harm while the medication is in the control of the healthcare profe ssional, patient, or 
consumer. All medication error s must be recorded and sent to Sage or designee within 24 hours 
of the site becoming aware of the medication error. The m edication error must be reported to 
Sage or designee even if the medication error do es not result in an AE. If a medication error 
results in an AE, the AE must be recorded and reported as described in Section  12.2.

    14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/D OCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant  into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will remotely assess  the investigational study site  per Sage SOPs  to determine 
suita bility  of the investigator to oversee the clinical study  and discuss with the investigator(s) and 
other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities 
of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . This will b e documented in a Clinical Trial  
Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, and that data are being 
accurately recorded  
• Remotely review e lectronic  source  data collected through the telemedicine platform  and 
review any participant medical records, and other records relevant to the study . This will 
require direct access to all original records for each participant  (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented in the telemedicine platform and 
confirm any  AESIs or  SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs 
that met criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or IEC. 
14.2. Audits and Inspecti ons 
Sage Therapeutics or a uthorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or 
an IEC or an IRB may visit the site to  perform an audit (s) or inspection (s). The purpose of a  Sage 
Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to systematically and independently 
examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, 
GCP/ICH GCP guidelines , and  any applicable regulatory requirements . The investigator should 
contact Sage Therapeutics immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency  or IRB/ IEC about an  
inspection.  
14.3. Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee

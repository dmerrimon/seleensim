1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
 
Title A phase I/II study of first line gemcitabine , cisplatin and 
MEK162 in advanced biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) 
Primary Objective To evaluate the safety and activity of MEK162 in 
combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients 
with advanced BTCs naïve to systemic therapy 
Seconda ry Objective To assess tissue biomarkers and perform tumor whole 
geno me sequen cing to discern geno typic differences by 
anatomic location, histology and response to study 
therapy 
Rationale Median overall survival for patients with advanced biliary 
carcinomas is 8 months. Gemcitabine and cisplatin is 
considered the most active combination regimen and 
current standa rd of care for treatment of patients with 
advanced disease, however improvements in systemic 
therapy are urgently need ed. The Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk 
cascade controls normal processes necessary for cell 
proliferation and survival and thus has the potential to 
cause malignan t transformation if left unchecked. 
Mutations in KRAS and BRAF, both of which are 
upstream of MEK, indicate a role for this signalin g 
pathway in the pathogenesis of BTCs. Direct inhibi tion of 
MEK1/2 by is considered a valid strategy to study for 
therapeu tic targeting of the MEK pathway in BTC. 
Preliminary results of a phase II trial evaluating the MEK 
inhibi tor AZD6244 in a mixed popu lation of pretreated 
(39%) and treatment-naïve patients with BTC reported 
an objective response rate of 14% (including one 
complete response), stable disease in 60%, median 
progression-free and overall survival times of 5.4 and 8.2 
months, respectively. MEK162 is an oral, selective small 
molecule inhibi tor of MEK1/2.  In vivo studies performed 
on human tumor explants have shown that MEK162 
activity is potentiated by various chemotherapy agents 
includin g gemcitabine and cisplatin, providing a rationale 
for the combination to be evaluated in this phase I/II trial. 
Study Design/Intervention Eligible patients must have evidence of recurrent 
disease, metastatic disease or locally advanced biliary 
tract carcinoma not amenabl e to surgical resection. 
Measurable disease (RECIST) is required in baseline 
imaging studies. Histologi c or cytologic confirmation of 
diagno sis is manda tory. Patients will sign written 
informed consent. 
Phase I portion:

In the phase I componen t of the study, a classic 3+3 
cohort dose escalation scheme will be used to identify 
the MTD of MEK162 when administered with 
gemcitabine at dose 800 mg/m2 and cisplatin given at 
dose 20 mg/m2  week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle. The final 
cohort will receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2  and cisplatin 
20mg/m2  week 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle in combination 
with MEK162 at the MTD as determined above. MEK162 
will be self-administered orally BID from week 1 of each 
treatment cycle. MEK162 will be held for 2 days prior to 
chemotherapy administration and resumed the day 
following chemotherapy.  A minimum of 2 patients and a 
maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase I 
part of this study. 
 
 
Phase II portion: 
 
In the phase II part of the study, patients will receive 
MEK162 at 45mg BID plus gemcitabine (800 mg/m2) and 
cisplatin (20 mg/m2) as determined by the  phase I 
portion. 29 patients will be enrolled on the phase II part; 
plus the 6 patients treated at the MTD level on the phase 
I portion will be evaluable for the primary and seconda ry 
endpoin ts of the phase II part. 
 
 
For both phase I/II portions: 
Imaging studies for restaging purpose will be obtained 
every 3 cycles. Medical and laboratory evaluation will be 
done on weeks 1, 2 and 3 of the first cycle and at week 2 
of every cycle thereafter. Vital signs, nursing 
assessment, CBC and creatinine will be obtained prior to 
every treatment. Treatment will continue until disease 
progression, development of unacceptable toxicity or 
consent withdrawal. 
Correlative studies: 
Tissue 
Targeted cancer gene sequen cing of 230 gene s using 
next gene ration techniques will be condu cted in the 
pathology dept at MSKCC on available pre-treatment 
tissue samples to explore aberrations in the 
Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling cascade and identify 
geno typic differences amongst tumors according to 
anatomic site, histology and response to study therapy. 
Tumor samples also will be examined for Ki67 staining,

 expression of pERK by immunohi stochemistry and 
expression of markers of MEK activity (SPRY4 and 
DSUP6 mRNA by PCR). 
Blood: 
Pharmacodynamic studies exploring the biological 
efficacy  of the different doses of MEK162 will performed 
by measuring change s in peripheral blood pERK 
expression and cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry. 
Blood samples will be analysed pre and post treatment 
for circulating free DNA and results correlated with 
response to therapy. 
Statistical Design Phase I portion: 
The primary objective of the phase I portion is to 
determine the MTD of MEK162 in combination with 
gemcitabine /cisplatin chemotherapy.  A dose escalation 
scheme will be used whereby patients will be treated in 
sequen tial cohorts of 3. If no patients experience a DLT 
at dose level 1 in an initial group of 3 patients a new 
cohort of patients will be enrolled at dose level 2.  If 1 of 
3 patients experience a DLT, the cohort will be 
expande d to 6.  If no further DLT occurs, a new cohort 
will be enrolled at the next dose-level.  If 2 of 6 patients 
experience a DLT, MTD has been exceeded .  The MTD 
will be defined as the highest dose for which not more 
than 1 of 6 patients develop DLT. If three or fewer 
patients are treated at the dose considered to be the 
MTD, additional patients (to a total of six) will be treated 
at that level to confirm the MTD. No intrapatient dose 
escalation will occur. 
 
Phase II portion: 
 
 
The primary objective of the phase II part is to evaluate 
the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and 
cisplatin plus MEK162 in patients with advanced biliary 
cancers naïve to systemic chemotherapy. The primary 
efficacy endpoin ts are the 6 month progression-free 
survival (PFS) rate and response rate (RR) at one year. 
For the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin, the 6 
month PFS rate is 59% and RR is 26%. An exact 
binomial single stage design will be used to discriminate 
between true 6-month PFS rates of 59% vs. 82%, and 
between true response rates of 26% and 50%. Thirty five 
patients will be enrolled. If at least 26 patients were

 observed to survive progression-free for at least 6 
months, or at least 14 responses were observed among 
the 35 patients, this agen t would be considered worthy 
of further testing in this disease. 
 
This design yields 91% power to detect a true 6-month 
PFS rate of at least 82%, and a true RR of at least 50%. 
It yields a 0.05 probability of a positive PFS result if the 
true 6-month PFS rate is no more than 59%, and 
a 0.05 probability of a positive RR result if the true RR is 
no more than 26%. Therefore, assuming that PFS and 
RR are independen t, the over-all type 1 error is .10.  The 
type 1 error decreases very slightly if PFS and RR are 
positively correlated, which is very likely. 
 
Progression free survival will be calculated from study 
entry to documented disease progression or death from 
any cause, whatever occurs first. Time to death 
(survival) will be calculated from study entry to death or 
last follow up. Patients who stop therapy for reasons 
other than progression of disease or death will be 
counted as events; however they will be encouraged to 
continue getting restaging radiologic evaluations until 
progression or death. In that case, their PFS will be 
recalculated. Progression free survival, time to 
progression and survival will be estimated using the 
Kaplan–Meier methodolo gy. The documented response 
rate and exact 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
3.1 Biliar y tract carcinoma (BTC) 
 
Carcinomas of the biliary tract include gallbladder carcinoma, intrahepa tic and extrahepa tic 
cholangio carcinomas (perihilar and distal cholan giocarcinomas).  In the United States, 
approximately 7500 cases of BTC are diagno sed annua lly, of which 5000 are gallbladde r 
carcinomas and 2500 are cholangio carcinomas.1   The globa l epide miology of BTCs is influenced by 
gende r and ethno-geographic variables.  Female sex, parity, advanced age and the metaboli c 
syndrome are known risk factors.2-4   Gallbladde r carcinoma is a leadin g cause of cancer mortality in 
northern India and Chile where infection with Salmonell a typhi, a known risk factor, is ende mic.5,6
 
Cholangio carcinomas are especially frequen t in areas like northern Thailand where liver fluke 
infections are common.3 
 
The vast majority of patients diagnosed with BTCs present with advanced disease given the 
propen sity for regional and distant spread.  Overall 5-year survival rates range from 5-12% with a 
median survival of approximately 6 months for those with metastatic disease 7-9   The poor progno sis 
of BTCs highligh ts a continued urgent need for effective systemic therapies. 
 
3.2 Systemic therapy for advanced BTC 
 
Cytotoxic chemotherapy for BTC is typically composed of a fluoropyrimidine or gemcitabine 
backbone .  While some poole d analyses sugge st that both agen ts have similar activity as 
monotherapies, others have reported better response rates with gemcitabine compared to 
fluoropyrimidines (20-30% vs. 10-20%).10,11    The combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin yields 
response rates of 30-50% based on phase II trials.10    A recent meta-analysis of rando mized and 
non-randomized trials reported superior objective  response and tumor control rates with 
gemcitabine-platinum over fluoropyrimidine-platinum combinations.11    There was also a trend 
towards improved time to tumor progression with gemcitabine-platinum, but this did not translate into 
an overall survival bene fit.11    The mechanism unde rlying the apparent synergism of gemcitabine- 
platinum combinations is though t to result from the inhibitory effect of gemcitabine on repair of 
cisplatin-induced DNA damage.12,13 
 
The activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin was confirmed in the ABC-02 trial, a rando mized phase III 
trial comparing the combination with gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced (unresectable, 
recurrent or metastatic) BTC.  There were approximately 200 patients in each arm, and gemcitabine

1000 mg/m2  and cisplatin 25 mg/m2  were given weekly for two weeks followed by a week of rest for a 
total of four cycles.  Compared to gemcitabine , combination therapy significantly improved overall 
survival (11.7 vs 8.1 months, p<0.001), progression-free survival (8.0 vs. 5.0 months, p<0.001) and 
disease control (81.4% vs. 71.8%, p = 0.049).  Differential activity was not seen among the various 
sites along the biliary tree. 14   The ABC-02 study established gemcitabine plus cisplatin as a new 
reference standa rd for the treatment of advanced BTC.  Although other chemotherapy double ts such 
as gemcitabine and oxaliplatin,15,16  gemcitabine and capecitabine , 17,18 and oral or IV 
fluoropyrimidines with cisplatin19-21  have shown comparable activity, there have been no head-to- 
head comparisons with gemcitabine and cisplatin. 
 
3.3 Genetic alterations and the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk Pathway in  BTCs 
 
 
The rarity of BTCs poses a challeng e for study recruitment, and many trials have been inadequately 
powered to detect differences in outcomes between gallbladde r carcinomas, intrahepa tic and 
extrahepa tic cholangio carcinomas.  In clinical practice, advanced BTCs are currently regarded as a 
single disease entity treated with the same agen ts regardless of anatomic site of origin.  There is 
however a growing awareness that BTCs are heterogeneou s and efforts are unde rway to elucidate 
the common gene tic alterations associated with different anatomic sites.22   For example, mutations 
in CTNNB1 have been documented in gallbladde r carcinomas but not cholangio carcinomas.22 
ERBB2/Her2 overexpression has been found in 15% of gallbladder carc inomas, 5% of extrahepa tic 
cholangio carcinomas and 0% of intrahepa tic cholangio carcinomas.23   Vascular endo thelial growth 
factor (VEGF) overexpression has been reported in nearly 60% of cholangio carcinomas and 91% of 
gallbl adder carcinomas and is a poor progno sticator.24,25      KRAS mutations have been reported in all 
BTCs, althoug h the frequen cy seems to be highe st among intrahepatic cholangio carcinomas at 48- 
54%.26-28    while BRAF mutations have been reported in 20-30% of BTCs in two Europea n series, 
although none were identified in tumors taken from a North American and Chilea n popula tion.26,29,30
 
It is unclear if this discordance reflects artifact or true geog raphic differences in mutation 
frequen cy.26   There is currently no available data on the expression levels or mutation frequen cy of 
MEK in different parts of the biliary duct. The Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk cascade controls normal processes 
necessary for cell proliferation and survival and thus has the potential to cause malignan t 
transformation if left unchecked.  Mutations in KR AS and BRAF, both of which sit upstream of MEK, 
sugge st a potential role of this signalin g pathway in the pathogenesis of BTCs.22,26 
 
 
3.4 Targeting the MAP kinase (MEK) pathway in BTC 
 
 
Clinical evaluation of targeted therapies in advanced BTCs is a relatively new area of investigation 
and no such therapies have yet been approved for this setting.  The anti-tumor activity of MEK 
inhibi tion in BTCs has been assessed in several studies. 
 
Sorafenib is an oral multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the VEGF and platelet-derived growth 
factor receptors, c-kit, as well as the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway.  The results of two phase II trials 
evaluating single agen t sorafenib 400 mg BID in both treatment-naïve and treatment-refractory 
advanced BTC have been reported.31-33    Despite the emerging data implicating aberrant KRAS, 
BRAF and VEGF expression in BTC, objective response rates on sorafenib have been disappoin ting 
at 2-6%, stable disease is achieved in 30-50%, and median survival range s from 4-6 months .31,33

IRB Number: 13 -004 A(11) 
Approval date: 25 -Oct-2017  
Page 10 of 46  
  
 
 
Direct inhibi tion of MEK1/2 by AZD6244 appea rs to be a more promising strategy for targeting the 
MEK pathway in BTC.  Preliminary results of a phase II trial evaluating AZD6244 in a mixed 
popula tion of pretreated (39%) and treatment-naïve patients reported an objective response rate of 
14% (including one complete response), stable disease in 60%, median progression-free and overall 
survival times of 5.4 and 8.2 months, respectively.  Furthermore, pERK positivity was present in 90% 
of patients who had disease control compared to 0% of patients who progressed on AZD6244.  In 
contrast, stainin g for pAKT did not correlate with response.34 
 
3.5  MEK162 (ARRY-438162)  
 
MEK162 is an oral, selective small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2.  MEK162 exerts an anti- 
proliferative effect, induces apop tosis, and decreases phosphorylation of ERK, a downstream 
effector of MEK, in cancer cell lines and various solid tumor xenog rafts.35 
 
MEK162 has been evaluated in six clinical trials thus far.  Three of thes e were phase I studies 
condu cted in healthy subjects.35   Two studies were condu cted in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 
given the pro-inflammatory effects of Ras/Raf/Mek signaling, but primary efficacy endp oints were not 
met.36,37   A single oncologi c phase I study is unde rway beginning with a dose escalation phase in 
advanced solid tumors followed by an expansion phase in patients with metastatic BTCs or 
colorectal carcinomas (www.clinicaltrials.gov, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Preliminary pharmacodynamic 
analyses have shown that MEK162 suppresses pERK and significantly decreases markers of MEK 
activity and cell proliferation from pre-treatment levels, particularly at doses of 45 mg and 60 mg 
BID.  The most frequen tly reported grade 1-2 toxicities include asymptomatic elevations in creatine 
kinase, stomatitis/mucositis and diarrhea.  Retinal events including photopsia, darkened vision and 
altered color perception occurred in 14% of patients and reversed with cessation of MEK162. 
Efficacy data are currently pending.35 
 
The occurrence of retinal events, including more serious complications such as retinal vein 
occlusion, has been reported with multiple other MEK inhibitors being evaluated for their anti- 
neopla stic activity.38 -45  In a phase I study of the oral MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD-03529 01, patients who 
developed retinal vein occlusion had predisposing risk factors including hypertension, diabetes, 
dyslipide mia and glaucoma.38   While the mechanism unde rlying ocular toxicity with MEK inhibition is 
poorly understood, pre-clinical studies on rat models have revealed increased retinal gene 
expression of markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, endo thelial damage and procoagulability.4 6
 
Furthermore, the severity and type of ocular toxicity may be dosing schedul e dependen t.  As an 
example, while retinal vein occlusions were observed on a continuou s schedule of PD -0352901, 
none were seen with an intermittent schedule .38,41 
 
 
 
3.5 Combinin g MEK162 with chemotherapy 
 
Although incremental increases in survival have been observed with gemcitabine-based doubl ets in 
advanced BTC, the possibility of further improving outcomes with the addition of targeted agents is 
being actively explored.  In vivo studies performed on human tumor explants have shown that 
MEK162 activity is potentiated by various chemotherapy agen ts including taxanes, gemcitabine and 
cisplatin.35    In the Calu-6 mouse model, the combination of MEK162 plus gemcitabine and cisplatin 
has been shown to be tolerable and with improved delayed growth of tumors relative to single agent

MEK 162 or the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin. Clinical trials have shown that combinin g 
targeted agents with a gemcitabine-platinum double t is feasible, safe, and effective. A phase II trial 
of bevacizumab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin yielded an objective response rate of 40%, median 
progression-free and overall survival times of 7 and 12.7 months, respectively. 47 The addition of 
cetuximab to gemcitabine and oxaliplatin showed a promising improvem ent in 4-month progression- 
free survival over chemotherapy alone (61% vs. 44%).48  Furthermore, we recently completed a 
phase II trial at MSKCC of sorafenib, gemcitabine and cisplatin in advanced BTCs 
(www.clinicaltrials.gov, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  It should be noted that in this trial, gemcitabine and cisplatin 
were initially administered at the same doses as in the ABC-02 study (1000 mg/m2  and 25 mg/m2, 
respectively) concurrent with sorafenib at the standa rd dose of 400 mg BID.   However, these doses 
were poorly tolerated, resulting in a high frequen cy of hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea and elevated 
liver enzymes.  The study regimen was subsequen tly modified to gemcitabine 800 mg/m 2, cisplatin 
20 mg/m2, and sorafenib 400 mg, providing the rationale for the dose of gemcitabine /cisplatin 
chosen for use in combination with MEK162. In addition, preclinical studies performed in biliary 
cancer models have demonstrated schedul e dependen ce to the antitumor effect observed when 
sequencing the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 with gemcitabine . DNA synthesis was suppressed during 
treatment with AZD6244 , and re-entry into S-phase was delayed by approximately 48hr post- 
treatment. Strong schedul e depend ence was seen in all four biliary cancer models tested, 
sugge sting that combined treatment with AZD6244 plus gemcitabine would be more active in biliary 
cancer patients when gemcitabine is given following a 48hr interruption in AZD6244 dosing, rather 
than concurrently55. Based on this data we plan an interrupted dosing schedul e of MEK162 in 
combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. 
 
3.6 Summar y 
 
MEK1/2 is a therapeu tic target in BTC due to the frequent occurrence of activating KRAS and BRAF 
tumor mutations resulting in oncogeni c signalin g through the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk  pathway. Clinical 
activity of single agen t MEK1/2 inhibition has been observed in patients with advanced BTC, and 
pre-clinical evidence indicates enhan ced activity of MEK162 when given with chemotherapy. 
Gemcitabine-cisplatin is the current reference regimen for advanced BTC; the combination of a 
direct MEK inhibitor with chemotherapy has not previously been clinically evaluated in BTCs. W e 
propose a phase I/II study evaluating the safety and activity of gemcitabine , cisplatin and MEK162 
as first-line therapy for advanced BTCs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION 
 
4.1 Design 
 
This is a non-rando mised, open label, single institution phase I/II study of gemcitabine , 
cisplatin and MEK162 in patients with advanced BTC naïve to systemic therapy. 
 
In the phase I portion, up to 18 patients will be enrolled in classic 3+3 cohort dose escalation 
design to identify the MTD of MEK162 when administered with gemcitabine and cisplatin

given weeks 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle . MEK162 will be self-administered orally from week 
one of each cycle and held 2 days prior to chemotherapy administration. Treatment with 
MEK162 will resume the day following each chemotherapy administration. Patients will be 
observed for 6 weeks ( 2 cycles) prior to determination of the MTD.  Patients treated at the 
MTD in the phase I portion will be evaluable for primary and seconda ry endpoi nts of the 
phase II portion. 
 
In the phase II portion, up to 29 patients will be treated with gemcitabine 800mg/m2 , cisplatin 
20mg/m2  week 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle and MEK162 at 45mg BID. The dose of 
gemcitabine used in the phase II portion will be depende nt on results of the phase I portion. 
 
Phase I: 
 
• Primary endpoin t is to determine the MTD of MEK162 in combination with 
gemcitabine /cisplatin chemotherapy. 
 
Phase II: 
 
• Primary endpoin ts are six-month progression free survival and objective response 
rate at one year 
• Seconda ry endpoi nts are:  median PFS, median overall survival, safety/toxicity profile 
• Joint primary endpoin ts of PFS6 and response rate were chosen for the phase II 
portion as responses to treatment with single agen t MEK inhibitor were observed in a 
previous phase I trial in biliary cancer. The use of a dual primary endpoin t therefore 
ensures that if a significant  increase in response rate is observed but PFS6 does not 
reach significance, the combination will still be considered worthy of further 
investigation. 
 
 
 
Correlative studies: 
 
 
• Perform  gene tic analysis on tissue samples to evaluate for mutations in the 
Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling cascade and to look for geno typic differences between 
tumors that differ in response to therapy and anatomic/histologic classification54
 
• Evaluate potential predictive tissue biomarkers of response to MEK162  and markers 
of MEK activity including  tumor expression of pERK, Ki67, SPRY4 and DSUP6 
• Measure change s in peripheral T-lymphocyte pERK expression and cell cycle by flow 
cytometry.49-53 
•
 
 
4.2 Intervention 
 
Phase I: 
 
Patients will receive treatment on the following schedule : 
 
• Gemcitabine over 30 mins IV week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle.

o  NOTE: Infusions within 10 minutes of the specified time will be allowed at the 
discretion of the treating nurse (e.g. to allow patients to use the restroom) and 
will not be considered a protocol violation. 
• Cisplatin over 30 mins IV week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle 
o  NOTE: Infusions within 10 minutes of the specified time will be allowed at the 
discretion of the treating nurse (e.g. to allow patients to use the restroom) and 
will not be considered a protocol violation. 
• MEK162 orally BID starting week one of each cycle, with treatment held 2 days prior to 
each chemotherapy administration and resumed one day following chemotherapy. 
• Dose escalation schedul e for gemcitabine , cisplatin and MEK162 as below: 
  
 
Table 1: Dose levels for MEK162, gemcitabine and cisplatin 
 
Dose level MEK162* Gemcitabine Cisplatin 
 
1  
30 mg PO  BID 800 mg/m2 20 mg/m2 
 
2  
45 mg PO  BID 800 mg/m2 20 mg/m2 
3 MTD 1000 mg/m2 20mg/m2 
 
A dose escalation scheme will be used whereby patients will be treated in sequen tial cohorts of 3-6. 
If no patients experience a DLT at dose level 1 in an initial group of 3 patients a new cohort of 
patients will be enrolled at dose level 2.  If 1 of 3 patients experience a DLT, the cohort will be 
expande d to 6.  If no further DLT occurs, a new cohort will be enrolled at the next dose-level.  If 2 of 
6 patients experience a DLT, MTD has been exceeded.  The MTD will be defined as the highest 
dose for which not more than 1 of 6 patients develop DLT. If three or fewer patients are treated at 
the dose considered to be the MTD, additional patients (to a total of six) will be treated at that level 
to confirm the MTD. No intrapatient dose escalation will occur. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are 
defined as: 
 
1) Ocular disorders defined by: 
 
•   Central serous retinopathy (CSR): 
 
-  CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 lasting > 14 days confirmed by ophthalmologic 
examination 
 
-  CTCAE v4.0 grade > 3 confirmed by ophthalmologic examination 
 
-  CTCAE v4.0 grade > 2 recurrence with same severity following suspension of 
study therapy followed by resolution and resumption of therapy at the same or 
lower dose 
 
•  CTCAE v4.0 grade > 1 non-CSR retinopa thy confirmed by ophthalmologic examination 
 
•  CTCAE v4.0 grade > 3 visual disturbances (blurring, floaters, flashing lights) without retinal 
change s

3) Liver dysfunction defined by: 
 
•  Elevation of AST/ALT > 4 times baseline level or CTCAE v4.0 grade   3, whichever is 
greatest. 
4) Skin toxicity defined by: 
 
•   Rash/ photosensitivity > CTCAE v4.0 grade 3 lasting > 48 hours despite skin toxicity treatment 
 
5) Delay of more than 4 weeks in receiving MEK162 due to toxicity. 
 
6) CTCAE v4.0 grade > 3 non-hematologic toxicity, considered potentially irreversible or life 
threatening despite best suppo rtive efforts. 
 
7) CTCAE v4.0 grade > 4 hematologic toxicity 
 
Phase II: 
 
Patients will receive treatment on the following schedule : 
 
• Gemcitabine 30 mins IV week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle, at dose of 800mg/m2  as 
determined by phase I portion. 
o  NOTE: Infusions within 10 minutes of the specified time will be allowed at the 
discretion of the treating nurse (e.g. to allow patients to use the restroom) and 
will not be considered a protocol violation. 
• Cisplatin 20mg/m2  over 30 mins IV week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle 
o  NOTE: Infusions within 10 minutes of the specified time will be allowed at the 
discretion of the treating nurse (e.g. to allow patients to use the restroom) and 
will not be considered a protocol violation. 
• MEK162 orally BID starting week one of each cycle, with treatment held 2 days prior to 
each chemotherapy and resuming one day post chemotherapy at a dose of 45mg BID as 
determined by the phase I portion. 
 
For both phase I/II portions: 
 
Imaging studies for restaging purpose will be obtained every 3 cycles. Medical (vital signs and 
physical exam) and laboratory evaluation (CBC, comprehen sive metabolic panel , direct bilirubin, 
magne sium, amylase, lipase, and ldh) will be done on week 1,2 and 3 of the first cycle and at week 
2 of every cycle thereafter. Vital signs, nursing assessment, CBC and creatinine will be obtained 
prior to every treatment. Cardiac function will be evaluated by transthoracic echocardiogram at 
baseline and every 3 cycles. Patients will complete a pill diary, which will be collected and reviewed 
at each clinic visit. All patients will complete the Amsler grid test (test of central visual field) at 
baseline and week 2 of each cycle thereafter. If a patient has an abnormal Amsler grid test, he/she 
will unde rgo ophthalmologic assessment.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS 
 
5.1 Gemcitabine 
  
5.1.1  Definition: Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine analogue of deoxycytidine in which the deoxyribose 
moiety contains 2 fluorine atoms at the 2’-position. The drug acts as an inhibi tor to 
ribonu cleotide reductase and inhibition of DNA synthesis may result in perturbations of 
deoxynucleotide pools and interference with DNA chain elongation. The drug is cell-cycle 
specific and blocks cells in the G1/S interface. Cytotoxicity is schedul e-dependen t and 
increases with increasing duration of exposure. The drug is rapidly eliminated from plasma, 
owing mainly to deamination. Renal clearance of drug is less than 10% of parent drug. 
 
5.1.2  Supply: The drug is supplie d as either a 200 mg or 1 gram lyophilized powder in a 50-mL 
sterile single vial for reconstitution. 
 
 
5.1.3  Administration: The drug is administered via a freely running intravenous catheter per 
institutional guidelines. 
  
5.1.4  Toxicity: Nausea, vomiting, alope cia, stomatitis, anorexia, fatigue, elevations of hepa tic 
transaminases, reversible myelosuppression, rash, flu-like symptoms, edema, constipation, 
paresthesias, hypersensitivity reactions, phlebitis, proteinuria, hematuria, and rarely 
interstitial pneumonitis, ARDS and hemolytic uremic syndrome.. 
 
5.2 Cisplatin 
 
5.2.1 Definition: Cisplatin is a plana r inorganic metal salt that function as an alkylating agent. In 
aqueou s solution, the drug is equa ted to a diaqu o species as the two chloride groups leave 
the molecule. The reactive diaquo species binds to N7 residues of guani ne bases on DNA 
resulting in strand scission, and intra-inter strand cross-linking. 
 
5.2.2 Supply: Cisplatin is commercially supplie d as a lyophilized powder in 10 mg and 50 mg vials, 
and stored at room temperature. The drug should be reconstituted using 10 ml and 50 ml 
respectively of sterile water for injection, USP, to yield a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Pre- 
reconstituted multi-dose vials of 100 mg are also available. Once the multidose vial has been 
entered, the remaining cisplatin is stable for 28 days when protected from light. 
 
5.2.2 Administration: Cisplatin should be given IV drip per institutional guidelines. Needles and IV 
sets using aluminum should not be used in the administration of cisplatin. 
 
5.2.3 Toxicity: Fatigue, asthenia , nausea, vomiting, neph rotoxicity, ototoxicity, myelosuppression, 
anaph ylaxis, peripheral neuropathy, diarrhea, alope cia, hypersensitivity reactions, and rarely 
myocardial infarction, stroke, seizure, and blindne ss.

5.3 MEK162 
 
5.3.1  Definition: MEK162 (also known as ARRY-438162 ) is a potent, selective, allosteric small 
molecule inhibi tor of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MEK) that is 
uncompetitive with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 
 
5.3.2  Supply: MEK162 is suppli ed as film coated tablets. The film coated tablets consist of 
MEK162,lactose monoh ydrate, microcrystalline cellulose, colloida l silicon dioxide, 
croscarmellose sodium, magne sium stearate and a commercial film coating. The capsule- 
shape d film coated tablets are yellow to dark yellow, and are supplied as a dosage 
strength of 15mg. MEK162 film coated tablets are packed in a high-density polyethylene 
bottle with an induction seal and a child resistant closure. MEK162 film coated tablets 
should be stored below 25°C,protected from light. 
 
5.3.3  Administration: MEK162 will be orally administered by the patient themselves, as directed 
by the physician. Patients must take 90% of MEK162 doses per cycle. If a patient lives out of 
state and forgets to pick up their MEK162 refill, pharmacy may ship the MEK162 drug to the 
patient’s home address at the discretion of the PI or co-PI. 
 
 
5.3.4  Toxicity:  rash-like events (acne, rash, dermatitis acneiform, etc.), elevations of CK, 
diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis/mucositis, edema and visual change s related to retinal 
events. See investigator brochure (ADDENDUM 1) for full description of human and animal 
toxicity and pharmacokinetic studies. 
 
 
5.3.5  Manage ment of MEK162 related toxicity: 
 
 
Rash: treatment with topical or oral antibiotics, topical or oral anti-inflammatories, topical or 
oral corticosteroids. The use of emollien ts and sunscreens has not been evaluated with 
MEK162 but may be used prophylactically or as treatment for rash. 
Elevated CK levels: patients may remain on MEK162 per investigator discretion if 
asymptomatic. 
Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea: treat with standa rd anti-emetic and anti-diarrhoeal 
medications. Prophylactic treatment for MEK162-related nausea and diarrhea is not required. 
Edema: treatment with diuretic medications if clinically indicated. 
Stomatitis/mucositis-like events: institutional standa rd of care treatment 
Visual change s or new ocular findings: study drug should be immediately held and an 
ophthalmologic evaluation initiated. If visual change s or new ocular finding s are assessed as 
not related to study drug after ophthalmologic evaluation, then study drug can be resumed at 
the previous dose. See section 4.2 for definition of ophthalmologic DLTs

7.0 RECRUITMENT PLAN 
 
This study will be condu cted at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Between 2 and 47 
patients will be neede d to meet the study endpoints, projected accrual rate is two patients / 
month. 
 
All patients with biliary tract carcinomas referred for considerations of systemic therapy will be 
screene d regardless of gende r or ethnicity. Participation is voluntary. Before any protocol 
intervention and after discussion of the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, 
potential bene fits, side effects, risks and discomforts, patients may sign informed consent. 
Patients who agree to join, will sign an institution's IRB approved written consent form. Three 
copies of the informed consent will be signed and dated by the patient or the patients legally 
authorized representative. One copy will be given to the patient, one copy will be filed in the 
patient’s medical record, and one copy will be stored in the research file. Written consent will 
be obtained by either the principal investigator or participating investigators. Patients who 
prefer to be consented using another language than English will be consented in their

preferred language as per the standa rd operating procedures established by the IRB at 
MSKCC. 
 
During the initial conversation between the investigator/research staff and the patient, the 
patient may be asked to provide certain health information that is necessary to the 
recruitment and enrollment process. The investigator/research staff may also review portions 
of their medical records at MSKCC in order to further assess eligibili ty. They will use the 
information provided by the patient and/or medical record to confirm that the patient is 
eligible and to contact the patient regarding study enrollment. If the patient turns out to be 
ineligible for the research study, the research staff will destroy all information collected on the 
patient during the initial conversation and medical records review, except for any information 
that must be maintained for screenin g log purposes. 
 
The protocol will be advertised on the MSKCC website and also will be registered and posted 
on clinicaltrials.gov. The protocol however does not contemplate the use of any other form of 
advertisements or payment to participants.  In view of the high incidence of certain BTC 
among woman, and the large referral circle based on previous experience accruing to 
studies of BTC, there is no envisioned limitation in accruing women and minorities in the 
research study.

9.0  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
 
9.1 Gemcitabine and cisplatin administration 
 
9.1.1 Patients will receive treatment unde r the following schedule : 
 
• Gemcitabine : over 30 minutes IV,  week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle at dose of 800 
mg/m2 
• Cisplatin: 20 mg /m2 over 30 minutes IV, week 2 & 3 of a 3 week cycle 
 
9.1.2  One cycle correspond s to three weeks of treatment (21 days) 
 
9.1.3  Before week 2 of each cycle of therapy a CBC, complete metaboli c pane l including 
LDH, magne sium, amylase and lipase will be obtained . The total granulocyte counts must be 
≥ 1,500 and the platelet count ≥ 100,000 to proceed with therapy at week 2 of treatment.The 
serum creatinine must be ≤ 1.6 mg/dl or the CrCl has been measured at ≥ 60 ml/min at 
screening ) to proceed with treatment. Otherwise, hold therapy and re-evaluate weekly. 
 
9.1.4  Before week 3 of each cycle of therapy a CBC and creatinine will be obtained. The 
total granulocyte counts must be ≥ 1,000 and the platelet count ≥ 75,000 to proceed with 
therapy. The serum creatinine must be ≤ 1.6 mg/dl to proceed with treatment. Otherwise, 
hold therapy and re-evaluate weekly. Patients with a baseline serum creatinine of > 1.6 
mg/dL but with a creatinine clearance of ≥ 60 ml/min at screenin g, will be treated as long as 
creatinine does not increased by more than 30% from their baseline obtained at the start of 
the study. 
 
9.1.5  A maximum of four weeks delay of treatment is allowed. If gemcitabine and cisplatin 
treatment is held for toxicity week 2 of any cycle, that cycle and week of treatment is given 
when toxicity has resolved (i.e missed treatments are made up).  If gemcitabine and cisplatin 
treatment is held for toxicity week 3 of any cycle, that treatment is not made up and treatment 
continues per previous schedul e once toxicity has resolved. If MEK162 treatment is held for 
toxicity, patients continue on gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment per previous schedul e and 
resume MEK162 when toxicity has resolved.

9.1.6 Patients who require to come off one of the two chemotherapeutic agen ts, can continue 
with the other one along with MEK162. At the discretion of the PI and/or Co-PI, patients may 
be permitted to continue MEK162 alone without gemcitabine or cisplatin after completion of 6 
months of combined treatment with MEK162, gemcitabine , and cisplatin. In this situation,

9.1.9  Dose modifications: see section 11.2 
 
9.2 MEK162 Administration 
 
9.2.1  Starting  cycle # 1 day #1 the patient will initiate MEK162 at the appropriate dose 
level as per table 1 (see section 4.2.) . Treatment with MEK162 will be held 2 days prior to 
chemotherapy administration and resumed the following chemotherapy. 
 
9.2.2 MEK162 in 15 mg tablets will be dispensed through the outpatient pharmacy. Detailed 
instructions regarding taking the medication will be provided. Adherence will be determined 
by evaluating patient medication diaries. All non-used tablets will be collected and returned to 
the pharmacy at the end of each cycle. 
 
9.2.3  MEK162 will be continued, as long as tolerated, until the time of disease progression, 
or consent withdrawal. Patient whose gemcitabine and cisplatin have been 
discontinued for toxicity may continue taking MEK162 until recovery. 
 
9.2.4  MEK162 will be supplied by Array BioPharmaand provided at no cost to the patient. 
 
9.2.5  See section 11.2 for dose modifications of MEK162 on the phase II portion. 
 
9.3 Correlative studies: 
 
Tissue correlatives: Archival tissue will be obtained on all patients where available; paraffin 
block or 8-10 unstained slides. 
 
9.3.1    Genotyping: 
 
Archival FFPE tumor tissue and stored buffycoat samples will be used for geno typing studies. 
Sections will be reviewed by the reference pathologist (Dr. Jinru Shia) DNA will be extracted 
from reviewed FFPE tumor sections in the geno mics core laboratory using Agilent alternative 
DNA extraction kit . Matched germline DNA will be extracted from stored buffycoat

samples using Gentra Puregen e Blood Kit (Qiagen).  Tumor samples and matched germline 
DNA will be sequen ced for mutations in over 230 target genes (see Append ix A). These 
gene s include oncogene s and tumor suppressor gene s commonly mutated in biliary 
cancer as well as a wider selection of candida te genes.  This targeted gene sequen cing 
platform will be evaluated and interpreted by Dr Michael Berger from the  Department of 
Patholog y. Custom oligonu cleotides will be used to capture all exons of the target gene s, 
with exon capture performed by hybridization (Agilent SureSelect Target Enrichment System) 
followed by next generation sequen cing (Illumina HiSeq).  The accuracy and reproducibility 
of this platform has been demonstrated internally at MSKCC. This method of geno typing will 
allow the identification of sequen ce variants, small insertions and deletions and copy number 
alterations in the target gene s. See appe ndix A for full list of genes to be studied. 
 
9.3.2  Analysis of SPRY4 and DSUP6 gene expression 
 
RNA will be extracted from archival FFPE tumor tissue using High Pure R NA extraction kit in 
the Geoffrey Beene Translational Core Facility at MSKCC. Reverse transcriptase PCR will 
be performed using Taqman gene expression assay to assess mRNA expression of markers 
of MEK activation SPRY4 and DSUP6. Gene expression data will be analysed in conjun ction 
with the bio-informatics core facility. 
 
9.3.2    pERK/Ki67 pre-treatment immunostaining: 
 
Sections (5–6 μm thick) cut from paraffin-embedde d pre-treatment tumor biopsies will be 
analyzed with immunohi stochemistry using a rabbit polyclonal antibody for pERK (phospho- 
p44/42 MAPK [Thr202/Tyr204]; Cell Signaling Technolo gy Inc., MA, USA). Positive and 
nega tive controls will ensure that the integrity of all tumor samples and reagen ts is 
maintained . Positive controls, selected to encompass a range of pERK staining , include 
human xenog raft MD A-MB-231 (breast) and MiaPaCa (pancreas) cells, and a renal cell 
carcinoma biopsy. Slides from each biopsy will be stained with a species, isotype (IgG), and 
concentration-matched nega tive control antibody. A hematoxylin-eosin slide will also be 
stained for each sample. Stained slides will be evaluated indepen dently by two pathologi sts. 
Localization of pERK stainin g to cell nuclei or cytoplasm will be ev aluated qualitatively. 
Nuclear pERK stainin g intensity will be graded semi-quan titatively using a five-point scale 
that will be based on the percentage of tumor showing positive staining in relation to the total 
amount of tumor present in the section.: 0, no staining; 1+, weak; 2+, moderate; 3+, strong 
and 4+, intense. Ki67 will be performed on all samples as per established clinical laboratory 
protocol. The experiments will be performed in the Pathology Immunohi stochemistry Core 
Labo ratory at MSKCC, unde r the guidance of Dr Jinru Shia. Samples will be preserved in the 
pathology depa rtment at MSKCC. 
 
 
 
9.3.3    pERK flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis: 
 
Pharmacodynamic studies exploring the biological efficacy  of the different doses of MEK162 
will be performed by measuring change s in peripheral blood pERK expression using flow 
cytometry. The use of pERK for optimal biologi c effective dose is meant to be an exploratory 
investigation to complement but not replace MTD. In addition, PBMCs will be analyzed for

change s in cell cycle by flow cytometry using PI staining These studies will be performed by 
the Immune Monitoring Core Facility in collaboration with the Wolchok laboratory  under the 
supervision of Dr Margaret Callaghan and Dr Jedd Wolchok. 
 
Blood samples will be analysed for presence of circulating free D NA. The detection of tumor 
derived DNA circulating within a blood sample provides the oppo rtunity for relatively non- 
invasive assessment of the gene tic alterations harbored in the tumor.  Optimally the analysis 
of cfDNA can be used to determine tumor mutation status for patients in whom a biopsy is 
not feasible and potentially serial assessment for new gene tic alterations that occur during 
tumor progression and therapeutic resistance.  Genotype concordance will be assessed 
between tumor and cfDNA, the primary  endpoin t.  We will also assess geno type 
concordance between multiple separate collections of cfDNA as this has not been explored 
previously.  We will further assess clinical correlates that may associate with variance 
includin g cfDNA characteristics (fragment size/quan tity),  tumor burden, and sites of 
metastatic disease. Supernatent from prepared buffycote samples will be used for this 
analysis,to be performed in the Jasin laboratory, RRL and the genomics core facility. DNA 
will be extracted using Qiagen QIAmp CAN columns. Somatic mutations detected in the 
primary tumor will be assessedin cfDNA through digital PCR 
 
 
 
Blood correlatives: Collection and processing of samples: 
 
9.3.5    B uffycoat preparation from blood samples: performed in ETC 
 
Collection of blood : 
 
• Blood should be drawn into a 10-mL Lavenda r top EDTA tube 
 
• Mix immediately by gentle inversion 8 to 10 times. 
 
• After collection, store tube upright at room temperature until centrifugation. Blood samples 
should be centrifuged within one hour of blood collection for best results. 
 
 
 
Centrifugation steps: 
 
• For best results, blood samples should be centrifuged within one hours of blood collection 
at room temperature (18-25°C). Store tube upright until centrifugation. 
 
• Remix the blood samples immediately prior to centrifugation by gently inverting the tube 8 to 
10 times. 
 
• Centrifuge tube/blood samples at room temperature (18-25ºC) in a horizontal rotor (swing-out 
head ) for a minimum of 20 minutes at 1500 to 1800 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force). 
Some specimens may require 30 minutes. Centrifugation beyond 30 minutes has little 
additional effect. The tube may be re-centrifuged if the mononu clear “band ” or layer is not 
disturbed. Always check to see that the tube is in the proper centrifuge carrier/adapter and 
balan ced properly.

Pipetting steps: 
 
• Labe l a conical centrifuge tube. 
 
• After centrifugation, mononu clear cells and platelets will be in a whitish layer just unde r the 
plasma layer 
 
• Using a pipette, aspirate approximately half of the plasma from each Lavendar EDTA 
tube without disturbing the whitish cell layer and aliquot into 2ml Eppendo rf tubes. The 
plasma aspirates should be clear so as not to contain any white cells. 
 
• Spin the 2 ml Eppendo rf tubes containing plasma at 16,000xg x 10 minutes at 4 degrees. 
 
• Aliquot supernatant into labeled Eppendorf tube and freeze at -80 degrees. 
 
• Using a fresh pipette, collect the whitish cell layer from the Lavenda r EDTA tube and 
transfer into a separate properly labeled 15 mL size conical centrifuge tube. This layer will 
contain the remaining plasma layer plus the PBMC layer (this is the entire remaining layer 
above the gel). Collection of cells immediately following centrifugation will yield best results. 
The Lavendar EDTA tube will now only contain the unusable layers unde r the gel, and can 
be disposed of according to MSKCC SOP on the disposal of biohazardous waste. 
 
You should now have a conical tube containing the whitish cell layers (PBMC layers) 
Step 1: Preparation of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) Please allow 15-20 minutes 
for this step. 
• PBS is used for cell washing in step 2. NOTE: This will yield enoug h washing solution for use 
on both conical tubes containing PBMCs. The phosphate buffer should be prepared fresh for 
each subject and kept at room temperature. Any unused buffer should be discarded 
according to disposal SOPs at your facility. 
 
• Fill the 250 mL gradua ted disposable beaker (provided in kit) up to the 200 mL mark with 
deioni zed/purified lab water. Place one phosphate buffered saline (PBS)  tablet into the 
beaker. Make sure the tablet has dissolved completely and is completely mixed and in 
solution before proceedin g with step 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 2: Cell Washing Steps 
 
• Using a fresh pipette, add PBS to bring the total volume to 15 mL in each of the graduated 
conical tubes containing the whitish cell layer (PBMCs). Cap the tubes. Mix cells by inverting 
the tubes 5 times. 
 
• Centrifuge both conical tubes for 15 minutes at 300 RCF. Aspirate as much supernatant as 
possible from both tubes without disturbing cell pellets.

• Resuspend cell pelle t in both conical tubes by gently vortexing or tapping tube with index 
finger. 
 
• To each conical tube containing PBMC pellets, add PBS to bring volume to 10 mL in each 
tube. Cap tubes. Mix cells by inverting tubes 5 times. 
 
• Centrifuge both conical tubes for 10 minutes at 300 RCF. Aspirate as much supernatant from 
both conical tubes as possible without disturbing cell pellet. 
 
• Cap the conical tubes containing PBMC pellets, make sure tubes are tightly capped to 
prevent desiccation. Do not freeze tubes in a styrofoam tray because tubes may crack. 
 
• Freeze the dry pellet (do not re-suspend the pellet in additional PBS)  in an open tube rack at 
-80°C.  Samples will be stored at MSKCC for plann ed gene tic studies, in -80ºC freezer at 3rd 
floor, room 312 (3rd floor) of the Rockefeller Outpatient Pavilion at 160 E 53rd street. All

resumption of therapy should be discussed with the Study PI or co-PI, and gemcitabine 
and/or cisplatin will be reduced one dose level. 
• Patients who develop a gastrointestinal perforation, grade 4 hemorrhage, or symptomatic 
grade 4 venous thromboembolic event will not be eligible for re-treatment. 
• Any grade alopecia does not call for any chang e in therapy. 
• Patients who have an abno rmal Amsler grid test during treatment will hold MEK162 pendin g 
ophthalmologic review, then dose reduction will be as per instructions for ophthalmologic 
toxicity detailed below (11.2.2). If patients have abnormal Amsler grid tests and are cleared 
by ophthalmology to resume treatment, they may forego additional ophthalmology 
evaluations and continue taking MEK162 per the discretion of the PI or co-PI. This will not 
compromise the assessment of potential MEK162 mediated impact upon vision. Patients will 
be monitored for change s in vision at clinic visits and referred for ophthalmology assessment 
of any new ocular symptoms. 
 
Maximum Duration of Treatment Delays/Maximum Dose Reductions: 
• Treatment with gemcitabine and cisplatin may be held up to a maximum of 4 weeks from the 
schedule d cycle initiation date to await resolution of toxicity according to the guidelines

above. If more than 4 weeks are needed for recovery, the study PI or co-PI should be 
contacted. 
 
11.2.2: Dose reductions for MEK162 
For grade 3 and 4 toxicities attributable to treatment with MEK162, treatment should be 
withheld until   patient’s recovery to grade ≤ 2 and the possibility of resumption of therapy 
should be discussed with the Study PI or co-PI. 
 
 
• Treatment with MEK162 will be held in patients enrolled on the phase II portion with 
MEK162 related toxicity meeting criteria as below until toxicity resolves to ≤ grade 2. 
• If the dose of MEK162 used in the phase II portion is 45mg BID, treatment may be re- 
introduced at a dose reduction to 30mg BID, following resolution of toxicity as above 
and at the discretion of the study PI or co-PI. 
• If the dose of MEK162 used in the phase II portion is 30mg BID, treatment may be re- 
introduced at a dose reduction to 15mg BID, following resolution of toxicity as above 
and at the discretion of the study PI or co-PI. 
• If toxicity meeting criteria in section 4.2 recurs at MEK162 dose of 15mg BID, study 
treatment will be discontinued . 
• Patients may continue to receive MEK162 if treatment with gemcitabine or cisplatin 
has been discontinued for nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity or  pulmonary toxicity as per 
section 11.1.1. 
• See section 11.2.1 for specific instructions regarding MEK162 treatment and 
hematologic toxicity.

12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESS MENT 
 
Tumor assessments will be based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIS T 
1.1) guidelines. 
 
12.1  Measurability of Tumor Lesions at Baseline 
12.1.1 Measurable – Tumor lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension 
(longe st diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 
10mm by CT scan (irrespective of scanne r type) and MR I (no less than doubl e the slice 
thickness and a minimum of 10mm) or 10mm calipe r measurement by clinical exam (when 
superficial) 
 
12.1.2 Nonmeasurable – leptomeningea l disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangi tic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by 
reproducible imaging technique s. 
 
12.1.3 Target lesions: All lesions up to a maximum of five lesions total (and a maximum of 
two lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target 
lesions.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to 
reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be 
measured reproducibly should be selected 
 
12.1.4 Non-target lesions: all other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non- 
target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. It is possible to record multiple 
nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. 
“multiple enlarged pelvic lymph node s” or “multiple liver metastases”). Measurements of 
these lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted 
throughou t follow-up. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  
IRB Number: 13 -004 A(11) 
Approval date: 25 -Oct-2017  
Page 34 of 46  
  
 
 
If there is a defined objective that includes the assessment/measurement of therapeu tic 
response to the defined treatment intervention, then detailed description of the measure, 
methods to be used (e.g., scales and/or definitions to assess response) and the criteria to 
determine each level of therapeutic response should be included . 
 
If appropriate, indicate what are the limiting factors required to 1) assess response and 2) 
determine if subject is evaluable and to be included in the study results. This may include 
total number of treatment interventions required, duration of on-study period, total number of 
measures utilized to assess therapeu tic response, etc. 
 
12.1.5 Guidelines for evaluation of measurable disease: all measurements should be taken 
and recorded in metric notation. The same method of assessment and the same techniqu e 
should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during 
follow-up. 
 
12.2 Response criteria 
 
 
12.2.1 Complete Response (CR) - Target Lesions: Disappea rance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph node s (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to 
<10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if there are target nodes) Non-target Lesions: 
disappea rance of all non - target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
node s must be non-pathologi cal in size (< 10 mm short axis) . Non-CR: Persistence of 1 or 
more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenan ce of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
 
12.2.2 Partial Response (PR) - a 30-99% decrease in the sum of the longe st diameter of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longe st diameter. 
 
12.2.3 Stable Disease (SD) - neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum 
longe st diameter since the treatment started, or the persistence of one or more nontarget 
lesions. 
 
12.2.4 Progressive Disease (PD) – at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longe st 
diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longe st diameter recorded 
since the treatment started and minimum 5mm increase over the nadir, or the appea rance of 
one or more new lesions and/or uneq uivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions. 
 
12.3 Best Overall Response – the best response recorded from the start of treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence. The table below should be used to determine best overall 
response. Patients with a globa l deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported 
as “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

13.0  CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one 
of the following criteria applies: 
 
• Disease progression 
• Duration of therapy delay of therapy more than 4 weeks. In the rare instance where the 
investigator considers the therapy still be beneficial and more than 4 weeks are needed for 
recovery, the study PI or co-PI should be contacted 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study 
• General or specific change s in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for 
further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 
• If at any time the patient is found to be ineligible for the protocol as designated in the s ection 
on Criteria for Patient/Subject Eligibility (i.e., a change in diagnosis), the patient will be 
removed from the study. 
 
Patients who are removed from study for any of these reasons will continued to be monitored 
for survival, unless consent for continued follow-up is withdrawn. Patients will be encouraged 
to continue to undergo repeat staging radiologic studies scans until progression or death. 
 
14.0  BIOSTATISTICS 
 
This trial contains a dose escalation phase I portion to determine the MTD of MEK162 in 
combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. This will be followed by a non-randomized phase 
II portion to assess the PFS at six months in patients with advanced biliary cancer treated 
with gemcitabine , cisplatin and MEK162 at the MTD determined in the phase I trial. Six 
patients treated at the MTD of MEK162 in the phase I trial will be considered evaluable for 
the primary and seconda ry endpoints of the phase II trial. Anticipated accrual is 2 patients 
per month. 
 
Phase I 
 
In the phase I componen t of the study, a classic 3+3 cohort dose escalation scheme will be 
used to identify the MTD of MEK162 when administered with gemcitabine at dose 800 mg/m 2

and cisplatin given at dose 20 mg/m2  day 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle. MEK162 will be self- 
administered orally BID continuou sly. Three dose levels are planned. A minimum of 2 
patients and a maximum of 18 patients will be enrolled in the phase I part of this study. 
 
Table 1: Dose levels for MEK162, gemcitabine and cisplatin 
 
 
Dose level MEK162* Gemcitabine Cisplatin 
 
1  
30 mg PO  BID 800 mg/m2 20 mg/m2 
 
2  
45 mg PO  BID 800 mg/m2 20 mg/m2 
3 MTD (30mg or 
45mg PO BID) 1000 mg/m2 20 mg/m2 
 
 
 
A dose escalation scheme will be used whereby patients will be treated in sequen tial cohorts 
of 3. If no patients experience a DLT at dose level 1 in an initial group of 3 patients a new 
cohort of patients will be enrolled at dose level 2.  If 1 of 3 patients experiences a DLT, the 
cohort will be expande d to 6.  If no further DLT occurs, a new cohort will be enrolled at the next 
dose-level.  If 2 of 6 patients experience a DLT, MTD has been exceeded.  The MTD will be defined 
as the highe st dose for which not more than 1 of 6 patients develop a DLT. If three or fewer patients 
are treated at the dose considered to be the MTD, additional patients (to a total of six) will be treated 
at that level to confirm the MTD. No intrapatient dose escalation will  occur. This escalation 
scheme is summarized in Table 2.

The dose escalation scheme provides the following probabilities of escalation based on the true 
chances of DLT at a specific dose level. One can see that the probability of escalation is high if the 
toxicity risks are low:

True probabi lity 
of toxicity .10 .20 .30 .40 .50 .60 
Probabili ty of 
escalation .91 .71 .49 .31 .17 .08 
 
Phase II 
 
A rando mized phase II trial condu cted in 80 patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
BTCs reported a 6-month progression-free survival rate (PFS6) of 59% and response rate 
(RR) of 26% for the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin.55      An exact binomial single 
stage design will be used to discriminate between true 6-month PFS rates of 59% vs. 82%, 
and between true response rates of 26% and 50%. Thirty five patients will be enrolled. If at 
least 26 patients were observed to survive progression-free for at least 6  months, or at least 
14 responses were observed among the 35 patients over one year, this agen t would be 
considered worthy of further testing in this disease. 
 
This design yields 91% power to detect a true 6-month PFS rate of at least 82%, and a true 
RR of at least 50%.  It yields a 0.05 probability of a positive PFS result if the true 6- month 
PFS rate is no more than 59%, and a 0.05 probability of a positive RR result if the true RR is 
no more than 26%. Therefore, assuming that PFS and RR are independ ent, the overall type 1 
error is .10.  The type 1 error decreases very slightly if PFS and RR are positively correlated, 
which is very likely. 
 
Patients who drop out of the study before 6 months due to toxicity or other reason without 
documented disease progression will be counted as events (disease progression) for the 
primary endpoin ts. However these patients will be encouraged to continue to unde rgo repea t 
staging radiologic studies until progression or death. 
 
The PI and co-PI will be monitoring the outcome of the study on frequent basis. If it is found 
at any time that there are 10 patients that die or progress within the first 6 months, the trial 
will be stoppe d as at that point it is mathematically impossible to achieve the desired 
endpoin t of having 26 out of 35 patients alive and progression free at 6 months. 
 
Time to progression will be calculated from study entry to documented disease progression, 
while progression free survival will be calculated from study entry to documented disease 
progression or death from any cause, whatever occurs first. 
 
Patients who progress at the 26-week (+/- 2 weeks) planne d scan, regardless of the actual 
calenda r date of that scan, will be declared as have progressed at six-months. 
 
Time to death (survival) will be calculated from study entry to death or censored at last follow 
up.

Time to progression, overall and progression free survival will be estimated using the 
Kaplan–Meier methodolo gy. The documented response rate and exact 95% confidence 
intervals will be calculated. 
 
For the correlative study endpoints described in Section 9.3, progression-free- 
survival, tim e-to-progression, and overall survival will be correlated w ith categorical 
markers using the log-rank test, w hile C ox regression will be used for c ontinuous 
markers. Tumor respons e will be correlated using Fishers exact test for categoric al 
biom arkers and using Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous m arkers. The frequency 
of the CTC in the pre and post treatm ent biopsies w ill be summ arized   descriptively. If 
CTC are detected, the change in CTC from pre to post treatment biopsies w ill be 
associated with response using the Wilc oxon rank sum test. These studies are 
exploratory. Not all patients may have tissue available so the analyses may involve 
fewer than 35 patients. 
 
15.0  RESEARCH PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURES 
 
15.1  Research Participant Registration 
 
 
 
Confirm in the electronic medical record that the patient has received the Notice of Privacy 
Practice. This must be obtained before the eligibility confirmation and obtaining of the 
research informed consent. Confirm eligibili ty as defined in the section entitled Criteria for 
Patient/Subject Eligibility. 
 
Obtain informed consent, by following procedures defined in section entitled Informed 
Consent Procedures. 
 
During the registration process registering individuals will be required to complete a protocol 
specific Eligibili ty Checklist. 
 
All participants must be registered through the Protocol Participant Registration (PPR) Office 
at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. PPR is availabl e Monday through Friday from 
8:30am – 5:30pm at 646-735-8000. Registrations must be submitted via the PPR  Electronic 
Registration System (http://ppr/).  The completed signature page of the written consent/RA or 
verbal script/RA, a completed Eligibility Checklist and other relevant documents must be 
uploade d via the PPR Electronic Registration System. 
 
15.2  Randomization 
 
No rando mization required in this study 
 
16.0  DAT A M AN AGEMENT ISSUES 
 
A Research Study Assistant (RSA) will be assigned to the study. The responsibilities of the 
RSA include project compliance, data collection, abstraction and entry, data reporting, 
regula tory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordinate the activities of 
the protocol study team. The data collected for this study will be entered into a secure 
database, the Clinical Research Database (CRDB).  Source documentation will be available

to suppo rt the computerized patient record. 
 
 
16.1  Quality Assurance 
Weekly registration reports will be gene rated to monitor patient accruals and completeness 
of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess missing data 
and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and extent and accuracy of evaluations and follow -up will 
be monitored periodically throughou t the study period and potential problems will be brough t 
to the attention of the study team for discussion and action. Rando m-sample data quality and 
protocol compliance audits will be condu cted by the study team, at a minimum of two times 
per year, more frequen tly if indicated. 
 
16.2  Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
were approved by the National Cancer Institute in September 2001 . The plans address the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the document entitled “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html. The DSM Plans at MSKCC were 
established and are monitored by the Office of Clinical Research. The MSKCC Data and 
Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/_assets/_tables/content/359709 /DSMPlans07.pdf 
 
There are several different mechanisms by which clinical trials are monitored for data, safety 
and quality. There are institutional pr ocesses in place for quality assurance (e.g., protocol 
monitoring, complian ce and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus 
there are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our 
clinical trials programs. The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development and review process, each protocol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of monitoring required. Every type of protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NC I coope rative group, etc.) will be addressed 
and the monitoring procedures will be established at the time of protocol activation 
 
17.0  PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
  
 
 
17.1  Privacy 
 
MSKCC’s Privacy Office may allow the use and disclosure of protected health information 
pursuant to a completed and signed Research Authorization form. The use and disclosure of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals described in the Research 
Authorization form. A Research Authorization form must be completed by the Principal 
Investigator and approved by the IRB and Privacy Board (IRB/PB).

➢  Any SAEs that are expected due to the condition being treated, including if the 
SAE is a primary outcome measure, and whether there has been a clear agreement 
with regula tors not to consider these as SAEs, provided the information is collected 
elsewhere 
 
17.2.1 Reporting 
 
Reporting requirements to Array: 
 
All events must be reported, by FAX (303-386-1516), to Array Drug Safety within 24 hours of 
learning of its occurrence. This includes serious, related, labele d (expected) and serious, 
related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse experiences. All deaths during treatment or within 
30 days following completion of active protocol therapy must be reported within 24 hours. 
 
Any serious adverse event occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and 
until  4 weeks  after  the  patient  has  stoppe d  study  participation  must  be reported.  This 
includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standa rd medical treatment 
given to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, chang e in treatment to a 
fixed dose of concomitant medication). 
 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only 
be reported if a relationship to the Array study drug (or therapy) is suspected. 
 
Follow-up information is sent to the same person to whom the original SAE Report Form was 
sent, using a new SAE Report Form stating that this is a follow -up to the previously reported 
SAE  and  giving  the  date  of  the  original  report.  Each  re-occurrence,  complication,  or 
progression of the original event should be reported as a follow-up to that event regardless of 
when it occurs. The follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the 
patient continued or withdrew from study participation. 
 
If the SAE is not previously documented  in the Investigator’s  Brochure or Package Insert 
(new  occurrence)   and  is  though t  to  be  related  to   MEK162,  an  Array  Drug  Safety 
representative  may  urgently  require  further  information  from  the  investigator  for  Health 
Authority reporting.  Array may need to issue an Investigator  Notification (IN), to inform all 
investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. 
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported 
to the competent  authorities  and relevant ethics committees  in accordance with Directive 
2001 /20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 
 
For Comparator Drugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse 
experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by the investigator. 
 
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy in a patient on study drug must be reported to

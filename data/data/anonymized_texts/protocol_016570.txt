ABSTRACT  
 
AALL0434 is a COG group -wide Phase III study designed for patients with T -lineage acute lym phoblastic 
leukemia (T -ALL) or T -lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma (T -NHL) from 1 -30 years of age. Although event 
free survival (EFS) and overall survival continue to increase for children and young adults with T -ALL, “On -
Treatment” relapses in the central ne rvous system (CNS) and bone marrow compartments continue to be 
common causes of treatment failure. There is evidence that both Nelarabine (Compound 506U78) and high 
dose methotrexate (HDMTX) are effective in preventing relapse in T -ALL. To specifically add ress the early 
treatment failures associated with T -ALL, this study will test the safety and efficacy of these two therapeutic 
interventions. The study utilizes a 2 x 2 factorial design with augmented intensity BFM backbone. After a Day 
29 risk assignment has been determined, patients will become eligible for treatment assignment or 
randomization. Patients will be randomized to receive Capizzi style methotrexate without leucovorin rescue 
(plus PEG Asparaginase) versus high dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue during the two month Interim 
Maintenance phase of therapy. A safety phase was conducted, during which only the High Risk patients were 
randomized to receive or not receive Nelarabine. During the subsequent efficacy phase of the study (which is 
now o pen), Intermediate Risk patients will also be randomized to receive or not to receive Nelarabine at a dose 
of 650 mg/m2/day for 5 days during the Consolidation, Delayed Intensification and Maintenance phases of 
therapy. All patients will receive only one D elayed Intensification course and all Intermediate and High Risk 
patients will receive prophylactic cranial radiation (1200 cGy) either during Consolidation (if randomized to 
treatment Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel) or Delayed Intensification (if rando mized to treatment 
Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel). All Intermediate and High Risk patients classified as CNS3 
will be assigned to receive HD MTX on either Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) and receive 
cranial radiation therapy (CRT) (1800 cGy) dur ing Delayed Intensification. T -NHL patients will be enrolled in 
a separate stratum and will receive the same common Induction therapy given to the T -ALL patients. T -NHL 
patients will be classified as Standard or High Risk, based upon flow cytometry studies  performed on 
diagnostic bone marrow samples, an approach piloted in the recently completed lymphoblastic lymphoma 
study (COG A5971). Patients with ≥  1% disease in the marrow at diagnosis or any level of steroid pre -
treatment will be designated as High Ris k and, at the end of Induction, will be randomized to either Arm A 
(CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel). Patients with <  1% disease in the marrow at diagnosis will be non -
randomly assigned to Arm A (CMTX). Patients who fail to achieve at least a radiologic partial  response (PR) 
at the end of Induction (Induction Failures) will be non -randomly assigned to Arm B (CMTX + Nel). T -NHL 
patients will receive treatment for a total of 2 years from the start of Interim Maintenance, regardless of 
gender, and without prophylac tic cranial irradiation. T -ALL patients with testicular leukemia will be assigned 
to receive HDMTX on either Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel), and will receive testicular 
radiation therapy (TRT) (2400 cGy) during Consolidation therapy, if testicular di sease does not resolve by the 
end of Induction therapy. T -NHL patients with CNS3 -positive disease and testicular disease patients will not 
be eligible for this study, as only CMTX -based therapy will be offered to T -NHL patients. Low Risk patients, 
who are NCI standard risk by age and WBC, with no testicular disease at diagnosis, CNS1 and rapid early 
responders (RERs) with an M1 marrow by Day 15, and minimal residual disease (MRD) < 0.1% on Day 29, 
have an excellent outcome and therefore will not receive Nel arabine in either the safety or efficacy phases; nor 
will they receive CRT.

Nelar abine (Compound 506U78) to augmented BFM therapy (Regimen C, CCG -1961).  
 
1.1.2  
To determine the relative safety and efficacy of high dose methotrexate (5  g/m2) with leucovorin 
rescue compared to escalating methotrexate without leucovorin rescue plus Pegaspargase 
(Capizzi I) delivered during Interim Maintenance.  
 
1.1.3  
To gain preliminary data on the use of Nelarabine in patients with High Risk T -cell 
lymphoblastic lymphoma and its effect on long -term survival.  
 
1.2 Secondary Clinical Objective  
 
1.2.1  
To determine the relative safety and efficacy of withholding radiation in patients with Low Risk T -
ALL, while treating Intermediate and High Risk patients with 1200 cGy of prophylactic cranial 
radiation.  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
T-cell lymphoid malignancies have distinct biochemical, immunologic and clinical features 
which set them apart from non -T-lymphoid malignancies.1-6 Historically, the diagnosis of T -ALL 
portended a worse prognosis than other forms of non -T childhood ALL.1,7,8 Over the past three 
decades, the introduction of intensive, high -dose, multi -agent pulse chemotherapy has 
significantly improved the EFS for patients with T -ALL from 15% -20% to 40% -73%.9-12 Current 
trials have further improved outcomes for children with T -ALL, but have plateaued in the 70% -
75% EFS range, as shown by Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) 85-01, 13 DFCI 87 -01 and 
Berlin -Frankfurt -Münster (BFM) -86.14 The recent Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) T -cell ALL 
protocol, POG 9404, ran domized the addition of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) to the DFCI 
regimen and found a statistically significant improvement in 4 -year EFS rates for NCI High Risk 
patients treated with and without HDMTX of 77.9% vs. 65.5%, respectively. The 76.9% EFS at 
5 years for patients with T -ALL, treated on CCG 1961, regimen C, without HDMTX, is 
comparable to that seen on 9404 with HDMTX. The majority of patients with T -ALL and NCI 
standard -risk features clearly fare better with more aggressive therapy, as demonstrate d by EFS 
rates of 71% on CCG 1952/1962 versus 87.4% on POG 9404 (89.2% within the HDMTX arm). 
Based on a projected 2 year EFS rate of 85% for T -cell patients compared to 94% for pre -B ALL 
patients treated on the CCG 1991 study [RHR of 3.12 (p = .002)], T -ALL patients will no longer 
be eligible for COG SR -ALL trials and will be treated on the T -cell specific AALL0434 trial.  
 
Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) accounts for approximately 25% of all pediatric non -Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) cases. The history of the treatm ent for LL over the past 3 decades reflects the

Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 15 
evolution of treatment from conventional lymphoma -based treatment to ALL -based 
treatment.11,15 -17 With current therapies for LL, the majority of pa tients, including those with 
advanced stage disease, can expect a likelihood of 80% -90% disease free survival (DFS) 
utilizing regimens modified from ALL -based regimens. While effective, this intensive 
chemotherapy does produce short - and long -term side eff ects.18 Unfortunately, identifying risk 
categories for this disease has been difficult.19,20 Even conventional staging classifications have  
failed to segregate High Risk patients from the remaining population as most studies have failed 
to demonstrate major survival differences between patients of different stages. In addition, the 
salvage rate remains poor for LL patients who relapse, with s urvival of these patients ranging 
from 10% -15%. The ability to identify High Risk patients likely to recur early in the course of 
therapy would provide the opportunity to test novel therapies in these patients.  
 
Rarely does one find a drug with lineage -specific cytotoxicity as recently discovered for 
Nelarabine. Nelarabine (2 -amino -9-B-D-arabinofuranosyl -6-methoxy -9H-purine) is a water -
soluble prodrug of araG (9 -B-arabinofuranosylguanine), a synthetic deoxyguanosine derivative 
that is resistant t o cleavage by endogenous purine nucleoside phosphorylase and is cytotoxic to 
T-lymphoblasts at micromolar concentrations. Cytotoxicity is mediated by the accumulation of 
araG nucleotides, especially d -araGTP, in T -cells greater than in B -cells, resulting i n inhibition 
of ribonucleotide reductase and inhibition of DNA synthesis. This differential cytotoxicity 
between B -cells and T -cells has created interest in using this compound to treat T -cell 
malignancies.  
 
Earlier T -ALL studies have not included risk str atification due to the lack of predictive clinical 
or laboratory based prognosticators.6,12 Recently, the international BFM and GIMEMA 
cooperative groups reported that children and adults with Day 29 MRD levels of greater than 1% 
were at  a very high risk of relapse.21,22 In the International BFM study, patients who had MRD 
levels of 10-2 or greater had five to ten fold higher relapse rates at 3 years (39% - 86%), and in 
the GIMEMA study, the probability of relapse at 2 years f or MRD -positive patients at 
preconsolidation was 81.5% vs., 38.9% for MRD -negative patients. In addition, measurable 
MRD, of prognostic significance, was identified more often in children with T -ALL than those 
with B -lineage ALL.22 Based on these results, MRD -based treatment stratification will be used in 
AALL0434. Low levels of MRD at end Induction (< 0.1%) will be required along with other 
clinical features to be classified as Low Risk (LR), and high levels of end -Induction MRD (≥ 
1%) wi ll be considered equivalent to an M2 (5% -25% blasts) marrow.  
 
In an attempt to develop better prognostic indicators for T -NHL, A5971 tested the feasibility of 
detecting low levels of disease in marrow and peripheral blood at diagnosis and its clearance in 
peripheral blood during Induction, using a BFM leukemia treatment backbone. Analysis from the 
completed trial revealed that 72% of patients had lymphoma cells (CD3+/TdT+ cells) detectable 
in the bone marrow and blood by flow cytometry, although most patien ts had no lymphoma cells 
detectable morphologically. High levels of disease by flow cytometry were significantly 
associated with a poorer outcome: 2 -year EFS was 68.1%  ± 11% for patients with >  1% 
lymphoblasts detected in the bone marrow at the time of dia gnosis, as compared to 
90.7%  ± 4.4% for patients who had less disease detected (P = 0.031). Thus, it appears that 
quantitation of low levels of disease in the bone marrow can identify High Risk patients for 
treatment stratification.

2.1 Rationale for Augm ented Intensity BFM Therapy  
The CCG 1961C or augmented BFM (aBFM) with one Delayed Intensification phase (aBFM) 
regimen will be used as the standard backbone therapy for this study. Patients will be 
randomized to receive high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) vers us Capizzi -style methotrexate plus 
PEG Asparaginase (CMTX) in Interim Maintenance and to either receive or not to receive 
Nelarabine in Consolidation, Delayed Intensification and Maintenance. MRD will be monitored 
at the end of Induction, and at the end of  Consolidation/beginning of Interim Maintenance for 
observational correlations with response to therapy among patients who are at an increased risk 
of relapse (High Risk patients as defined below, patients with a slow early response and those 
that fail Ind uction).  
 
The aBFM backbone was chosen over POG 9404 for the following reasons: 1) The overall result 
for aBFM was accomplished without the use of CRT in patients with a rapid early response; 2) 
The aBFM regimen includes significantly less anthracycline; 3 ) aBFM is most similar to the 
POG pilot study, AALL00P2 which incorporates Nelarabine into a multi -agent backbone, 
allowing for the application of pilot toxicity data to the incorporation of Nelarabine in a 
randomized trial; 4) aBFM is the backbone for COG  AALL0232 for patients with High Risk B -
lineage disease. The use of the same aBFM backbone, for patients with B and T -lineage ALL 
will increase provider familiarity with the therapy, enhancing patient care and, importantly, 
allowing for the continued compa rison of response measures, including the significance of MRD 
among patients with T - and B -lineage leukemias, and; 5) MRD measurements using the BFM 
backbone have produced compelling European data that response to Induction chemotherapy 
may be useful as a tool for risk -stratification.22 
 
To further assess the toxicity of Nelarabine in the context of multi -agent chemotherapy, 
Nelarabine was incorporated into a modified BFM86 backbone in AALL00P2, which opened for 
accrual in April 2001, usin g Nelarabine at 400 mg/m2/day, Days 1 through 5. During the first 
phase of AALL00P2, no Grade 3 or higher central or peripheral nervous system toxicities 
attributable to Nelarabine were observed. Based on these results, AALL00P2 was re -opened and 
amended t o increase the Nelarabine dose from 400 to the Phase II -recommended dose of 650 
mg/m2. To supplement the data accrued on AALL00P2, MRD positive patients with T -ALL 
(High Risk) will be randomly assigned in AALL0434 to either receive or not to receive 
Nelara bine at 650 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days. This cohort of patients will be assessed for toxicity 
at approximately 24 months and again at 36 months into the trial. During this analysis, only High 
Risk patients will continue to be randomized to all four arms of the study. If patients receiving 
Nelarabine are found to have an acceptable toxicity profile during this safety phase, the study 
will be opened to also allow randomization of Intermediate Risk patients to all four arms of the 
study during the efficacy phas e. 
 
The efficacy phase will include a post -Induction randomization to receive or not receive 
Nelarabine for all Intermediate and High Risk patients. Low Risk patients (NCI standard Risk, 
RER, without testicular disease at diagnosis, CNS1 and Day 29 MRD < 0 .1%) will be eligible 
for randomization to aBFM with either Capizzi methotrexate or High Dose methotrexate [Arm A 
(CMTX) or Arm C (HDMTX), respectively]. They will not be eligible for the Nelarabine 
randomization, and will not receive CRT because these pat ients have an excellent outcome and, 
due to their young age, are more susceptible to neurotoxicity. T -NHL patients will be assessed 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 17 
for the presence of disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis using flow cytometry. Patients with 
≥ 1% disease in the bone mar row or any level of steroid pre -treatment will be considered High 
Risk and randomized to either Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel). Those with <  1% 
disease in the bone marrow will be considered Standard Risk and will be non -randomly assigned 
to Arm A (CMTX ). Results from two prior group wide studies (POG9404 and A5971) have 
failed to demonstrate a superior outcome for patients receiving HDMTX. Thus, a design that 
would include yet another randomization of these patients to the addition of HDMTX is not 
justified. As a result treatment assignment for patients classified as High Risk for T -NHL will be 
restricted to be randomized to either Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel). Please see 
Section 3.3.5  for details regarding T-NHL risk classification. CRT will not be delivered to any 
lymphoma patients on this study as recent reports have demonstrated excellent outcomes without 
radiation. Treatment plans for T -NHL risk groups are designed to closely parallel those for the T -
ALL  risk groups. Since patients with high risk T -NHL do not get cranial radiation in contrast to 
patients with T -ALL, those high risk patients randomized to Arm A invariably receive 4 less IT 
Methotrexate administrations during Maintenance compared to patient s with standard risk T -
NHL non -randomly assigned to treatment Arm A. This difference in the total number of IT 
administrations (21 for standard risk verses 17 for high risk T -NHL) is not felt to be significantly 
different and is comparable to the number of  IT administrations in the recently closed A5971 (19 
for Arms  A1 and A2, 13 for Arms B1 and B2) which had excellent CNS disease control. CNS -
positive and testicular disease T -NHL patients will not be eligible for this study.  
 
This study fits in with develo pment of other studies within the ALL committee by using a 
backbone which allows for comparative data, utilizing a new agent with disease specificity and 
allowing for incorporation of biologic questions and cancer control questions within the context 
of the clinical trial.  
 
The use of CRT with aBFM for patients with T -ALL may significantly enhance the outcome for 
patients with T -ALL, whose failures on CCG 1961 disproportionately involved the CNS. 
Additionally, aBFM did not include high dose MTX. In vitro  and ex vivo  studies of T -
lymphoblasts demonstrate a decrease in accumulation and polyglutamation of MTX when 
compared to B -lineage blasts23-27. Consistent with these observations, POG 9404 demonstrated a 
clear improvement in outcome for T -lineage NCI standard and high risk patients through the 
addition of HD MTX and BFM -90 produced a superior EFS as compared to BFM -86 with an 
increase in the MTX dose from 0.5 to 5.0 gm/m2.28 Thus, it is important to assess, in a 
randomized study, whether the addition of HD MTX to aBFM will enhance outcome.  
 
Osteonecrosis (ON)  
Results from CCG -1961 showed that the use of discontinuous dexamethasone (Days 1 -7 and 15 -
21, rather than Days 1 -21) during DI decreased the rate of ON. Specifically, the rate of ON 
among patients 10+ years of age on CCG -1961, all of whom received prednisone during 
Induction therapy, was 18% for those treated with continuous dexamethasone in a si ngle DI 
(regimen C) vs. 6% for those treated with discontinuous dexamethasone in 2 DI phases (regimen 
D). However, very little ON was observed in CCG -1961 among patients less than 13 years of 
age. Based on these findings, the COG High Risk ALL study (AALL0 232) initially used 
discontinuous dexamethasone during DI for patients 13+ years of age, and continuous 
dexamethasone during DI for patients 1 -12 years of age. Interim analysis of AALL0232 in 2006 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 18 
revealed a higher than expected rate of ON in 10 -12 year ol ds receiving continuous 
dexamethasone during DI. Based on these findings, AALL0232 Amendment #3A (09/11/06) 
changed dexamethasone dosing during DI to discontinuous for patients 10 -12 years of age.  
 
Ongoing analysis in April 2008 demonstrated higher than ex pected reported incidence of ON in 
AALL0232 as compared to that observed in CCG -1961. The overall incidence of ON at 24 
months is 10.4%. The incidence of ON is related to patient age and type of Induction steroid. The 
incidence rates by age group are 1 -9 years: 2.7%, 10 -12 years: 16.0%, and 13+ years: 14.7%. 
Patients who received dexamethasone during Induction have experienced a higher rate of ON 
compared to those who received prednisone (11.6 vs. 8.7%; p -value  = 0.014); although there is 
no difference in O N rates in patients 1 -9 years of age related to steroid administered during 
Induction therapy (2.2% dexamethasone vs. 2.6% prednisone).  
 
While it is too early in the conduct of AALL0434 to analyze the occurrence of ON in this trial, 
AALL0434 therapy is hig hly similar to that administered in AALL0232 and the risks for ON are 
likely very similar. Amendment #2A implements several changes in steroid administration to 
attempt to decrease the rate of ON. All patients, regardless of age, will receive discontinuous  
dexamethasone dosing during DI. In addition, all patients, regardless of age, will receive every 4 
week 5 -day pulses of prednisone 40 mg/m2/day, rather than dexamethasone 6 mg/m2/day, during 
Maintenance therapy.  
 
2.2 Preliminary Data  
In a phase I study of  Nelarabine a striking response rate was observed.  Fourteen complete (CR) 
and 9 partial responses (PR) were documented among 28 evaluable patients with relapsed T -
ALL. Responses were observed at all dose levels (5 mg/kg - 75 mg/kg), with Nelarabine given 
on Days 1 -5. Dose -limiting neurotoxicity, consisting of weakness, ataxia, confusion and coma, 
was observed in 3 of 4 adults treated at the 60 mg/kg dose level, 2 of 31 adults treated at the 40 
mg/kg dose level, and 1 of 11 children treated at the 60 mg/kg dose level. No neurotoxicity was 
observed in children treated at the 40 mg/kg or 1200  mg/m2 level.29 Thirty percent of the adults 
treated at a dose of  40 mg/kg experienced reversible somnolence on Day 6 -7 after starting 
therapy with Nelarabine. POG P9673, a pediatric Phase II trial of Nelarabine in T -ALL and T -
NHL accrued 153 (two were ineligible for evaluation) patients from June 1997 to July 2002. By 
definition, all patients treated with Nelarabine on this trial had failed earlier therapy, which 
incorporated other known neurotoxic agents. Patients in first bone marrow relapse had a 
complete response rate of 55%, and 27% of patients with a second or sub sequent relapse 
achieved a CR. Available details about the PNS ( ≥ Grade 2) and CNS ( ≥ Grade 3) toxicities 
reported from POG 9673 are presented in Tables 1 and 2. Among 151 patients who received at 
least 1 dose of Nelarabine, there were 47 episodes of any G rade of CNS or PNS toxicity in 34 
patients (23%). Twenty -five patients experienced CNS or PNS toxicities that were possibly or 
probably attributable to Nelarabine (Table 1), while 9 patients experienced neurotoxicity unlikely 
to be related to Nelarabine (T able 2). Twelve of the 25 patients experiencing Nelarabine -related 
neurotoxicity, twelve (nearly half) had complete resolution of neurologic signs and symptoms 
within a few hours to one year. Eight experienced toxicity with insufficient follow -up to 
determ ine the completeness of resolution; four patients died from other causes prior to resolution 
of their neurologic findings and one patient died, comatose, with the death attributed to 
Nelarabine. Based on these data it appears that even in a heavily pretrea ted group of patients that 
the majority of PNS and/or CNS events will resolve.

COG Study AALL00P2 (opened for accrual in April 2001) incorporated Nelarabine into a 
modified BFM86 backbone and gave Nelarabine at 400 mg/m2/daily for 5 days during weeks 6, 
25, 35, 43, 51 and 59 of therapy. In phase I of this study, no Grade 3 or greater central or 
peripheral nervous system toxicities attributable to Nelarabine, given with either 1260 cGy CRT 
(CNS1/CNS2) or 1800 cGy (CNS3) an d HDMTX, were observed. Based on this very re -assuring 
absence of significant neurotoxicity, AALL00P2 was re -opened with an amended increase in the 
Nelarabine dose from 400 mg/m2 IV Days 1 -5 to the Phase II recommended dose of 650 mg/m2 
IV daily for 5 days . 
 
Several large study groups have reported that MRD analyses are more reliable for risk 
classification in childhood ALL than age, presenting white blood count (WBC), extramedullary 
disease and other existing clinical and biological predictors.30-33 Leukemic cell phenotype 
contributes to the prognostic value of MRD detection, as recently demonstrated by outcome 
predictions that were more accurate for patients with T -ALL than for children having precursor 
B-ALL.22,34 The measurement of MRD at critical time points during the ALL treatment course is 
an important method to gauge the effectiveness of therapy. Using flow -based techniques, the 
detection of one or  more leukemic cells among 10,000 normal bone marrow cells was associated 
with an increased risk of relapse, but especially so for patients with more than 1% leukemic 
blasts at the end of Induction.31-34 Alternatively, favorable EFS rates were realized in cases where 
MRD was first detected but later became undetectable during the treatment course, underscoring 
the importance of intensive post -Induction chemotherapy as a means of eradicating residual 
disease burden.33 As previously noted for other patients with higher risk ALL, such as those with 
the Philadelphia chromosome,35,36 children with T -ALL are more likely to have detectable level s 
of MRD at the end of Induction and at later points during treatment.22,34 As a result of this 
supportive data, we propose to use MRD -based risk stratification strategi es to either intensify or 
reduce therapy in this study.  
 
Experience on COG P9900 with over 3000 ALL patients has shown that flow cytometric 
detection of end -Induction MRD is feasible in more than 95% of patients, and that end -Induction 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 21 
MRD burden correlate d with 3 years EFS. This method of MRD detection will be used in 
contemporary COG ALL trials. Preliminary data from COG P9900 suggest that MRD 
measurement in peripheral blood (PB) by flow cytometry at Day 8 Induction adds prognostic 
value to Day 29 MRD bur den in B -precursor ALL. To confirm and extend these data, frontline 
COG ALL studies (AALL0434, AALL0232 and AALL0331) will include optional Day 8 PB 
MRD determinations. In addition, we also wish to explore whether assessment of BM MRD at 
Day 15 of Inductio n may help to improve our ability to discriminate between good and bad 
responders. Currently, about 50% of patients have a BM aspiration performed to assess 
morphology at Day 15 of Induction (all patients not M1 at Day 8). Day 15 MRD samples will be 
sent t o COG Reference labs for those patients already scheduled to have a BM aspiration 
performed. Consent for these extra specimens is included with AALL08B1.  
 
2.3 Determination of Early Response  
All T -ALL patients on study will be stratified on the basis of early response as assessed by 
marrow morphology at Day 8/15 and MRD on Day 29. Patients who are M1 on Day 8 will be 
considered rapid early responders (RER) pending the results of Day 29 BM and MRD levels. 
Patients who are M2 or M3 on Day 8 will have a Day 15 BMA and, if M1 on Day 15, they will 
be considered RER pending results of Day 29 MRD. Patients who are M2 or M3 on Day 15 will 
be considered SER, regardless of Day 29 MRD result. All patients  with ≥ 0.1% MRD on Day 29 
are considered SER regardless of Day 8/15 marrow morphology. Treatment randomization will 
be affected by categorization into Low, Intermediate and High Risk status. Low Risk patients are 
those who are NCI standard risk by age and  WBC, lack testicular disease at diagnosis, are CNS1, 
and are RERs (M1 marrow on Day 8 or 15, and have an M1 marrow with < 0.1% MRD on Day 
29). Low Risk patients are excluded from receiving Nelarabine and CRT (see Sections 4.1.1  and 
10.1 for further details).  
 
High Risk T -ALL patients are those who are either NCI standard or high risk, RER or SER 
status, and have an M2 marrow or ≥ 1% MRD on Day 29. Patients in the High Risk category will 
be eligible for randomization to all four study arms during both the safety and efficacy phases of 
this study.  
 
Intermediate Risk T -ALL patients are those who are NCI standard risk with SER, CNS2 or 
CNS3 disease, or testicular disease, o r NCI high risk, RER or SER, any CNS and testicular 
status, but with an M1 marrow on Day 29 with less than 1% MRD. They will be eligible for 
randomization to receive Nelarabine in the efficacy phase (which is now open), but not the safety 
phase of this stu dy (which is now closed). This trial does not include the administration of a 
second Interim Maintenance or Delayed Intensification for the SER patients, as was included in 
CCG 1961. Support for this change in therapy is derived from the absence of any def inable 
subset of NCI high risk RER patients that gained benefit from the second IM/DI on CCG 1961. 
Statistically, this suggests that the smaller subset of SER patients, are also unlikely to derive 
significant benefit from the second IM/DI. The continued as sessment of RER vs SER status is 
required, however, to allow for an ongoing evaluation of outcome for the SER patients. Should 
they fare poorly on this trial as opposed to 1961; the study will be closed to the SER patients 
while therapy is adjusted.  
 
T-ALL  patients with M3 marrow on Day 29 will be considered Induction failures. Given the 
notable responses to Nelarabine for patients with refractory disease, patients who have failed 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 22 
Induction will be eligible to remain on study, and will be non -randomly assig ned to receive 
Nelarabine and HD MTX. If patients in this subset have an M3 marrow after the first block of 
therapy during Consolidation, they are to be taken off study and treated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Moreover investigators may decide on subs equent non -protocol therapy such as bone 
marrow transplantation after exposure to Nelarabine. These patients may be taken off study 
without penalty.  
 
Risk assessment for T -NHL patients will be based upon disease burden in the bone marrow at 
diagnosis and d isease response, as measured radiographically and by bone marrow morphology, 
at the end of Induction. The results to date from A5971 indicate that we possess the means to 
detect minimal disease in bone marrow and peripheral blood samples in T -NHL patients,  and 
that the extent of disease, as measured by flow cytometry at diagnosis in the bone marrow, may 
predict those patients at increased risk for bone marrow recurrence. Review of data from A5971 
found that all relapses in patients with low or undetectable disease in the bone marrow at 
diagnosis were at the primary site only and not in the bone marrow. Thus, disease quantification 
in the bone marrow at diagnosis may be limited to assessing the risk of relapse in the bone 
marrow and may fail to identify patie nts at risk for local recurrence. An additional means of 
assessing disease burden using radiologic methods may complement analysis of the marrow to 
fully characterize a patient’s risk status. Thus, conventional CT will be obtained at diagnosis and 
at the e nd of Induction to assess radiologic clearance of bulky disease.  
 
T-NHL patients with <  1% disease in the marrow at diagnosis will be considered Standard Risk 
and non -randomly assigned to Arm A (CMTX). T -NHL patients with ≥  1% disease in the 
marrow at diag nosis or any level of steroid pre -treatment will be designated as High Risk and, at 
the end of Induction, will be randomized to either Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel). 
Patients who fail to achieve at least a radiologic partial response (PR) or clearance  of their 
marrow by morphology at the end of Induction will be considered Induction Failures and non -
randomly assigned to Arm B (CMTX + Nel).  
 
2.4 Integration of Radiation Therapy  
Patients with T -ALL have an increased risk of relapse in the central nervous  system and CNS 
relapse has become a major cause of treatment failure with improved prevention of BM relapse 
using the ABFM regimen. To date, there have been a total of 77 relapses among 411 T -ALL 
patients enrolled in CCG 1961, including 24 CNS relapses (3 1% of total relapses) (unpublished 
data, 12/05). Comparison of events between RER patients (who did not receive CRT) and SER 
patients (who received 1200 cGy CRT) suggests a critical role for CRT in CNS control for T -
ALL patients. There were 20 CNS relapses  among 252 RER T -ALL patients (7.9%) versus 1 
CNS relapse among 121 SER T -ALL patients (0.8%). Twelve of the 20 CNS relapses in RER 
patients occurred in the first year of therapy, with approximately half occurring in the first 6 
months of therapy. These ob servations suggest that CRT is a critical component of therapy for T -
ALL patients treated with aBFM therapy and should be delivered relatively early in treatment. 
On this trial, Intermediate and High Risk patients assigned to CMTX (Arms A or B) will receiv e 
CRT during the Consolidation phase of theapy in the first 2 -3 months of treatment. In contrast to 
these results, early administration of HD MTX allows CRT to be delayed in patients with T -
ALL. Among 123 patients with T -ALL enrolled in ALL -BFM 90 that had  a good response to a 
prednisone prophase, there were only 3 relapses that involved the CNS (1 isolated CNS, 2 
combined marrow and CNS).37 Based on thes e and other similar data, CRT will be administered 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 23 
during the second half of Delayed Intensification in those patients assigned to receive HDMTX 
in order to decrease the risk of neurotoxicity.  
 
CRT will not be delivered to any lymphoma patients on this stu dy as recent reports have demonstrated 
excellent outcomes without radiation.38 The safety of withholding CRT in this study is reinforced by the 
results of  the recently completed A5971. Two hundred fifty -seven patients with Stage III/IV disease with 
no CNS disease at diagnosis were treated without prophylactic XRT. Three patients (1.2%) subsequently 
were found to have disease in the CNS at relapse. These res ults were in the face of an excellent overall 
outcome of the patients in this study (80% 5 year EFS) (personal communication, Dr. Thomas Gross). 
Thus, the exclusion of prophylactic CRT for this population would not be expected to alter the disease 
control for these patients and would spare them of the long term effects of such therapy . 
 
As described above, COG Study AALL00P2 (opened for accrual in April 2001) incorporated 
Nelarabine into a modified BFM86 backbone and gave 1260 -cGy CRT (CNS1/CNS2) or 1800 
cGy (CNS3) as well as four courses of HDMTX. In phase I of this study, no Grade 3 or greater 
central or peripheral nervous system toxicities attributable to Nelarabine were observed. Based 
on this very re -assuring absence of significant neurotoxicity, AALL00 P2 was re -opened with an 
amended increase in the Nelarabine dose from 400 mg/m2 IV Days 1 -5 to the Phase II 
recommended dose of 650 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days. The study is now closed with only one 
episode of neurotoxicity (Grade 3 Guillain -Barre like syndr ome) probably attributable and 2 
episodes of neurotoxicity possibly attributable (Grade 3 PNS, Grade 3 extrapyramidal) to 
Nelarabine among 65 patients enrolled at the 400 mg/m2 dose level and 8 patients enrolled on the 
650 mg/m2 dose level. All of these toxicities occurred at the 400 mg/m2 dosing level.  
 
Testicular leukemia is present in 1% -2% of boys with ALL at the time of initial diagnosis. The 
optimal treatment of testicular leukemia is unknown. While TRT is routinely adminis tered to 
patients with testicular leukemia by some centers and cooperative groups, its role in preventing 
relapse is unproven and this treatment modality is associated with significant late toxicities. For 
these reasons, many large centers and cooperative groups do not routinely prescribe TRT for 
boys with overt testicular leukemia. A recent report from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital 
concluded that irradiation appears to provide no survival advantage to this patient population.39 
In an effort to decrease the burden of therapy, contemporary COG ALL trials no longer 
recommend routine use of TRT for all boys with testicular leukemia. In this trial, boys with T -
ALL and overt testicular di sease will be assigned to HDMTX regimens (Arms C or D). No TRT 
will be given to those patients with testicular leukemia that resolves by the end of Induction 
therapy; those that have persistent testicular involvement at end Induction will receive 2400 cGy 
TRT during Consolidation. T -NHL patients with testicular disease are not eligible for this study.  
 
2.5 Biological Correlates  
T-ALL arises from transformed progenitors in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Adjusted 
for NCI clinical risk status, patient outcome in High Risk T -ALL remains inferior to other 
childhood leukemias. This study seeks to identify new prognostic markers  and identify new targets 
for pharmaceutical intervention. We will couple our previous work with BM stroma -supported 
growth of T -ALL cells and our gene microarray analysis in order to identify novel prognostic 
markers and new therapeutic targets. Our under lying premise is that tumor survival is dependent on 
signaling pathways, communicated in large part through cell -cell contact, that stimulate growth, 
angiogenesis, or the production of anti -apoptotic factors, all of which help sustain tumor cell

Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 24 
growth, sp read, and survival. The “setting” in which these cellular interactions take place is often 
termed the microenvironment. The genetic alterations associated with malignancy may alter cellular 
responses to the microenvironment or alter the response of the mic roenvironment to the malignant 
cells. Thus, targeting the microenvironment for drug therapy has gained considerable interest, 
including small cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and other hematopoietic tumors.  
 
T-ALL cell survival in the BM microenvironment is a tightly regulated multistep process that 
involves many of the biologic features of normal T -cell precursor sub populations, as illustrated by 
shared patterns of cell surface protein expression.40-42 The careful analysis of clonal chromosomal 
abnormalities in leukemic blast cells has been a catalyst for the develo pment of new diagnostic and 
therapeutic strategies. Since genetic alterations involving transcriptional regulators and other growth 
regulatory molecules may result in T -cell leukemogenesis43-45 and regulate minimal residual disease 
(MRD) status,21,22 we p ostulate that genetic alterations might directly or indirectly interfere with 
transcriptional networks that normally regulate T -ALL survival on BM stromal cells as well as 
patient response to therapy as measured by MRD.  
 
For T -NHL, specimens to characteriz e the biologic nature of the disease will focus on 4 major areas: 
1) immunophenotyping; 2) cytogenetic characterization by fluorescence in situ hybridization 
(FISH); 3) NOTCH mutation analysis; and 4) comparative genomic hybridization and gene 
expression p rofiling. Tissue should be collected prior to treatment initiation. Patients with T -NHL 
do not enroll onto AALL08B1. It is anticipated that there will be variability in the type and amount 
of tissue submitted, based upon the accessibility of the tumor tiss ue and the feasibility of obtaining it 
(i.e. patients with large mediastinal masses who are sedation risks will be expected to have limited 
tissue available). Minimum requirements for study entry will include sufficient tissue to confirm the 
diagnosis. Fre sh tissue should be obtained whenever possible. All available biologic specimens 
should be sent to the COG Biopathology Center, which will serve as the central repository for this 
component of the study. The study committee will assess the state and quanti ty of material for 
subsequent studies, with allocation to designated laboratories placing priority in the studies. Please 
see Sections 15 & 16 for details regarding collection, processing, shipping and analysis of the tissue.  
 
2.6 Exclusion of Patients with Down syndrome  
Due to a high number of toxic deaths seen in Down syndrome patients on AALL0232, and the 
many similarities in the basic therap eutic approaches for patients with Down syndrome between 
AALL0232 and this study, we are excluding this vulnerable patient population from enrollment 
onto AALL0434. At this time, we do not have specific recommendations for the management of 
T-ALL in patien ts with Down syndrome.  
 
2.7 Phase 1 Safety Phase Data Analysis  
The required 20 High Risk (HR) patients were randomized to Arms B (CMTX + Nel) and D 
(HDMTX + Nel). Data current as of 02/15/2010 were used in the safety assessments by the 
DSMC. As of 02/15/20 10, a total of 57 patients were randomized to either receive or not receive 
Nelarabine; of these 28 randomized to Nelarabine -containing regimens (12 on Arm B [CMTX + 
Nel] and 16 on Arm D [HDMTX + Nel]). A total of 29 patients were randomized to non -
Nelarab ine containing regimens (13 on Arm A [CMTX] and 16 on Arm C [HDMTX]). All 
adverse event data submitted as of this date were included in the analyses.  
 
Post-Induction treatment regimens for the 57 High Risk patients:

Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 25 
• Arm A: CMTX, no Nelarabine (13)  
• Arm B: C MTX, plus Nelarabine (12)  
• Arm C: HDMTX, no Nelarabine (16)  
• Arm D: HDMTX, plus Nelarabine (16)  
 
Grade 3 and higher toxicities were examined. There was 1 Grade 5 (death) on Arm D in 
Consolidation due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), reported as unrelated to 
study drug.  
 
2.7.1  Toxicity and Adverse Events  
In general, most toxicities occurred for treatment arms A, B, C and D during the Consolidation, 
IM and DI phases of therapy. The toxicities of interest were rather evenly distributed for all 
treatment arms. In comparing the toxicities across all arms, there appears to be an increased 
number of events of elevations of AST/ALT and febrile neutropenia in Arms A and B as 
compared to Arms C and D. However, these events do not seem increased over thos e reported in 
similar intensive treatment regimens for T -ALL. Importantly, there were few neurological 
toxicities reported for any of the arms. Of note, there were no Grade 4 motor or sensory toxicities 
reported in any of the High Risk patients. The motor and sensory toxicities will be discussed 
separately.  
 
2.7.1.1  Motor Neuropathy  
There were 5 events on Arm A among 13 patients, 6 on Arm B among 12 patients, 1 on Arm C 
among 16 patients, and 4 on Arm D among 16 patients. There were only 2 Grade 3 motor 
neuropathy toxicities reported: 1 in Arm B and 1 in Arm D, both of which were attributed to 
vincristine. The patient in Arm B developed footdrop greater than 3 months after his last 
Nelarabine and in conjunction with vincristine. The patient in Arm D devel oped vocal cord 
dysfunction in Consolidation after vincristine and prior to Nelarabine. There was 1 Grade 2 
motor neuropathy on Arm A (during DI) in a patient who had a history of neurotoxicity. Another 
patient who experienced a Grade 2 event (on Arm D, IM ) did not receive Nelarabine. There does 
not appear to be any difference in overall motor neuropathy rates between Arms A and B and 
also Arms C and D.  
 
2.7.1.2  Sensory Neuropathy  
There were no sensory neuropathies reported on Arm A (N=13). There were 5 on  Arm B 
(N=12), 7 on Arm C (N=16), and 5 on Arm D (N=16). There were only 4 Grade 3 sensory 
neuropathy toxicities reported. One was reported in Arm B in DI, 1 in Arm C in Maintenance 
Cycle #1 and 2 in Arm D. The 2 in Arm D were reported on the same patient.  The first event 
occurred in DI prior to the administration of Nelarabine, and the second event occurred in 
Maintenance 1. One of the Grade 2 events on Arm B was due to vincristine. With respect to 
sensory neuropathies, Arm B appears to have more when comp ared to Arm A, but only 1 of 
them was a Grade 3. The rates are similar on Arms C and D.   
 
The data analysis revealed that the addition of Nelarabine to the CMTX and HDMTX arms does 
not result in excessive toxicity for either the targeted neurotoxicities o r non -neurologic toxicities. 
While all arms of the protocol are myelosuppressive and thus, produce infectious toxicity, these 
toxicities appear similar to those found on other intensive chemotherapy regimens to treat T -
ALL. The protocol has, therefore, bee n opened to the efficacy phase.

2.7.1.3 Rhabdomyolysis  
Three cases of rhabdomyolysis have been seen in patients receiving nelarabine; two were 
reported as rhabdomyolysis, and one was reported as elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and myalgia . 
Two cases from AALL0434 are clear cut and isolated incidents; nelarabine administration was 
stopped for these patients and the adverse effects resolved. The third case from a 2004 special 
exception trial (protocol E04 -5299) was fatal, but confounded by multi -organ system failure 
resulting in death; direct causality in this case cannot be established. Narratives for these patients 
are provided in Appendix IX.  
 
Thus far, approximatel y 1175 patients have been treated with nelarabine. Two of the patients 
mentioned above were treated on AALL0434 by the Children’s Oncology Group. They received 
augmented BFM with either Capizzi methotrexate or high dose methotrexate and nelarabine. To 
date, 876 patients have been treated thus far on this study; the targeted accrual is 1580.  Of these 
patients, 126 were randomized to and received nelarabine.  
 
 
3.0 STUDY ENROLLMENT  AND PATIENT ELIGIBI LITY  
 
3.1 Study Enrollment  
 
3.1.1  Patient Registration via Rem ote Date Entry (RDE)  
Prior to enrollment on this study, patients must be assigned a COG patient ID number. This 
number is obtained via the eRDE system once authorization for the release of protected health 
information (PHI) has been obtained. The COG patie nt ID number is used to identify the patient 
in all future interactions with COG.  If you have problems with the registration, please refer to 
the online help.  
 
In order for an institution to maintain COG membership requirements, every newly diagnosed 
patient needs to be offered participation in ACCRN07, Protocol for the Enrollment on the 
Official COG Registry, The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) . 
 
A Biopathology Center (BPC) number will be assigned as part of the registration process. Each patient  will 
be assigned only one BPC number per COG Patient ID. For additional information about the labeling of 
specimens please refer to the Pathology and/or Biology Guidelines in this protocol.  
 
 
3.1.2  IRB Approval  
Local IRB/REB approval of this study must be  obtained by a site prior to enrolling patients. Sites 
must submit IRB/REB approvals to the NCI’s Cancer Trials Support Unit (CTSU) Regulatory 
Office and allow 3 business days for processing. The submission must include a fax coversheet 
(or optional CTSU I RB Transmittal Sheet) and the IRB approval document(s). The CTSU IRB 
Certification Form may be submitted in lieu of the signed IRB approval letter. All CTSU forms 
can be located on the CTSU web page (https://www.ctsu.org). Any other regulatory documents

met.  Study enrollment is accomplished by going to the Enrollment application in the RDE 
system. If you have problems with enrollment, refer to online help in the Applications area of the 
COG website.  
 
3.1.4  Timing  
PATIENTS WITH T -ALL  MUST BE ENROLLED ON COG AALL08B1 BEFORE 
TREATMENT ON COG AALL0434 BEGINS  (with the exception of the first dose of 
intrathecal chemotherapy and/or selected cases for which there has been steroid pretreatment). 
PATIENTS THAT BEGIN PROTOCOL THERAPY FOR LEUKE MIA, PRIOR TO 
ENROLLMENT ON AALL08B1, ARE INELIGIBLE FOR BOTH AALL08B1 AND COG 
ALL THERAPEUTIC TRIALS . 
 
PATIENTS WITH T -NHL  ARE INELIGIBLE FOR AALL08B1 AND  CAN ENROLL 
DIRECTLY ON AALL0434 . EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE MADE TO ACQUIRE AS 
MUCH TISSUE AS POSSIBLE. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING TISSUE 
SUBMISSION ARE OUTLINED IN SECTIONS 15 & 16. 
 
All patients :  
Informed consent : Except for administration of intrathecal cytarabine  or allowable steroid 
pretreatment (defined below), informed consent/parental permission  MUST be signed before 
protocol therapy begins.   
 
Study enrollment:  Study enrollment for AALL0434 must take place within five (5) calendar days 
of beginning protocol therapy. If enrollment takes place before  starting therapy, t he date protocol 
therapy is projected to start must be no later than five (5) calendar days after enrollment.  
 
Eligibility studies : Patients must meet al l eligibility criteria prior to the start of protocol therapy 
or enrollment, whichever occurs first. Unless otherwise indicated in the eligibility section, all 
clinical and laboratory studies to determine eligibility must be performed within 7 days prior t o 
the start of protocol therapy or enrollment, whichever occurs first.

3.1.5  Bilingual Services   
To allow non -English speaking patients to participate in the study, bilingual health care services will 
be provided in the appropriate language.  
 
 
3.1.6  Randomization  
Randomization/assignment of post -Induc tion treatment will take place through the eRDE system after Day  29 
risk status has been assigned. For all patients, post -Induction randomization via the RDE Late Randomization 
CRF should be done PRIOR to starting Consolidation therapy.  
 
T-ALL PATIENTS:  
For T-ALL patients, there are four treatment arms in this study. They are identified as follows:  
 
Arm A: Capizzi MTX without Nelarabine (CMTX);  
Arm B: Capizzi MTX with Nelarabine (CMTX + Nel);  
Arm C: High Dose MTX without Nelarabine (HDMTX); and  
Arm D: High Dose MTX with Nelarabine (HDMTX + Nel).   
 
During the safety phase (completed), ONLY High Risk T -ALL patients were randomized to receive 
Nelarabine.  
 
During the efficacy phase (now open), both High and Intermediate Risk T -ALL patients will be i ncluded in 
the Nelarabine randomization. Low Risk T -ALL patients do not receive Nelarabine on this protocol.  
 
T-NHL PATIENTS:  
For T -NHL patients, treatment will be restricted to 1 of 2 arms:  
 
 Arm A: Capizzi MTX without Nelarabine (CMTX)  
 Arm B: Capizzi MT X with Nelarabine (CMTX + Nel)  
Patients classified as Standard Risk for T -NHL will be non -randomly assigned to Arm A (CMTX). Patients 
classified as High Risk for T -NHL will be randomized to either Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + Nel). 
Please see Section 3.3.5  for details regarding T -NHL risk classification.  
 
3.2 Patient Criteria  
Important note : The eligibility criteria listed below are interpreted literally and cannot be 
waived (per COG policy posted 5/11/01). All clinical and laboratory data required for 
determining eligibility of a patient enrolled on this trial must be available in the patient's 
medical/research record which will serve as the source document for verification at the time 
of audit.  
 
INCLUSION CRITE RIA 
 
3.2.1  Classification Study  
T-ALL patients must be enrolled on AALL08B1 prior to treatment and enrollment on 
AALL0434.  
 
3.2.2  Age 
Patients must be greater than 1.00 and less than 31 years of age.  
 
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 29 
3.2.3  Diagnosis   
Patients must have newly diagnosed T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T -ALL) or T -lineage 
lymphoblastic lymphoma (T -NHL) Stage II -IV (see Appendix VIII). B -lineage lymphoblastic 
lymphoma will not be eligible for this study.  A diagnosis of T -ALL is established when leukemic 
blasts lack mye loperoxidase or evidence of B -lineage derivation (CD19/CD22/CD20), and 
express either surface or cytoplasmic CD3 or two or more of the antigens CD8, CD7, CD5, CD4, 
CD2 or CD1a. If surface CD3 is expressed on all leukemic cells, additional markers of 
immatu rity, including TdT, CD34 or CD99 will be assessed for expression. Cases with uncertain 
expression will receive additional review within the appropriate COG reference laboratory.  
 
T-NHL PATIENTS:  
For T -NHL patients with tissue available for flow cytometry,  the criterion for diagnosis should 
be analogous to T -ALL. For tissue processed by other means (i.e. paraffin blocks), the 
methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic analysis to establish the diagnosis of T -NHL 
defined by the submitting institution will  be accepted.  
 
 
3.2.4  Prior Therapy Restrictions  
Patients shall have had no prior cytotoxic chemotherapy with the exception of steroids and/or IT 
cytarabine.  
 
IT chemotherapy with cytarabine is allowed prior to registration for patient convenience. This is  
usually done at the time of the diagnostic bone marrow or venous line placement to avoid a 
second lumbar puncture. (Note: The CNS status must be determined based on a sample obtained 
prior to administration of any systemic or intrathecal chemotherapy, exc ept for steroid 
pretreatment as discussed in Section 3.3 .) Systemic chemotherapy must begin within 72 hours of 
this IT therapy.  
 
Patients diagnosed as having T -NHL or T -ALL with respiratory distress or hyperleukocytosis 
may require steroids prior to the initiation of additional systemic therapy. They are eligible for 
AALL0434 and will be stratified according to Section 3.3.5  below, based on the initial CBC. 
Steroid pretreatment may alter the risk group assessment. If the T -ALL patient’s clinical status 
precludes a lumbar puncture within 48 hours of the initiation of steroid therapy, T -ALL pati ents 
CANNOT be classified as Low Risk and will be Intermediate or High Risk based on the results 
of the Day 29 marrow as above. Patients with T -NHL who receive steroid pre -treatment will be 
classified as High Risk. The dose and duration of previous steroid  therapy should be carefully 
documented.  
 
For the management of airway compromise, patients who have received emergent chest 
irradiation up to 600  cGy will be eligible for this study.  
 
3.2.5  Concomitant Medications Restrictions  
Patients with a prior seizure disorder requiring anti -convulsant therapy are not eligible to receive 
Nelarabine. In addition, patients with pre -existing Grade 2 (or greater) peripheral neurotoxicity, 
as determined prior to Induction treatment by the treating physician or a neur ologist, are not 
eligible to receive Nelarabine. These restrictions in eligibility are designed to prevent excessive 
Nelarabine -induced central and peripheral neurotoxicity in at -risk patients.  For the purposes of 
this study, this includes any patient that  has received anticonvulsant therapy to prevent/treat 
seizures in the prior two years .

3.2.6  Pregnant/Lactating Females  
Pregnant or lactating females are ineligible. The medications used in this protocol may put the 
fetus at risk, and  may cross into the breast milk and put the infant at risk.  
 
3.2.7  Patients with Down syndrome  
Patients with Down syndrome are ineligible to enroll onto this study.  
 
3.2.8  For T -NHL patients the following additional exclusion criteria apply : 
• B-Precursor ly mphoblastic lymphoma  
• Morphologically unclassifiable lymphoma  
• Absence of both B -cell and T -cell phenotype markers in a case submitted as 
lymphoblastic lymphoma  
• CNS3 -positive (see Section 3.3.2  for details) or testicu lar involvement  
 
REGULATORY  
 
3.2.9  
All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent.

T-NHL DEFINITION OF CNS3 -POSITIVE DISEASE  
Elevated CSF WBC (≥  5 cell/µL) and a cytocentrifuge preparation demonstrating lymphoma 
cells. CNS lymphoma may also be diagnosed when the CSF WBC is normal but clinical signs of 
CNS involvement are present:  
• Cranial nerve palsy (if not explained by extra cranial tumor)  
• Clinical spinal cord compression  
• Isolated intracerebral mass

METHOD OF EVALUATING INITIAL TRAUMATIC LUMBAR PUNCTURES:  
If the patient has leukemic cells in the peripheral blood and the lumbar puncture is traumatic and 
contains  5 WBC/L and blasts, the following algorithm should be used to distinguished 
betw een CNS2 and CNS3 disease:46 
 
CSF WBC  > 2X   Blood WBC  
CSF RBC             Blood RBC  
 
A patient with C SF WBC  5/L blasts, whose CSF WBC/RBC is 2X greater than the blood 
WBC/RBC ratio, has CNS disease at diagnosis. Example: CSF WBC = 60/ L; CSF RBC = 
1500/L; blood WBC = 46000/ L; blood RBC = 3.0 X 106/L: 
 
60  = 0.04  >  2X   46000   = 0.015  
1500                       3.0 X 106 
 
TESTICULAR LEUKEMIA AT DIAGNOSIS: Unilateral or bilateral testicular disease. Biopsy is 
required if clinical findings are equivocal or suggestive of hydrocele or a non -leukemic mass.

Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 33 
T-NHL PATIENTS:  
STANDARD RISK T -NHL: <  1% disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis detected by central 
lab flow cytometry.  
HIGH RISK T -NHL: ≥  1% disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis dete cted by central lab flow 
cytometry or any level of steroid pre -treatment.  
 
INDUCTION FAILURE T -NHL: Failure to achieve PR, CR or Cru at end of Induction therapy 
(see Section 11.3 ). 
 
NO RESPONSE (NR) FOR T -NHL: see Section 11.3 . 
 
UNFAVORABLE CHARACTE RISTICS : 
 
PHILADELPHIA CHROMOS OME POSITIVE  (Ph+)  
a) BCR -ABL1  (formerly known as BCR -ABL) fusion transcript determined by FISH or RT -
PCR  
b) t(9;22) (q34;q11) determined by cytogenetics  
 
T-ALL patients entered onto AALL0434  who are later found to meet eligibility criteria for the 
AALL0622 Ph+ ALL study (or successor) should immediately be taken off protocol therapy 
prior to Day  15 of Induction therapy.  
 
T-NHL patients entered onto AALL0434  who are later found to meet the criteria for Ph+ T -NHL 
will be ineligible for post -Induction therapy on AALL0434 and should be removed from 
protocol therapy at the end of Induction.  
 
STEROID PRETREATMENT:  
 
Risk Assessment based on steroid pretreatment for T -ALL patients. Please note: This is different 
from patients with B -precursor ALL.  
 
Patients receiving steroids within the week preceding diagnosis, prior to the diagnosis of T -
ALL:  
i. Patients who have receiv ed less than 48 hours of oral or IV steroids during the week 
immediately prior to diagnosis will be stratified according to the schema outlined 
above if the results of a CBC obtained prior to the initiation of steroid therapy are 
available. The pre -steroid  CBC and age will be used to determine risk assignment.  
ii. If the patient has received > 48 hours of oral or IV steroids, whether or not a CBC is 
available prior to therapy, they will be categorized as an SER and assigned to the 
Intermediate Risk group provid ed their Day 29 BM is M1 and MRD < 1%. If Day 29 
BM is M2 or contains >  1% MRD the patient will be considered to be High Risk. 
Note that on this trial, SER status does not determine treatment assignment.  
iii. In the absence of presteroid CBC patients will be co nsidered Intermediate Risk unless 
their Day 29 BM is M2 and/or their MRD is > 1%. These later patients fall into the 
High Risk category.  
Patients who have received steroids within one month of diagnosis (e.g. week -4 to week -1): 
i. Patients who receive less than 48 hours of steroids will not have risk assignment 
changed.

Version date: 03/24/16                         Page 34 
ii. Patients who receive > 48 hours in weeks -4 to -1 will be assigned to the Intermediate 
or High Risk category depending on the Day 29 bone marrow status.  
 
Any T -NHL patient with a history of steroid pre -treatment in any of the parameters listed above 
will be categorized as High Risk.  
 
3.3.6  Definitions of Relapse  
 
T-ALL and T -NHL PATIENTS  
Any recurrence of disease whether in marrow or extramedullary site. Relapse should be 
histopathologically confirmed.  
 
CNS Relapse : Positive cytomorphology and > 5 WBC/µL OR positive cytomorphology with CSF 
WBC 0 -4/µL on two successive occasions one month apart. If any CSF evaluation shows positive 
cytomorphology and < 5 WBC/µL, a second CSF evaluation is required in 4 weeks. Identification 
of leukemic clone in CS F by flow cytometry (CD2, CD3, CD34, or the same T -cell 
immunophenotypic markers that were identified at diagnosis) or FISH for diagnostic karyotypic 
abnormality is encouraged.  
 
Testicular Relapse : Must be documented by testicular biopsy if the testicular relapse is isolated. 
Biopsy is not mandated if the marrow is also involved.  
 
Bone Marrow Relapse : Patients with an M3 marrow at any point after Day 29.  
 
T-NHL PATIENTS ONLY  
Progressive disease:  Greater than 25% increase in the size of any lesions or appea rance of new lesion(s).

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
4.1 Overall Treatment Plan  
 
 
 
All T -ALL and T -NHL patients will receive the same Induction sequence. Subsequent therapy 
will be dependent on risk assignment, as detailed below in Table 3. Since treatment assignment 
is in part dependent on Day 29 MRD  status for T -ALL, a radiation oncology consultation should 
be considered for all T -ALL patients during Induction. As specified below, Low Risk T -ALL 
patients (NCI std. risk, CNS1 with RER) do not receive radiation treatment and will, therefore, 
not requir e a radiation oncology consultation; however, Intermediate and High Risk T -ALL 
patients may be randomized to an arm that includes CRT at Week 8 from the start of 
Induction therapy (Week 3 of Consolidation) . 
No T -NHL patients will receive CRT. T -NHL patient s with CNS3 -positive and/or testicular 
disease are not eligible for this study.  
 
4.1.1  Risk Assignment  
Low Risk T -ALL: These patients will be randomized ONLY to Arm A (CMTX) and Arm C 
(HDMTX) and will NOT receive Nelarabine in either the safety or efficacy  phases. They must 
meet the following criteria: Age 1.00 -9.99 years and initial WBC count less than 50,000/µL, 
without testicular disease at diagnosis, CNS1 status; RER with an M1 marrow by Day 15; and 
MRD < 0.1% on Day 29. Low Risk patients will NOT recei ve CRT. Pretreatment with 
steroids may preclude Low Risk status (see Section 3.3 ). 
 
Intermediate Risk T -ALL:  These patients are neither Low Risk, nor High. They will be eligible 
for the Nelarabine randomization during th e efficacy phase (which is now open), but did not 
receive Nelarabine during the safety phase (which is now closed). All Intermediate Risk 
patients will receive CRT during either Consolidation (if randomized to Arm A (CMTX) or 
Arm B (CMTX + Nel) or Delayed Intensification (if randomized to Arm C (HDMTX) or 
Arm D (HDMTX + Nel); those with CNS3 status will be assigned to HDMTX on either 
Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) and receive 1800 cGy rather than the 1200 
cGy prophylactic CRT dose during Delayed Inten sification . Patients with testicular disease at 
diagnosis will be assigned to HDMTX on either Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel), 
and may receive TRT during Consolidation, depending on response.  
 
High Risk T -ALL:  These patients will be eligible to receiv e Nelarabine during both the safety 
and efficacy phases. These patients, regardless of other features , will have a morphologic M2 
marrow or MRD ≥ 1.0% at the end of Induction. All High Risk patients will proceed directly to 
Consolidation, without waiting f or count recovery at end -Induction. Given their high risk for 
subsequent failure, the remission status of these patients will be monitored carefully. They will 
have peripheral blood sent at start, mid and end -Consolidation for MRD determination and 
marrow sent at end Consolidation for both morphology and MRD. Patients must have attained an Timing of protocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on 
schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable 
departures (up to 72 hours) from protocol directed therapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for 
surgery) for valid clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia schedulin g issues 
are acceptable per COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohibited within the protocol).  
  THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434

M1 marrow by morphology at the end of Consolidation to continue on study. All High Risk 
patients will receive CRT during either Consolidation (if randomized to Arm A (CMT X) or 
Arm B (CMTX + Nel) or Delayed Intensification (if randomized to Arm C (HDMTX) or 
Arm D (HDMTX + Nel); those with CNS3 status will be assigned to HD MTX on either 
Arm C (HDMTX) or D (HDMTX + Nel) and will receive 1800 cGy rather than the 1200 
cGy prop hylactic CRT dose during Delayed Intensification . Patients with testicular disease at 
diagnosis will be assigned to HDMTX on either Arm C (HDMTX) or Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) 
and may receive TRT during Consolidation, depending on response.  
 
Induction Failures T -ALL : Patients with an M3 marrow on Day 29 will be non -randomly 
assigned to Arm D (HDMTX + Nel). These patients should proceed directly to Consolidation 
after the Day 29 marrow without waiting for count recovery to occur. They will receive at least 1 
block of Consolidation therapy. Prior to the 2nd course of Nelarabine exposure during 
Consolidation therapy (Day 43), the patients are to have a bone marrow evaluation by local 
morphologic assessment. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples will also be sent fo r MRD 
analysis. If M3 status is again observed, the patient is taken off protocol therapy. If the patient 
has an M1 or M2 marrow, they will continue with the second block of Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) 
Consolidation therapy. If the patient has an M1 marrow at end of two blocks of Consolidation 
therapy (ten weeks), they may remain on Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) of the study. These patients 
may also be taken off protocol therapy to receive alternate therapies, such as stem cell 
transplantation, at investigator discretion. Pe ripheral blood and bone marrow samples for MRD 
are required at end -of-Consolidation.  
 
Standard Risk T -NHL : Patients with <  1% disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis by central 
lab flow cytometry. These patients are NOT eligible for the Nelarabine randomiz ation and will 
be non -randomly assigned ONLY to Arm A (CMTX).  
 
High Risk T -NHL : Patients with ≥  1% disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis by central lab 
flow cytometry or any level of steroid pre -treatment. These patients are eligible for the 
Nelarabine r andomization and will be randomized to either Arm A (CMTX) or Arm B (CMTX + 
Nel). There will be no CRT during Consolidation.  T-NHL patients who are CNS -positive or 
who have testicular disease are not eligible for this study.  
 
Induction Failures T -NHL : Patients who fail to achieve at least a PR (see Section 11.3 ) at the 
end of Induction. These patients will be non -randomly assigned to Arm B (CMTX + Nel). 
Patients who do not attain at least a PR (see Section 11.3 ) by the end of Condolidation therapy 
will be removed from protocol therapy at that time.

Testicular Disease:  T-ALL patients with testicular involvement at diagnosis will not receive 
irradiation if testicular disease has resolve d completely at the end of Induction (biopsy is 
required if there is any uncertainty regarding the clinical response). Those patients with 
persistent testicular disease at end Induction, based on clinical and/or biopsy findings, will 
receive radiation duri ng Consolidation (2400 cGy to bilateral testes). T -NHL patients with 
testicular disease are not eligible for this study.  
 
4.1.2  Randomization  
After a risk assignment has been determined for each patient with T -ALL or T -NHL, the patient will become 
eligible  for treatment randomization. Randomization will also be determined by whether or not patients have 
T-ALL vs. T -NHL.

4.1.2.1  Safety Phase Randomization (closed)  
During the safety phase of the AALL0434 trial only the High Risk patients received Nelarabine. High Risk 
patients w ere randomized to all four arms of the study. Toxicity data for the High Risk cohort receiving 
Nelarabine were assessed following administration through Week 43 of the study. If additional data were 
required to assess toxicity in High Risk patients who rec eived Nelarabine, a second assessment would have 
occurred prior to the completion of the third year of the study (see Section 10.2 ). Completion of the analysis 
of these data ended the safety phase. Grade 2 and g reater neurotoxicity was monitored closely during the 
safety phase. During this phase, Low Risk and Intermediate Risk patients were randomized to either Arm A 
(CMTX) or Arm C (HDMTX) and did not receive Nelarabine. NOTE: During the safety phase analysis, H igh 
Risk patients continued to be randomized to all four treatment arms.  
 
4.1.2.2  Efficacy Phase Randomization (open)  
Analyses of toxicity data have been completed for the initial cohort of High Risk T -ALL patients 
randomized to receive Nelarabine, and the  study has been approved to move into the efficacy phase as 
Nelarabine has been deemed safe. The efficacy of Nelarabine will be determined by randomized 
treatment assignment. During the efficacy phase of this study, Intermediate Risk and High Risk T -ALL 
patients (as defined in Table 3) will be randomized to any one of the 4 treatment arms as shown in Table 
4. Low Risk T -ALL patients will not receive Nelarabine and thus will only be randomized to either Arm 
A (CMTX) or Arm C (HDMTX) (Table 4). High Risk T -NHL patients (as defined in Table 3) will be 
randomized to one of two treatmemt arms, as shown below in Table 4. Standard Risk T -NHL patients will 
not receive Nelarabine and thus will be non -randomly assigned to Arm A (CMTX).

receive CMTX with Nelarabine.  
 
See Section 7.0  for baseline studies to be obtained prior to starting Induction therapy.  
 
4.1.2.3  Dose Modifications for Obese Patients  
There is no clearly documented adverse impact of treatment of obese patients when dosing is 
performed according to actual body weight. Therefore, all dosing is to be determined by the 
patient’s actual weight. Failure to use actual body weight in the calcul ation of drug dosages 
will be considered a major protocol deviation. Physicians who are uncomfortable with 
administering chemotherapy doses based on actual body weight should not enroll obese patients 
on this protocol.

1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do  not remove covering until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine.  
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventional and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.

The therapy delivery map (TDM) for Induction is on the next page.  
 
Following completion of Induction, the next course (Cons olidation, Section 4.3  or 4.4) starts on 
Day 36 or when blood count parameters are met (whichever occurs later). See below for 
additional details regarding risk group ass ignment and randomization.  
 
Criteria to begin Consolidation  
Once risk assignment occurs, patients must complete and sign informed consent specific to post -
Induction therapy for the appropriate risk group and then undergo randomization. Consolidation 
for Arm A (CMTX) and Arm C (HDMTX) is in Section 4.3 ; Consolidation for Arm B (CMTX + 
Nel) and Arm D (HDMTX + Nel) is in Section 4.4 . 
 
If patient has T -ALL with M1 marrow and MRD < 1% as determined by the COG Reference 
Lab (Low and Inte rmediate Risk T -ALL), randomize and proceed to Consolidation at Day 36 or 
when peripheral counts recover with ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL (whichever 
occurs later).  
 
If patient has Standard Risk T -NHL (<  1% disease in the bone marrow at diagnosis ), proceed to 
Consolidation on Arm A (CMTX) ( Section 4.3 ) at Day 36 or when peripheral counts recover 
with ANC ≥  750/µL and platelets ≥  75,000/µL (whichever occurs later).  
 
If patient has High Risk T -NHL (≥  1% dis ease in the bone marrow at diagnosis or any level of 
steroid pre -treatment), randomize and proceed to Consolidation at Day 36 or when peripheral 
counts recover with ANC  ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥  75,000/µL (whichever occurs later).  
 
High Risk T -ALL  
If the Day 29 marrow is M2 (5% -25% blasts) and/or the central COG reference lab 
determines MRD ≥ 1%, then the patient is defined as High Risk. High Risk patients should 
be randomized as soon as possible and begin Consolidation therapy (as randomized) as 
soon as p ossible and should not wait until Day 36 or for count recovery to occur.  
 
Induction Failure T -ALL  
If the Day 29 marrow is M3 (≥ 25% blasts), then patient is an Induction Failure. Study 
chair should be notified . The patient will be non -randomly assigned to Arm D (HDMTX + 
Nel) and should begin Consolidation therapy as soon as possible and should not wait until

Day 36 or for count recovery to occur.  Patients with Induction Failure must sign the 
appropriate consent form before Consolidation therapy begins.  
 
Induction Failure T -NHL  
If the Day 29 evaluation reveals that the patient’s response status is NR or progressive 
disease (see Section 11.3 ) then patient is an Induction Failure. Please notify the study chair . 
The pat ient will be non -randomly assigned to Arm B (CMTX + Nel) and should begin 
Consolidation therapy as soon as possble and should not wait until Day 36 or for count 
recovery to occur. Patients with Induction failure must sign the appropriate consent form 
befor e Consolidation therapy begins.

4.3 CONSOLIDATION  Arms A (CMTX) and C (HDMTX)  (NO Nelarabine) Weeks 6 -13 
This Consolidation course is for patients randomized or assigned to either treatment arm 
WITHOUT NELARABINE (Arms A and C).  
 
Criteria to begin Consolidation  
Start Consolidation on Day 36 (7 days following Day 29 LP) or when peripheral counts recover 
with ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL (whichever occurs later). Once Consolidation 
therapy has begun, interruptions for myelosuppression (ANC ≤ 750/µL and pl atelets ≤ 
75,000/µL) should occur only at Day 29 . Once the Day 1 or Day 29 cyclophosphamide has 
been given, the remainder of the therapy should not be held solely for myelosuppression, which 
is expected to occur. Therapy must be interrupted for patients wi th serious proven or presumed 
infection and resumed when the signs of infection have abated.  
 
T-ALL patients who are High Risk with MRD >  1% and/or M2 marrow on Day 29, should 
be randomized and proceed directly to Consolidation without waiting for count recovery.  
 
Patients with Induction failure should proceed directly to Consolidation without waiting 
for count recovery.  
 
Intrathecal Methotrexate : IT 
For intrathecal administration, dilute with 5 -10 mL preservative -free normal saline or lactated 
Ringer's s olution on Days 1++ or 29 ++, 8, 15# and 22# 
 
++if High Risk T -ALL or T -NHL: omit Day 1 and give on Day 29 instead i.e, patients should 
receive IT MTX on Days 8, 15, 22, and 29.  
#if CNS3 T -ALL: omit Days 15 & 22 i.e, patients should receive IT MTX on Days 1 & 8 only.  
All other patients receive IT MTX on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22.  
The volume of CSF removed should equal at least half the volume delivered.  
 
Aged -based dosing:  
Age (yrs)  Dose  
1 – 1.99  8 mg  
2 – 2.99  10 mg  
3 – 8.99  12 mg  
≥ 9  15 mg  
 
Cyclophosphamid e: IV (over 30 minutes)  
1000 mg/m2/dose on Days 1 and 29. Reduce urine specific gravity to ≤ 1.015 prior to 
administering cyclophosphamide and give IV fluids to maintain urine output. Furosemide may 
be given at a dose of 0.25 – 0.5 mg/kg/dose IV for urine output < 3 mL/kg/hr after CPM. See 
Section 5.3  for additional details.  
 
Cytarabine : IV over 1 -30 minutes or Subcutaneous  
75 mg/m2/dose on Days 1 -4, 8-11, 29 -32 and 36 -39

60 mg/m2/dose on Days 1-14 and 29 -42. Give at least 1 hour after evening meal. To be taken 
without milk or citrus products. Adjust dose using half tablets and different doses on alternating 
days in order to attain a weekly cumulative dose as close to 420 mg/m2/week as possible.  See 
Appendix I for details. Do not escalate or modify dose based on blood counts during this 
course.  
 
VinCRIStine : IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy  
1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2 mg) on Days 15, 22, 43 and 50  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do not remove covering until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine.  
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventi onal and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.  
 
Pegaspargase : IM (or IV over 1 -2 hours)  
2500 International units/m2/dose x 1 dose  on Days 15 and 43  
 
For IV: Administer through the tubing of a freely infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl   
 
Testicular Radiation Therapy  
Patients with T -ALL and persistent testicular disease at end -Induction will receive XRT to the 
testes during Consolidation (a testicular biopsy is required  if there is any uncertainty regarding 
the clinical response). Within th e first two weeks of Consolidation, testicular radiation therapy 
will be given at 2400 cGy in 12 once -daily fractions of 200 cGy (See Section 14.2 ). Testicular 
radiation must be started during Consolidation and  should be completed before the end of this 
phase of therapy. T -NHL patients with testicular disease are not eligible for this study.  
 
Cranial Radiation Therapy  
Prophylactic cranial radiation therapy (1200 cGy in 8 once -daily fractions) for Intermediate/Hi gh 
Risk  
T-ALL patients randomized to Arm A (CMTX) should be given during Weeks 3 and 4 of 
Consolidation (see Section 14.0 ). Cranial XRT (1800 cGy in 10 once -daily fractions) for CNS3 
patients and prophylactic cra nial XRT (1200 cGy in 8 once -daily fractions) for 
Intermediate/High Risk T -ALL patients randomized to Arm C (HDMTX) will be given during 
DI. Intrathecal therapy is NOT held during the concomitant administration of CRT. Low Risk T -
ALL patients (defined in Section 4.1 ) and all T -NHL patients will NOT receive any CRT.  
 
 
The therapy delivery map (TDM) for Consolidation is on the next page.

4.5 INTERIM MAINTENANCE  Arms A (CMTX) and B (CMTX + Nel)  
Weeks 14 -21 (Arm A) & 17 -24 (Arm B)  
 
This Interim Maintenance (IM) course is for patients randomized or assigned to either treatment 
arm with Capizzi methotrexate (Arms A and B).  
 
Criteria to begin Interim Maintenance – Capizzi Methotrexate  
Begin IM when peripheral counts recover with an ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL. All 
therapy should be interrupt ed for patients with presumed or proven severe infections and 
resumed when the signs of infection have abated. Obtain blood counts 10 days after initial dose 
of methotrexate.  
A) If ANC is < 500/µL or platelets < 50,000/µL, hold all chemotherapy and repeat blo od 
counts in 4  days.  
1. If ANC ≥ 500/µL and platelets ≥ 50,000/µL, give same dose of methotrexate as 
previously.  
2. If ANC is still < 500/µL or platelets < 50,000/µL, give VCR, PEG -ASP and IT MTX 
(if due) and repeat counts in 7 days to begin next dose of MTX if counts are adequate. 
If counts now adequate, reduce dose of MTX by 20%. Do not make up missed dose 
of MTX. If counts still too low, hold therapy until counts recover to ANC >  500/µL 
and platelets >  50,000/µL.  
B) If ANC ≥ 500/µL but < 750/µL and platelets ≥ 50 ,000/µL but < 75,000/µL, give same 
dose of MTX as previously.  
C) If ANC ≥750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL escalate MTX by 50  mg/m2/dose  
D) If allergic to pegaspargase, give Erwinia L -asparaginase as described in Section 5.1 . 
 
VinCRIStine : IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy  
1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2 mg) on Days 1, 11, 21, 31 and 41  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do not remove covering until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBL AStine.  
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventional and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.  
 
Methotrexate : IV push  
Start dose at 100 mg/m2/dose and escalate by 50 mg/m2/dose  (see Section 5.8.2 ) on Days 1, 11, 
21, 31 and 41. Discontinue escalation and resume at 80% of last dose if delay is necessary for 
myelosuppre ssion and/or Grade 3 mucositis.

4.6 INTERIM MAINTENANCE  Arms C (HDMTX) and D (HDMTX + Nel)  
Weeks 14-21 (Arm C) & 17 -24 (Arm D)  
 
This Interim Maintenance (IM) course is only for T -ALL patients randomized to either treatment 
arm with High -Dose methotrexate (Arms C and D). T -NHL patients DO NOT receive HDMTX 
and will NOT receive therapy on either of these arms.  
 
Criteria to begin Interim Maintenance – High -Dose Methotrexate  
Begin IM when peripheral counts recover with an ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL. All 
therapy should be interrupted for patients with presumed or proven severe infections and  
resumed when the signs of infection have abated. All chemotherapy should be held for ANC < 
750/µL or platelets < 75,000/µL. If counts fail to recover within 2 weeks notify the Study Chair . 
 
Review of BFM and past COG protocols indicates that excess toxici ty is not encountered in 
patients who are > 2 m2 and receive more than 10 grams of methotrexate. The methotrexate dose 
should be dosed on the actual meter -squared basis and not capped.  
 
Hold any nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications, penicillins, prot on pump inhibitors 
aspirin -containing medications, or TMP -SMX on the days of the MTX infusion and until the 
MTX level is less than 0.4 µM. In the presence of delayed clearance, continue to hold TMP -
SMX until the MTX level is less than 0.1 μM.  
 
High -Dose Me thotrexate : IV 
5000 mg/m2/dose on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43. See Section 4.6.1  and Appendix IV for High -Dose 
methotrexate infusion and leucovorin rescue guidelines.  
 
VinCRIStine : IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as  per institutional policy  
1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2 mg) on Days 1, 15, 29 and 43  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do not remove coveri ng until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine.  
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventional and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.  
 
Mercaptopurine : PO 
25 mg/m2/dose on Days 1 -56. Give at least 1 hour after evening meal. To be taken witho ut milk 
or citrus products. Adjust dosing using half tablets and different doses on alternating days in 
order to attain a weekly cumulative dose as close to 175 mg/m2/week as possible. See Appendix 
I for details. Do not escalate or modify dose based on blo od counts during this course.  
 
Intrathecal Methotrexate : IT 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                        Page 56 
For intrathecal administration, dilute with 5 -10 mL preservative -free normal saline or lactated 
Ringer’s solution on Days 1 and 29. The volume of CSF removed should equal at least half the 
volume delivered. Deliver within 6 hours of the start of IV MTX (hr -6 to +6).  
 
Aged -based dosing:  
Age (yrs)  Dose  
1 – 1.99  8 mg  
2 – 2.99  10 mg  
3 – 8.99  12 mg  
≥ 9  15 mg  
 
4.6.1  HD MTX Infusion Guidelines  
(Please see Section 5.8.1  for additional information.)  
When IT therapy and HDMTX are scheduled for the same day, deliver the IT therapy within 6 
hours of the beginning of the IV MTX infusion (hour -6 to +6, with 0 being the start of the MTX 
bolus).  
 
Hold TMP -SMX on the days o f HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the 
HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.4 μM. In the presence of delayed 
clearance continue to hold TMP -SMX until MTX level is less than 0.1 µM  
 
Hold any nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications, penicillins, proton pump inhibitors or 
aspirin -containing medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the 
start of the HD MTX infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.4 μM. In the presence of 
delayed clearance continue to hold these drugs until MTX level is less than 0.1 µM  
 
Recommended Prehydration with D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L at 125 mL/m2/hour until 
urine specific gravity is ≤  1.010 and pH is ≥ 7.0 and ≤  8.0. Ringers Lactate may be used as the 
initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume and sodium 
bicarbonate to maintain urine specific gravity and pH at above parameters. A bicarbonate bolus 
(25 mEq/m2 over 15 minutes) may be given to raise the urine  pH relatively quickly; a normal 
saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. Continue hydration and alkalinization 
throughout HD MTX infusion, and for a minimum of 48 hours after its completion. In patients 
with delayed MTX clearance, conti nue hydration until the plasma MTX concentration is below 
0.1 µM.  
 
Hour 0 : MTX 500 mg/m2 IV mixed in a final volume of 65 mL/m2 D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq 
NaHCO 3/L and infused over 30 minutes. This is followed, immediately, by MTX 4500 mg/m2 
mixed in a final volu me of 2935 mL/m2 D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L given by continuous 
IV infusion over 23.5 hours at 125 mL/m2/hr. Be certain that the HD MTX infusion is completed 
in the 24 hour period. Unintentional prolongation to as long as 26 hours though not encouraged 
is acceptable.  
 
Hours 24, (36), 42 and 48 : Draw MTX level and serum creatinine; NOTE: 36 hour level is only 
drawn if needed (see below)  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                        Page 57 
For MTX levels that exceed these expected values modify the rescue regimen as noted 
below and increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr, monitor urine pH to assure a value ≥ 7.0 
and monitor urine output to determine if volume is ≥ 80% of the fluid intake, measured 
every 4 hours. If serum creatinine rises significantly, at any time point, assure appropriate 
urine pH and urine volum e as above and draw a 42 hour level. If urine output fails to 
continue at 80% of the fluid intake, consider furosemide. Regardless of urine output, also 
consider glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase G 2) (see Section 5.8.1 ). For p atients with delayed 
clearance during a previous course, begin the following course with the increased hydration 
(200 mL/m2/hr). If subsequent course is not associated with delayed clearance, attempt to use 
standard hydration.  
 
If the 24 hour level is < 15 0 µM  draw the next level at hour 42 and refer to table in 
Section 5.8.1 .If the 24 hour level is ≥ 150 µM and/or creatinine > 125% baseline , repeat 
level if MTX contamination is possible. While waiting for the result and if the value is 
“real” refer to the changes in hydration, etc described above and repeat the level with a 
serum Cr at hour 36. Then refer to the table in Section 5.8.1 . 
 
If the 42 and 48 hour levels are ≤ 1 and 0.4 µM, respectively,  give leucovorin at 15 mg/m2 
IV/PO at 42, 48 and 54 hours post the start of methotrexate loading dose. No additional levels 
are needed, nor is additional leucovorin. If levels exceed these values, see Section 5.8.1 .

4.7 DELAYED INTENSIFICAT ION Arms A (CMTX) and C (HDMTX)  (NO Nelarabine) 
Weeks 22 -30 
This Delayed Intensification (DI) course is for patients randomized or assigned to either 
treatment arm WITHOUT NELARABINE (Arms A and C).  
 
Criteria to begin Delayed Intensification (NO Nelarabine)  
Patients should have ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL  prior to starting therapy on Days 
1 and 29. Once Delayed Intensification has begun, it may be interrupted for 
myelosuppression (ANC ≤  750/µL and platelets ≤ 75,000/µL) on Day 29 ONLY . Once the 
Day 1 therapy or Day 29 cyclophosphamide has been given, the r emainder of the therapy should 
not be held solely for myelosuppression, which is expected to occur. Therapy must be interrupted 
for patients with serious proven or presumed infection and resumed when the signs of infection 
have abated.  
 
VinCRIStine : IV push over 1 minute or infusion via minibag as per institutional policy  
1.5 mg/m2/dose (max dose 2 mg) on Days 1, 8, 15, 43 and 50  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY  
The container or the syringe containing vinCRIStine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do not remove covering until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLAStine.  
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventional and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.  
  
Dexamethasone : PO (may give IV)  
All patients, regardle ss of age, receive discontinuous dexamethasone: 5  mg/m2/dose BID (i.e., 
10 mg/m2/day, divided BID) on Days 1 -7 and 15 -21. 
 
DOXOrubicin : IV push  
25 mg/m2/dose on Days 1, 8 and 15  
 
Administer at a concentration not to exceed 2 mg/mL by slow IV push or infus ion over 1 -15 
minutes. Short infusion times may be lengthened slightly (and up to 60 minutes) if institutional 
policies mandate. It is suggested that DOXOrubicin be administered through  the tubing of rapidly 
infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl  and that i t is infused into a large vein.  
 
Pegaspargase : IM (or IV over 1 -2 hours)  
2500 International units/m2/dose on Day 4 [ OR 5 OR 6] AND  Day 43  
 
For IV: Administer through the tubing of a freely infusing solution of D 5W or 0.9% NaCl   
 
Intrathecal Methotrexate : IT

Version date: 03/24/16                     Page 60 
For intrathecal administration, dilute with 5 -10 mL preservative -free normal saline or lactated 
Ringer's solution on Days 1, 29 and 36. The volume of CSF removed should equal at least half 
the volume delivered.  
 
Aged -based dosing:  
Age (yrs)  Dose  
1 – 1.99  8 mg  
2 – 2.99  10 mg  
3 – 8.99  12 mg  
≥ 9  15 mg  
 
Cyclophosphamide : IV (over 30 minutes)  
1000 mg/m2/dose on Day 29.  
 
Reduce urine specific gravity to ≤ 1.015 prior to administering. Give IV fluids to maintain urine 
output. May use Furosemide 0.25 – 0.5 mg/kg/dose IV for urine output < 3 mL/kg/hr after CPM. 
See Section 5.3  for addi tional details.  
 
Cytarabine : IV over 1 -30 minutes or Subcutaneous  
75 mg/m2/dose on Days 29 -32 and 36 -39 
 
Thioguanine : PO 
60 mg/m2/dose on Days 29 -42.  
 
Give at least 1 hour after evening meal. To be taken without milk or citrus products. Adjust dose 
using half tablets and different doses on alternating days in order to attain a weekly cumulative 
dose as close to 420  mg/m2/week as possible. See Appendix II for details. Do not escalate or 
modify dose based on blood counts during this course.  Please note: TG should not be 
administered to any patient receiving CRT during this stage of therapy (i.e. IR/HR T -ALL 
patients randomized to Arm C and all CNS3 T -ALL patients).  
 
 
Cranial Radiation Therapy  
Prophylactic cranial XRT (1200 cGy in 8 once -daily fractions) for Intermediate/High Risk T -
ALL patients randomized to Arm C (HDMTX) and cranial XRT (1800cGy in 10 once -daily 
fractions) for CNS3 T -ALL patients should start on Day 50 of DI. Intermediate and High Risk T -
ALL patients randomized to Arm A (CMTX) received CRT i n Consolidation and WILL NOT  
receive prophylactic cranial XRT during this phase of therapy. Low Risk T -ALL patients 
(defined in Section 4.1) and all  
T-NHL patients WILL NOT  receive any cranial XRT. Please see Section 14.0  for all CRT 
details.  
 
The therapy delivery maps (TDMs) for Delayed Intensification are on the next two pages.  
 
Following completion of Delayed Intensification, the next course (Maintenance, Section 4.9 ) 
starts on Day 64 or when blood count parameters are met (whichever occurs later).

Patients should have ANC ≥ 750/µL & plts ≥ 75,000/µL prior to starting therapy on Days 1 and 29. Once Delayed Intensification  has begun, it may be 
interrupted for myelosuppression on Day 29 ONLY. Once the Day 1 therapy or Day 29 Nelarabine has been given, the remainder of the therapy should not be 
held solely for myelosuppression, which is expected to occur. Therapy must be interrupted for patients with serious proved or  presumed infection and resumed 
when the signs of infection have abated. This Course las ts 9 weeks (63 days) and this Therapy Delivery Map is on two (2)  pages.

5.0 DOSE MODIFICATION FO R TOXICIT IES  
 
Notify the Study Chair  at the time of removing a patient from protocol therapy for toxicity. The 
drugs are listed in alphabetical order  
 
5.1 Asparaginase [Pegaspargase (PEG -Asparaginase) or Erwinia]  
Allergy  
Local Allergic Reactions (inflammation at injection site, swelling) : Continue pegaspargase 
administration in the presence of Grade 1 allergy (transient flushing or rash; drug fever <  38ºC).  
 
Systemic Allergic Reactions : Discontinuation may be considered for sev ere Grade 2 or higher 
allergic reactions as defined by CTCAE v4.0.  
 
Note : Pre-medication with antihistamines to decrease the risk of overt allergy symptoms is 
strongly discouraged since anti -histamine use may mask the appearance of systemic allergy. 
System ic allergy is frequently associated with the presence of asparaginase neutralizing 
antibodies, which render asparaginase therapy ineffective. In the event of severe systemic or 
recurrent local allergic reaction, Erwinia asparaginase (now FDA -approved for t his indication) 
should be substituted.  
 
Anaphylaxis : Discontinue pegaspargase if the patient develops Grade 3 anaphylaxis as defined 
by CTCAE v4.0 (symptomatic bronchospasm, with or without urticaria; parenteral intervention 
indicated; allergy -related ede ma/angioedema; hypotension). If this occurs, Erwinia asparaginase 
(now FDA -approved for this indication) should be substituted.  
 
Erwinia asparaginase has a shorter half life and is associated with a shorter duration of 
asparagine depletion than native E. coli asparaginase, with “head -to-head” comparisons of 
Erwinia and E. coli  asparaginase, using the same dose and schedule for both preparations, 
demonstrating a superior outcome, favoring E. coli  asparaginase47,48. Pegaspargase has a longer 
half-life and is associated with more prolonged asparagine depletion than native E. coli  
asparaginase, but the largest randomized trial comparing weekly native to bi -weekly 
pegaspargase wasn’t powered to detect a difference in o utcome49 Current COG trials have 
adopted pegaspargase as the preparation of choice, based on the results of CCG 1962. COG 
AALL07P2 showed that Erwinia asparaginase was well tolerated and achieved nadir serum 
asparaginase activity at both  48 and 72 hours after dosing that was similar to that achieved with 
pegaspargase. Based on these and other data, the FDA approved Erwinia asparaginase for use 
following allergy to pegaspargase, with a dose of Erwinia 25,000 IU/m2 x 6 doses IM on a 
Monday/ Wednesday/Friday schedule substituted for a single dose of pegaspargase  
 
The dose modification guidelines for ALL trials recommend the substitution for replacement of 
Erwinia asparaginase for either native or pegaspargase utilizing the following schedule:  
 
Phase(s) of Treatment  Drug(s)  Replacement Schedule 
for Erwinia 
asparaginase# 
Standard Induction, Re -Induction, Interim One or more 25,000 IU/m2/dose IM

Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 78 
Maintenance, Delayed Intensification, or phases 
of therapy in which pegaspargase doses are 13+ 
days apart  doses of 
pegaspargase 
(2,500 IU/m2) M/W/F x 6 doses for each 
dose of pegaspargase  
#If a patient develops a Grade 3 or higher anaphylaxis to Erwinia, discontinue future asparaginase therapy. Consider 
discontinuation for severe Grade 2 or higher  allergic reactions.  
 
To replace a dose of intravenous pegaspargase that was discontinued during the infusion due to an allergic 
reaction, the following recommendations may be used to guide patient care.  
 
In the event that a pegaspargase infusion is disco ntinued for an allergic reaction, regardless of amount 
received, substitution with Erwinia asparaginase should begin approximately 48 hours after pegaspargase 
has been discontinued and preferably to coincide with the recommended Monday/Wednesday/Friday 
administration schedule detailed above in patie nts who are clinically stable. Up to 6 doses of Erwinia 
asparaginase may be administered, as tolerated, to replace the incomplete  intravenous pegaspargase dose.  
Of note, Erwinia asparaginase is recommended only for pegaspargase hypersensitivity reactions, and not 
for pancreatitis, hepatitis, coagulation abnormalities, or other non -hypersensitivity toxicities associated 
with pegaspargase. To best suit the needs of  each individual patient, additional modifications to these 
recommendations may be made at the discretion of the treating physician.  
 
Coagulopathy : If symptomatic, hold asparaginase until symptoms resolve, then resume with the 
next scheduled dose. Consider  factor replacement (FFP, cryoprecipitate, factor VIIa). Do not 
withhold dose for abnormal laboratory findings without clinical symptoms.   
 
Hyperbilirubinemia : asparaginase may need to be withheld in patients with an elevated direct 
bilirubin, since aspar aginase has been associated with hepatic toxicity. There are no specific 
guidelines available.  
 
Hyperglycemia : Do not modify dose. Treat hyperglycemia as medically indicated.  
 
Hyperlipidemia : Do not modify dose.  
 
Ketoacidosis : Hold asparaginase until blood  glucose can be regulated with insulin.  
 
Pancreatitis (Grade 3 -4): Discontinue asparaginase in the presence of hemorrhagic pancreatitis or 
severe pancreatitis. In the case of mild pancreatitis, asparaginase should be held until symptoms 
and signs subside, and amylase levels return to normal and then resumed. Severe pancreatitis is a 
contraindication to additional asparaginase administration.  
 
Thrombosis : Withhold asparaginase until resolved, and treat with appropriate anti -thrombotic 
therapy, as indicated. Upon resolution of symptoms consider resuming asparaginase, while 
continuing LMWH or anti -thrombotic therapy. Do not withhold dose for abnormal laboratory 
findings without clinical correlate. For significant thrombosis, not line related, consider evaluatio n 
for inherited predisposition to thrombosis.  
 
CNS Events (bleed, thrombosis or infarction) : Hold asparaginase. Treat with FFP, factors or 
anticoagulation as appropriate. Resume at full dose when all symptoms have resolved (and evidence 
of recanalization i n case of thrombosis by CT/MRI). Consider evaluation for inherited 
predisposition to thrombosis.

5.2 Nelarabine (Compound 506U78)   
If neurologic toxicity develops prior to the completion of 5 days of therapy,  Nelarabine 
should be halted and the study chair  should be called immediately . If Grade 4 Nelarabine -
related neurotoxicity develops, the patient will be taken off Nelarabine indefinitely . 
 
NOTE: THE DRUG MANUFACTURERS OF NELARABINE HAVE INCLUDED AS 
PART OF THE AGENT’S RISKS/SIDE EFFECTS THAT PATIENTS RECEIVING 
INTRATHECAL CHEMOTHERAPY OR CRANIOSPINAL IRRADIATION WITH 
NELARABINE MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK OF NEUROLOGICAL ADVERSE 
EVENTS.  
 
Peripheral Neurotoxicity  
Investigators are cautioned to monitor patients carefully for the development of sign s and 
symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In the event that a patient develops initial signs or 
symptoms of peripheral neuropathy attributed to the administration of Nelarabine, the agent 
should be discontinued for the course. Only resume Nelarabine if peri pheral neuropathy resolves 
to less than Grade 2 toxicity. Nelarabine should NOT be continued in patients who develop signs 
or symptoms suggestive of an ascending polyneuropathy, including a Guillain -Barré -like 
syndrome, even if these symptoms resolve. It i s recommended that patients who develop 
neurotoxicity in association with Nelarabine undergo a thorough neurologic evaluation to 
establish a diagnosis and to exclude other potential etiologies (e.g. disease progression, 
concomitant illness, etc.). If a Gui llain-Barré -like syndrome is suspected, therapeutic measures 
considered appropriate for the individual patients (i.e. intravenous immunoglobulin, 
plasmapheresis, steroids, and supportive care) should be instituted as soon as possible. It is 
strongly recomm ended that you consult with your institution’s neurologist.  
 
Central Neurotoxicity  
In patients who develop Grade 3 CNS events (e.g., somnolence, mood alteration, irritability, 
confusion, etc.) that return to < Grade 2 severity prior to the next planned co urse of Nelarabine, 
the Nelarabine dose is to be prescribed without treatment interruption.  
 
Nelarabine will not be made up if any doses are missed during a 5 -day treatment course. Patients 
who are unable to receive a 5 -day course of Nelarabine because of toxicity should proceed to the 
next planned course of protocol therapy as soon as recovery allows.  
 
Rhabdomyolysis  
If patient(s) develop myalgia or myoglobinuria, they should be evaluated for the potential of 
having rhabdomyolysis. The patient should recei ve a workup that includes AST, ALT, 
creatinine, and creatine kinase (CK)/(CPK) at a minimum. Consideration should be given to 
consulting a nephrologist. The Study Chair (s) should be notified if the patient develops either of 
the above symptoms, and the nel arabine should be held. If the patient is stable, other protocol 
therapy may continue while the patient is undergoing evaluation. Following study chair  
notification and evaluation for rhabdomyolysis, a decision should be rendered regarding 
permanently disc ontinuing the nelarabine.

5.3 Cyclophosphamide  
Hematuria : Omit in the presence of macroscopic hematuria. If there is a history of previous 
significant hematuria, hydrate before cyclophosphamide until specific gravity is < 1.010 and 
hydrate at 125  mL/m2/hr for 24 hours after dose. Monitor for adequate urine output as per 
institution guidelines.  Give IV mesna at a total dose that is 60% of the cyclophosphamide dose 
divided to 3 doses (eg, if the cyclophosphamide dose is 1000  mg/m2, the total mesna dose is 60 0 
mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2). Give the first mesna dose  15 minutes before or at the same time as the 
cyclophosphamide dose and repeat 4 and 8  hours after the start of cyclophosphamide. This total 
daily dose of mesna can  also be a dministered as IV continuous infus ion. The continuous infusion 
should be started 15 -30 minutes before or at the same time as cyclophosphamide and finished no 
sooner than 8  hours after the end of cyclophosphamide infusion.  
 
5.4 Cytarabine (ARAC)  
ARAC Syndrome : Do not withhold ARAC for fever  if it is likely to have been caused by the 
ARAC. Obtain blood cultures if a central line is present. For rash or conjunctivitis, withhold for 
Grade 3 -4 toxicity until resolved. Make up missed doses and consider concurrent treatment with 
hydrocortisone or dexamethasone, and/or with dexamethasone ophthalmic drops for 
conjunctivitis.  
 
5.5 Intrathecal Cytarabine  
Do not withhold dose given on Day 1 of Induction.  
 
5.6 Daunorubicin and Doxorubicin (Anthracyclines)  
Cardiac Toxicity: Discontinue for clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiomyopathy (SF 
< 27% or EF < 50%) or Grade 3 -4 left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) per CTCAE 
version 4.0.  
 
Note: use the following updated term to report decreases in the SF or EF: Cardiac disorders -
other.  
 
Myelos uppression (beyond Induction) : If patient has severe infection or severe mucositis (Grade 3 -4) and 
an ANC < 500/μL delay anthracycline during phases other than Induction. During Induction, continue 
with anthracycline administration. Subsequent doses should  be given at full dose.  
Hyperbilirubinemia :50  
Direct bilirubin <1.2 mg/dL  -Full dose  
Direct bilirubin 1.2 -3.0 mg/dL  -50% dosage decrease.  
Direct bilirubin 3.1 -5.0 mg/dL  -75% dosage decrease.  
Direct b ilirubin >5 mg/dL  -Withhold dose  and administer next scheduled dose if toxicity has 
resolved. Do not make up missed doses.  
 
Extravasation:  
In the event of an extravasation, discontinue the IV administration of the drug and institute appropriate 
measures to  prevent further extravasation and damage according to institutional guidelines. Also see 
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/disc/Nursing/extravasationguidelines.pdf  for COG 
guidelines.

Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 81 
5.7 Intrathecal Methotrexate  
Systemic toxicity : The dosage for IT chemotherapy will not be reduced for systemic toxicity 
(myelosuppression, muco sitis, etc.). Instead, leucovorin may be used at a dose of 5mg/m2/dose 
every 12  hours x 2 doses, beginning 48 hours after the IT therapy has been delivered. This may 
reduce the risk of worsening already existent myelosuppression (ANC < 500/ L) or mucositis . Do 
not administer leucovorin solely to prevent myelosuppression.  
 
Dose modifications following an episode of acute neurotoxicity:  
Neurotoxicity has extremely protean manifestations, ranging from transient events, seizures or 
episodes of acute hemiparesis, to severe necrotizing encephalopathies.51-53 These toxicities are 
poorly un derstood and currently it is impossible to predict who will suffer these complications. 
In addition, there are no data clearly linking the occurrence of an acute neurotoxic event with an 
increased risk of long -term neurocognitive dysfunction, nor do change s present on MRI at the 
time of an acute event clearly correlate with or predict outcome.53-58 It is clear however, that 
CNS prophylaxis is a mandatory component of curative therapy for children with ALL. Effective 
prophylaxis generally takes 2 forms; cranial, or less commonly, craniospinal radiation, with a 
limited number of doses of IT therap y or prolonged IT therapy with either IT MTX or triple IT 
therapy (MTX, ARAC and hydrocortisone). Certain protocols, for example BFM 200028, include 
fewer doses of IT MTX, with an acceptably low frequency of CNS relapse, but the backbone of 
the BFM therapies is not the same as those currently used by the Children’s Oncology Group. 
The exclusive use of IT ARAC has not been studied or described in the context of ALL therapy 
nor can one demonstrate the safety of omitting multiple doses of IT therapy without concomitant 
use of cranial irradiation or high dose Methotrexate.  
 
The following guidelines are offered for consideration  following an acute event, but it must be 
recognized that there are little data to support these approaches or any others. Thus the treating 
physician must evaluate the patient and, with the family, make the best possible decision with 
respect to the relat ive risk and benefit of continued therapy.  
 
Following an acute neurotoxic event, a history and physical exam should guide the differential 
diagnosis. A neurology consult may be of value and should be considered.  Seizures and other 
transient events may be linked to fever, infection, encephalitis, meningitis, hypertension, 
electrolyte disturbance, hypoglycemia, trauma, intracranial hemorrhage or thrombosis, narcotic 
withdrawal, illicit drug use, or other causes in addition to the direct side effects of chemo therapy. 
Appropriate laboratory studies may include, but are not limited to, blood cultures, a CBC, 
electrolytes, including glucose, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, renal and liver function 
studies and/or an examination of the CSF. Imaging studies may i nclude a CT scan and/or an 
MRI. The CT is commonly normal, in the absence of stroke, but if calcifications are present, this 
finding may be indicative of a more severe mineralizing leukoencephalopathy.59 MRI 
abnormalities may be pronounced, but transient. Posterior reversible encephalopathy may be 
present on MR with extensive diffusion abnormalities, but these do not appear to correlate with 
subsequent demyelination or gliosis.60-62 Additional studies, including MR angiography and/or 
venogram should be considered, if clinicall y indicated (e.g. focal deficits).  
 
Many acute events, seizures or episodes of transient hemiparesis,  are temporally related to the 
administration of intrathecal therapy, commonly 9 to 11 days after the IT administration.63 For 
patients who return to their “pre -event” status, without residual deficits on physical or neurologic 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 82 
exam,  there are few data to support or guide therapeutic interventions. I t is reasonable to hold the 
next dose of IT therapy, or, substitute IT ARAC for 1 dose of IT MTX, or triple IT therapy. It is 
also reasonable to include leucovorin rescue at a dose of 5 mg/m2 q 12 hrs x 2 doses beginning 
48 hours after the LP. This pattern  of rescue was associated with a clear diminution in the 
incidence of acute neurotoxicity in one case series.63 There have been questions about po tential 
interference of leucovorin with the efficacy of the IT MTX, but there are little data to support or 
refute this position. Moreover, the administration 48 hours later would minimize any potential 
interference. If the event does not recur, resumption  of standard therapy should be considered, 
following one modified or omitted IT dose. In the face of multiply recurrent events, or evidence 
of progressive encephalopathy, another evaluation is warranted and the treating physician may 
consider a more prolon ged or definitive change in therapy. These decisions are extremely 
difficult and may hinge on an individuals view of the importance of quality of life versus an 
increase in the risk of relapse. Since the greatest impact of CNS prophylaxis occurs early in 
therapy, the timing of these events may also influence clinical decisions. Cranial radiation has 
been suggested as an alternative to continued IT therapy though much of the literature on long -
term neurocognitive dysfunction supports a more deleterious effec t from CRT than IT therapy.64-
67 Dramatic deviations from protocol recommended therapy might result in the child being taken 
off protocol therapy.  
 
The use of dextromethorphan (DM) has been suggested as a neuroprotectant, capable of 
preventing NMDA mediated neurotoxicity without prohibitive toxicity. Low dos e therapy has 
been recommended, in part, based on data suggesting that DM is concentrated in brain relative to 
serum. However, the literature on the use of DM supports a tight dose response relationship, with 
the likelihood of sparing an initially unaffect ed area, following ischemic damage, linked to dose, 
in both clinical trials and animal models of CNS ischemia.68-71 At doses thought to be 
therapeutic, side effects have included nystagmus, nausea and vomi ting, distorted vision, ataxia, 
and dizziness. In addition, Hollander and others72 have raised concerns about the potential 
deleterious effects of long -term NMDA receptor blockade on memo ry because hippocampal 
long-term potentiation is dependent on the activation of the NMDA receptor. Thus in the absence 
of a clinical trial there are few data to support the addition of DM.  
 
 
Hydrocephalus, microcephaly or known abnormality of CSF flow prec luding intrathecal chemotherapy 
via lumbar puncture : 
Intraventricular chemotherapy via Ommaya catheter may be used in place of intrathecal therapy delivered 
by LP. Intraventricular chemotherapy should be given according to the same schedule, but at 50% of the 
corresponding age -based doses  that would be given by LP. NOTE: Obstruction to CSF flow may be a 
contraindication to intrathecal and/or intraventricular therapy.  
 
Viral, bacterial, or fungal meningitis : Omit until resolved.  
 
 
5.8 High -Dose Methotrexate (HD MTX) and Leucovorin Rescue  
[Please note that HD MTX  refers to IV MTX 5 g/m2 given over 24 hrs ] 
Review of methotrexate dosing on BFM -based protocols indicated that excessive methotrexate 
toxicity has not been encountered in patients larger than 2 m2 who receive more than 10 grams of 
methotrexate. The investigator should base the methotrexate on the patient's meter -squared 
dosing and not cap at 10 grams of methotrexate.

When IT therapy and HDMTX are scheduled for the same day, deliver the IT therapy within 6 
hours of the beginning of the IV MTX infusion (hour -6 to +6, with 0 being the start of the MTX 
bolus).  
 
Hold TMP -SMX on the days of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of the HD MTX 
infusion and until the MTX level is less than 0.4 μM. In the presence of delayed clearance continue to hold 
these medications until MTX level is less than 0 .1 µM.  
 
Hold any nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications, penicillin s, proton pump inhibitors,   TMP/SMX or 
aspirin -containing medications on the day of HD MTX infusion and for at least 72 hours after the start of 
the HD MTX infusion and until the MTX le vel is less than 0.4 μM . In the presence of delayed clearance 
continue to hold these medications until MTX level is less than 0.1 µM.  
 
Recommended Prehydration with D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L at 125 mL/m2/hour until 
urine specific gravity is ≤  1.010 and pH is ≥ 7.0 and ≤  8.0. Ringers Lactate may be used as the 
initial fluid if a bicarbonate containing solution is unavailable. Adjust fluid volume and sodium 
bicarbonate to maintain urine specific gravity and pH at above parameters. A bicarbonate bolus 
(25 m Eq/m2 over 15 minutes) may be given to raise the urine pH relatively quickly; a normal 
saline bolus may also be helpful in facilitating hydration. Continue hydration and alkalinization 
throughout HD MTX infusion, and for a minimum of 48 hours after its com pletion. In patients 
with delayed MTX clearance, continue hydration until the plasma MTX concentration is below 
0.1 µM.  
 
Hour 0 : MTX 500 mg/m2 IV mixed in a final volume of 65 mL/m2 D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq 
NaHCO 3/L and infused over 30 minutes. This is followed , immediately, by MTX 4500 mg/m2 
mixed in a final volume of 2935 mL/m2 D5 ¼ NS with 30 mEq NaHCO 3/L given by continuous 
IV infusion over 23.5  hours at 125 mL/m2/hr. Be certain that the HD MTX infusion is completed 
in the 24 hour period. Unintentional prolo ngation to as long as 26 hours though not encouraged 
is acceptable.  
 
Hours 24, (36), 42 and 48 : Draw MTX level and serum creatinine; NOTE: 36 hour level is only 
drawn if needed (see below)  
 
 For MTX levels that exceed these expected values modify the rescu e regimen as 
noted below and increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr, monitor urine pH to assure a 
value ≥ 7.0 and monitor urine output to determine if volume is ≥ 80% of the fluid intake, 
measured every 4 hours. If serum creatinine rises significantly, at any time point, assure 
appropriate urine pH and urine volume as above and draw a 42 hour level. If urine output 
fails to continue at 80% of the fluid intake, consider furosemide. Regardless of urine 
output, also consider glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase G 2) (see  below). For patients with 
delayed clearance during a previous course, begin the following course with the increased 
hydration (200 mL/m2/hr). If subsequent course is not associated with delayed clearance, 
attempt to use standard hydration.  
 
If the 24 hour  level is < 150 M draw the next level at hour 42 and refer to table below.

If the 24 hour level is ≥ 150 M and/or creatinine > 125% baseline , repeat level if 
MTX contamination is possible. While waiting for the result and if the value is “real” 
refer to the changes in hydration, etc described above and repeat the level with a serum 
Cr at hour 36. Then refer to the table below.  
 
If the 42 and 48 hour levels are ≤ 1 and 0.4 M, respectively , give leucovorin at 15 
mg/m2 IV/PO at 42, 48 and 54 hours post the start of methotrexate loading dose. No 
additional levels are needed, nor is additional leucovorin.

Consider glucarpidase.  
** If the 36 hour level exceeds 3 M, increase hydration to 200 mL/m2/hr, monitor urine pH to assure a value 
> 7.0 and monitor urine output to determine if volume is > 80% of the fluid intake, measured every 4 hours. 
If urine output fails to continue at 80% of the fluid intake, consider furo semide. Regardless of urine output, 
also consider glucarpidase if 36 hour MTX level exceeds 10 M (see below).  
 
++ If the level is high at hour 36 or 42, but then the patient “catches up” and the level falls to the expected 
values of ≤ 1 µM and/or ≤ 0.4 µM  at hours 42 and 48, respectively, resume standard leucovorin and 
hydration as long as urine output remains satisfactory.  
 
Nephrotoxicity : Postpone course if pre -treatment (MTX) serum creatinine is > 1.5 x baseline or 
GFR creatinine clearance < 65 mL/minute/1.73m2. If renal function does not recover, omit MTX.  
Do not give HDMTX to a patient with this degree of renal impairment, assuming that prolonged 
excretion can be managed with glucarpidase. Patients who must omit more than one course of 
HDMTX w ill be removed from protocol therapy.  
 
NOTE: For patients  who have markedly delayed MTX clearance secondary to renal dysfunction, 
consider using glucarpidase (carboxypeptidase G 2, Voraxaze ).73,74 ASD Healthcare is the sole 
supplier of glucarpidase in the US.  To obtain supplies of glucarpidas e in the US contact the

Patients requiring glucarpidase rescue wil l remain on study.  
 
Liver Dysfunction : Samples for the determination of ALT value must be drawn within 72 hours, PRIOR to 
a course of intravenous MTX. Blood samples for ALT should not be drawn following the start of MTX 
infusions as MTX causes significant  short term elevations in ALT levels.

Consider liver biopsy before additional therapy given.   
* Please see Section 8.1.2  for TMP/SMX substi tutions  
 
Hold IV MTX for direct hyperbilirubinemia of > 2.0 mg/dL.  
 
For patient's allergic to or experiencing excessive myelosuppression with TMP/SMX, alternative 
prophylaxis with dapsone (1 -2 mg/kg/day, maximum dose 100 mg/day), aerosolized pentamidine 
(300 mg/q month ≥  5 years of age), or atovaquone (30 mg/kg/day if 1 -3 mo. or > 2 years, 45 
mg/kg/day if between 3 mo. & 2  years) may be considered.  
 
Mucositis : For Grade 3 -4 mucositis, withhold IV MTX until resolved. Increase leucovorin rescue 
following the next course from three to five doses on a q6 hr schedule. If subsequent course is not 
associated with Grade 3 -4 mucositis, attempt to decrease the leucovorin. If mucositis recurs despite 
the extended leucovorin, decrease the dose of MTX by 25%, increase hy dration to 200mL/m2/hr 
and continue increased leucovorin as above. Should subsequent courses be well tolerates, use a 
stepwise approach to resuming a standard approach to drug delivery.  Consider culturing lesions for 
herpes simplex if mucositis persists o r recurs.  
 
Myelosuppression : All chemotherapy should be held for ANC < 750/µL or platelets < 
75,000/µL.

Hold IV MTX for direct hyperbillirubinemia of > 2.0 mg/dL  
 
Mucositis : For Grade 3 -4 mucositis, withhold IV MTX until resolved. Discontinue MTX dose 
escalation and resume at 80% of last dose if therapy is delayed for myelosuppression or Grade 3 or 
greater mucositis. If mucositis recurs, consider culturing lesions for herpes simplex.  
 
Myelosuppression:    
A) If ANC is < 500/µL or platelets < 50,000/µL, hold all chemotherapy and repeat blood counts 
in 4 days.  
1. If ANC ≥ 500/µL and platelets ≥ 50,000/µL, give same dose of methotrexate as previous 
cycle.  
2. If ANC is still < 500/µL or platelets < 50,000/µL, give VCR, PEG -ASP and IT MTX (if 
due) and repeat counts in 7 days to begin next dose of MTX if counts are adequate. If 
counts now adequate, reduce dose of MTX by 20%. Do not make up missed dose of 
MTX. If counts still too low, hold therapy until counts recover to ANC > 50 0/µL and 
platelets > 50,000/µL.  
B) If ANC ≥ 500/µL but < 750µL and platelets ≥50,000/µL but < 75,000/µL, give same dose of 
MTX as previously.   
C) If ANC ≥ 750/µL and platelets ≥ 75,000/µL escalate MTX by 50 mg/m2/dose.  
 
 
5.9 PO Methotrexate (MTX) and 6 -Mercap topurine (6 -MP)  
 
Interim Maintenance with HD MTX:  
If ANC is < 750/µL and/or platelets < 75  000/µL, hold mercaptopurine. Restart mercaptopurine 
at full dose with next cycle of HD MTX when ANC is  750/L and platelets are  75 000/L. 
Do not make up missed doses. Consider a marrow evaluation in the face of persistent or 
prolonged cytopenias.  
 
If patient develops severe or unexpected myelosuppression, see section below on thiopurine 
pharmacology testing.  
 
Maintenance : 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 87 
If neutrophil count falls below 500/ L or if platelet count falls below 50,000/ L during Maintenance, 6-
MP and MTX only will be held until recovery above these levels. For the first drop in ANC or platelets, 
resume chemotherapy (both 6-MP and MTX) at the same dose the patient was taking prior to the episode 
of myelosuppression. If neutrophil count falls below 500/ L or if platelet count falls below 50,000/ L for 
a second (or greater) time, discontinue doses of MP and MTX until ANC is ≥ 750/µL and platelets are 
≥ 75,000/µL. Restart both 6-MP and MT X at 50% of the dose prescribed at the time the medication was 
stopped. Then continue to increase to 75% and then 100% of the dose prescribed prior to stopping the 
medication at 2 -4 week intervals provided ANC remains ≥ 750/µL and platelets remain ≥ 75,000 /µL. 
Consider discontinuing TMP/SM X as per supportive care guidelines in Section 8.1.2 . If neutrophil count 
falls below 500/µL or if platelet count falls below 50,000/µL on > 2 occasions during Maintenance, 
perform thiopurine pharmacology testing as described below. Should therapy be withheld for 
myelosuppression or elevated transaminase, do not “make up” that week. Resume therapy at the correct 
point, chronologically.  
 
Dose escalation during Maintenance:  
No dose escalations are recommended during the first cycle of Maintenance. Thereafter, for ANC ≥ 
1500/L on 3 CBC(s) done over 6 weeks or 2 successive monthly CBC(s) alternately increase doses 
of MTX or MP by 25%. If both MTX and 6 -MP are increased once wi thout a fall in ANC, consider 
noncompliance as a possibility. Noncompliance can be assessed by obtaining a sample for RBC 
thioguanine nucleotides (TGNs). Consider observing the administration of an oral dose of MTX and 
checking plasma MTX concentration 2 -4 hours later. This will document whether or not poor 
absorption contributes to lack of response and may facilitate discussions about noncompliance.  
 
Mucositis Grade 3 -4: 
MTX should be reduced to 50% if Grade 3 toxicity develops; withhold in the presence of  Grade 4 
toxicity until there is a resolution, then resume at 50% of original dose with gradual dose escalation. 
If mucositis persists or recurs, consider culturing for herpes simplex.  
 
Liver Dysfunction : 
For increase in hepatic transaminases (SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST) to greater than 5x ULN 
consistent with Grade 3 toxicity, obtain total bilirubin.  Monitor SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST and 
total bilirubin every 2  weeks during Consolidation and every 4 weeks during Maintenance as long 
as transaminases remain over 5x ULN . 
 
Continue full dose therapy  unless either of the following occurs:  
1) Direct bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL  
2) SGPT/ALT or SGOT/AST > 20x ULN (consistent with Grade 4 toxicity) on 2 determinations at 
least 1 week apart.  
 
If either of these occurs, hold MTX and m onitor labs as above, weekly. Restart at full dose therapy when the 
transaminase is less than 5x ULN, if bilirubin is normal. If liver dysfunction persists, consider a trial period 
with MTX but without 6 -MP, especially if red cell 6-MP methylated derivatives are  elevated. If liver 
function improves in the absence of MP, consider resuming MP dose at 50% and escalating every two weeks 
as tolerated. Also consider liver biopsy.  
 
Exclude infectious hepatitis (A, B, C) for persistent (> 1 month) elevatio ns in SGPT/ALT or 
SGOT/AST above 5x ULN.

Thiopurine Pharmacology Testing and Dosage Adjustments:  
6-MP and 6 -TG are methylated directly by thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to an inactive 
metabolite. TPMT activity varies tremendously among patients, bec ause of a common inherited 
genetic defect in TPMT. One in 300 patients is completely deficient (homozygous defective) and 
10% of the population are moderately deficient in TPMT activity because they have inherited one 
variant (non -functional) TPMT allele ( i.e., heterozygotes).75-78 Patients with low TPMT form 
higher concentrations of the thioguanine nucleotides (TG Ns) and are more susceptible to acute 
thiopurine toxicity (primarily myelosuppression, involving neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and 
anemia).  Patients with the complete deficiency of TPMT tolerate less than 10% of protocol doses 
of 6MP (10 to 30 mg/m2/day 3  days per week). About 35% of heterozygotes require a lower dose 
of 6MP to avoid dose -limiting myelosuppression.79  
 
There are now CLIA certified tests for TPMT genotype and phenotype, and for thiopurine 
metabolites (6 -methyl mercaptopurine [6 -MMP]  and 6 -TGN) measurements. Only 3 SNPs 
constitute well over 90% of the inactivating mutations in the gene, based on studies in numerous 
racial and ethnic groups worldwide .75,80 -83 Thus, the genotyping test has a low false negative rate, 
and may be preferable to TPMT phenotype testing in cases where a history of red cell 
transfusions would potentially confound assessments of RBC TPMT activity. When the 
geno typing result is coupled with a phenotyping test for TPMT or with thiopurine metabolite 
concentrations in erythrocytes, the reliability of the tests will be even greater. Moreover, 
metabolite levels can provide an index of patient compliance with thiopurin e therapy.  
 
Recommendations for Thiopurine Monitoring and Dosage Adjustments:  
Since 6 -MP is first introduced during Consolidation, concomitantly with myelosuppressive 
therapy, TPMT genotyping should be considered during Induction, prior to the initiation o f 6-MP 
administration. If TPMT testing has not been performed, consider TPMT testing and/or an 
assessment of 6 -TGN and methlymercaptopurine metabolites when myelosuppression has led to 
significant delays in therapy (>  2 weeks) or is disproportionate to the  therapy being delivered:  
-  For patients who have received full dose thiopurine therapy during the 2 weeks 
immediately preceding the test, RBC thiopurine metabolites will likely predict TPMT 
status and actual thiopurine exposure.  
-  In the absence of RBC transfusions for 3 months prior, TPMT activity will accurately 
reflect TPMT status  
-  TPMT genotyping will be informative in all patients, if at least one mutant allele is 
identified. If not, and myelosuppression continues, send samples for TPMT activity 
and/or metabolites since TPMT genotyping will miss 5% -10% of mutants. NOTE: 
Genotyping can be done despite recent transfusions.  
 
Suggested Dose Adjustments in Patients with Unacceptable Myelosuppression:  
-  If the patient is homozygous deficient  for TPMT, t he thiopurine dose should be 
reduced to  10-20 mg/m2/day 3 days per week. If the patient is heterozygous for TPMT  
and has experienced significant myelosuppression, the thiopurine dose should be 
reduced by 30% -50%. Do not increase the dose in response to a h igh ANC for 4 
weeks to allow for achievement of steady state. All other myelosuppressive 
medications should be delivered at full dose, and the thiopurine dose should be 
titrated based on blood counts. Further thiopurine pharmacologic measures are not 
often  necessary.

Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 89 
 
-  If the patient is homozygous wild -type (high activity) for TPMT, then discontinue 
TMP/SMX and use pentamidine or dapsone. For modifications of the oral 6 -MP and 
MTX see the beginning of this section ( 5.9). 
 
5.10 Steroids (Dexamethasone and Prednisone)  
Hypertension : Dose should not be reduced. Sodium restriction and anti -hypertensives should be 
employed in an effort to control hypertension. Avoid calcium channel blockers due to their 
potential prohemorrhagic effect.  
 
Hyperglycemia : Dose should not be reduced for hy perglycemia. Rather, insulin therapy should be 
employed to control the blood glucose level.  
 
Pancreatitis : Do not modify dose for asymptomatic elevations of amylase and/or lipase. Discontinue 
steroids, except for stress doses, in the presence of hemorrhagi c pancreatitis or severe pancreatitis 
(abdominal pain >  72 hours and > Grade 3 amylase elevation (> 2.0x ULN).   
 
Osteonecrosis (ON) : Do not modify corticosteroid therapy for osteonecrosis ( also referred to as 
avascular necrosis)  during Induction or Delaye d Intensification. Consider omitting Maintenance 
steroid for osteonecrosis Grade 1 (clinically asymptomatic, radiographic finding only) . Omit 
Maintenance steroid for osteonecrosis Grade 2 or greater, and notify study chair . Consider resuming 
Maintenance st eroid after 6 months if joint symptoms have resolved and if MRI findings have 
significantly improved or normalized.  
 
Varicella : Steroids should be held during active infection except during Induction. Do not hold 
during incubation period following exposure . 
 
Inability to use oral doses : 
For dexamethasone, substitute the IV preparation mg for mg. For prednisone, substitute IV 
methylprednisolone at 80% of the oral prednisone dose. Note that if substituting oral 
prednisolone for prednisone, the doses are the same; prednisone is converted in the liver to 
prednisolone.  
 
Severe infection : Do not hold or discontinue steroids during Induction without serious 
consideration, as this is a critical period in the treatment of ALL. Later in therapy, one may consider 
holding steroid until patient achieves cardiovascular stability, except for “stress doses.”  
 
Severe psychosis : Steroid dose may be decreased by 50% for severe psychosis.  
 
5.11 PO 6-Thioguanine  (6-TG) 
Delayed Intensification:  
Oral 6 -TG will be held for suspecte d or proven serious infection.  
 
For severe and/or unexpected myelosuppression, evaluate for TPMT activity as described in 
Section 5.9 .

5.12 Vincristine  
 
** PLEASE USE “BALIS” SCALE FOR GRADING NEUROPATHY (SEE APPENDIX V)  
 
Severe neuropathic pain (Grade 3 or greater) : Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 
50% previous calculated  dose (maximum dose: 1  mg), then escalate to full dose as tolerated. NOTE: 
neuropathic pain can be not only severe but difficul t to treat. However, since vincristine is an 
important component of curative therapy and the majority of neuropathies are ultimately reversible, 
vincristine therapy may be given at full dose at investigator discretion. Severe peripheral 
neuropathies, with or without a positive family history might suggest the need for a molecular 
diagnostic evaluation to rule out Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT), Type 1A or Hereditary 
neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.  Drugs such as gabapentin may be of value.  
 
Vocal Cord paralysis : Hold dose(s). When symptoms subside, resume at 50% previous calculated  
dose (maximum dose: 1  mg), then escalate to full dose as tolerated. See above for comment on 
CMT.  
 
Foot Drop, paresis : Should be Grade 3 to consider holding or d ecreasing dose. These toxicities are 
largely reversible but over months to years. Accordingly, holding doses of vincristine and/or 
lowering the dose may not result in rapid resolution of symptoms and may compromise cure. See 
above for comment on CMT. Physi cal therapy may be beneficial to maintain range of motion and 
provide AFO’s and other forms of support. Drugs such as gabapentin may be of value.  
 
Jaw pain : Treat with analgesics; do not modify vincristine dose.  
 
 
Hyperbilirubinemia :84,85 
 
Direct bilirubin    Dose reduction   
< 3.1 mg/dL   Full dose (maximum dose: 2  mg) 
3.1-5.0 mg/dL   50% of calculated  dose (maximum dose: 1  mg) 
5.1-6.0 mg/dL   75% of calculated  dose (maximum dose: 0.5  mg) 
> 6 mg/dL  Withhold dose  and administer next scheduled dose if toxicity has 
resolved. Do not make up missed doses.  
 
Constipation or ileus (> Grade 3) or typhlitis : Hold dose(s); institute aggressive regimen to treat 
constipation if present. When symptoms abate resume at 50% of calculated  dose (maximum dose: 
1 mg) and escalate to full dose as tolerated.  
 
Extravasation : 
In the event of an extravasation, discontinue the IV a dministration of the drug and institute appropriate 
measures to prevent further extravasation and damage according to institutional guidelines. Also see 
https://members.childrensoncologygroup.org/_files/disc/Nursing/extravasationguidelines.pdf  for COG

5.13 Drug Interactions  
Since concurrent use of enzyme inducing anticonvulsants (e.g. phenytoin, phenobarbital, and 
carbamazepine) with antil eukemic therapy has recently been associated with inferior EFS, every 
effort should be made to avoid these agents, as well as rifampin, which also induces many drug 
metabolizing enzymes 86,87. Neither Gabapentin nor Levetiracetam induce hepatic drug 
metabolizing enzymes and may be suitable alternative anticonvulsant. Azole antifungals 
(fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole) and the macrolide 
group of antibioti cs (e.g. erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin) may have potent 
inhibitory effects on drug -metabolizing enzymes. Patients receiving some antileukemic drugs 
(e.g. vincristine, anthracyclines, etoposide) may experience excess toxicity when these age nts are 
given concomitantly; alternate antifungal and antibacterial therapy should be used where 
possible  (see table below).

6.0 DRUG INFORMATION  
 
6.1 ASPARAGINASE ERWINIA  CHRYSANTHEMI (ERWINIA  CHRYSANTHEMI , 
ERWINASE®, ERWINAZETM, CRISANTASPASE )  NSC #106977      
 (02/29/12)  
Source and Pharmacology:  
L-asparagine is a nonessential amino acid synthesized by the transamination of L -aspartic acid 
by a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme L -asparagine synthetase. Neoplastic cells associated with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia and lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma are 
asparagine -dependent but lack asparagine synthetase activity. The administra tion of L -
asparaginase produces an anti -neoplastic effect by catalyzing asparagine into aspartic acid and 
ammonia. As a result, these cells lack the ability to produce the asparagine necessary for protein 
metabolism and survival. Deamination of glutamine m ay also play a role in the antineoplastic 
activity of asparaginase.  
 
Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  (ErwinazeTM) is asparaginase derived from cultures of 
Erwinia chrysanthemi . L-asparaginase is a tetrameric enzyme; each of the four identical subunits 
has a molecular weight of approximately 35 kDa. Asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  is 
immunologically distinct from E. coli L-asparaginase and may allow continued asparaginase 
therapy when a hypersensitivity reaction occurs to Escherichia coli -derived asparag inase. The 
package labeling states that there is insufficient information to characterize the incidence of 
antibodies to asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi . Several factors are involved in 
immunogenicity assay results and the assessment of antibodies, inclu ding assay methodology, 
assay sensitivity and specificity, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant 
medications, and the underlying disease state. The following data have been reported on each of 
the three preparations of asparaginase :

Effective asparaginase levels have been defined as activity of ≥ 0.1 International Units per mL. 
Clinical trials with asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi  demonstrated that 100% of patients 
achieved effective asparaginase levels at 48 and 72 hours (n=35 and n =13, respectively) 
following the third total dose when given on a Monday, Wednesday, Friday schedule. No formal 
drug interaction studies have been performed with asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi .

Units of asparaginase Erwinia chrysanthemi and the following inactive ingredients: glucose 
monohydrat e (5.0 mg), sodium chloride (0.5 mg). Store intact vials between 2°C and 8°C (36° to 
46ºF). Protect from light.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifica tion sections of the protocol.  
 
Use appropriate precautions for preparation of a hazardous agent. Visually inspect the powder in 
vial for foreign particles or discoloration prior to reconstitution. The contents of each vial should 
be reconstituted by slowl y adding 1  mL or 2  mL of sterile, preservative -free NS to the inner vial 
wall. The final concentration is 10,000 International Units per mL when using 1 mL for 
reconstitution or 5,000 International Units per mL when using 2 mL for reconstitution. Gently mi x 
or swirl the contents to dissolve the contents of the vial. Do not shake or invert the vial. The 
resulting solution should be clear and colorless. Discard if any particulate matter or protein 
aggregates are visible. Withdraw the appropriate dosing volume  into a polypropylene 
syringe within 15  minutes of reconstitution.  Polycarbonate luer -lok syringes from B -D (1 mL) 
are also acceptable (personal communication, EUSA Pharma). Discard any unused drug; do not 
save or use any unused drug remaining in the vial.   
 
Administer the dose within a 4 hour time period from reconstitution.  If the dose is not used 
within this time period, discard the dose. Do not freeze or refrigerate the reconstituted solution.   
 
Administer the dose intramuscularly (IM). No more than 2  mL should be given at any one injection 
site. Doses larger than 2 mL should be divided and given in separate administration sites.

6.2 CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE INJECTION  (Cytoxan) NSC #26271                           (03/05/13) 
Source and Pharmacology:   
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent related to nitrogen mustard. Cyclophosphamide is 
inactive until it is metabolized by P450 isoenzymes ( CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4) in the 
liver to active compounds. The initial product is 4 -hydroxycyclophosphamide (4 -HC) which is in 
equilibrium with aldophosphamide which spontaneously releases acrolein to produce 
phosphoramide mustard. Phosphoramide mustard , which is an active bifunctional alkylating 
species, is 10 times more potent in vitro  than is 4 -HC and has been shown to produce interstrand 
DNA cross -link analogous to those produced by mechlorethamine. Approximately 70% of a dose 
of cyclophosphamide is excreted in the urine as the inactive carboxyphosphamide and 5 -25% as 
unchanged drug. The plasma half -life ranges from 4.1 to 16 hours after IV administration.

6.3 CYTARABINE  (Cytosine arabinoside, Ara -C, Cytosar®) NSC #063878              (05/06/11)  
Source and Pharmacology : Cytarabine appears to act through the inhibition of DNA 
polymerase. A limited, but significant, incorporation of cytarabine into both DNA and RNA has 
also been reported. It exhibits cel l phase specificity, primarily killing cells undergoing DNA 
synthesis (S -phase) and under certain conditions blocking the progression of cells from the G1 
phase to the S -phase. Cytarabine is metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide 
kinases to the nucleotide triphosphate (Ara -CTP), an effective inhibitor of DNA polymerase. 
Ara-CTP is inactivated by a pyrimidine nucleoside deaminase, which converts it to the nontoxic 
uracil derivative (Ara -U). It appears that the balance of kinase and deaminas e levels may be an 
important factor in determining sensitivity or resistance of the cell to cytarabine.  It has an initial 
distributive phase t ½ of about 10 minutes, with a secondary elimination phase t ½ of about 1 to 3 
hours. Peak levels after intramuscula r or subcutaneous administration of cytarabine occur about 20 
to 60 minutes after injection and are lower than IV administration. Intrathecally administered doses 
are metabolized and eliminated more slowly with a t ½ of about 2 hours.

6.4 DAUNORUBICIN (Daunomycin, rubidomycin, Cerubidine®) NSC #82151  (05/09/11)  
Source and Pharmacology : Daunorubicin is an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of 
Strep tomyces coeruleorubidus . Daunorubicin is closely related structurally to doxorubicin only 
differing in that the side chain of daunorubicin terminates in a methyl group rather than an alcohol. 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24 /16                     Page 99 
The cytotoxic effect of daunorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various organs 
are similar to those of doxorubicin and are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalation 
and cell membrane lipid binding activities. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action 
of DNA and RNA polymeras es. The interaction of daunorubicin with topoisomerase II to form 
DNA -cleavable complexes appears to be an important mechanism of cytocidal activity. 
Daunorubicin cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of cellular functions. Enzymatic 
electron redu ction of daunorubicin by a variety of oxidases, reductases and dehydrogenases 
generate highly reactive species including the hydroxyl free radical (OH•) which may lead to 
DNA damage or lipid peroxidation. Daunorubicin is metabolized more rapidly by 
aldoket oreductases to the active metabolite, daunorubicinol, than is doxorubicin. Daunorubicin 
hydrochloride is rapidly and widely distributed in tissues, with the highest levels in the spleen, 
kidneys, liver, lungs, and heart. Daunorubicin serum decay pattern is  multiphasic. The initial t ½ 
is approximately 45 minutes followed by a terminal t ½ of 18.5 hours. By 1 hour after drug 
administration, the predominant plasma species is daunorubicinol, which disappears with a half -
life of 26.7 hours. Twenty -five percent of  an administered dose of daunorubicin is eliminated in 
an active form by urinary excretion and an estimated 40% by biliary excretion.

diverse physiologic effects on carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water 
balance, functions of the cardiovascular system, kidney, skeletal muscle, and the nervous 
systems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of thymus -depende nt lymphocytes (T -
lymphocytes), monocytes, and eosinophils. Glucocorticoids selectively bind to the cortisol 
receptors on human lymphoid cells which are found in larger numbers on leukemic 
lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding of immunoglobulin to cell surface receptors and 
inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby decreasing T -lymphocyte 
blastogenesis and reducing expansion of the primary immune response. The specific cellular 
mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition of glucose 
transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. 
Elimination half -lives for the following age groups have been reported to be: infants and children 
under 2 years of age: 2.3 to 9 .5 hours, 8 to 16 years: 2.82 to 7.5 hours, and adults (age not 
specified): 3 to 6 hours. The biologic half -life is 36 -72 hours. It is primarily metabolized in the 
liver and excreted by the kidneys.

in the placenta. In animal  studies, large doses of cortisol administered early in pregnancy produced cleft 
palate, stillborn fetuses, and decreased fetal size. Chronic maternal ingestion during the first trimester has 
shown a 1% incidence of cleft palate in humans. There are no rep orts of dexamethasone excretion into 
breast milk in humans; however, it is expected due to its low molecular weight that it would partition into 
breast milk.

6.6 DOXORUBICIN  (Adriamycin®) NSC #123127  (05/09/11 ) 
Source and Pharmacology : An anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces 
peucetius . The cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin on malignant cells and its toxic effects on various 
organs are thought to be related to nucleotide base intercalati on and cell membrane lipid binding 
activities of doxorubicin. Intercalation inhibits nucleotide replication and action of DNA and 
RNA polymerases. The interaction of doxorubicin with topoisomerase II to form DNA -cleavable 
complexes appears to be an importa nt mechanism of doxorubicin cytocidal activity. Doxorubicin 
cellular membrane binding may affect a variety of cellular functions. Enzymatic electron

reduction of doxorubicin by a variety of oxidases, reductases and dehydrogenases generate 
highly reactive s pecies including the hydroxyl free radical (OH•). Free radical formation has 
been implicated in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by means of Cu (II) and Fe (III) reduction at the 
cellular level. Cells treated with doxorubicin have been shown to manifest the char acteristic 
morphologic changes associated with apoptosis or programmed cell death. Doxorubicin -induced 
apoptosis may be an integral component of the cellular mechanism of action relating to 
therapeutic effects, toxicities, or both.  
 
Doxorubicin serum decay  pattern is multiphasic. The initial distributive t ½ is approximately 5 
minutes suggesting rapid tissue uptake of doxorubicin. The terminal t ½ of 20 to 48 hours reflects 
a slow elimination from tissues. Steady -state distribution volumes exceed 20 to 30 L/k g and are 
indicative of extensive drug uptake into tissues. Plasma clearance is in the range of 8 to 20 
mL/min/kg and is predominately by metabolism and biliary excretion. The P450 cytochromes 
which appear to be involved with doxorubicin metabolism are CYP 2D6 and CYP3A4. 
Approximately 40% of the dose appears in the bile in 5 days, while only 5 to 12% of the drug 
and its metabolites appear in the urine during the same time period. Binding of doxorubicin and 
its major metabolite, doxorubicinol to plasma prote ins is about 74 to 76% and is independent of 
plasma concentration of doxorubicin.

6.7 LEUCOVORIN CALCIUM  (LCV, Wellcovorin®, citrovorum factor, folinic acid)  
NSC #003590  (05/09/11)  
Source and Pharmacology :  Leucovorin is a mixture of the diastereoisomers of the 5 -formyl 
derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF). The biologically active compound of the mixture is the 
(-)- l-isomer, known as Citrovorum factor or ( -)-folinic acid. Leucovorin does not require 
reduct ion by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase in order to participate in reactions utilizing 
folates as a source of “one -carbon” moieties.  Administration of leucovorin can counteract the 
therapeutic and toxic effects of folic acid antagonists such as methotrex ate, which act by 
inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. In contrast, leucovorin can enhance the therapeutic and toxic 
effects of fluoropyrimidines used in cancer therapy, such as 5 -fluorouracil. Leucovorin is readily 
converted to another reduced folate, 5,10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate, which acts to stabilize the 
binding of fluorodeoxyuridylic acid (an active metabolite of 5 -FU) to thymidylate synthase and 
thereby enhances the inhibition of this enzyme.  Peak serum levels of 5 -methyl THF (an active 
metabolite) were reached at approximately 1.3 -1.5 hours (IV/IM) and 2.3 hours for the oral form. 
The terminal half -life of total reduced folates was approximately 6.2 hours. Following oral 
administration, leucovorin is rapidly absorbed and expands the serum pool of re duced folates. At 
a dose of 25 mg, almost 100% of the l-isomer (the biologically active form) but only 20% of the 
d-isomer is absorbed. Oral absorption of leucovorin is saturable at doses above 25 mg. The 
apparent bioavailability of leucovorin was 97% for 25 mg, 75% for 50 mg, and 37% for 100 mg 
doses.  Both oral and parenteral leucovorin raise the CSF folate levels.

Unknown Frequency and 
Timing:   Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of leucovorin in humans are unknown. It is 
unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.  
 
Injection : Because of the calcium content of the leucovorin solution, no more than 160  mg of 
leucovorin should be injected intravenously per minute (16  mL of a 10  mg/mL solution per 
minute). IV leucovorin and sodium bicarbonate a re incompatible.  
 
Oral: Oral leucovorin should be spaced evenly (e.g. every six hours) throughout the day and may 
be taken without regard to meals. Doses > 25 mg should be given IV due to the saturation of 
absorption.  
 
Leucovorin should not be administered  < 24 hours after intrathecal injections which contain 
methotrexate unless there are special circumstances.

6.8 MERCAPTOPURINE  (6-MP, Purinethol®, 6-mercaptopurine) NSC #000755  (11/26/12)  
Source and Pharmacology : Mercaptopurine is an analogue o f the purine bases adenine and 
hypoxanthine. The main intracellular pathway for MP activation is catalyzed by the enzyme 
hypoxanthine -guanine phosphoribosyl tr ansferase (HGPRT) which catalyzes the conversion of 
MP to several active nucleotide metabolites including thioinosinic acid, a ribonucleotide which 
can interfere with various metabolic reactions necessary for nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) 
biosynthesis. It can  also cause pseudofeedback inhibition of the first step in de novo purine 
biosynthesis or convert to another ribonucleotide which can cause feedback inhibition. 
Mercaptopurine  can be incorporated into DNA in the form of TG nucleotides as well and thus 
produce toxicity . The absorption of an oral dose of MP is incomplete and variable, with only 
about 16% -50% of an administered dose reaching the systemic circulation secondary to a first 
pass metabolism in the liver. Food intake and co -administration with cotrimoxazole (TMP/SMX) 
significantly reduces absorption of MP. After IV a dministration, MP has a plasma half -life of 21 
minutes in children and 47 minutes in adults. Approximately 19% is bound to protein. 
Mercaptopurine is well distributed into most body compartments except the CSF. (With high dose 
IV MP the CSF to plasma ratio  is 0.15.) MP is metabolized by xanthine oxidase in the liver to 6 -
Thiouric acid an inactive metabolite. In patients receiving both MP and allopurinol (a xanthine 
oxidase inhibitor) the dose of MP must be reduced by 50 -75%.  Since TPMT, 6 -thiopurine 
methylt ransferase, is also one of the enzymes involved in the metabolism of MP, those 
individuals who have an inherited deficiency of the enzyme may be unusually sensitive to the 
myelosuppressive effects of MP and prone to develop rapid bone marrow suppression fo llowing 
the initiation of treatment. Mercaptopurine  is excreted in urine as metabolites and some 
unchanged drug; about half an oral dose has been recovered in 24 hours. A small proportion is 
excreted over several weeks.

Women receiving mercaptopurine  in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased 
incidence of abortion. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk  
(L) Toxicity may also occur later.  
 
Formulation and Stability : 
Mercaptopurine  is available as a 50 mg tablet containing mercaptopurine  and the inactive 
ingredients corn and potato starch, lactose, magnesium stearate, and stearic acid.  Store at 
15°-25°C (59°-77°F) in a dry place.  
 
Guidelines for Administration : See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of the protocol.  
 
Do not give oral mercaptopurine with food or milk. C oncurrent milk products can decrease 
absorption and mercaptopurine effect is enhanced if given at bedtime on an empty stomach. If 
allopurinol is also given, the oral dose of mercaptopurine should be reduced by 67 -75%. Patients 
with severe myelosuppression should have their thiopurine S -methyltransferase (TPMT) status 
and/or their thiopurine metabolite concentrations evaluated, so that the dose of mercaptopurine can 
be reduced in patients with a TPMT defect. Patients with the rare homozygous deficient TPMT 
phenotype may tolerate only 1/10th to 1/20th the average mercaptopurine dose. TPMT testing and 
thiopurine metabolite measurements are commercially available.  
 
Suspension : 
For children unable to swallow the tablets whole, a 50  mg/mL oral suspension can be 
compounded. The suspension is prepared by crushing 50 mercaptopurine 50  mg tablets in a mortar 
and adding 8.5 mL sterile water for irrigation. The mixture is triturated to form a smooth paste. 
Next, 16.5  mL simple syrup (pH=7) are added with continuous mixin g and finally cherry syrup 
(pH=7.1) is added to a total volume of 50  mL. The suspension is stable in amber glass bottles at 
room temperature (19ºC -23ºC) for up to 5 weeks. The suspension should be shaken well before 
each use.  Procedures for proper handlin g and disposal of cytotoxic drugs should be used when 
preparing the suspension. (Aliabadi HM, Romanick M, Desai S et al. Effect of buffer and 
antioxidant on stability of mercaptopurine suspension. Am J Heath -Syst Pharm.  65:441 -7, 2008 .)

6.9 METHOTREXATE  (MTX, amethopterin, Trexall®) NSC #000740  (02/29/12)  
Source and Pharmacology : A folate analogue which reversibly inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, 
the enzyme that reduces folic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid. Inhibition of tetrahydrofolate formation 
limits the availability of one carbon fragments necessary for the synthesis of purines and the 
conversion of deoxyuridylate to thymidylate in the synthesis of DNA and cell reproduction. The 
polyglutamated metabolites of MTX also contribute to the cytotoxic effect of MTX on DNA repair 
and/or strand breaks.  MTX cytotoxicity is highly dependent on the absolute drug concentration 
and the duration of drug exposure.  MTX is actively transported across cell membranes. At serum 
methotrexate concentrations exceeding 0.1 µmol/mL, passive diffusion becomes a major means of 
intracellular transport of MTX. The drug is widely distributed throughout the body with the highest 
concentration in the kidney, liver, spleen, gallbladder and skin. Plasma concentrations following 
high dose IV MTX decline in a biphasic manner with an initial half -life of 1.5 -3.5 hours, and a 
terminal half life of 8 -15 hours. About 50% is bound to protein. After oral administration, 
approximately 60% of a 30 mg/m2 dose is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract, with peak blood 
levels at 1 hour. At doses > 30 mg/m² absorption decreases significantly. Even at low doses 
absorption may be very erratic, varying betwe en 23% and 95%. The elimination of MTX from the 
CSF after an intrathecal dose is characterized by a biphasic curve with half -lives of 4.5 and 14 
hours. After intrathecal administration of 12 mg/m², the lumbar concentration of MTX is ~ 100 
times higher than  in plasma. (Ventricular concentration is ~ 10% of lumbar concentration.) MTX is 
excreted primarily by the kidneys via glomerular filtration and active secretion into the proximal 
tubules. Renal clearance usually equals or exceeds creatinine clearance. Sma ll amounts are 
excreted in the feces. There is significant entero -hepatic circulation of MTX. The distribution of 
MTX into third -space fluid collections, such as pleural effusions and ascitic fluid, can substantially 
alter MTX pharmacokinetics. The slow re lease of accumulated MTX from these third spaces over 
time prolongs the terminal half -life of the drug, leading to potentially increased clinical toxicity.

hours after food or milk and at the same time each day.  Methotrexate injection diluted in water 
can be used for oral administration (Marshall PS, Gertner E. Oral administration of an easil y 
prepared solution of injectable methotrexate diluted in water: a comparison of serum 
concentrations vs methotrexate tablets and clinical utility. J Rheumatol  23:455 -8, 1996).  
 
For IV use:  Powder for injection: Dilute 1000 mg vial with 19.4  mL of preserva tive free SWFI, 
D5W or NS to a 50  mg/mL concentration. The powder for injection may be further diluted in NS 
or dextrose containing solutions to a concentration of ≤ 25 mg/mL for IV use.  
 
The 25 mg/mL solution may be given directly for IM administration or further diluted in Saline 
or Dextrose containing solutions for IV use. Do not use the preserved solution for high dose 
methotrexate administration due to risk of benzyl alcohol toxicity.  Methotrexate dilutions are 
chemically stable for at least 7 days at room temperature but contain no preservative and should 
be used within 24 hours. Diluted solutions especially those containing bicarbonate exposed to 
direct sunlight for periods exceeding 4 hours should be protected from light.  
 
High dose methotrexate requires alkalinization of the urine, adequate hydration and leucovorin 
rescue. Avoid probenecid, penicillins, cephalosporins, aspirin, proton pump inhibitors, and 
NSAIDS as renal excretion of  MTX is inhibited by these agents.  
 
For Intrathecal use : Use preservative free  25 mg/mL solution.  
 
For intrathecal administration, dilute with 5 -10 mL preservative free NS, lactated Ringer’s, or 
Elliot’s B solution, as per institutional standard of practi ce. The volume of CSF removed should be 
equal to at least half the volume delivered.

6.10 NELARABINE  (2-Amino -9--D arabinofur anosyl -6-methoxy -9H-purine, Compound 506U78 ) 
NSC# 686673; IND# 52611  (03/24/16) 
Source and Pharmacology: Nelarabine (compound 506U78) is a water soluble pro -drug of 9 -β-
D-arabinofuranosylguanine (ara -G), a deoxyguanosine analog being developed for the treatment

of patients with T -cell and B -cell leukemias and lymphomas. Nelarabine is rapidly converted by 
aden osine deaminase in the peripheral blood to ara -G. In Vitro studies and biochemical studies 
have demonstrated that intracellular ara -G is phosphorylated via deoxycytosine kinase (dCK) 
and deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) to its active 5’ -triphosphate (ara -GTP). Ara-GTP 
incorporation into DNA is a primary cause of cell death.  
 
The pharmacokinetics of nelarabine in humans are characterized by a rapid and extensive 
conversion to ara -G. The average elimination half -lives for nelarabine and ara -G were 
approximately 20 -25 minutes and 2.6 -4.0 hours, respectively. Virtually all nelarabine was 
converted to ara -G. Peak plasma concentration and area under the curve for both nelarabine and 
ara-G was essentially proportional to the administered dose. The steady -state volume of  
distribution of ara -G was similar in adult and pediatric patients. Neither compound showed 
accumulation with the dosing studies used in the pre -clinical trials with this agent. The 
pharmacokinetics of both nelarabine and ara -G appeared to be independent o f diagnosis and 
gender. Intracellular leukemic blast concentrations of ara -GTP were characterized by a long 
elimination half -life (median approximately 24 hours) and diagnosis dependent accumulation; 
with T -lymphoblasts generally demonstrating greater accu mulation of ara -GTP than other cell 
types. Nelarabine and ara -G is < 25% bound to human plasma proteins.

6.11 PEGASPARGASE  (PEG -asparaginase, PEGLA, PEG -L-asparaginase, polyethylene glycol -
L-asparaginase, Oncaspar®)  
NSC #624239           (03/13/13 ) 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Pegaspargase is a modified version of the enzyme L -asparaginase. L -asparaginase is modified by 
covalently conjugating units of monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG), molecular weight of 5000, to 
the enzyme, forming the active ingredient PEG -L-asparaginase. The L -asparaginase (L -asparagine 
amidohydrolase, type EC -2, EC  3.5.1.1) used in the manufacture of Pegaspargase is derived from 
Escherichia coli  which is purchased in bulk from Merck, Sharp and Dohme. L -asparagine is a 
nonessential amino acid synthesized b y the transamination of L -aspartic acid by a reaction catalyzed by 
the enzyme L -asparagine synthetase. The ability to synthesize asparagine is notably lacking in 
malignancies of lymphoid origin. Asparaginase depletes L -asparagine from leukemic cells (espec ially 
lymphoblasts) by catalyzing the conversion of L -asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. In 
predominately L -asparaginase naive adult patients with leukemia and lymphoma, initial plasma levels of 
L-asparaginase following intravenous administration of pegaspargase were determined. Apparent volume 
of distribution was equal to estimated plasma volume. L -asparaginase was measurable for at least 15  days 
following the initial treatment with Pegaspargase. The approximate t ½ in adult patients is 5.73  days. The  
enzyme could not be detected in the urine. The half -life is independent of the dose administered, disease 
status, renal or hepatic function, age, or gender.  In a study of newly diagnosed pediatric patients with 
ALL who received either a single intramuscul ar injection of pegaspargase  (2500  IU/m2), E. coli 
L-asparaginase (25000  IU/m2), or Erwinia (25000  IU/m2), the plasma half -lives for the three forms of 
L-asparaginase were: 5.73  ± 3.24 days, 1.24  ± 0.17 days, and 0.65  ± 0.13 days respectively.  The plasma 
half-life of pegaspargase  is shortened in patients who are previously hypersensitive to native 
L-asparaginase as compared to non -hypersensitive patients. L-asparaginase is cleared by the 
reticuloendothelial system and v ery little is excreted in the urine or bile. Cerebrospinal fluid levels are <  1% 
of plasma levels.

6.12 PREDNISONE (Deltasone, Meticorten, Orasone®, Liquid Pred, Pediapred®, Sterapred ®)      
NSC #010023   (05/10/11)  
Source an d Pharmacology : Prednisone is a synthetic compound closely related to hydrocortisone. 
Glucocorticoids produce widespread and diverse physiologic effects on carbohydrate, protein, and 
lipid metabolism, electrolyte and water balance, functions of the cardiov ascular system, kidney, 
skeletal muscle, and the nervous systems. Glucocorticoids reduce the concentration of thymus -
dependent lymphocytes (T -lymphocytes), monocytes, and eosinophils. Glucocorticoids 
selectively bind to the cortisol receptors on human lymp hoid cells which are found in larger 
numbers on leukemic lymphoblasts. They also decrease binding of immunoglobulin to cell 
surface receptors and inhibit the synthesis and/or release of interleukins, thereby decreasing T -
lymphocyte blastogenesis and reduci ng expansion of the primary immune response. The specific 
cellular mechanisms that act to halt DNA synthesis are thought to be related to inhibition of 
glucose transport or phosphorylation, retardation of mitosis, and inhibition of protein synthesis. 
Peak blood levels occur within 2 hours of oral intake. Prednisone is approximately 75% protein 
bound with a plasma t ½ of 3.2 to 4 hours (biologic half -life is 12 -36 hours).

Unknown Frequency 
and Timing:  Fetal and teratogenic toxicities: Corticosteroids cross the placenta ( prednisone has the 
poorest transport). In animal studies, large doses of cortisol administered early in pregnancy 
produced cleft palate, stillborn fetuses, and decreased fetal size. Chronic maternal ingestion 
during the first trimester has shown a 1% incidence of cle ft palate in humans. Prednisone is 
excreted into breast milk in humans; however, several studies suggest that amounts excreted 
in breast milk are negligible with prednisone  doses ≤  20 mg/day.

6.13 THIOGUANINE  (6-TG, 6 -thioguanine, 2 -amino -1, 7-dihydro -6H-purine -6-thione, WR -1141,  
Tabloid®, Lanvis®) NSC #752  (10/28/12)  
Source and Pharmacology : Thioguanine is a purine analogue of the nucleic acid guanine with the 
substitution of a thiol group in place of the hydroxyl group on guanine. The main intracellular 
pathway for 6 -TG activation is catalyzed by the enzyme hypoxanthine -guanine phosphoribosyl 
transferase (HGPRT) which catalyzes the conversion of 6 -TG to the active nucleotide, 6 -

thioguanylic acid. The monophosphate nucleotide form of 6 -TG inh ibits de novo  purine synthesis 
and purine interconversion reactions, whereas the nucleotide triphosphate metabolite is 
incorporated directly into nucleic acids. Incorporation of fraudulent nucleotides into DNA 
interferes with DNA replication and results in  the formation of DNA strand breaks.  The net 
consequence of its actio n is a sequential blockade of the synthesis and 
utilization of the purine nucleotides. The relative contribution of each of these 
actions to the mechanism of cytotoxicity of 6 -TG is unclear. The absorption of an oral 
dose of 6 -TG is incomplete and variable , averaging approximately 30% of the 
administered dose (range: 14% to 46%).  
 
Thioguanine undergoes deamination by the enzyme guanine deaminase resulting in 6 -
thioxanthene, which is then oxidized by xanthine oxidase to 6 -thiouric acid. In contrast to 
mercap topurine, 6 -TG is not a direct substrate for xanthine oxidase. Because the inhibition of 
xanthine oxidase results in the accumulation of 6 -thioxanthene, an inactive metabolite, 
adjustments in 6 -TG dosage are not required for patients receiving allopurinol.  Since TPMT, 6 -
thiopurine methyltransferase, is one of the enzymes involved in the deactivation of 6 -TG, those 
individuals who have an inherited deficiency of the enzyme may be unusually 
sensitive to the myelosuppressive effects of 6 -TG and prone to develo ping 
rapid bone marrow suppression following the initiation of treatment.  
 
Peak levels occur 2 to 4 hours after oral administration with a median half -life is about 90 minutes 
(range: 25 -240 minutes). Very little unchanged drug is excreted renally.

6.14 VINCRISTINE SULFATE  (8/16/12)  
(Oncovin ®, VCR, LCR ) NSC #67574  
Source and Pharmacology : Vincristine is an alkaloid isolated from Vinca rosea Linn 
(periwinkle). It binds to tubulin, disrupting microtubules and inducing metaphase arrest. Its serum 
decay pattern is triphasic.  The initial, middle, and terminal half -lives are 5 minutes, 2.3 hours, 
and 85 hours respectively; however, the range of the terminal half -life in humans is from 19 to 
155 hours. The liver is the major excretory organ in humans and animals; about 80% of an 
injected dose of vincristine sulfate appears in the feces and 10% to 20% can be found in the 
urine. The p450 cytochro me involved with vincristine metabolism is CYP3A4. Within 15 to 30 
minutes after injection, over 90% of the drug is distributed from the blood into tissue, where it 
remains tightly, but not irreversibly bound.  It is excreted in the bile and feces. There is  poor CSF 
penetration.  
 
Toxicity:  
 Common  
Happens to 21 -100 children out 
of every 100  Occasional  
Happens to 5 -20 children out of

Unknown 
Frequency and 
Timing:  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of vincristine (eit her alone or in combination with other antineoplastic 
agents) have been noted in humans. The toxicities include: chromosome abnormalities, malformation, 
pancytopenia, and low birth weight. It is unknown whether the drug is excreted in breast milk.  
 
Formulation and Stability : 
Vincristine is supplied in 1 mL and 2 mL vials in which each mL contains vincristine sulfate 1 
mg (1.08  µmol) , mannitol 100 mg; SWFI; acetic acid and sodium acetate are added for pH 
control. The pH of vincristine sulfate injectio n, USP ranges from 3.5 to 5.5. This product is a 
sterile , preservative free solution. Store refrigerated at 2° -8°C or 36° -46°F. Protect from light and 
retain in carton until time of use.  
 
Do not mix with any IV solutions other than those containing dextros e or saline.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See Treatment  and Dose Modifications  sections of protocol.  
 
The World Health Organization, the Institute of Safe Medicine Practices (United States) and the 
Safety and Quality Council (Australia) all support the use of minibag rather than syringe for the 
infusion of vincristine. The delivery of vincristine via eithe r IV slow push or minibag is 
acceptable for COG protocols. Vincristine should NOT  be delivered to the patient at the same 
time with any medications intended for central nervous system administration. Vincristine is 
fatal if given intrathecally.  
 
Injection  of vincristine sulfate should be accomplished as per institutional policy. Vincristine 
sulfate must be administered via an intact, free -flowing intravenous needle or catheter. Care 
should be taken to ensure that the needle or catheter is securely within t he vein to avoid 
extravasation during administration. The solution may be injected either directly into a vein or 
into the tubing of a running intravenous infusion.  
 
Special precautions : FOR INTRAVENOUS USE ONLY.  
The container or the syringe containing vin CRIS tine must be enclosed in an overwrap bearing 
the statement “Do not remove covering until moment of injection. For intravenous use only - 
Fatal if given by other routes.”  
 
Medication errors have occurred due to confusion between vinCRIStine and vinBLASt ine. 
VinCRIStine VinCRIStine is available in a liposomal formulation (vinCRIStine sulfate 
liposomal injection, VSLI, Marqibo®). Use conventional vincristine only; the conventional and 
liposomal formulations are NOT interchangeable.

8.0 SUPPORTI VE CARE GUIDELINES  
 
Aggressive supportive care improves outcome, particularly in High Risk patient populations 
receiving very intensive therapy as incorporated in this trial. The following guidelines are intended 
to give general direction for optimal patie nt care and to encourage uniformity in the treatment of this 
study population. Investigators are requested to report unexpected or unusually severe 
complications to Study Chair . Please also see the supportive care manual developed by CCG/POG 
(Supportive Ca re of Children with Cancer, A Altman ed, 3rd ed).   
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 124 
 
8.1 General Guidelines  
Patients are recommended to have central venous access with either a totally implantable devide 
(port -a-cath) or a tunneled catheter (Broviac, Groshong or Hickman). The risks and b enefits 
associated with these devices should be discussed with the patient by members of the oncology 
and surgical care teams. The goal is to select a venous access catheter that will have the least 
likelihood of developing catheter -related complications f or each individual patient.  
 
8.1.1  Blood Components  
 
Blood products should be irradiated following current FDA guidelines found at: 
http://www.fda.gov/cber/gdlns/gamma.htm   
 
Investigators in Canadian institutions need to follow the CSA standards for Blood and Blood 
Components CAN/CSA -Z902 -04 issued in March 2004 and available at: http://www.shopcsa.ca .  
 
Red blood cells (RBCs)  
Transfusion with RBCs is indicated to correct severe or symptomatic anemia or acute blood loss. 
In the setting of extreme hyperleukocytosis investigators should be mindful that PRBC’s may 
contribute to hyperviscosity.  
 
Platelets  
Transfusion with platelets is indicated  to correct bleeding manifestations and may be indicated 
for severe thrombocytopenia without bleeding particularly in the setting of an invasive 
procedure.  
 
8.1.2  Infection Prophylaxis  
 
Pneumocystis carinii  
All patients should receive trimethoprim/sulfamet hoxazole (TMP/SMX) at a dose of TMP 5 
mg/kg/day divided bid three sequential days per week. For patient’s allergic to or experiencing 
excessive myelosuppression with TMP/SMX, alternative prophylaxis with dapsone (1 -2 
mg/kg/day, maximum dose 100  mg/day), ae rosolized pentamidine (300 mg/q month ≥ 5 years of 
age), or atovaquone (30  mg/kg/day if < 3 mo. or > 2 years, 45 mg/kg/day if between 3 mo. & 2 
years) may be considered.  
 
Varicella Vaccine  
May be given to the siblings of patients in remission and stable at  the physician’s discretion. 
Administration to the non -immune patients is not recommended.  
 
Gamma globulin  
If clinically indicated, IgG levels may be monitored throughout treatment. If the IgG level falls 
below age -determined normal levels, IVIG at 400 mg/ kg may be administered at the discretion 
of the investigator. Note of IVIG administration should be made on data form.

Azole antifungal agents (i.e. fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) given concurrently with 
vincristine may increase the risk of neurotoxicity. Investigator caution is advised if azole 
antifungals are used.   
 
8.1.3  Treatment of Established or Presumed Infections  
 
Fever with Neutropenia  
For patients with ANC < 500/µL and temperature between 38.0°C and 38.5°C twice in 12 hours, 
or ≥ 38.5°C, empiric parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics should be instituted after obtaining 
appropriate cultures. The risk of sepsis is higher during Induction and while the peripheral 
neutrophil count is falling rather than rising. The specific  choice of antibiotics to be used in 
empiric treatment of febrile neutropenia is dependent on each of your institution’s experience 
regarding the type of infecting organisms and their antibiotioc sensitivity patterns. Duration of 
therapy should be determin ed by site of infection (if identified), culture results, and response to 
treatment. If fever and neutropenia persist, systemic antifungal therapy with amphotericin B 
should be initiated after 3 -5 days. When severe mucositis or a sepsis syndrome is present  in 
patients with their initial febrile neutropenia, or a patient has a history of prior alpha hemolytic 
sepsis, consider inclusion of Vancomycin in the empiric antibiotic regimen.  
 
Primary Varicella Infection (Chickenpox)  
Patients should be treated prompt ly with acyclovir 1500 mg/m²/day intravenously divided q 8 
hours, and monitored closely for the development of invasive systemic disease.  
 
Empiric Management of Pulmonary Infiltrates  
Pulmonary infiltrates should be evaluated in the context of the patients clinical and laboratory 
profile. If the patient is not neutropenic, and the pulmonary lesions on CT scan are not 
particularly suggestive of a mold infection (Aspergillus, mucor), consider using broad spectrum 
antibiotics . If the patient develops progressiv ely worsening clinical or laboratory features then 
more aggressive diagnostic measures should be undertaken. Pulmonary infiltrates should then be 
evaluated with bronchoscopy and biopsy, lavage or open lung biopsy. If a procedure cannot be 
tolerated, begin empiric treatment with amphotericin B given89 the high likelihood of fungal 
disease during Induction. It is advisable to seek an infectious disease consult under these 
circumstances. Empiric cov erage should include treatment for gram -negative and positive 
bacteria, Legionella (erythromycin), Pneumocystis (TMP/SMX), and fungi 
(amphotericin/ambesome) pending culture results. If fungal pulmonary disease is documented, 
surveillance radiographic imagi ng studies of the sinuses, abdomen/pelvis and brain are indicated. 
Surgical excision of pulmonary lesions should be considered at the discretion of the treating 
physician. Treatment of fungal infections with amphotericin B and/or other antifungal agents 
will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Azole antifungal agents (i.e. fluconazole, 
itraconazole, voriconazole) given concurrently with vincristine may INCREASE the risk of 
neurotoxicity and myelosuppression.88,89 Investi gator caution is advised if azole antifungals 
are used.  
 
Management of Mucositis/Perirectal Cellulitis  
Mucositis should be managed with IV hydration and hyperalimentation if indicated, effective 
analgesia, broad -spectrum gram -positive and gram -negative ant ibiotic therapy and empiric 
antiviral and antifungal therapy as indicated. Management of perirectal cellulitis should include

Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 126 
broad -spectrum antibiotic therapy with dual gram -negative coverage as well as anaerobic 
coverage (i.e. ceftazidime + aminoglycosid e + metronidazole; or piperacillin -tazobactam + 
aminoglycoside), Sitz baths, a strong barrier technique and effective analgesia.  
 
8.1.4  Antiemetic Protection  
Antiemetics should be given as needed. The routine use of steroids is discouraged, including 
dexam ethasone, but may be appropriate in select patients with demonstrated intolerance to 
higher -dose chemotherapeutic agents.  
 
8.1.5  Use of Filgrastim  
The routine use of filgrastim is not generally recommended, but may be used at the discretion of 
the investig ator in situations of serious infection with neutropenia.  
 
8.2 Guidelines for Induction  
 
8.2.1  Acute Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
The risk for serious acute tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is usually restricted to the first 72 hrs after 
initiation of therapy; however, it m ay spontaneously occur prior to treatment. To manage the 
metabolic derangements caused by hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia and 
hypocalcemia, the following steps should be intiated:  
1. Begin allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg/m²/day in 3 divided doses and continue until 
peripheral blasts and extramedullary disease are reduced. In some situations it may be 
appropriate to use Rasburicase.  
2. Hydrate at 2400 -3000 mL/m²/day to maintain urine output > 1 00 mL/m²/hour until 
peripheral blasts and extramedullary disease are reduced.  
3. Alkalinize urine with NaHCO 3 20-40 mEq/L IV fluid to maintain urine pH between 6.5 and 
7.5. Alkalinization is not recommended when treating with Rasburicase.  
4. If the patient has o liguria or severe renal dysfunction, consider the use of Rasburicase at 
0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg/dose and obtaining a nephrology consult.  
5. While patients are on steroid therapy they should receive an H2 blocker.  
 
Refer also to the discussion of TLS in the Support ive Care Manual (Supportive Care of Children 
with Cancer, ed A Altman, 3rd edition, 2004)  
 
8.2.2  Induction – Infectious Complications  
Since steroid -containing 4 drug ALL inductions may be associated with higher rates of toxicity, 
investigators are cautione d to pay close attention to a number of factors during the early phases of 
treatment. Patients may experience profound myelosuppression and immune suppression during this 
time. Since prednisone may mask fever, as well as other components of the inflammator y response 
sepsis during Induction, the warning signs of septic shock may be associated with very mild and 
subtle symptoms. Caregivers must also be made aware that patients may experience very rapid 
clinical deterioration. This suggests the need for a supp ortive care network that can recognize and 
respond to sudden changes in a patient’s condition. In addition it should be noted that several 
serious toxic events have had an intestinal component. Patients with subtle GI symptoms should be 
monitored very clos ely.

In this population with High Risk ALL, rapidly assess patients clinically and by appropriate 
laboratory parameters for evidence of symptomatic hyperleukocytosis, tumor lysis syndrome, and 
coagulopathy. Patients at greatest risk will be those with WBC  > 100,000/ L and extramedullary 
disease. Suggested initial studies to be obtained prior to initiating antileukemia therapy include 
complete blood count (CBC), prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times, fibrinogen, 
D-dimer, and serum electroly tes, including creatinine, BUN, uric acid, phosphorous, and calcium. 
Continued monitoring of these studies should be carried out at suitable intervals until abnormalities 
have resolved or the risk has abated.

10.0 STATISTICAL CON SIDERATIONS  
 
10.1 Statistical  Design (Amendment #5)  
The anticipated number of newly diagnosed T -lineage ALL patients is estimated to be 230/year 
(~19/month). About 25% and 75% of T -lineage patients would be in the age/WBC defined NCI criteria 
for standard risk (age 1 -9 and WBC < 50 ,000/µL ) and high risk (age 10+ or WBC > 50 ,000/µL ) groups, 
respectively.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 128 
 
The long term EFS result in the overall T -lineage group in recent COG studies is approximately 80%, 
with the vast majority of EFS events occurring in the first three years. Unlike the pattern of outcome seen 
for B -precursor ALL, it is rare to see events occur beyond 4 years among patients with T -ALL. This 
outcome can be modeled reasonably well by a linear decreasing hazard rate with no appreciable risk of 
failure after completion of yea r 4. 
 
For this study, definitions of T -lineage risk groups have been chosen to conduct the study in a manner that 
provides appropriate treatment strategies for these different groups. The Low Risk subset of T -lineage is 
defined for this study as those who are age 1 -9.99 with WBC ≤ 50, 000/µL  (i.e., NCI standard risk), but 
who in addition have CNS1 status at diagnosis and have no testicular leukemia at diagnosis, who have a 
morphologic M1 marrow by Day 14, and who have MRD < 0.1% at end of Induction. We estim ate that 
this will result in approximately 18% of the overall T -lineage group being in the “Low Risk” group for 
this study. The “High Risk” subset for this study will be those patients with either M2 morphologic 
marrow status or MRD > 1% at the end of Indu ction. This group is estimated to be approximately 20% of 
the overall T -lineage group, leaving 62% in the “Intermediate Risk” subset.  
 
European data from the BFM group have suggested a poor outcome for T -lineage patients with MRD 
levels > 1%. Data from COG  studies on MRD status suggest that about 15% -20% of T -lineage patients 
will have MRD > 1% at end of Induction. However, insufficient follow -up is currently available to 
determine their ultimate EFS outcome. Data from COG studies suggest that most traditio nal prognostic 
factors in B -precursor ALL have minimal effect on outcome for T -lineage ALL. Patients in recent COG 
studies with M2 marrow status at the end of Induction had a 4 year EFS of 56%. It is expected there will 
be substantial overlap in the two cr iteria for High Risk (HR) status with many patients who are in both the 
MRD > 1% and end Induction marrow status of M2. We estimate that approximately 20% of patients will 
be High Risk by these combined criteria. We will assume that the 4 year EFS outcome for the High Risk 
subset is 56%. We also assume that the 4 year EFS for the Low Risk (LR) and Intermediate Risk (IR) 
subsets will be 92% and 84%, respectively. These assumptions would give an EFS of 80% for the overall 
T-lineage population which is reasona bly consistent with the observed results in recent COG studies. 
Since randomization in this study will occur after successful completion of Induction (about 2.5% are 
estimated to have either Induction death or M3 non -response), the EFS post -randomization w ill be a bit 
higher. The assumed EFS post -randomization for the 3 risk groups are 93%, 86% and 60% - resulting in 
an overall post -randomization 4 year EFS of approximately 82%.  
 
The basic therapy backbone for all the patients in this study will use the ABFM regimen. The 
initial design at the start of this study (safety phase) will involve a randomization at the 
completion of Induction for all patients achieving remission to two regimens that will differ only 
in the dose and schedule of MTX delivery: eith er HDMTX or CMTX. Children who are in the 
LR subset will be excluded from CNS irradiation and will be non -randomly assigned to regimens 
without Nelarabine throughout all stages of this study. IR patients will receive prophylactic CNS 
irradiation, but they will not receive Nelarabine during the safety phase of the study. During the 
safety phase, HR risk patients will be randomized to receive Nelarabine or no Nelarabine in 
addition to randomization to receive HDMTX or CMTX. Once sufficient accrual and follow -up 
is available (described in following section), an assessment of the toxicity profile for Nelarabine 
will be performed. If Nelarabine is found to be safe in the context of this treatment backbone and 
the MTX regimens, the initial study randomization to H DMTX vs. CMTX would be modified to 
a larger 2x2 randomization in an expanded efficacy phase which includes the IR risk patients.

T-cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Patients  
The T -NHL patients will be stratified separately on this study, and will also be analyzed 
separately without impacting the analyses for the T -ALL patients. The number of T -NHL 
patients to be accrued during the Efficacy Phase of AALL0434 is projected to be around 68/year. 
Adjusting for loss to randomizati on, about 35 patients/year will be classified as High Risk at the 
end of Induction and will be randomized to CMTX ± Nelarabine. Those classified as Standard 
Risk (17 patients/year) will be assigned to Arm A (CMTX, no Nelarabine). About 2 patients/year 
will be classified as Induction failures (no PR, CR or CR u by Day 29 of Induction) and will be 
assigned to Arm B (CMTX + Nelarabine). Over a 4 -year accrual period, approximately 140 High 
Risk patients will be accrued. There will be insufficient power for any f ormal comparison of 
outcomes between randomized regimens for these patients, but informal comparisons will be 
made. Outcome analyses for the 68 Standard Risk and 8 Induction Failure patients will 
essentially be descriptive due to small numbers.  
 
10.1.1  Study Re -design - (Amendment #9)  
Overall accrual rate (as of 09/30/2011) for the T -ALL patients has been around 256 per year over 
the past year compared to the projected 230/year in the protocol; and the actual loss to post -
Induction randomization/assignment is around 20% instead of the estimated 10%. In addition, 
the distribution of post -Induction risk assignments - Low risk (LR), Intermediate risk (IR), and 
High risk (HR) is currently 9%, 71%, and 20% respectively, differing from what was projected 
above (18 %, 62%, and 20% respectively). Due to this, the annual accrual rate to the MTX and 
nelarabine randomizations are currently the same – around 175 patients/year (compared to the 
prior estimates of 201 and 165 patients, respectively).  
 
Per the current design in the protocol, the MTX question is to accrue 1206 patients to ensure that 
we get the required 615 patients for the nelarabine randomization during that accrual duration. 
This results in the MTX randomization being well over -powered  at 91.6% power. This 
amendment modifies the statistical considerations for the 2 randomizations as detailed below in 
Section 10.3, in order to cater to the change in distribution of risk groups. The baseline event free 
survival (EFS) rates and detectable improvement in EFS remain the same as was originally 
specified. Both randomizations will have the same efficacy and futility monitoring procedures as 
was previously specified, using the updated expected total events for each.  
 
The annual accrual rate for T-NHL patients has also been higher than expected and is around 68 
patients per year. With the increased accrual rates for T -ALL and T -NHL, the target accrual on 
this study will be 1707, in order accrual of the required eligible, evaluable patients for stu dy 
objectives .

10.1.1.1 Study re -design (Amendment #11)  
On April  17th 2015,  following  review  of a planned  protocol  specified  interim  monitoring,  the Data Safety  
Monitoring  Committee  released  the results  of the randomized  comparison  of Capizzi  versus  High  Dose  
Methotrexate  (HDM)  regimens  on study.  Per protocol  specified  interim  monitoring  4-year disease -free 
survival  rates (DFS)  are 92.5%  (SE 1.8%)  for the CM regimen  vs. 86.1%  (SE 2.4%)  for the HDM  regimen  
(p = 0.0173).  Although  the efficacy  monitoring  boundary  (was not crossed  (the p-value  is equal  to the 
boundary),  the conditional  probability  of proving  HDMTX  is superior  to CMTX  given  the current  data 
(12/31/2015  data freeze),  was very small  (<0.0001).  The baseline  outcomes  for patients  on this study  are 
higher  than projected.  Hence  the expected  total number  of events  for both the MTX  randomization  and the 
Nelarabine  randomization  are lower  than projected  in the original  study  design.  This amendment  is to 
update  the study  design  to reflect  the lower  expected  event  horizon  for the Nelarabine  randomization  (which  
would  impact  the interim  monitoring  for outcomes . The details  of the redesign  done  by an independent  
statistician  who does not have knowledge  of the interim results  for the nelarabine  randomization  and was 
provided  with the updated  event  rate for the control  arm, are provided  in section  10.3.2  below.  
 
 
10.1.2  Amended study accrual (Amendment #10)  
The total target accrual for the study has been increased from 1707 to 1900 patients. This 
increase is necessary in order to get the required eligible, evaluable patients (as given in Section 
10.3.1  below) for the  Methotrexate and Nelarabine post -induction randomizations. The reasons 
for this increase in projected total accrual, are: a) The projected accrual rates for T -ALL and T -
NHL on study were 256 and 68 patients per year, respectively while the actual rates (a s of 
9/9/2013) are 247 and 86 patients per year. The T -NHL patients do not participate in the two 
randomized study questions, but their increased accrual rate has taken up accrual slots that would 
have been taken otherwise by T -ALL patients who would likel y get randomized. b) The loss at 
the end of induction to the post -induction randomizations was higher (24%) than that projected 
(20%). c) The actual accrual rates for each of the randomizations are both around 
145 patients/year as opposed to the projected rates (175 pts/year). Based on data as of 9/9/2013, 
an additional 115 patients are needed for EACH of the post -induction randomizations. This 
translates to about 270 (200 T -ALLs, 70 T -NHLs) enrollments to the overall study (adjusting for 
losses end of indu ction and for the 30 patients currently on induction therapy yet to be risk 
assigned). As of 9/9/2013, 77 accrual slots were still available before current target accrual of 
1707 is met. Hence the required increase in target accrual is by 193 (270 -77), to give a new 
target accrual of 1900. The study is projected to meet the new accrual target by September 2014. 
No changes are required to any of the statistical analyses plans and power calculations given in 
the following sections.  
 
10.2 Nelarabine Toxicity Assessment and Duration of Safety and Efficacy Phases   
The initial assessment of Nelarabine toxicity will occur for the first 20 HR patients receiving 
Nelarabine with 10 in both the HDMTX and CMTX regimens. An adequate period of follow -up 
in these patients  is necessary to judge the toxicity. The delivery of Nelarabine starts in the first 
week of the Consolidation phase (at 6 weeks from study entry) and the last dose will be given at 
week 60, which is early in Maintenance. During the evaluation period for th e Safety Phase, HR 
patients will continue to randomize to all four treatment arms. This approach will allow us to 
gain further experience with Nelarabine in HR patients. We will evaluate the HR patients in the 
Safety Phase of the study at approximately 8  weeks following the week 36 dose of Nelarabine 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 131 
(through week 43 in the Maintenance phase). The rationale for choosing this time -point is that it 
will allow patients to have resolved radiation -induced somnolence syndrome and other 
potentially confounding neu rotoxicities. It has been our experience on AALL00P2 that 
Nelarabine toxicities occurred acutely after exposure and we do not anticipate significant 
additional Nelarabine toxicities occurring after the Week 43 observational time point. In 
addition, this wi ll shorten the time interval for follow -up required before proceeding to the 
Efficacy Phase. Based on the anticipated annual accrual rate, we estimate that it will take about 
12 months to obtain this initial cohort of 20  HR patients randomized to Nelarabin e. Then an 
additional 10 months after the last of this group is entered will be needed to reach the time in 
Maintenance with adequate follow -up for toxicity assessment. The HR patients receiving 
Nelarabine will be compared directly to their randomized HR c ontrols who are not receiving 
Nelarabine with the comparison further stratified by the methotrexate regimen received. These 
toxicity analyses and any recommendations from the ALL Steering Committee regarding the 
opening of the Nelarabine randomization to t he IR subset will be provided to the COG DSMC 
for their review and approval before any decision to open the randomization further. If results at 
this first toxicity comparison require additional patient entries for further assessment, the original 
randomiz ation to Nelarabine will continue in just the HR patients. If this second stage of toxicity 
assessment is needed, it will take place at approximately one year after the initial assessment, at 
which time a decision to either open or not open the Nelarabine randomization to include the IR 
patients will occur. The total planned length of the safety phase HR randomization is intended to 
not exceed 3 years. HR T -ALL patients will continue to be randomized for the Nelarabine 
question throughout the safety phase.  
 
10.3 Primary Treatment Comparisons and Statistical Power (Amendment #9)   
The primary endpoint for the study analyses and the endpoint used for the subsequent power 
calculations is event -free survival (EFS) following initial remission since randomization o ccurs 
after Induction. EFS events include any type of relapse, death in remission or second malignant 
neoplasm. Since CNS relapse has been an important event in many studies of T -lineage patients, 
that outcome will be a secondary endpoint which will be exa mined for various treatment regimen 
comparisons, and in the subset of patients who will not receive XRT CNS prophylaxis. “Intent -
to-treat” analyses (i.e. based on the regimen to which patients are initially randomized) will be 
the primary approach used to assess treatment efficacy.  
 
The following calculations allow for a 2.5% failure rate in Induction (the combined M3 non -
response rate and Induction death rate) and a 10% rate of randomization refusal. This provides 
201 patients per year (approximately 36 LR , 125 IR and 40 HR) who will be available for the 
MTX randomization after allowing for the attrition due to Induction failure and those who refuse 
randomization. The planned study accrual duration will be approximately 6 years providing a 
total of 1206 pat ients who will be randomized to HDMTX versus CMTX. The power calculation 
for this comparison is based on a 2 -sided log rank test (alpha = 0.05) with the first analysis 
occurring when approximately 20% of the expected events from the projected EFS event hor izon 
have occurred. Four subsequent analyses will occur at approximately 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% 
of the expected event total. A t2 spending function for the stopping boundary (with truncation at 
3 standard deviations) will be used to allocate greater import ance to the later analyses. For the 
MTX comparison, the long term EFS baseline outcome in these patients is expected to be 82% at 
4 years. In this study, a clinically important difference is assumed to be an improvement to 89% 
EFS which represents a relati ve EFS event reduction of approximately 41% for the better 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 132 
regimen (viz., relative hazard rate, RHR = 0.587). The event horizon is calculated using the 
previous EFS outcome assumptions and assuming an accrual of 6 years with a follow -up of 3 
years after th e last patient is randomized. For this situation, one would expect a total of 174 EFS 
events which results in a cumulative power to detect a difference by the last analysis of 91.6%. 
The z -value upper and lower monitoring boundaries for the 5 looks at the data are ± 3, 2.744, 
2.477, 2.281, and 2.115. If a slightly smaller improvement to 88% EFS occurs (RHR = 0.644), 
the cumulative power to detect a difference by the last analysis would be 80.4%.  
 
Upon completion of the study, smaller differences in EFS outc ome than those described above 
might occur. In that case, it would still be useful to identify which of the 2 methotrexate 
treatment approaches might be selected for use in future T -ALL studies. Part of this selection 
process would involve the overall comp arison of toxicity and complications data for HDMTX 
and CMTX, but another part of the evaluation would relate to the final EFS results for the 
regimens. If the final EFS efficacy comparison described above does not achieve the 
conventional significance lev el used (overall alpha = 0.05), the regimens would also be 
compared using a more liberal significance criterion (p ≤ 0.20) to choose which regimen is 
better. With this criterion and the sample size for the methotrexate randomization, true EFS 
differences in the neighborhood of 4% would permit identification of the better regimen with 
high probability. For example, if on e of the methotrexate regimens has an EFS of 82% and the 
other has an EFS of 86%, the probability that the better regimen is selected would be .852 and 
the probability that the poorer regimen would be selected is only 0.003 (with a .145 probability 
that no  regimen would be selected based on the criterion being used). The table below (Table 1) 
shows that the selection rates remain reasonably stable for this 4% EFS difference if the baseline 
outcome departs somewhat from the assumed 82%. If a slightly smaller  EFS difference of 3% 
occurs (with one regimen at 82% and the other at 85%), the selection probabilities are still in a 
reasonable range with the probability that the better regimen is selected being 0.737 and the 
probability that the poorer regimen would be selected is 0.001. Of course, this type of 
comparison would need to be considered in conjunction with the toxicity and complications 
analysis in order to decide which regimen is preferable to the other for choice in a future study.

The power calculation for the randomized Nelarabine versus no Nelarabine comparison is based 
on a  
1-sided log rank test (alpha = 0.05) since we wish to see if the addition of Nelarabine improves 
the outcome of T -lineage patients. The Nelarabine comparison will also have 5 planned analyses 
of the data and utilize the same type of t2 spending function. The following calculations assume a 
3 year period of randomization to the Nelarabine question for the HR subset before the 
randomization is expanded to include the IR group. If the study duration is approximately 6 
years, this would eventually result in about 615 patients randomized to this comparison (240 HR 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 133 
patients over 6 years, 375 IR patients over 3 y ears). Since the more favorable LR subset of T -
lineage patients will be excluded from this randomization (i.e., those who are aged 1 -10 years 
and CNS1 and no testicular disease and RER and MRD - are excluded), the assumed long term 
EFS outcome in this group  of patients is assumed to be 76% at 4 years (resulting from the above 
mixture of the IR and HR groups). A clinically important difference is an improvement to 85% 
EFS, representing a relative EFS event reduction of approximately 41% for the better regimen  
(viz., RHR = 0.592). The number of expected EFS events with 3 years of follow -up after the last 
randomized patient is enrolled would be 119 events. In this situation, the cumulative power to 
detect a difference by the last analysis is 85.9%. The 1 -sided z -value monitoring boundaries for 
the 5 looks at the data are 2.878, 2.470, 2.200, 1.982 and 1.790. If the IR patients can be enrolled 
sooner than 3 years into the study because the Nelarabine safety is established before that time, 
this would increase the statistical power figures given above.  
 
With the planned study duration, there should also be reasonable statistical power to examine 
some of the treatment differences within the risk group subsets. This would be of particular 
interest for the Nelarabine r andomization. In the HR subset, the cumulative power to detect a 
change in EFS outcome from 60% to 75% (RHR = 0.563) would be 77.2%. For the IR subset the 
power to detect a change in EFS outcome will be less since those patients would only begin 
enrollment  after the safety phase is completed. For example, in the IR subset the power to detect 
a change in EFS outcome from 86% to 93% (RHR = 0.481) for the Nelarabine regimen 
comparison would be 68.4%.  
 
Secondary comparisons of the incidence of CNS relapse will be examined. This will be 
performed for the comparison of the 2 MTX regimens and also for comparing Nelarabine versus 
no Nelarabine. Comparison of overall survival (OS) will also be a secondary endpoint for the 
regimen comparisons.  
 
Based on the treatment regimens chosen for this design and experience with factorial designs in 
numerous other COG ALL studies, the occurrence of an important statistical interaction effect on 
EFS for the 2 main treatment factors is thought to be unlikely. Hence, the preceding p ower 
calculations are based on the assumption that the stratified analysis of either factor across levels 
of the other factor will allow the “pooled” analysis to be valid. However, analyses will be 
performed regularly to assess the possibility of an intera ction effect (using a Cox regression 
likelihood ratio test) which will assess the four individual treatment regimens in the 2 x 2 design 
to see if a non -proportional hazards effect occurs for the combinations of the two main effect 
factors. If strong evide nce exists for the presence of a statistical interaction of the MTX and 
Nelarabine regimens, then separate analyses of a regimen effect would need to be done within 
each level of the other treatment factor. This would result in substantial attenuation of t he 
statistical power and might necessitate extension of the study duration to achieve better power to 
detect treatment differences.  
 
Since the comparison of the methotrexate regimens utilizes a selection type analysis, no futility 
testing will be used for that comparison. However, futility testing boundaries will be used for the 
comparison of “Nelarabine” versus “No Nelarabine” to decide if stopping should occur for 
similarity of outcome. This will be tested with a Pampallona -Tsiatis type lower monitoring 
boundary when approximately 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% of the EFS event information is 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 134 
available. This boundary has the property that the probability of rejecting H A (i.e. relative hazard 
of 0.5237 favoring Nelarabine) when H A is true is 5%. The z -values corresp onding to stopping 
for futility at the four interim analyses are -1.595, -0.656, +0.021 and +0.584, respectively.  
 
The proportional hazards assumption underlying the log rank test appears to have been 
reasonably valid for the treatments studied in many pre vious COG trials in ALL. However, that 
assumption for this trial will be regularly examined at the times the treatment regimens are 
compared. Should it not appear valid, other statistics will be used for comparing treatment 
outcome (e.g., cure model statis tics and/or 4 -year EFS comparisons).  
 
If during the conduct of the trial, results emerge which establish the superiority of one of the 
regimens for a particular comparison in the factorial design (i.e., either for the methotrexate 
regimen comparison or for  the Nelarabine comparison), the entire study would not be stopped. In 
this case, the study will continue the randomization for the remaining comparison with all 
additional patients assigned to the better regimen for the part of the randomization which was  
terminated.  
 
10.3.1  Study Re -design Power Calculations (Amendment #9)  
The distribution of post -Induction risk assignments - Low risk (LR), Intermediate risk (IR), and 
High risk (HR) is currently 9%, 71%, and 20% respectively, differing from what was proje cted 
above (18%, 62%, and 20% respectively). Due to this, the annual accrual rate to the MTX and 
nelarabine randomizations are currently the same – around 175 patients/year (compared to the 
prior estimates of 201 and 165 patients, respectively). The update d power calculations reflecting 
this, and interim monitoring rules are given below.  
 
MTX randomization : Using a 2 -sided alpha of 5%, there is power of 85.3%, to detect an 
improvement in 4 -year EFS from 82% to 89%. A total of 980 patients will be accrued ( total 
expected events: 142) with minimum followup of 3 years. As of 09/30/2011 a total of 580 
patients have already been accrued to this randomization. Hence the remaining 400 patients can 
be accrued to this post -Induction randomization over 2.3 years (pro jected study closure date of 
02/01/2014 instead of the currently projected date of 04/15/2015). Overall, a total of 605 patients 
will be enrolled at study entry during this time period, to give 590 eligible, evaluable patients for 
the post -Induction random izations/treatment assignments. Interim analyses will be done as 
specified earlier in Section 10.3 , with the first analysis occurring when approximately 20% of the 
expected events from the projected EFS event hori zon have occurred. Four subsequent analyses 
will occur at approximately 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of the expected event total. A t2 spending 
function for the stopping boundary (with truncation at 3 standard deviations) will be used to 
allocate greater importa nce to the later analyses. Since the comparison of the methotrexate 
regimens utilizes a selection type analysis, no futility testing will be used for that comparison.  
 
Nelarabine randomization : With a 1 -sided alpha of 5%, there is 85.9% power, to detect an  
improvement in 4 -year EFS from 76% to 85%. The total number of patients required is the same 
as currently specified in Section 10.3  (615 patients) (total expected events: 119) with minimum 
followup of 3 years. As  of 09/30/2011 a total of 215 patients have been accrued to this 
randomization. Hence the remaining 400  patients can also be accrued over 2.3 years as specified 
for the MTX randomization. The Nelarabine comparison will also have 5 planned interim 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 135 
analyses of the data for efficacy (at 20%, 40%, 60%, and 100% information) and utilize the same 
type of t2 spending function as for the MTX randomization.  
 
Futility testing boundaries will be used for the comparison of “Nelarabine” versus “No 
Nelarabine” to decide if stopping should occur for similarity of outcome. This will be tested with 
a Pampallona -Tsiatis type lower monitoring boundary when approximately 20%, 40%, 60% and 
80% of the EFS event information is available. This boundary has the property that the 
probability of rejecting H A (i.e. relative hazard of 0.5237 favoring Nelarabine) when H A is true is 
5%. The z -values corresponding to stopping for futility at the 4 interim analyses are -1.595, -
0.656, +0.021 and +0.584, respectively.  
 
10.3.2 Study Re -design Power Calculations for Nelarabine randomization (Amendment #11)  
The study closed to accrual on 07/25/2014. Total expected accrual for the study was determined based 
on estimating losses during/at the end of induction and the required sample sizes for the t wo randomized 
study questions. Due to a lower rate of loss than projected, a higher number of (n= 659) patients than the 
projected 615 were randomized to +/ - nelarabine. A total of 336 and 323 patients were randomized to no 
nelarabine vs. nelarabine regime ns. 
 
It is assumed that the 336 and 323 patients randomized to the two arms were accrued uniformly 
during the  3.83 years (from 9/22/2010 to 7/25/2014) when the efficacy phase of the nelarabine 
randomization was open, with a minimum follow up of 3 years. As suming a cure rate model for 
each arm that has exponential distribution for the first four years and reaches a plateau at 4 
years; accounting for 5 interim analyses (using an alpha t2 spending function) at approximate 
20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%, there is 80% power to detect improvement in 4 -year EFS from 
82% to 89% (93 events) with a one sided significance level of 0.05. Given the additional 
expected toxicities due to the addition of nelarabine, 7% is considered to be a clinically 
meaningful improvement in  outcome to plan for. Three interim analyses for efficacy have 
already occurred thus far. The next planned interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be 
conducted at 80% information (74 events). Final analysis will be conducted when the specified 
even t horizon (93 events) is reached or when the last patient randomized to +/ - nelarabine has 3 
years of follow -up, whichever comes first.  
 
10.4 Toxicity Assessment and Monitoring   
Neurological toxicities are of special concern with Nelarabine. The toxicities  for the Nelarabine 
patients will be examined in two primary ways: First, they will be compared directly to their 
randomized control not receiving Nelarabine with additional examination of the comparison 
within the separate methotrexate regimen subsets. Th ese comparisons will focus on Grade 3 or 
higher non -hematologic toxicities. Next, the overall incidence of selected neurologic toxicities 
will also be monitored since these represent an important target category for Nelarabine toxicity 
(see Section 7.3 ). 
 
For toxicity monitoring rules related to Nelarabine, any death clearly attributable to Nelarabine will lead 
to closure of the Nelarabine randomization with subsequent review and consideration given to re -opening 
the randomization at a lower dose and/or restricting patient entry to only those with High Risk disease. A 
second monitoring rule will look for 10% Grade 4 or 20% Grade 3 peripheral neuropathies that fail to 
resolve within one week, attributable to Nelarab ine and not matched by a similar neurologic toxicity rate 
on the regimens without Nelarabine. Should this occur, it will lead to a temporary closure of the 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 136 
randomization with consideration to be given to re -opening the randomization at a lower dose and/or 
restricting patient entry to only those with High Risk disease.  
 
Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis (CNS3) might be at higher risk of neurologic problems with 
Nelarabine. Thus, specific toxicity comparisons of this small group will be examined for the randomized 
Nelarabine and no Nelarabine regimens, and those analyses will be provided together with the regular 
overall study toxicity assessments.  
 
Detailed toxicity data as described above will be regularly provided to the COG DSMC at each of their 
twice  yearly meetings and an ad hoc  basis as required for judging the safety of Nelarabine.  
 
10.4.1   Amended monitoring for toxic deaths (Amendment # 10)  
A formal statistical monitoring rule for toxic deaths attributed to Nelarabine, during post 
Induction therapy is given below. Based on the rule given in Section 10.4  above, on 09/05/2012, 
accrual to the study and randomization to Nelarabine was suspended following a death during 
consolidation of a patie nt assigned to the Nelarabine + HDMTX arm. The AALL0434 study 
committee reviewed the data on Nelarabine related toxicities. Although there was one death 
related to Nelarabine, there were only two other nervous system toxicities (1 Grade 3 seizure and 
1 Gra de 3 somnolence) for which attribution to Nelarabine was scored as possible , and none that 
were scored as probable or definite among over 180 patients randomized /assigned to receive 
Nelarabine on study. The rate of neurological toxicities is well below th e level defined as 
concerning in Section 10.4 . The COG DSMC reviewed the data and approved re -opening 
randomization/assignment of patients on study to Nelarabine containing arms as in the original 
study design. The DSMC also recommended at the time that with the next amendment a more 
formal monitoring rule for deaths related to Nelarabine be added to the statistical consideration. 
Of note, no additional deaths attributed to Nelarabine have occurred after the sole  death that 
occurred in September 2012.  
 
The death rate related to Nelarabine during post -Induction therapy will be closely monitored. 
About 335 patients will be randomized or assigned to Nelarabine containing regimens for post 
Induction therapy on this study. If four remission deaths attributed to Nelarabine occur, then the 
Nelarabine randomization will be temporarily closed to accrual. The deaths will be reviewed by 
the study committee and the COG data safety monitoring committe e, and a decision made with 
respect to possible therapy modifications and reopening the randomization or permanent closure 
of the Nelarabine randomization. With this rule, the probability of stopping is 9% if the true toxic 
death rate is 0.5%. The probabil ity of stopping is 90% if the true toxic death rate due to 
Nelarabine is 2%.  
 
10.5 Analysis and Monitoring of Special Patient Subsets  
There are various patient subsets in this study that will be examined regularly. These subsets 
were selected either because the AALL0434 treatment is very different than in previous studies 
for the subset, or the subset is of interest for other reasons.  
 
Patients in the LR subset:  
The outcome of the Low Risk patients who do not receive prophylactic CNS irradiation will be 
contrasted to the historical control experience from recent studies of T -lineage ALL that 
provided such treatment (POG 9404).  
 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 137 
SER patients:  
Since SER patients in this study will not receive a second DI phase and previously treated SER 
T-lineage patient s in the CCG -1961 study received 2 DI phases, a comparison of outcome for 
this subset will be made with that historical control.  
 
Induction failure patients:  
In this study, patients failing Induction with an M3 marrow continue to stay on the study and 
they will receive Nelarabine+HDMTX in a Consolidation phase which might be followed 
thereafter by BMT.  This subset is expected to be a very small group based on the M3 rate at end 
of Induction for the CCG -1961 T -ALL patients receiving the ABFM chemotherapy (1 .2%). Only 
very limited data is available from previous COG studies about these patients such as the 
survival outcome following Induction failure. Thus, examination of outcome for this group will 
be primarily descriptive, but their toxicity experience will  be examined separately and their 
survival outcome will be compared to a similar group of patients treated on previous studies.  
 
10.6 Analyses of Gender and Ethnicity  
Using national incidence data (SEER, 1986 -1990) one can calculate the sex ratio incidenc e for 
male: female cases in childhood ALL to be approximately 1.24 for ages 0 -14 or 1.31 for ages 0 -
19.91 Data from recent COG trials (CCG -1950/60s) show that the ratio of male to female patients 
entered on ALL trials is 1.31:1, so the ALL population registered by COG institutions is in 
excellent agreement with national data for the relative incidence of ALL by sex group. In the 
subset of patients to be treated in this T -lineage ALL study the estimated sex ratio is 2.32:1 since 
the male: female sex ratio is much higher in T -lineage ALL  which is known to have a male 
predominance. National data for the ethnicity distribution of the overall US population (1986 -
1990) suggests that 84.3% of the overall US population are white, 12.2% are black, and 3.5% are 
non-white, non -black.91 The relative ethnicity distribution in T -lineage childhood ALL (from the 
CCG -1950/60s series of studies) was 77.4% whites, 6.0% blacks, 11.0% Hispanics, 3.3% Asians, 
and 2.3% “other”. Using the SEER classification of race, probably most of the Hispanics in the 
COG racial category classification would be classified as “whites”. These data suggest that the 
racial composition of patients entered in COG ALL trials is similar to what would be expected 
from national incidence data. One would expect this to be the case since some reports have 
suggested that 80% -90% of children in the US diagnosed with ALL are enrolled on COG trials.  
 
As has been done in previous COG ALL trials, analyses of effects of sex group and ethnicity on 
outcome will be examined for this study. Extensive data exists in the literatu re showing that for 
all children with ALL, females generally have a better prognosis than males.92-94 However, it is 
less clear that this effect also occurs in T -lineage ALL (viz., for the CCG -1950/60s series it was 
a non -significant difference, p = 0.42, relativ e event rate for males 1.18 times that for females). 
Numerous reports also exist suggesting certain types of outcome differences by racial category 
for childhood ALL. The most consistent theme in these reports is a somewhat poorer outcome 
for black patient s as compared to whites.95,96 The size of this difference is in the neighborhood of 
10%-15% lower EFS at late periods of follow -up. Again it is not clear that this is the case in T -
lineage ALL (v iz., for the CCG -1950/60s blacks had a non -significant difference in EFS 
compared to whites with a relative event rate for blacks of only 1.19 times that in whites). With a 
sex ratio of male: female patients in T -lineage patients of approximately 2.32, the  overall size of 
the AALL0434 study (N = 1900 patients) will provide adequate statistical power in this study to 
examine any overall prognostic difference in outcome by sex. Examination of prognostic 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 138 
differences in ethnicity categories will be more of a pr oblem because of the relatively small 
proportions for some ethnicity groups, resulting in adequate statistical power only for larger 
differences in outcome for certain comparisons. However, analyses will be performed for both 
gender and ethnicity outcome d ifferences recognizing the above statistical analysis caveats. No a 
priori evidence exists suggesting that the therapies to be used in this study will have differing 
effects on either gender groups or ethnicity categories. Nevertheless, examination of diff erent 
prognostic patterns for sex group or racial category outcome according to treatment regimen will 
be examined and statistical tests for interaction effects will be used. However, the small subsets 
that will result for some comparisons and the multiple  comparison nature of this type of analysis 
will require cautious interpretation of any findings.

11.0 EVALUATI ON CRI TER IA  
 
11.1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  
This study will utilize the CTCAE of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for toxicity and 
performance reporting.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised CTCAE version 
4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting beginning J uly 1, 2011. All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 which can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site ( http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Additionally, t oxicities are to be reported on the 
appropriate data collection forms.  
 
11.2 Response Criteria for T -ALL  
See definitions in Section 3.3 . 
 
11.3 Response Criteria for T -NHL  
 
11.3.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Defined as disappe arance of all evidence of disease from all sites for at least 4 weeks. This will 
be determined by physical exam and appropriate imaging studies. Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy

12.0 ADVERSE EVENT R EPORTING REQUIRE MENT S  
 
12.1 Purpose  
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every cli nical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents. Certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patie nt safety and care. The following sections 
provide information about expedited reporting.  
 
12.2 Determination of reporting requirements  
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations: 1) whether the patient has 
received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the characteristics of the adverse event 
including the Grade  (severity), the relationship to the study therapy  (attribution), and the prior 
experience  (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (1, 2, or 3) of the trial; and 4) 
whether or not hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization was associated with the event.  
 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New Drug 
Application (IND). In some instances, the investigational agent  may be available commercially, 
but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved package label.  
 
Commercial agents  are those agents not provided under an IND but obtained instead from a 
commercial source. The NCI, rather than a co mmercial distributor, may on some occasions 
distribute commercial agents for a trial.  
 
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agents, the following rules apply.  
• Concurrent administration : When an investigational agent is used in combinat ion 
with a commercial agent, the combination is considered to be investigational and 
expedited reporting of adverse events would follow the guidelines for 
investigational agents.  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 140 
• Sequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent and  a 
commercial agent on the same study arm, but the commercial agent is given for a 
period of time prior to starting the investigational agent, expedited reporting of 
adverse events which occur prior to starting the investigational agent would follow 
the gu idelines for commercial agents. Once therapy with the investigational agent is 
initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events follow the investigational agent 
reporting guidelines.  
 
Secondary Malignancy  
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by tr eatment for a previous malignancy (eg, treatment with 
investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A metastasis of the initial neoplasm is not 
considered a secondary malignancy.  
 
All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment  need to be reported via AdEERS. Three 
options are available to describe the event:  
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy   
• Myelodysplastic syndrome  
• Treatment related secondary malignancy  
 
12.3 Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be report ed in an expedited manner  
 
Step 1 : Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) [use 
version 4.0 beginning 07/01/11] . 
 
The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCA E) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting and are located on the 
CTEP website at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm .  All approp riate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.  
 
Step 2 : Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE.  
 
Step 3 : Determine the attribution of adverse event in relation to the protocol therapy. Attribution 
categories are: Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.  
 
Step 4 : Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.    
Expected events for a CTEP IND agent are defined as those listed in the ASAEL 
(Agent Specific Adverse Event List), a subset of the CAEPR (Comprehensive Advers e 
Event and Potential Risks). For investigational agents that are not commercially available 
and are being studied under a company’s IND, expected AEs are usually based on the 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
Unexpected  events for a CTEP IND agent are defined as those NOT listed in the

Step 5 : Review Tables A and/or B  in this section to determine if:  
 
• there are any p rotocol -specific requirements for expedited reporting of specific 
adverse events that require special monitoring ; and/or  
• there are any protocol -specific  exceptions  to the reporting requirements.  
 
Step 6 : Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included an 
investigational agent, a commercial agent, or a combination of investigational and commercial 
agents.   
 
Note:  If the patient received at least one dose of investigational age nt, follow the guidelines in 
Table A. If no investigational agent was administered, follow the guidelines in Table B.  
 
12.4 Reporting methods  
 
• Use the NCI’s Adverse Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS). The NCI’s 
guidelines for AdEERS can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/default.htm  
 
 An AdEERS report must be submitted by the following method:  
 
 Electronically submit the report via the AdEERS Web -based application located 
at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_a pplications/adeers.htm  
 
• Fax supporting documentation for AEs related to investigational agents  to: 
o The NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND only (fax # 301 -230-0159)  
o and to COG for all studies (fax# 626 -303-1768 ; email: 
COGAdEERS@childrensoncologygroup.org ; Attention: COG A dEERS 
Coordinator).  
 
• DO NOT send the supporting documentation for AEs related to commercial 
agents to the NCI. Fax or email this material to COG  (fax # 626 -303-1768 ; email: 
COGAdEERS@childrensoncologygr oup.org ; A ttention: COG A dEERS 
Coordinator).  
 
• ALWAYS include the ticket number on all faxed documents.  
 
• Use the NCI protocol number and the protocol -specific patient ID provided 
during  trial registration on all reports.  
 
12.5 When to report an event in an expedited manner  
 
• Some adverse events require notification within 24 hours  (refer to Table A) to NCI 
via the web based application and/or by telephone call to the Study Chair . 
 
In the rare situation where Internet connectivity is disrupted, the 24 -hour notification 
is to be made to the NCI for agents supplied under a CTEP IND  by telephone call to

Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 142 
301-897-7497. In addition, once Internet connectivity is restored, a 24 -hour 
notific ation that was phoned in must be entered into the electronic AdEERS system 
by the original submitter of the report at the site.  
 
• Submit the report within 5 calendar  days  of learning of the event.  
 
12.6 Other recipients of adverse event reports  
COG will for ward reports and supporting documentation to the Study Chair , to the FDA (when 
COG holds the IND) and to the pharmaceutical company (for industry sponsored trials).  
 
Adverse events determined to be reportable must also be reported according to the local p olicy 
and procedures to the Institutional Review Board responsible for oversight of the patient.  
 
12.7 Reporting of Adverse Events for investigational  agents – AdEERS 24 -hour notifications , 
and complete report requirements .

Report all Grade 3 and higher infection toxi cities.  
 
Report all osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) Grade 1 and greater that has been confirmed 
by imaging. If a new site of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) is diagnosed during a 
subsequent reporting period please report each occurrence of toxicity o n the AE form and 
the Osteonecrosis (Avascular Necrosis) Data Form again for the reporting period during 
which the new site of toxicity was identified. Likewise, during subsequent reporting periods 
submit these forms if toxicity grade increases, and also i f an orthopedic surgical procedure 
is performed.  
 
If the patient is off protocol therapy and has a newly diagnosed osteonecrosis (avascular 
necrosis)  or develops a new site of osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis)  the Osteonecrosis 
(Avascular Necrosis) CRF should be completed.

14.0 RADIATION THERA PY GUIDELINES  
Radiation Therapy for patients on COG protocols can only be delivered at approved COG RT 
facilities (per COG administrative policy 3.9)  
 
 
 
All Intermediate and High Risk T -ALL patients randomized to Arms C (HD MTX) and D (HD 
MTX + Nel) will receive prophylactic cranial radiation therapy (CRT) (1200 cGy) starting on 
Day 50 of Delayed Intensification (DI) . All Intermediate and High Risk T -ALL p atients 
randomized to Arms A (CMTX) and B (CMTX + Nel) will receive prophylactic cranial radiation 
therapy (CRT) (1200 cGy) during Weeks 3 and 4 (Arm A) and Weeks 4 and 5 (Arm B) of 
Consolidation . All T -ALL patients who were CNS 3 at diagnosis will receive  CRT (1800 cGy) 
starting on Day 50 of DI. T -ALL patients with testicular disease at diagnosis that has not 
resolved by end Induction (biopsy is required  if there is any uncertainty regarding clinical 
response) will receive testicular irradiation (2400 cGy)  during Consolidation. T -ALL patients 
with testicular disease at diagnosis that resolves by end -Induction will not receive testicular 
irradiation. No patients with Low Risk T -ALL or T -NHL disease will receive radiation therapy.  
 
14.1 Cranial Irradiation  
 
14.1.1  Equipment and Calibration  
 
14.1.1.1  Modality  
X-ray beams with a nominal energy between 4 and 6 MV. The use of IMRT is not permitted in 
this study.  
 
14.1.1.2  Calibration  
Calibrations of therapy units used in this protocol will be verified by the Rad iological Physics 
Center (RPC).  
 
14.1.2  Target Volume  
Target volume consists of entire brain and meninges, including frontal lobe as well as posterior 
halves of globes of eyes, with optic disk and nerve, extending superior to vertex and posterior to 
occipu t. Caudal border will be below skull base at C2 vertebral level.  
 
The target volume shall be defined by means of a CT simulator or conventional simulator. Care 
must be taken to avoid shielding the posterior orbit and cribriform plate. In case of convention al 
simulation, radio -opaque markers should be placed on the surface of the fleshy canthus to aid in 
localizing this point.  
 
14.1.3  Target Dose  
 
14.1.3.1  Prescription Point  Timing of p rotocol therapy administration, response assessment studies, and surgical interventions are based on 
schedules derived from the experimental design or on established standards of care. Minor unavoidable departures 
(up to 72 hours) from protocol directed th erapy and/or disease evaluations (and up to 1 week for surgery) for valid 
clinical, patient and family logistical, or facility,  procedure and/or anesthesia scheduling issues are acceptable per 
COG administrative Policy 5.14 (except where explicitly prohib ited within the protocol).  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 149 
The prescription point in the cranial volume is at or near the center. For multi -convergent beams, 
the prescription point is usually at intersection of the beam axis. Note:  Regardless of the location 
of central axis, dose should be prescribed at the center of the cranial volume (midway between 
the maximum separation).  
 
14.1.3.2  Dose Defin ition 
Absorbed dose is specified in centigrays (cGy) -to-muscle.  
 
14.1.3.3  Tissue Heterogeneity  
No corrections for bone attenuation will be made.  
 
14.1.3.4  Prescribed Dose and Fractionation  
 
14.1.3.4.1  Intermediate and High Risk Patients  
These patients will  receive prophylactic cranial radiation, consisting of a total dose of 1200 cGy 
given in 8 daily fractions of 150 cGy per fraction, administered Monday through Friday.  
 
14.1.3.4.2  CNS 3 Patients  
All patients who present with CNS 3 leukemia at diagnosis wil l receive cranial radiation 
consisting of a total dose of 1800 cGy given in 10 daily fractions of 180 cGy per fraction, 
administered Monday through Friday.  
 
14.1.4  Dose Uniformity  
Dose variations in target volume will be within +7%, -5% of prescription -point dose. (From 
ICRU Report 50: small high -dose volumes can be excluded from evaluation of dose uniformity 
but not small low -dose volumes.)  
 
14.1.5  Treatment Interruptions  
No corrections will be made for treatment interruptions less than 7 days. For interru ptions greater 
than 7 days, contact the Study Radiation Oncology Coordinator.  
 
14.1.6  Treatment Technique  
 
14.1.6.1  Patient Position  
It is recommended that the patient be treated in supine with immobilization appropriate for the 
child such as a face mask.  
 
14.1.6.2  Beam Configuration  
Cranial volume is treated with two lateral, equally weighted photon beams. Fields will extend at 
least 1 cm beyond periphery of scalp.  
 
14.1.6.3  Field Shaping  
Field -shaping will be done with blocks which are at least 5 HVL thick. Multi -leaf collimators are 
acceptable.  
 
14.1.6.4  Eye Protection  
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 150 
A simple method to minimize lens irradiation, while treating posterior halves of eyes, is to let 
central axes of horizontal cranial beams go through both orbits. Anterior edges of beams  are 
defined by external block or by independently controlled collimator and meet at a point 1 cm 
anterior to frontal lobe meninges. Shielding blocks cover anterior halves of eyes and protect nose 
and mouth. Essentially the same geometry can be achieved wi th central axes through center of 
head by angling lateral fields so rays through the eyes lie in the same horizontal plane. It is 
acceptable to use parallel -opposed beam -pair, without such angling, with shielding blocks that 
cover anterior half of proximal  eye. (Dose to contralateral lens will then increase.)  
 
 
14.2 Testicular Radiation  
Only patients with persistent testicular disease at end -Induction (based on clinical and/or 
biopsy findings) will receive testicular irradiation.  
 
14.2.1  Equipment and Calib ration  
 
14.2.1.1  Modality  
High -energy photon or electron beams. Selection of energy is determined by dose uniformity 
criterion, and with electrons, lowest possible energy should be used to spare tissues outside target 
volume. IMRT is not permitted.  
 
14.2.1 .2 Calibration  
Calibrations of therapy machines used in this protocol will be verified by the Radiological 
Physics Center.  
 
14.2.2  Target Volume  
Planning target volume consists of testes in scrotal sac. (N.B. Cremasteric reflex may move 
testes high up in i nguinal canal.) The field may be reduced as the palpably enlarged mass 
decreases in size during treatment.  
 
14.2.3  Target Dose  
 
14.2.3.1  Prescription point is at or near center of planning target volume.  
 
14.2.3.2  Dose Definition  
Absorbed dose is specified  as centigrays (cGy) -to-muscle.  
 
14.2.3.3  Prescribed Dose and Fractionation  
Total dose to prescription point will be 2400 cGy in 12 fractions. Patient will be treated with one 
daily fraction per day of 200 cGy for five days a week.  
 
14.2.4  Dose Uniformity  
Variations of dose within planning target volume will be within +7%, -5% of dose to 
prescription point Uniformity requirement can be met with electron beam of appropriate energy 
provided bolus is used, which is simplest technique. Bolus may also be needed for photon beams 
to fulfill dose uniformity requirement. (From ICRU Report 50: small high -dose volumes can be 
excluded from evaluation of dose uniformity, but not small low -dose volumes.)

Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 151 
14.2.5  Treatment Interruptions  
No corrections will be made for trea tment interruptions less than 7 days. For interruptions greater 
than 7 days, contact the Study Radiation Oncology Coordinator.  
 
14.2.6  Treatment Technique  
 
14.2.6.1  Patient Position  
Patient will be treated in supine position.  
 
14.2.6.2  Field Shaping  
Field  shaping can be done with blocks of at least 5 HVL thick.  Multi -leaf collimators are 
acceptable.  
 
14.2.6.3  Normal Tissue Sparing  
Testes will be supported posteriorly and, if possible, extended caudally in order to minimize 
perineal irradiation.  Field wil l not be angled towards perineum. The penis will be excluded from 
field by fixing it to skin over the symphysis pubis.  
 
14.3 Quality Assurance Documentation  
 
14.3.1  QARC Post Treatment Review

15.0 PATHOLOGY GUIDE LINES FOR T -NHL  
 
15.1 Pathology Goals  
1. Provide quality control by central pathologic review with accurate diagnosis and 
classification of pediatric non -Hodgkin lymphoma. This is to be based on both morphologic 
and immunophenotypic criteria. This study is limited to T -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma . 
Patients with B -lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma are not eligible for this study.  
2. Employ the recently described World Health Organization (WHO) Lymphoma 
Classification97 to facilitate concordance in diagnosis.  
3. Correlate morphologic, immunophenotypic and cytogenetic data for the lymphomas included 
in this treatment protocol.  
 
15.2 Requirements for Handling Tissue or Cytology Specimens at Primary Institutions  
 
15.2.1  Tissue Specimens  
Tissue should preferentially, whenever possible, be obtained fresh and delivered immediately to 
the Pathology Laboratory for optimal handling and distribution (fixation, snap freezing, 
cytogenetics, etc.). Refer to diagram entitled ‘Lymph Node Pr ocessing For Institutional 
Diagnosis And Research Studies In Children’s Oncology Group’ (Figure 15.1). Submit 
representative tissue sections for fixation including at least one block with 10% buffered 
formalin.

Figure 15.1  
 
 
15.2.2  Cytology Specimens  
Cytology or body fluid specimens (i.e. pleural fluid) should be delivered promptly to the 
pathology laboratory, and handled per primary institutional procedures. Sufficient material 
should be utilized for morphologic evaluation by cytocentrifuge preparatio ns stained with a 
Romanowsky stain (i.e. Giemsa or Wright’s stains). Provided enough specimen is available, at 
least one cell block should be prepared with specification of the fixative utilized and the time in 
fixative.

Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 154 
15.3 Immunophenotyping Recommendations for Primary Institutions  
For eligibility in this study, the methodology and criteria for immunophenotypic analysis defined 
by the submitting institution will be accepted. Recognized methods include: paraffin section 
immunohistochemistry, fr ozen section immunohistochemistry, cytocentrifuge (cytospin) 
immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry.  
 
For eligibility in this study, an extensive panel of antibodies should be employed for 
immunophenotypic evaluation. This can be done on snap frozen tissu e by 
immunohistochemistry, and body fluid/cytology specimens by flow cytometry or cytocentrifuge 
(cytospin) immunocytochemistry. This panel of antibodies is listed as follows:  
 
T-Cell: CD1, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD7, CD8.  
B-Cell: CD19, CD20, Kappa, Lambda.  
Myeloid: CD13, CD14, CD33.  
Other: CD10, CD25, CD34, CD45, TdT.  
 
The method of TdT evaluation should be specified (i.e. flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, 
immunohistochemistry).  
 
For cases in which no paraffin embedded tissue has been prepared, and only stained cytospin 
slides remain available, these cases will be acceptable for protocol submission and pathology 
review when adequate immunophenotypic data is available from the primary institution. This 
situation may occur with cases evaluated by cytospin i mmunocytochemistry or flow cytometry 
immunophenotyping.  
 
If specimen is limited, preventing a complete immunophenotypic evaluation, a recommended 
minimum panel of antibodies should include: CD3, CD5, CD19, CD79a and TdT. If specimen is 
limited to paraffin embedded tissue only, a preferred panel of antibodies should include at least: 
CD45RO (UCHL -1), CD79a, and TdT. If additional antibodies that may be utilized in paraffin 
embedded tissue are available at the primary institution, the panel may include: CD3 
(polyclonal), CD43 (Leu22), CD22, PAX598,99, and CD45RA (4KB5). If immunophenotyping 
studies are not available locally, the case may be sent as a consultation case for evaluation 
including immunoph enotyping studies to Dr. Sherrie Perkins (see address in Section 15.5.6 ). 
 
15.4 Pathology Staging Criteria  
Cerebrospinal Fluid : Leukocyte count greater than or equal to 5/μL, with presence of blasts. TdT 
evalu ation is strongly recommended.  
 
Bone Marrow : The presence of greater than 5% and less than 25% blasts in a bone marrow 
aspirate, or focal infiltration in a bone marrow biopsy, represents involvement of the marrow by 
lymphoblastic lymphoma.

16.0 BIOLOGY METHODS  AND SPECIMEN SUBMIS SION FOR T -NHL  
 
16.1 Required  Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Biology Studies  
 
16.1.1  Sample Collection  
A single bone marrow specimen will be obtained at diagnosis to assess disease involvement in 
the bone marrow for subsequent risk stratification. This sample will be shipped to the COG ALL 
Reference Flow Cytometry Lab using the same shipping and handling re quirements as T -ALL 
patients enrolled on this study.  
 
Samples are to be shipped to Dr. Brent Wood at the University of Washington, Flow Cytometry 
Laboratory. The Specimen Transmittal Form is to be submitted with each sample submitted to 
the COG Reference L aboratory. The specimen transmittal form information should always 
include the name and telephone number of a person designated by the PI to receive calls from the 
Reference Laboratory directors. The PI’s FAX number must also be noted on each sample 
inclus ion form. Because clinical recommendations will be made on these samples, always 
include the patient’s initials and COG number on any sample submitted. This is a CLIA 
requirement. COG ALL Reference Laboratories may be unable to analyze specimens if adequat e 
patient identifiers are not provided.  
 
T-NHL samples for the Reference Laboratories are to be collected in special 15  mL conical tubes 
(SM) containing EDTA/RPMI as the anticoagulant and media diluent. These tubes will be 
prepared in the Reference Laborat ories and mailed in batches to each participating institution, 
where they can be stored frozen at -20°C until use. Tubes are stable for 3 months if refrigerated 
and stable for 1 year if frozen.  
 
To request prepared and pre -packaged sample shipping tubes, c lick on the ‘Biopathology Center 
Application’ link on either the Protocol or the CRA Home Page of the COG web site. On the 
Biopathology Center Applications page, select the BPC Kit Management link to enter the Kit 
Management application. Please select the protocol ‘AALL08B1’ to order the shipping tubes 
required for MRD samples. Even though T -NHL patients are not enrolled on AALL08B1, the 
supplies are still ordered through that protocol.  
 
Bone Marrow Collection Procedures for Reference Laboratories for T -NHL : 
a. Collect BM into a syringe and transfer the specimen immediately into the 15 mL shipping 
media conical tube with RPMI/EDTA.  
b. Mix well. Up to 5 mL of BM can be placed in one 15  mL tube with RPMI/EDTA. If you 
don’t have shipping media tubes, you can pl ace the BM into large purple EDTA tubes 
that are commonly available in most hospitals. However, the viability of the cells is 
greatly enhanced in the shipping media tubes.  
c. 5 mL of BM will be sufficient for MRD analysis at diagnosis.

16.2 Optional  Tissue Banking and Subsequent Biologic Studies  
Specimens to characterize the biologic nature of the disease will focus on four major areas: 
1) immunophenotyping; 2) cytogenetic characterization by FISH; 3) NOTCH mutati on analysis; 
and 4)  CGH and gene expression profiling.  Tissue collection is requested prior to treatment 
initiation and also at the time of relapse. It is anticipated that there will be variability in the type 
and amount of tissue submitted based upon the accessibility of the tumor tissue and the 
feasibility of obtaining it (i.e. patients with large mediastinal masses who are sedation risks will 
be expected to have limited tissue available). Minimum requirements for study entry will include 
sufficient tissu e to confirm the diagnosis. Fresh tissue will be obtained whenever possible. All 
available biologic specimens will be sent to the COG Biopathology Center, which will serve as 
the central repository for this component of the study. The study committee will assess the state 
and quantity of material for subsequent studies with allocation to designated laboratories, placing 
priority in the studies in the rank order listed below. The collection, processing, shipping and 
analysis of the tissue have been incorpora ted into the AALL0434 protocol in order to prevent 
any modification or amendment of the ALL Classification Study (AALL08B1). Specific details 
of the biologic studies include:  
  
1. Immunophenotyping : Immunophenotyping will focus on the characterization of the 
thymic developmental stage of a particular patient’s disease to determine whether this has 
prognostic significance. Emphasis will be placed on those surface markers that can be 
obtained from paraffin embedded tissue that should be available from all patien ts 
enrolled. This will include CD4-CD8-sCD3-CD1a to establish the developmental stage of 
the disease for each patient. Data from recently completed A5971 suggests that a 
 THIS PROTOCOL IS FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ON LY, SEE PAGE 1 FOR USAGE POLICY  AALL0434  
Version date: 03/24/16                   Page 160 
phenotype expressing CD1, CD5, and CD8 may correlate with a poor outcome.100 This 
observation will be examined in this proposal to determine its validity.  
2. Cytogenetic Analysis : Limited cytogenetic analysis (via FISH) will be obtained in all 
specimens with sufficient tissue given the great paucity of data available characterizing 
the nature of cytogenetic abnormalities in LL. Conventional cytogenetic analysis on fresh 
tissue will not be a ttempted as prior studies have failed to yield sufficient specimens to 
warrant a commitment of resources to this endeavor. This combined with CGH studies 
below will allow a more detailed characterization of the cytogenetic abnormalities in LL.  
3. NOTCH Mutati on Analysis : Specimens will be collected to characterize both the 
incidence and prognostic value of the presence of NOTCH mutations and NOTCH 
expression in patients with LL. Data collected from these studies will be correlated to 
disease outcome and gene e xpression analysis to gain further insight on the relevance of 
NOTCH mutations and the biologic and clinical behavior of the disease.  
4. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) and Gene Expression Profiling : The 
recently completed A5971 study piloted the feas ibility of comparative genomic analysis 
to characterize genetic alterations in a small number of LLs to assess whether this 
technique can identify important genetic alternations, which have been difficult to assess 
due to the limited availability of tissue  typically available for cytogenetic analysis. A 
recent COG analysis comparing T -cell ALL to LL utilizing gene expression profiling 
demonstrated that there may be several non overlapping genes expressed, distinguishing 
these two diseases.101 Based upon the findings of A5971, and the availability of 
resources, a targeted approach will be expanded to gain more extensive characterization 
of the incidence of genetic aberrations in LL and their correlation to clinical outcome. 
This may potentially lead to insight of the important genetic features of high risk disease 
and possibly reveal potential targets for new therapies.  
 
For cases with a limited amount of  tissue available for analysis, the AALL0434 and NHL 
Biology Committee will prioritize specimens for studies.  
 
16.3 Preparation of Tissue Banking Samples at Time of Diagnosis or Relapse  
At diagnosis, at least one square centimeter of snap frozen tumor is requested in addition to the 
material required for central review (described in Section 15.5 ). If more than 1 gram is available, 
cut tissue into 1  gram aliquots. Wrap tissue in foil and snap freeze in liquid n itrogen or cold 
isopentane. Place tissue in zip -loc bag and, using a waterproof marker, label the bag with the 
patient’s BPC number, specimen type and date obtained. Store specimens at -70°C or colder 
until shipped. Include a transmittal form with each shi pment of specimens.  
 
If tumor tissue is obtained at the time of relapse for clinical purposes, additional material (as 
described above for diagnosis) is requested for banking and s ubsequent biologic studies.  
 
The Biopathology Center (BPC) will bank the tis sue for future distribution and use including the 
studies listed above.  
 
16.3.1  Specimen Shipping Instructions  
Specimen procurement kits for shipping frozen tumor tissue to the BPC are provided upon 
request. To request a Specimen Procurement Kit, click on the ‘Biopathology Center Application’

INFORMATION SHEET REGARDING RESEARCH STUDY AALL0434  
(for children from 7 through 12 years of age)  
 
Intensified Methotrexate, Nelarabine and Augmented Therapy for Children and Young Adults 
with T -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or T -cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma  
 
1. We have been talking with you about a type of cancer called T -cell acute lymphoblastic  
leukemia or T -ALL. T -ALL is a type of cancer that only affects T -cells (a special kind of cell 
of your immune system). T -cell ALL grows in the bone marrow . The bone marrow is inside 
your bones. It is where your blood is made. After doing tests, we have fo und that you have 
this type of cancer.  
 
2. We are asking you to take part in a research study because you have T -ALL. A research 
study is when doctors work together to try out new ways to help people who are sick. In this 
study, we are trying to learn more ab out how to treat T -ALL. We will do this by comparing 4 
ways to treat T -ALL. Some of the children in this study will get the usual treatment for T -
ALL. Some of the children will get extra chemotherapy. We don’t know which way is better. 
That is why we are d oing this study.  
 
3. Children who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is a 
type of medicine that destroys cancer cells. Sometimes X -ray treatments are also given to 
patients to help kill cancer that is in the brain and/or te sticles (if you are a male) or to keep 
the cancer from moving into the brain. You will have regular blood tests and several bone 
marrow tests and spinal taps during your treatment. The bone marrow tests and spinal taps 
may hurt some, but medicines will be given to keep it from hurting too much.  
 
4. Sometimes good things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These good 
things are called ‘benefits’. We hope that a benefit to you of being part of this study is 
keeping the cancer away for as long  as possible, but we don’t know for sure if there is any 
benefit of being part of this study.  
 
5. Sometimes bad things can happen to people when they are in a research study. These bad 
things are called ‘risks’. The risks to you from this study are increased toxicities that can 
cause infections or make it harder for a patient to fight off infections, loss of healthy blood 
cells and damage to bones or joints. Steroid drugs, such as the dexamethasone (and less 
frequently prednisone), are known causes of a diseas e called “osteonecrosis” (ON). 
Osteonecrosis results from the temporary or permanent loss of the blood supply to the bones. 
Without blood, the bone tissue dies and causes the bone to breakdown. ON is most 
commonly seen in the hip joint. If the bones near a  joint breakdown it can cause the joint to 
collapse. The exact reason why corticosteroids cause ON is not known. For patients receiving 
extra chemotherapy, there is also the risk of side effects involving the nerves, such as 
numbness and tingling and weakn ess. Most of the time these side effects are mild and go 
away within a few days. In rare cases the nerve side effects may be very severe, and then 
may last for a long time and may not completely go away. It is also possible that your

ways to treat T -ALL:  
• Standard chemotherapy for T -ALL  
• Standard chemotherapy for T -ALL, plus an experimental drug called Nelarabine  
• Augmented chemotherapy for T -ALL, which is standard  chemotherapy with high -
dose methotrexate substituted for methotrexate  
• Augmented chemotherapy for T -ALL, plus Nelarabine  
 
Some of the children and teens in this study will get the usual treatment for T -ALL. Some of 
the children and teens will get extra che motherapy. We don’t know which way is better. That 
is why we are doing this study.  
 
3. Children and teens who are part of this study will be treated with chemotherapy.

Nelarabine and/or high -dose methotrexate to your treatment plan may increase the side 
effects of treatment without improving the chances of getting rid of the cancer for as long as 
possible. Adding Nelarabi ne and/or high -dose methotrexate to your treatment plan could also 
reduce how well your treatment works.

with T -cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) or T -cell Lymphoblastic Lymphoma  
 
1. We have been talking with you about a  type of cancer called T -cell lymphoblastic lymphoma 
or  
T-NHL. T -NHL is a type of cancer that occurs in the lymph system, which is made up of the 
lymph nodes and other lymph tissue throughout the body. Lymph tissue makes and stores 
infection -fighting whit e blood cells called lymphocytes. These cells become cancerous when 
a subject has lymphoma. After doing tests, we have found that you have this type of cancer.

APPENDIX IX: AGGREGATE ANALYSIS O F PATIENTS WHO EXPER IENCED 
RHABDOMYOLYSIS IN TR IALS USING NELARABIN E 
 
AE #1147179 (Protocol AALL0434):  
A 4-year-old male with precursor T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T -cell ALL) experienced elevated 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilateral lower limb muscle 
weakness, and rhabdomyolysis while on the consolid ation arm of a phase 2/3 study using the 
investigational agent nelarabine in combination with methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 
mercaptopurine, vincristine, pegaspargase , and radiation therapy.   
 
The patient received nelarabine as scheduled from  April 19, 2011 to April 23, 2011, and tolerated the 
treatment well while in the hospital. On April 23, 2011 (Cycle 2, Day 5), laboratory results showed 
elevated AST and ALT levels immediately following his last dose of nelarabine. On April 26, 2011, the 
patient presented with abdominal pain associated with dark urine, nonspecific pain in his upper neck, and 
bilateral leg pain causing difficulty with  walking. The neck and leg pain had been present since he left the 
hospital. His urinalysis showed a protein of 30 mg/dL (reference range: 0 -8 mg/dL) and was positive for 
hemoglobin. His creatine kinase (CK) was 56,846 IU/L (reference range:  60 -294 IU/L), his ALT was 770 
IU/L (reference range: 1 -52 IU/L), and his AST was 1880 IU/L (reference range: 1 -51 IU/L).  He was 
admitted to the hospital and started on aggressive hydration, along with alkalinization of his urine.  
Chemotherapy and his prophylactic Bactrim® were held. It was felt that the patient was experiencing 
acute rhabdomyolysis due to the nelarabine. On  May 1, 2011 (Cycle 2, Day 8 with dose delay), the patient 
restarted his chemotherapy receiving cyclophosphamide and cytarabine, which he tolerated. By May 2, 
2011, the patient’s condition had improved; his CK was 1,559  IU/L and his ALT and AST were 321 IU /L 
and 76 IU/L, respectively, and he was discharged. On May 10, 2011, his ALT and AST were 68 IU/L and 
47 IU/L, respectively. Treatment with nelarabine was permanently discontinued. Per the site, as of 
July 12, 2011, the patient has had no residual side ef fects from the event.  
 
AE #1668452 (Protocol AALL0434):  
A 16 -year-old male with Non -Hodgkin’s Lymphoma experienced elevated ALT, elevated AST, elevated 
creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and myalgia while on the consolidation arm of a phase  2/3 study using the 
investigational agent nelarabine in combination with methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, 
mercaptopurine, vincristine, pegaspargase , and radiation therapy.  
 
The patient completed Cycle 2, Day 47 of consolidation, which included a 5 -day course of nel arabine, on 
April 26, 2011. He had experienced diffuse but mainly abdominal and chest muscle pain which improved 
by April 29, 2011 (Cycle 2, Day 50). The patient’s symptoms were thought to initially be an episode of 
myositis associated with nelarabine. Eva luation revealed an elevated CPK of 56,760 IU/L (ULN = 
400 IU/L), AST of 1178 IU/L (ULN = 41 IU/L), ALT of 246 IU/L (reference range not provided), and 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 1298, consistent with rhabdomyolysis. A previous urinalysis had shown 
blood without RBCs on microscopic examination; a current urinalysis was unremarkable. He was given 
IV fluids and increased oral fluids. On May 4, 2011, the patient’s CPK was 1086 IU/L. By May 6, 2011, 
his CPK was 342  IU/L and the rhabdomyolysis was deemed res olved. The patient had no further muscle 
pain.  Nelarabine was permanently discontinued. The patient relapsed with bony metastatic disease in 
June of 2011.  
 
AE # 1720816 (Protocol E04 -5299):  
A 12 -year-old male with pre -cursor T -cell acute lymphocytic leuke mia (ALL) developed motor 
neuropathy, psychosis, seizure, and rhabdomyolysis before dying of adult respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) while on a special exception trial using the investigational agent nelarabine.

The patient, who received 4 of the 5 pla nned doses of nelarabine, tolerated the treatment well until 
September 17, 2004 (Cycle 1, Day 3), when he experienced a single episode of hallucinations and 
developed leg weakness. By Cycle 1, Day 5, the patient was experiencing increased leg pain and 
weak ness and was unable to move his legs. The last day of study drug was held. He experienced further 
hallucinations as well as confusion, then seizure. On September 20, 2004, his creatinine increased to 
3.7 mg/dL (reference range: 0.8 -1.2 mg/dL), his myoglobi n was 4,258.8 ng/mL (reference range: 0 -
110 ng/mL), and his CPK was 1,653 U/L (reference range: 55 -370 U/L), consistent with rhabdomyolysis. 
Myoglobin decreased to 191.9 ng/mL on September 24, 2004. The patient went into respiratory failure 
and gradually d eteriorated until he expired on October 12, 2004.

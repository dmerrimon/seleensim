3 Device Intended Use  
The Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay is a real-time PCR  test intended for  use on the Q -POC instrument 
for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid s from Severe Acute Res piratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2), in nasal mid -turbinate swabs (MTSW) obtained from individuals 
suspected of COVID -19 by their healthcare provider. Testing is limited to laboratories certified 
under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment s of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. §263a, that 
meet requirements to perform high complexity or moderate complexity tests.  
Results are for the detection of SARS -CoV-2 RNA. SARS -CoV-2 RNA is generally detectable in 
nasal mid -turbinate swabs (MTSW) during the acute  phase of infection. Positive results are  
indicative of the presence of SARS -CoV-2 and aids in the diagnosis of COVID -19 if used in 
conjunction with other clinical and epidemiological information. Positive results do not rule out 
bacterial infection or co -infection with other viruses .  
Negative results do not preclude SARS -CoV-2 infection and should not be used as the sole basis 
for patient management decisions. Negative results must be combined with clinical 
observations, patient history, recent exposures and epidemiological information. Laboratories 
within the United States and its territories are required to report all results to the appropriate 
public health authorities.  
The Q-POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay  is intended for use by laboratory personnel who have rece ived 
specific training on the use of the Q-POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay in conjunction with the Q -POC 
instrument (Q29001) .

agreement [PPA] and negative percent agreement [NPA]) of 
QuantuMDx’s Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay when running mid -turbinate 
nasal swab (MTSW; also known as nasal mid -turbinate, NMT) compared 
to Roche Cobas 6800 SARS -CoV-2 Comparator Test.  
Study Design  Prospective clinical study enrolling patients with signs and symptoms 
that are consistent with SARS -CoV-2. Positive and negative specimens 
will be run on the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay in comparison w ith an FDA -
approved reference standard. The reference standard will be the Roche 
Cobas 6800 SARS -CoV-2. 
Three  clinical testing sites , located in different geographical locations 
of the U.S. , will be used to collect SARS -CoV-2 positive and negative 
specimens . Testing sites may  be independent from sample collection 
sites – i.e., there can be multiple sample specimen collection sites that 
feed into the three testing sites.  
Study Population  Prospectively enrolled patients  >18 years of age  with signs an d 
symptoms that are indicative of  SARS -CoV-2 infection . 
Subject populations must be  from the U.S. to be  representative of the 
intended patient population(s).

10 Testing Sites  
The study will be conducted at three external collection and testing sites located in the U.S. (in 
different geographical locati ons).  
Testing sites may  be independent from sample collection sites – i.e., there can be multiple 
sample collection sites that feed into the three testing sites. If some non -U.S. testing/collection 
sites are chosen, the relevance of this patient populatio n to a U.S. population will be 
documented.  
11 Operators  
The study will include 1 -3 operators at each site and at least nine (9) operators across all sites. 
The operator study participants enrolled must represent anticipated operators of the Q -POC 
SARS -CoV-2 Assay within the use -case environment. They should be laboratory personnel who

have received specific training on the use of the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay in conjunction with 
the Q -POC instrument (Q29001). Operators must be suitably trained to work in laborato ries 
certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 
§263a, that meet requirements to perform high complexity or moderate complexity tests.  
Operators should be personnel currently employed in the selected intended use sites and 
testing should be integrated into the daily workflow of the facility.  
Education (including experience and training) and the occupation of each operator  will be 
recorded and tabulated for each operator enrolled in the study. Study sit es will be required to 
provide CVs and a filled in information form for potential operators prior to approval for their 
inclusion in the study. This wil l ensure that the  participants meet the definition of intended 
operators.  
The operators who participate in the study will be provided with the test kit in the form that 
will be made available in the actual intended use settings when the test is marketed. The 
operators should also be provided with the instructions  for use and the training that is intended 
for such operators.

Ideally, Category II samples should be limited to no more than 30% of the total prospective 
samples enrolled in the clinical study . 
Please note that Category I and II samples must be collected sequentially from all patients 
meeting study inclusion criteria and representing the assay’s intended use population (i.e., not 
pre-selected) presenting at a clinical facility between two pre -determined dates. This minimizes 
bias and prevalence of infection in the population can be evaluated. The Category II samples 
should be appropriately stored (e.g., frozen at -70˚C to -80˚C ). 
It is anticipated that within this clinical study both the compara tor and candidate samples will 
be tested under the Category I conditions.

An adequate number of subjects (N=550) will be enrolled to achieve a minimum 50 
symptomatic positive and 500 negative cases confirmed via Roche Cobas 6800 SARS -CoV-2, a 
FDA approved reference standard.  
12.5 Specimen Storage, Handling, Transport, and Disposal  
Once recruited, a healthcare professional will take a sample  per subject  for the comparator 
test, following the manufacturer’s Instructions For Use (IFU)  in one nostril . MTSW samples will 
be taken  from the o pposite nostril  (that was not swabbed for the comp arator NPS sample) , 
using Copan F LOQ  Swabs and placed into  MSwab buffer (Q14 -116-P02), for the test under 
investigation. In instances where opposite nostrils cannot be swabbed for both the comparator 
and the test under investigation, a 15 minute wait perio d to allow for viral reloading must occur 
between collecting both the comparator and the test samples on the same nostril.   
Comparator RT -PCR s amples will be shipped overnight  with ice packs as they are collected  and 
processed for testing within 48 hours of collection . Comparator RT -PCR samples will be stored 
frozen at -70oC to -80oC after testing ; they will be defrosted and brought up to room 
temperature immediately before re-testing , if required . Test  MTSW  samples will  tested as soon 
as possible  following collection , however if time is required between specimen collection and 
testing, the samples must be stored at 2 -8 °C for up to 24 hours. Test samples must also be 
stored at 2 -8 °C whilst the Q -POC test  is running.    
Following testing  (and any subsequent re -testing) , residual samples will be stored between  -
70oC to -80oC for retesting of any discordant results. Once the study is completed, the samples 
will be disposed of within biohazardous waste .  
13 Clinical Performance Study Procedures  
NPS samples will be tested on the Roche Cobas 6800 SARS -CoV-2 Test. A 400  µL aliquot of 
MTSW sample  will be inserted into the  Q-POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay test cassette and run on the 
Q-POC instrument . 
Test and compara tor assays will be run on their respective sample types.  
13.1 Data Validity  
Upon completion of each Q -POC run, the instrument should display the test status as ‘VALID’. 
If any other test status is displayed, the run should be discarded.  
The comparator RT -PCR a ssay, Roche cobas® SARS -CoV-2, uses two SARS -CoV-2 nucleocapsid 
targets. Target 1 is specific to the SARS -CoV-2 virus, but Target 2 is a pan -Sarbecovirus region 
of the nucleocapsid that is conserved and detects both SARS -CoV-1 and SARS -CoV-2. This 
comparat or RT -PCR assay considers samples which are positive for Target 1 as positive for 
SARS -CoV-2 virus regardless of the status of Target 2 which can be invalid, negative, or positive

and the sample is still SARS -CoV-2 positive if Target 1 is positive. If Targ et 2 is positive and 
Target 1 is either negative or invalid, then the result is a presumptive positive due to Target 2’s 
promiscuity among Sarbecovirus members. The decision has been made to consider all 
presumptive positive results as invalid for this cli nical performance  study . Only the result of 
“SARS -CoV-2 RNA detected”, according to the manufacturer’s instructions for use, will be 
counted as  positive in the clinical performance evaluation data analysis.  
Any problems encountered during testing must als o be communicated to the relevant 
facilitator(s ) and to QuantuMDx.  
Any invalid tests should be repeated at least once.  
External Quality Controls will be run as per the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay product IFU  and Roche 
cobas® SARS -CoV-2 IFU. External p ositive control runs must return positive results.  External 
negative control runs must return negative results.  If the incorrect result is returned, or the Q -
POC ™ instrument displays one of these test statuses as ‘INVALID’, the controls should be  re-
run. If repeats also fail, contact the facilitator(s) or QuantuMDx.  
13.2 Discordance Analysis  
Any discrepant results will be investigated via repeat testing using an alternative FDA approved 
RT-PCR test . Discrepant analysis will not be used to adjust PPA and NPA calculations. These 
results can only be used to provide further information in the product IFU or academic 
publications. Statistical analysis of test assay performance will be conducted to determ ine PPA 
and NPA . This will be based solely on comparison of Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay and Roch e Cobas 
6800 SARS -CoV-2 Test  results . 
14 Monitoring Plan and Data Management

Study data will be captured in the case report forms (CRFs) by the study staff.  Paper forms will 
be filled in during the study and transcribed into electronic forms (smartsheet) whi ch will feed 
into a spreadsheet. The paper forms will  also be scanned and uploaded to the spreadsheet.  
Access  to the data collection system will be provided to members of the study site who have 
been delegated data collection and entry responsibilities by the site PI and who have completed 
training on the EDC system.  
The data recorded in the CRFs will be source -verified from study -related source documents. 
Quality Control checks will take place to verify that the smartsheet MDF matches the scans of 
the pape r source CRFs. The investigator shall ensure that all data on the CRFs are complete, 
accurate, and consistent with source documentation. A monitor from the Sponsor (or designee) 
will review the  CRFs for completeness and accuracy.  
The investigator will anon ymise patient data so that no identifiable information is kept. Data 
arising from the administration of the index and reference tests, e.g. graphs and other outputs 
will be collected. All data related to the evaluation will be stored; raw and unanalysed da ta files 
will be shared with QuantuMDx.  
15 Statistical Considerations  
The diagnostic performance of the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay  (in terms of PPA and NPA) will be 
determined using the Roche Cobas 6800 SARS -CoV-2 Test , as an FDA -approved reference 
standard comparator assay. This will be done for the entire dataset and also for subsets 
classified by comparator Ct -banding (Ct≤25, 25<Ct≤30, Ct>30) for SARS -CoV-2. Diagnostic 
performance will be assessed as follows:  
• Positiv e Percent Agreement (PPA) will be calculated as 100% × (TP/(TP + FN)).  
• Negative Percent Agreement (NPA) will be calculated as 100% × (TN/(TN + FP)).  
• PPA and NPA will include 95% CI.  
Where :  
• True Positive (TP) indicates that both the Q -POC  SARS-CoV-2 Assa y and comparator 
assay returned a positive result for the target.  
• False Negative (FN) indicates that the Q -POC  SARS -CoV-2 Assay returned a negative 
result for the target, while the comparator assay returned a positive result.  
• True Negative (TN) indicates t hat both the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay and comparator 
assay returned a negative result for the target.  
• False Positive (FP) indicates that the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay returned a positive r esult 
for the target, while the comparator assay returned a negative result.  
The performance of the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay will be presented based on the overall study 
(all specimens of a claimed specimen type combined) as well as stratified by site  and ti me since 
symptom onset .

The rate of invalid/indeterminate results observed during the clinical study  by site and overall 
will be reported. The prevalence of infection observed at each clinical site as determined by 
the comparator and the detection rate by  the Q -POC SARS -CoV-2 Assay  separately will be 
reported.  
 
16 Deviations from the Clinical Performance Study Plan  
The investigator is not allowed to deviate from the CPSP, except when a deviation is necessary 
to protect subject’s rights, safety and well -being,  or the scientific integrity of the clinical 
performance study.  
Should a deviation from the clinical performance study plan be required, this will be 
communicated to QuantuMDx , QuantuMDx will record the deviation in a Deviation Record 
Template Form (QTEM -270) and circulated for approval with the relevant stakeholders. All 
deviations will be explained and referenced in the Clinical Performance Study Report. Should 
there be any major and/or repeated deviations, these will be recorded and corrective and 
preven tative actions implemented via the Control of Non -Conforming Product Procedure 
(QQA -14).  
17 Accountability of the IVD Medical Devices under Investigation

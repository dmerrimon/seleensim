2 (100)VERSION HISTORY
Global Clinical Study Protocol Version 8.0 is arising from:
Outsi de of  US Clinical Study  Protocol  version 7.0 (Outside of US )
US (only) Clinical Study Protocol versio n 7.0 ( US)
Clinical Study Protocol version 8.0
Rationale for protocol amendment:
Changes were made to clarify  operati onal and statisti cal aspects of the protocol, including 
minor editori al changes throughout the document to c orrect ty pographical errors and improve 
consistency and clarit y.
Changes to secondary  efficacy in term s of addit ion of objectives and outcome measures as 
well as the ordering were made to harmonize D5740C00002 with the other phase 3 trials in 
the Roxadusta t dialysis program  (FG-4592 -064, 1517- CL-0613 and FG-4592- 063).
Adjudicated CV events from this study  will be part of the pool ed anal ysis across the study  
program. This strategy  was adopted to ensure that the overall number of events is high enough 
to prov ide adequate power to address CV No harm. Thus, all analyses of CV safet y will be 
conducted in accordance with the Pooled SAP (PSAP) .
Summary of changes from Clinical Study Protocol version 7.0 (US) and Clinical Study 
Protocol version 7.0 ( Outside of US) to version 8.0:
All below changes are updated in relevant sections of the study protocol.

12 (100)Inclusion Criteria
Added text to modify Inclusio n Cri teria # 3, specifically it now reads as fo llows (added text i s 
italicized):
Receiving or initiating hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis for treatment of native kidney end -
stage renal disease (ESRD ) for a minimum of 2 w eeks and a maximum of 4 months prior to 
randomization. Patients treated w ith hemodialysis must have access consisting of an 
arteriovenous fistula, AV graft, or tunneled (permanent) catheter. Patients on peritoneal 
dialysis must have a functioning peritoneal dialysis catheter in place .
Rationale for change:
Study  D5740C00002 (Rockies) was designed to allow for both incident and stable dial ysis 
patients to be enrolled. The incident dia lysis populati on is recogni zed to have higher
cardi ovascular event rates, higher mortalit yrates, and higher ESA dose requirement for 
anemia therap y. Because the stable dialy sis (conversi on) pati ents were enrolled at a much 
more rapi d rate in thi s phase 3 program than incident dialy sis pat ients, there were few 
incident dial ysis pat ients enrolled when the original target for this study was reached. The
primary intent for thi s amendment is to further support the enrolment of incident dial ysis 
patients to improve representati on of  incident dia lysispatients f or the pooled anal ysis in the 
roxadustat phase 3 program. The definit ion of incident dialysis pat ients has been modified 
to insure that the period of highest risk, 2 wks to 4 mo nths, is captured.
Dose and treatment regimens 
Initial dosing of Roxadustat an d Epoeti n Alfa will be based upon current dose at screening 
visit 1 for patients already  receiving ery thropoi etin analogue therapy.
Rationale for change:
Incident dialysis pat ients frequent ly are on ti trated dosing of ESA and this change simplifies 
the initial dosing strategy .
Dose and schedule and Dosing of epoetin alfa (active control)
Deleted paragraphs covering self -administrati on.
Rationale for change:
Acco mmo date si tes where pati ents are dialyzed at hours when site staff cannot be present.

Primary efficacy and safet y object ives separated and clarified.
Rationale for ch ange:

program, allowing the program to demonstrate both efficacy and safet y across all populat ions 
studi ed.
Appendix A Signatories
Removed and replaced by  electroni c signatures.
Appendix E -National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0
Removed and replaced by  a ref erence to the document.
Rationale for amendment:
Study  D5740 C00002 was designed to allow for both incident and stable dialy sis pat ients to 
be enrolled. The incident dia lysis populati on is recogni zed to have higher cardi ovascular
event rates, higher mortalit yrates, and higher ESA dose requirement for anemia therap y. 
Because the stable dial ysis (conversio n) pati ents were enrolled at a much more rapi d rate in 
this phase 3 program than incident dial ysis pat ients, there were few incident dial ysis 
patients enrolled when the original target for this study was reached. The primary intent is 
to further support the enro lment of incident dial ysis pati ents to improve representation o f 
incident dia lysispatients for the pooled analy sis in the roxadustat phase 3 program. 
The incidence dialysis patient populat ion is an important subset of the intended pat ient 
popul ation for the roxadustat Phase 3 dialysis studies; including these pat ients will help 
evaluate the safet y and efficacy of roxadustat in all dialysis pat ients.
The primary  purpose of thi s protocol  amendment is harmo nization of  D5740C00002 with the 
other phase 3 trials in the roxadustat dialysis program, allowing the program to demonstrate 
both efficacy and safet y across popul ations studied. Addit ionally , the amendment allows 
further recruit ment of newly  initiated (incide nt) dialysis patients (on dialysis ≥2 weeks but ≤4 
months at randomizat ion).

Rationale for amendme nt:
Rockies was designed to allow for both incident and stable dialysis pat ients to be enrolled. 
The incident dialysis populat ion is recognized to have higher cardiovascular event rates, 
higher mortalit y rates, and higher ESA dose requirement for anemia th erapy . Because the 
stable dialysis (conversio n) patients were enrolled at a much more rapid rate in this phase 3 
program than incident dialysis pat ients, there were few incident dialysis pat ients enro lled, 
especially  incident di alysis pat ients from the US, when the original target for this study  was 
reached. The primary  intent for thi s US -only amendment is to further support the enrolment 
of US incident dialysis patients to improve representation of incident dialysis pat ients in the 
US for the pooled analy sis in the roxadustat phase 3 program.

Edition 4.0 w as the original protocol submitted and approved globally.
Summary of main changes from edition  3.0 to 4.0:
Concomitant medications
Deleted text `Due to a potential…at the healt hcare provi ders discretion`
Added text to new section Statins 7.7.1.1
`When co administered with roxadustat, hy droxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase 
inhibitor (statin) exposure was increased 2 -to 3-fold. For patients rando mized to roxadustat, 
investigators should consider this interaction and local prescribing informat ion when de ciding 
on the appropriate statin dose for individual pat ients, bearing in mind the impact of ethnicit y, 
other concomitant medicat ions, renal and hepat ic funct ion. Goals of lipid lowering treatment 
shoul d be maintained as clinically indicated. The recommend ed m aximum  daily statin doses 
are: simvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 
40 m g (20 m g if eGFR<30), pi tavastatin 2 mg (1 mg if eGFR<30)
Rationale :
In vitro studies indicated an inhibitory  potential  of roxadustat for transporters OATP1B1 and 
BCRP, so formal drug: drug interaction studies with simvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin 
were conducted. When preliminary results became available, the Clinical Study  Protocol  
concomitant medicat ion sect ion was up dated:
simvastatin 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC
atorvastatin 1.3-fold increase in Cmax, 2 -fold increase in AUC
rosuvastatin 4-fold increase in Cmax, 3 -fold increase in AUC
The CSP al ready  included maximum recommended statin doses based on in vitro data ; 
rosuvastatin exposure when administered with roxadustat was higher than predicted, so the 
maximum reco mmended rosuvastatin dose was reduced from 20 mg to 10 mg daily. To avoid 
undertreatm ent of pati ents at hi gh CV ri sk who might be rando mized to placebo, invest igators 
are asked to consider this interact ion in the context of local prescribing informat ion and lipid 
guidelines. Reco mmendat ions for pravastatin, pitavastatin and fluvastatin are based on 
predi cted exposure as clinical studies were not conducted with these medications.

Date 19September 2018
16 (100)7.7.1.2 Phosphate binders
When coadministered with phosphate binders, roxadustat exposure was reduced. Patients should be 
advised to discuss with the investigator before changing their phosph ate binder dose or dosing time. To 
optimize absorption of roxadustat, subjects should take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours 
after their phosphate binder.
Rationale :
In addition to new statin data, preliminary results of a drug: drug interactio n study with sevelamer 
carbonate and calcium acetate indicate 40 -50% reduced roxadustat exposure with concurrent
administration. A recommendation to take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after phosphate 
binder was also added to the concomitant medication section.
Concomitant medications
Moved herbal medicine text “ Use of herbal medicine…to continue at the same dose” fro m 
7.7.1 to a new section 7.7.1.3 Herbal medicine
Rationale :
In addit ion, preliminary results of a drug: drug interaction stu dy with sevelamer carbonate and 
calcium acetate indicate 40 -50% reduced roxadustat exposure with concurrent administration. 
A reco mmendat ion to take roxadustat at least 1 hour before or 3 hours after phosphate binder 
was also added to the concomitant medic ation sectio n.
Liver enzy mes
Liver enzyme text exchange " For cases where a patient shows an AST or ALT ≥3xULN or total 
bilirubin ≥2xULN please refer to Appendix D for further instruction in cases of combined increase of 
aminotransferase and total bilirub in." to “If a patient meets any of the following criteria, please refer to

Version 8.0
Date 19September 2018
17 (100)Starti ng dose and dose adjust ment; 
Start doses: 120 mg dose removed
120 and 350 mg dose steps removed
Dosing algorithm changes; 0.8 changed to 1.0
Single dose adjust ment algorithm used throughout treatm ent peri od instead of separate 
algorithms for Correction and Maintenance
Maximum dose reduced fro m lower of 3.5 m g/kg or 400 m g to 3.0 m g/kg or 400 m g
Rationale:
Dosing simplified to reduce risk of prescriber/pat ient error and provide slow, steady  Hb ri se to 
and maintenance wit hin desired range of 11+1 g/dL. 
Dose algorithm was adjusted to reflect results of pharmaco metric modeling and simulation 
using the simplified dosing regimen
Mg/kg dose cap lowered fro m 3.5 to align wit h non -dialysis. The 400 mg cap is retained, 
reflect ing weight distribut ion of dialysis pat ients.
Definition of excessive erythropoiesis
Definit ion of excessive erythropoi esis simplified from before week 20 ‘Hb increases by  >2.0 
g/dL wi thin a 2 week period’ and after week 20 ’Hb increases by >2.5 g/dL within a 4 week 
period’ to a single definit ion, ’Hb increases by >2.0 g/dL within a 4 week period’
Rationa le:
Revised to less complicated and more conservat ive definit ion of excessive erythropoi esis.
Self-administration of study drug :
Specify  self-administrati on of  study  drug or epoetin alfa allowed in PD and ho me HD patients
Rationale:
Clarificat ion to hom ogenize prescript ion in dialysis patients
Visit schedule 
Exchange visit week 1 with phone call
Removed visi ts at week 3,5,7. Also after week 52, visits every 4 weeks
Visit window + -2 day s to –4 day s to 2
Rationale :
Enhance retention, reduce patient burden . Visi ts every  4 weeks align wit h standard of care for 
measurements of Hb and drug dose adjustments in dialysis pat ients 
The visit window was lengthen to improve pat ient retention by making sure that invest igators 
in dialysis clinics can capture necessary data fro m patients who may  miss di alysis treatm ents 
that fall on scheduled visit days

Exclusion criteria
#9 changed fro m Bosniak II to IIF
#10 added definit ion of uncontrolled hypertensio n in dialysis pat ients
#13 added ‘that is determined to be the principal cause of anemia’
Rationale:
Allow patients with Bosniak II cysts, which are not associated with increased risk of renal cell 
carcino ma. Continue to exclude Bosniak IIF cysts which are associated with cancer risk.
Clarificat ion specifying need to measure post- dialysis blood pre ssure and account ing for 
higher blood pressures observed in dialysis pat ients
Allows part icipation of patients with inflammatory disease if cause o f anemia is CKD
Temporary discontinuation 
Deleted study  medicat ion discont inuat ion for thrombocytopenia or bleeding

iron deficiency or bleeding. Also, rescue should be discont inued when Hb >9 g/dL or (new 
text) ‘after a 4 -week cycle has been completed, whichever co mes first.’ Allow one cycl e of 
rescue before permanent discont inuat ion of study  drug.
Added statement regarding rescue with different eryt hropoi etin analogue in epoetin alfa 
treated pati ents
Rationale :
Rescue cont inues to be reserved for patients who are not responsive to study med ication, oral

Target subject population
Approxi mately 2000 anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving hemodialysis 
or peri toneal dialysis wit h an indicat ion for treatment with an ery thropoi etin analogue.
Duration of treatment
The study  will consist of three study  periods as follows:
 Screening Period: Up to 6 weeks
 Treatment Period: Patients will be rando mized (1:1) to open- label treatm ent wi th 
either roxadustat or epoetin alfa. A study  end date will be declared and commo n close -
out will occur when the target number of CV events has been accrued. The expected 
durati on of  treatm ent is est imated to be up to 4years
 Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period : 4 weeks
Investigational product , dosage and mode of administration
Roxadustat
Roxadustat will be administered orally  three times a week (TIW). St udy drug doses must be 
administered at least 2 days apart but no more than 4 days apart (e.g., Monday , Wednesday, 
Friday). Sel ection of roxadustat starting dose will utilize a conversion table (Section 7) for 
patients currently treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue. Patients not currently treated with an 
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadusta t using a tiered weight -based dosing scheme. 
Patients wi th dry weights between 45 and 70 kg will receive 70 mg o f roxadustat as starting 
dose. Pati ents wi th dry weights between 71 and 160 kg will receive 100 mg of roxadustat for 
initial dosing. Dose adjust ments are permitted starting at week 4 and at intervals of every  
4weeks thereafter in order to achieve an Hb le vel of 11 g/dL and maintain an Hb o f 11±1 g/ dL. 
However, dose adjust ments can be done at any t ime if dose reduction is required for excessive 
erythropoi esis. Study  drug will be dosed TIW throughout the study  treatm ent peri od unl ess 
downward dose adjust ment requi res a change to twice or once weekly.
Epoetin alfa 
Initial dose select ion of epoetin alfa for patients treated with an eryt hropoiet in analogue will be 
determined using a conversio n table based on the patient’s current ery thropoi etin analogue dose

25(100)at screening visit 1. Initial dosing of epoetin alfa fo r pati ents not currently  receiving an y
erythropoi etin at study  entry  will be 50 IU/kg TIW with subsequent dose adjust ments to achieve 
an Hb l evel of 11 g/dL and maintain an Hb o f 11±1 g/dL, consistent with approved prescribing 
inform ation or the Summary  of Product Characteristics for epoetin alfa.
Rescue therapy  guidelines are provi ded to optimize standardizat ion of the use of rescue therapy  
by invest igators and to ensure safet y of the individual  study patients.
In the event of excessive erythropoi esis, the dose may be adjusted or put on hold at any  time.
Statistical methods
Sample size determination
Primary efficacy variable: With at least 600 subjects, the study  will provide at l east 99% power 
to demo nstrate non -inferiorit y of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the primary efficacy  endpoint 
(i.e., Hb change fro m baseline to the average level during the evaluat ion peri od defined as Week 
28 until Week 52). This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus epoe tin alfa) of -0.30 g/dL, a 
non-inferiorit y margin for this difference of -0.75 g/dL and a standard deviat ion of 1.25 g/dL.
To contribute adjudicated CV events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 program: 
approximately  2000 subjects will be random ized in a 1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or active 
control , i.e. epoetin alfa. The sample size for this study  is driven by  the overall requirement of 
adjudicated CV events for the phase 3 program in dialysis -treated CKD subjects (which consists 
of four stu dies in total targeting 611 subjects with MA CE events ).The three other studies in the 
study  program  are FG -4592 -064, 1517 -CL-0613, FG-4592- 063. 
Further informat ion related to the sam ple size determination can be found in the study  stati stical 
analysis pl an and the pooled statistical analysis plan.

1.1 Background and rat ionale for conducting this study
Roxadustat is an orally  administered invest igational novel  drug in devel opment f or the 
treatm ent of anemia associated with chronic kidney  disease (CKD), including end -stage renal 
disease (ESRD) . It is current ly in glo bal Ph ase 3 clinical development and has not been 
marketed in any country . Roxadustat i s a potent and reversible orally  active hypoxia -inducible 
factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF -PHI) that transient ly induces hypoxia -inducible factor 
(HIF) stabilizat ion and leads to a funct ional HIF transcript ional response that mimics the 
erythropoi etic response associated with exposure of humans to intermittent hy poxia 
(Semenza 1998
). HIF induces expressio n not only of erythropoi etin, but al so the
erythropoi etinreceptor and proteins that promote iron reabsorption and recy cling 
(Peyssonnaux et al  2008 ). Thus, roxadustat pharmacologically st imulates ery thropoi esis via 
the HIF pathway  and in a manner consistent with the body ’s norm al homeostati c response to 
hypoxia, but under normoxic condit ions. Potential advantages of roxadustat compared with 
erythropoi etin analogues for treatment of anemia in patients with CKD treated with dialysis 
include oral administrati on, greater cardiovascular (CV) safet y and reduced need for 
intravenous (IV) iron therapy . The clinical  data collected thus far suggest that roxadustat is 
generally safe and well tolerated in healt hy adult patients, and in dialysis and no n-dialysis 
CKD pati ents wi th anemia treated up to 60 weeks. Informat ion from the clinical studies 
conducted with roxadustat can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
The obj ective o f the current study  is to assess the efficacy ,safet y and tol erabili ty,with the 
primary  focus on Hem oglobin efficacy and CVsafety of roxadustat in pat ients with ESRD 
treated by  dialysis (hemodialysis [HD] or peritoneal dialysis [PD]).
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
1.2.1 Rationale for study design
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of roxadustat in the treatment of 
anemia associ ated wi th CKD in dialysis pat ients. The study  is a rando mized, open -label study  
with two treatm ent groups, roxadustat or epoetin alfa, and includes hemo dialysis or peri toneal 
dialysis pat ients that have been treated with an eryt hropoi etin analogue or have an indicat ion 
for treatm ent w ith an ery thropoietin analogue.
1.2.2 Rationale for doses 
Starti ng doses of roxadustat were studied in three ways in the Phase 2 program : mg per kg 
weight
-based dosing, tiered weight -based dosing or a fixed starting dose regardless of weight.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code D5740C00002
Version 8.0
Date 19September 2018
36(100)Dose adjust ments were allowed at regular 4 -week intervals to maintain, increase or decrease 
the dose according to pre -specified rules. Addit ional rules were provi ded to minimize 
excessive erythropoi esis. These dose adj ustm ent rules are adopted in this study  with minor 
modificati ons. 
For pati ents treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue at study entry, selection o f initial 
roxadustat dose in this study  will utilize a conversion table based on the patient’s current 
erythropoi etin analogue dose at screening visit 1 . Pati ents not currently  treated wi th 
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadustat using a tiered weight -based dose dosing 
scheme. Patients with dry weights between 45 and 70 kg will receive 70 mg of roxadustat as 
starting dose.  Patients with dry  weights between 71 and 160 kg will receive 100 mg of 
roxadustat for init ial dosing.
Doses will be administered at a frequency o f three times a week (TIW) throughout the study  
treatm ent peri od unless downward dose adjust ment requires a change to twice or once weekly.
In the event of excessive erythropoi esis, the dose may be adjusted at any  time. The maximum 
dose of roxadustat allowed will be the lower of 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg per dose.
Patients rando mized to the epoetin alfa group will receive an epoetin alfa dosing regimen wit h 
initial and subsequent dose adjust ments in accordance wit h accepted clinical pract ice 
guidelines and approved prescribing inform ation for epoetin alfa. The init ial dose of epoetin 
alfa will be selected based on the ery thropoi etin anal ogue regimen used prior to the entry  into 
the study .  Pati ents who were not receiving an ery thropoi etin analogue at study  entry  will 
initially receive epoetin alfa at a dose of 50 IU/kg three times weekly .  Adjustments in the 
total weekly  dose or frequency of epoetin alfa dosing should subsequently be made to achieve 
an Hb of 11 g/dL and maintain Hb levels of 11±1 g/dL.
1.2.3 Rationale for control group
The c ontrol  group will be treated with epoetin alfa in accordance wit h accepted clinical 
practi ce guidelines and approved prescribing informat ion for epoetin alfa in this patient 
popul ation. Epoetin alfa is a frequent ly used eryt hropoiet in analogue agent and is approved for 
use in treatment of anemia associ ated wi th CKD in dialysis pat ients. 
1.2.4 Rationale for hemoglobin level
This study  seeks to achieve and m aintain Hb wi thin the range of 11±1 g/dL. This level is 
chosen to improve the clinical manifestations of anemia, reduce RBC transfusio n and improve 
qualit y of life, wi thout affect ing CV risk. Systematic reviews have found that anemia
correcti on in patients with CKD improved exercise tolerance, energy  and physical  functions 
(Gandra et al 2010, Johansen et al 2010 ). Also, a number of studies and meta analyses have
addressed the issue of clinical benefit versus potential risk upon anemia correcti on in CKD 
(Phrommint ikul et al 2010, Strippo li et al 2004). In a recent update, the 2012 KDIGO 
guidelines suggest that ery thropoi etin analogues be started at Hb below 10 g/dL and should 
generally not be used to maintain Hb above 11.5 g/dL ( Johansen et al 2010 , KDIGO 2012 ). In 
Clinical Study Protocol

37(100)contrast, the Cleveland Clinic reco mmends target hemoglo binlevel  for both predi alysis CKD 
and ESRD patie nts should be 11 to 12 g/dL ( Lascano et al 2010 ).
Unlike Hb levels above 13 g/dL where the data indicates CV harm ( Pfeffer et al  2009 ), there 
is a paucit y of data on the po tential risk of CV adverse events when Hb below 12 g/dL i s 
achieved. Further, other factors than the exact Hb level may contribute to t he CV risk 
associ ated wi th erythropoi etin analogue use. These include toxic effects of higher doses of 
erythropoi etin ana logue ( Andrews et al201) and a too rapid increase in hemoglo binupon 
anemia correcti on (Singh 2010).
Roxadustat acts via a different mechanism of act ion than ery thropoi etin analogues and supra -
physio logic ery thropoi etin concentrations have not been observed in pat ients treated with 
roxadustat ( Yu et al 2013). Wi th the proposed dosing regimen, the risk of rapid rises of Hb 
levels is minimized. Finally, in clinical pract ice, it is difficul t to m aintain individual patient 
Hb values wit hin a very  narrow range and the p roposed range (11±1 g/dL) is in line with 
achievable levels in practice.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
The primary  benefit for patients rando mized to roxadustat is expected to be the correction of 
anemia, including the relief o f associated si gns and symptom s and an improved qualit y of life. 
Roxadustat is expected to be at least as safe as parenteral ery thropoi etin anal ogues.
An established dose adjust ment algorithm will be used during the study  to titrate roxadustat 
doses to enable pat ients to achieve and maintain Hb levels, while closely mo nitoring the rate 
of rise of Hb levels. Roxadustat doses may be held and therape utic phlebotomy  is allowed in 
the event of excessive erythropoi esis. 
Dosing o f epoetin alfa in the epoetin alfa group will be consistent with approved prescribing 
inform ation. Adverse and serious adverse events, and laboratory  parameters including 
electro lytes, liver enzymes, and iron indices, will be closely mo nitored to ensure the safet y of 
treatm ent wi th roxadustat or epoetin alfa. 
In studies with healt hy subjects, headache and dizziness were commo n events which occurred 
at a hi gher frequency wit h roxa dustat compared to placebo. An increased frequency of mild to 
moderate m uscul oskeletal  pain was also noted with high doses of roxadustat. These findings 
were not observed at the usual therapeut ic dose range in the Phase 2 studies in the target 
popul ations.
Treatment with roxadustat was associated with increases in heart rate which were most 
pronounced at supra -therapeuti c doses (5 m g/kg). At the high clinical dose of 2.75 mg/kg, the 
increase was modest (about 10 bpm fro m baseline, placebo corrected). In the Phase 2 studies, 
there were no adverse effects on hemodynamics with repeat dose administration in the 
therapeuti c dose range. The cumulat ive safet y data to date have not ident ified any major risks 
related to roxadustat, which was well tolerated by  healt hysubjects and pat ients with CKD.

38(100)The safet y of treatm ent wi th roxadustat and epoeti n alfa will be carefully mo nitored and an 
independent Data Safety  Moni toring Board (DSMB) will perform periodic assessments of 
safet y data to detect any  potential  safety signals that m ay arise during the study  and advise the 
International Coordinat ing Investigator and Sponsor accordingly. 
Based on data so far obtained, treatment with roxadustat is expected to be efficacious in 
treating anemia in patients with CKD. The safet yprofile of the co mpound, together with the 
safet y monitoring implemented would minimize the risk to study  parti cipants. The benefit -risk 
in this study  is therefore deem ed acceptable.

1.4 Study Design 
This is a Phase 3, mult icenter, randomiz ed, open -label, active -controlled study  to eval uate the 
efficacy and safety of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa for the treatment of anemia due to 
CKD in dialysis pat ients (hemo dialysis or peri toneal  dialysis). This study  is planned to 
rando mize approximately 2000 patients from approximately 250 centers worldwide.
1.4.1 Treatment duration and dosing
The study  periods are as fo llows:
 Screening Period: Up to 6 weeks
Treatment Peri od: Patients will be rando mized (1:1) to open- label treatm ent wi th 
roxadustat or epoetin alfa. Roxadustat will be started at doses of 70 mg for patients 
with dry weights between 45 and 70 kg and 100 mg for patients with dry  weights 
between 71 and 160 kg. T his dose will be subsequent ly titrated. Pati ents currently 
treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue and randomized to receive roxadustat will 
discontinue prior ery thropoi etin analogue therapy and init iate treatm ent wi th 
roxadustat at a starting dose accordi ng to Table 4Secti on 7to achi eve and m aintain
Hb 11±1 g/dL. Epoetin alfa dosing will be done in accordance with accepted 
clinical practice guidelines and approved pres cribing informat ion.
The expected duration of treatment is est imated to be up to 4 years. A study  end 
date will be declared and commo n closeout will occur when the target number of 
CV events has been accrued.
 Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period: 4 weeks. Pati ents who di scont inue study  
medicat ion or protocol -specified study  visits will  be followed up for CV events, 
vital status and hospi talizat ions until the end of the study  (EOS), unl ess consent to 
participate is withdrawn.
1.4.2 Randomization
A total o f approximate ly 2000 patients will be randomiz ed at 1:1 rati o to roxadustat or epoetin 
alfa via an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)/ Interactive Voice Response System 
(IVRS).

For m ore details see Section 7.  
Roxadustat
Patients currently treated with an ery thropoi etin anal ogue who are randomized to the 
roxadustat group will discontinue prior ery thropoi etin anal ogue therapy  and ini tiate treatm ent 
with roxadustat at a starting dose according to Sectio n 7. Pati ents not currently  treated wi th an
erythropoi etin analogue will init iate roxadustat with dose selection based on body  weight. 
Roxadustat will be dosed orally three times a week (TIW) throughout the Treatm ent Peri od 
unless dose reduction is required based on Hb levels.
Epoetin alfa
Patients currently treated with ery thropoi etin analo gue who are rando mized to the epoetin alfa 
active control group will be treated with epoetin alfa dosing regimen as described in Sect ion 7
. 
Initial dosing of epoetin alfa in pat ients not currently  treated wi th erythropoi etin analogue will 
be 50 IU/kg TIW with subsequent dose adjust ments of ery thropoietin analogue made based on 
Hb levels consistent with approved prescribing information.
During the screening period, eligibilit y will be confirmed at a minimum o f 2 screening visits. 
If eligible, the patient will be randomized at the rando mizat ion visit. During the treatment 
period, pati ents will be contacted by  telephone at week 1, and will attend study  visits every  
two weeks from weeks 2 to 20. After week 20, study  visits will occur every  four weeks unt il 
the end of treatment period. A study  end date will be defined based on when the planned 
number of events are estimated to be accrued; the end of treatment (EOT) visit will occur as 
soon as possible after that date. An end of study  (EOS) vi sit will be perform ed 4 weeks after 
the EOT.

opinio n of the invest igator or Sponsor may pose a safet y risk to a patientin this 
study , which may confound efficacy  or saf ety assessment, or may interfere with 
study  participati on
Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled subjects see Section 3.4.
3.3 Subject enrolment and randomization
Invest igator(s) should keep a record, the subject screening log, of subjects who entered pre -
study  screening.
The Investigator(s) will:
 Obtain signed Informed Consent fro m the potenti al patient before any  study  specific 
procedures are perfor med.
 Assign potential pat ient a uni que enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’, through 
the IVRS/IWRS
 Determine patient eligibilit y, see Sect ion 3.1and 3.2.
 Assign elig ible pat ient unique randomizat ion code through the IVRS/IWRS
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , his/her enrolment/randomizat ion code 
cannot be reused.
Randomization codes will be assigned strict ly sequent ially as pati ents beco me eligib le for 
rando mizat ion. Rando mizat ion of qualified patients within the IVRS/IWRS system must take 
place pri or to administrati on of  study  drug.  Randomizat ion procedures must be completed 
within 72 hours.  The first dose of study  drug defines Day  1. The rando mizat ion visit should 
be scheduled after the study  drug has arrived at the study  site.
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomized 
subjects
Patients who fail to meet the eligibilit y criteria shoul d not, under any  circumstances, be 
enrolled o r receive study  medicat ion. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are 
enrolled, but subsequent ly found not to m eet all the eligibilit y criteria must not be randomized
or init iated on treatment, and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibilit y criteri a but i s rando mized in error or 
incorrectly  started on treatm ent, the Invest igator should inform the AstraZeneca study 
physician immediately, and a discussio n should occur between the AstraZeneca study 
physi cian and the invest igator regarding whether to continue or discont inue the patient fro m 
treatm ent. The AstraZeneca study  physician must ensure all decisio ns are appropriately 
docum ented.

46(100)3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
Randomization schedules will b e prospectively prepared. Automated randomization and 
treatm ent assi gnments will be provi ded by an IWRS /IVRS. The randomizat ion codes will be 
computer generated by  AstraZeneca R&D using GRand (AZ Glo bal Rando mizat ion system) 
and loaded into the IVRS/IWRS database. A blocked randomization schedule by country  will 
be produced.
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding (Not applicable)
3.7 Methods for unblinding (Not applicable)
3.8 Restrictions
The fo llowing restri ctions apply in the study :
Female pat ients of childbearing poten tial and m ale pati ents (non -surgi cally  sterile i .e., 
vasectomy ) with a female partner of childbearing potential must, if not practicing complete 
sexual abst inence, agree to practice a dual method of contraception, for example, a 
combinat ion of the fo llowing: (1) oral contraceptive, depo progesterone or intrauterine device; 
and (2) a barrier method (condom or diaphragm).
Contraceptive methods must be practiced upon being rando mized to the study and through 
12weeks after the last dose of study  treatm ent. If  a pati ent di scontinues prematurely , the 
contraceptive method must be practiced for 12 weeks following final administration of study  
drug.
Pregnancy, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, or events related to pregnancy  must be 
reported ( see Section 6.6).
For hi gh dose statins use, see Sect ion 7.7.1.1 .
If epoetin alfa is supplied by  AstraZeneca, see Sectio n 7.1.2 for dose restr ictions at study  
entry . 
3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product
Patients shoul d be discont inued from invest igational product (IP) in the following situat ions:
3.9.1 Temporary discontinuation from investigational product
For pati ents needing treatment with p rohibited concomitant medicat ions, study  medicat ion 
must be discont inued or interrupted temporarily.
For decisio ns around discont inuat ion the AstraZeneca study  physician can be consulted as 
appropriate.

47(100)3.9.2 Permanent discontinuation from investigational product
1. Patient deci sion: The pat ient is at any  time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment.
2. Invest igator’s decisio n, including but not limited to these examples:
Incorrectly randomized patient in who m the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria 
violation would put the patient at undue risk
Adverse event (AE) for which the invest igator thinks continued treatment may 
put the patient at undue risk
Severe non -compliance to study  protocol  
Pregnancy
Need for m ore than one cycle of ery thropoi etin analogue rescue in patients 
treated with Roxadustat
Patients who receive organ transplantation during the study
Each permanent discont inuat ion from study  medicati on shoul d be co mmunicated to the study 
team . For decisi ons around perm anent discont inuatio n the AstraZeneca study  physician can be 
consulted as appropriate. Study  assessments or fo llow-up should be cont inued in all cases if 
possible, see Section 4.
3.9.3 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investig ational product 
Patients perm anent ly discontinuing study medicat ion should be given convent ional therapy, if 
applicable, and should always be asked to continue the regular study  visits as described below.
A pat ient who decides to discont inue study  medicat ion will always be asked about the 
reason(s) to discontinue study  medicat ion and the presence of AEs (if any). These data will be 
ascertained and documented by the invest igator and recorded in the eCRF as appropriate. AEs 
will be fo llowed up (see Secti ons 4and 6.4); and the pat ient shoul d return all study  
medicat ions.
Discontinuation from study medication is not the same as complete withdrawal from the 
study (withdraw al of consent), which has a direct impact on the potential validity of all 
study data, and should be avoided wherever possible. It is essential to collect as much 
data as possible for all patients throughout the study and especially all potential 
endpoint events.
All discont inued patients unless consent withdrawal will be fo llowed up for vi tal status and 
hospi talizati ons unt il study  closure (see Secti on 3.9.3.2 ).
If the patient permanent ly discont inues study medi cation pri or to cl osure of the study , there 
shoul d be several different options for their continuation in the study  as described below:
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Roxadustat
Study Code D5740C00002
Version 8.0
Date 19September 2018
48(100)3.9.3.1 Patient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discontinuation Visit and 
then continue in -person study visits
The pat ient agrees to undergo the Premature Treatment Discont inuat ion Visit (PTDV) and 
then cont inue in-person study  visits according to plan. This is the preferred option and 
patients who discont inue study  medicat ion will always be asked if they agree to this ap proach. 
If agreed, as above, the patient will undergo their PTDV within 15 days after the study  
medicat ion is stopped. The PTDV includes the same assessments as the EOT visit. The patient 
will cont inue attending subsequent study visits according to schedul e (Table 1), or if needed 
with reduced frequency until end of study  is declared (i.e., when the prespecified number of 
primary  events has been reached). The patient will then return for their EOS visit as soon as 
feasible ,but no l ater than 60 days after the study  closure has been declared. It is essent ia
l that 
the pati ents attend the EOS visit in person whenever possible.
At PTDV, the physicians caring for the patient will decide upon treatment the patient should 
receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care.
3.9.3.2 Patient refuses to continue in -person study visits but agrees to undergo 
modified follow -up
If the patient agrees, the PTDV should be done. In all subjects permanent ly discont inuing 
study  drug, all  adverse e vents and potential endpoints should be captured during the 28 days 
following study  drug di scont inuat ion. Bey ond 28 days following study  drug di scontinuat ion, 
for subjects who refuse to continue in- person study visits but agree to modified follow -up, all 
SAEs shoul d be captured as well as any  information(for exam ple, hospi talizati on records) 
relevant to the fo llowing adj udicated events:
 Death
 Non-fatal MI
 Non-fatal stroke
 Heart failure requiring hospitalizat ion
 Unstable angina leading to hospitalization
 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
 Pulmo nary embo lism (PE)
 Vascular access thrombosis (VAT)
 Hypertensive emergency
Addit ionally , informat ion about anemia treatment fo llowing study  drug di scont inuat ion (for 
example, ery thropoi etin analogue use) should be documented in the eCRF.
Examples of modified fo llow
-up include in -person study  visits occurring at a different 
frequency  and/or wi th fewer study  procedures (for example, without laboratory  assessments)

49(100)than that listed in Table 1; periodic telephon e contact wi th the subject, subject’s spouse, or the 
subject’s treating physician; and periodic medical record review. 
3.9.3.3 Patient refuses any form of follow -up
If the patient refuses a n
yform of follow-up, he/she official ly withdraws from  the study and 
withdraws consent. Th is approach should be avo ided if possible and is further described in 
Secti on 3.10. All available fo llow-up opti ons (including modified fo llow-up as described in 
section 3.9.3.2) should be discussed with the patient, and the pa tient’s refusal o f all fo llow-up 
options shoul d be docum ented. Patients who agree to any  form of follow-up or contact with 
the site (for exam ple, one phone call during the study  closeout peri od), have not wi thdrawn 
consent. At the end of the stud y, vital status on all  such pati ents will  be collected from  
publicly available sources, in accordance wit h local reg ulations.
3.9.3.4 Restart of study medication
Whenever possible, restart of rando mized study medicat ion shoul d be encouraged. However ,
if a pat ient has perm anent ly discont inued study  drug and a PTDV has been performed, study  
drug should not be restarted.
If pat ient has been treated with ery thropoi etin analogue as rescue, see Section 7.7.4 for 
guidance on whe n study  drug treatm ent can be restarted. 
3.9.3.5 End of study procedures
If a patient is unable to attend the EOS visit in person, telephone contact for CSE events, 
hospi talizati on, SAEs and vital status, should be made to ascertain endpoint and AE 
information. 
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
Patients are at any  time free to withdraw from the study  (i.e., discont inue study  medicati on 
perm anent ly and wi thdraw from  visit assessments), without prejudice to further treatment 
(withdrawal  of consent). Wi thdrawal  of consent from  the study  must be ascertained and 
docum ented by  the invest igator and recorded in the eCRF as well as in the wit hdrawal 
addendum to the informed co nsent form (ICF). The withdrawal addendum to ICFshould be 
signed and dated by  both the patient a nd the investigator, if possible. Such pat ients will always 
be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. The reason for permanent 
discontinuat ion of treatm ent wi th the study  medicati on and the date of the last intake of the 
study  medicat ion must be docum ented in the eCRF. 
To ensure validit y of study  data, i t is very  important to collect as much data as possible 
throughout the study  and especially  vital status (dead or alive) at the EOS. The invest igator or 
delegate will  therefore attem pt to co llect informat ion on all patients’ vital status from publicly 
available sources at the EOS visit, in accordance with local regulations ,even if Informed 
Consent has been withdrawn co mpletely.

50(100)3.10.1 Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulf il the eligibilit y criteria for the study , and 
therefore m ust not be randomized . These patients should have the reason for study  withdrawal 
recorded as ‘Incorrect Enrolment ’ (i.e., pati ent does not m eet the requi red inclusi on/exclusi on 
criteria). Thi s reas on for study  withdrawal is only valid for screen failures (not rando mized
patients).
3.10.2 Withdrawal of Informed Consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any time (invest igational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs. The Invest igator will fo llow up AEs outside of the clinical study . 
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrolment /randomi zation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. Patients who agree to 
continued study participation following investigational product discontinuation, 
including modified follow -up such as telephone calls or medical record review, hav e not 
withdrawn consent.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
A study  end date will be defined based on when the planned number of events are estimated to 
be accrued.
The study  may be stopped earlier if, in the judgment of AstraZeneca, the patients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings or for other reasons.
Regardless of the reason for study  terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion and fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discont inuat ion 
of treatm ent m ust be docum ented.
If terminat ing the study , the Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the 
protecti on of  the pati ents’ interests.
The independent DSMB will monitor the study  to ensure pati ent safet y.
4. STUDY PLAN AND TIMING OF PROCED URES 
During study  visits, all assessments including laboratory  tests and physical examinat ions 
shoul d be com pleted pri or to init iation of the hemo dialysis (HD) procedure in pat ients 
receiving HD. The EQ -5D
-5L qualit y of life assessment s should be completed prior to any  
intervent ion (e.g., start of dialysis in HD pat ients) and at approximately the same time of the 
day. Blood sam ples f or Hb m easurem ent and safety  laboratory  tests will  be obtained 
according to Study  Plan, Table 1.

should be done after dialysis to confirm eligibility.
r Receipt of the first dose of study drug defines Study Day 1.
s Randomization may occur up to 2 weeks after the scr eening period ends, in order to allow for synchronization with the patient`s existing dosing schedule
t Every 24 weeks should be calculated from week 48 for Intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) and from week 52 for Weight, Blood pres sure/Heart rate and 
EQ-5D

4.1 Enrolment/screening period
During the screening period, consent ing pat ients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibilit y 
criteria. Pati ents who do not m eet these criteria must not be randomized in the study . Pati ents 
must provide written Informed Consent before any screening tests or assessments are performed. 
Patients in screening current ly treated with erythropoiet in analogue will cont inue their exist ing 
erythropoi etin analogue therapy during the enrolment/screening period .
4.1.1 Screening Visits
Procedures will be performed according to the Study Plan, Table 1.
The screening period will consist of a minimum o f two visit s to be performed at least 7 days 
apart. All screening procedures should be co mpleted wi thin 6 weeks. The site must ensure that 
roxadustat and epoetin alfa are available at study  site before the randomizat ion visit is scheduled. 
The Hb inclusio n criteria will be based on central laboratory  assessments and may  be repeated 
during the screening per iod. Eligible pat ients should have two central laboratory Hbvalues 7 
days apart (during the screening period) .<12. g/dL in pat ients currently treated with an 
erythropoi etin analogue or <10.0 g/dL in patients not currently treated with an eryt hropoiet in 
analogue.
4.1.2 Additional screening assessments
If a patient’s laboratory  resul ts do not m eet the eligibilit y criteria or the pati ent is considered to 
have uncontrolled hypertensio n, the l aboratory  assessment may  be repeated wi thin the screening 
period. The visi ts must be at l east 7 day s apart. 
For example, an addit ional central  laboratory  Hb may be collected, if necessary, at least 7 days 
after the second screening visit if the screening visit 1 or visit 2 Hb level is ≥12 g/dL in patients 
currently treated with an ery thropoi etin analogue. Similarly an addit ional central  laboratory  Hb 
may be collected, if necessary, at least 7 days after the second screening visit if the screening 
visit 1 or visit 2 Hb level is ≥10 in pat ients not treated with epoetin alpha or ot her ery thropoi etin 
analogue for at least 4 weeks prior to visit 1.
Iron, vitamin B12 and fo late laboratory tests m ay be repeated during the screening period after 
supplementati on, if necessary . The l iver funct ion test (LFT) parameters may not be repeated if 
found excl usionary at screening wi thout a pri or approval  from the AstraZeneca study  physician 
unless the Invest igator has a valid reason to believe that the original lab result is due to an error 
(e.g. possible sample mix -up). Such repeat should be communicated to the AstraZeneca study  
physician as soon as possible. 
Instructi ons will be provided for collect ion and recording of baseline dialysis symptoms.
A screen -fail pat ient may  be re-screened if deemed appropriate by  the invest igator. Where 
possible, an approval should be obtained from the AstraZeneca study physician prior to re -
screening. Two rescreening periods are allowed.

4.2 Treatment period
Procedures will be performed according to the Study  Plan in Table 1.
The treatment period begins on the first day  of dosing wi th study  treatm ent (Day 1, week 0). Day  
1 is preferably  a scheduled treatm ent date accordi ng to the exist ing erythropoietin analogue 
treatm ent regimen.
The first day  of dosing should not occur less than 2 day s from the l ast dose of epoetin alfa or 
epoetin beta, less than 7 days since the last dose of darbepoetin alfa or less than 14 days since the 
last dose of Mircera®. All Day 1 study  assessm ents are to be performed prior to first study  drug 
administration; in hemodialysis pat ients, study  assessments should also be performed prior to or 
at initiation of the dialysis procedure for patients treated with epoetin alfa prior to randomizat ion. 
During the treatment period, the patient will be contacted by  telephone at week 1. Pati ent will 
attend study  visits every  2 weeks from  rando mization to week 20 and every 4 weeks thereafter 
until study  closure is declared. The patient’s next scheduled visit wil l then be the EOT visit, 
marking the end of the treatment period. At the EOT visit, the physicians caring for the patient 
will decide upon treatment the patient should receive as part of his/her ongoing clinical care.
The study  is event -driven and will be closed when the target number of CV events has been 
accrued. Treatment duration is est imated to be up to 4 years. 
In case of premature discont inuat ion of study  medicati on, see Secti on 3.9.
4.3 Follow -up period
Procedures will be performed according to the Study Plan, Table 1.
After the treatment period (ending with the EOT visit), patients will proceed to the 4- week post -
treatm ent follow-up peri od (ending with the EOS visit) .
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS
The Rave Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collect ion and query  
handling. The investigator will ensure that data are recorded in the electroni c Case Report Forms 
(eCRF) as specified in the study  protocol  and in accordance wi th the instructi ons provi ded.

5.2.4.1 Resting 12- lead ECG
Standard 12 -lead ECGs will be performed on all patients at specific time po ints as described in 
the Study  Plan, Table 1, as to l ocal routines. A singl e ECG will be taken after the patient has 
been rest ing in the supine posit ion for 5 minutes. Any abnormalit ies m ust be evaluated in clinical 
context (based on patient’s medical history  and conco mitant m edica tion) and the invest igator 
shoul d determine if it is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormalit ies should be 
reported as an AE.
Only the visit, ECG date, heart rate (HR), RR Interval, PR Interval, QRS Interval, QT Interval, 
overall interpret ation and relevant comments will be recorded in the eCRF. ECG recordings will 
be kept as source documents.
5.2.5 Vital signs
The vital signs, blood pressure and heart rate, will be assessed at the visits as described in the 
Study  Plan, Table 1and recorded in the eCRF.
5.2.5.1 Heart rate and blood pressure
At most visi ts, HR and BP will be measured according to usual clinical pract ice and recorded.
On specific visits indicated in Table 1
,HR and BP will be measured in triplicate after the patient 
has been comfortably at rest in a seated posit ion for at least 5 min. The position o f the pati ent 
shoul d be comfortabl e with the arm  where the blood pressure is recorded to b e within the level o f 
heart (the middle o f the cuff on the upper arm is at the level o f the right atri um (the midpoint of 
the sternum ). The pati ent will be instructed to relax as much as possible and to not talk during 
the measurement procedure. Preferably  measurement will be d one wi th an electroni c autom ated 
oscillo metri c device. The same device should preferably  be used for the pati ent during the course 
of the study  and in the same arm. Blood pressure will be measured in triplicate with at least one -
minute intervals between me asurements. In HD patients BP and HR will be assessed prior to 
initiation of the dialysis procedures. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients BP and HR will be 
assessed when they  com e to the clinic. All the three readings will be reported in the eCRF. 
The he art rate will be assessed by  pulse pal pation of  radial artery  for 30 s immediately  after each 
recording of the blood pressure. It could be also performed with an oscillo metric device if this is 
used for blood pressure measurement. The triplicate heart rate assessmen ts will recorded in the 
eCRF.
Blood pressure m easurem ents are to be obtained prior to init iation of each dialysis procedure.
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Patient reported outcomes
All study  patients will  be asked to com plete the Euro Qualit y of life (QoL) H ealth Utili ty Index 
questionnaire at time po ints indicated in the Study  Plan, Table 1. The questionnaires should be 
completed by  the pat ient prior any  other intervention.

61(100)5.3.1.1 EuroQol Health Utility Index –EQ-5D-
5L
TheEQ-5D- 5L is a self -reported questionnaire measuring utilit y values. The EQ -5D consists of 
the EQ -5D descript ive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ -5D descript ive 
system  com prises 5 dimensio ns of healt h: mobility; self -care; usual act ivities; pain/disco mfort; 
and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate 
probl ems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The VAS records the respondent's self -rated 
healt h status on a graduated (0 -100) scale, wher e the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable 
healt h state’ and ‘worst imaginable healt h state’ with higher scores for higher HRQoL. EQ 5D 
healt h states, defined by the EQ -5D descript ive system, may be converted into a single summary 
index by  applying a for mula that essentially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the 
levels in each dimensio n. The index can range from 1 for full healt h to 0 for being dead, but it 
can also be below 0 indicat ing a healt h state worse than being dead.
5.3.1.2 Administration of patient -reported outcome
All patient -reported outcomes (PROs) are paper -based and will be administered at baseline and 
according to Study  plan,Table 1and recorded in the eCRF.
Each center must allocate the res ponsibilit y for the administration of the quest ionnaire to a 
specific individual (e.g., a research nurse, study  coordinator) and if possible assign a back -up 
person to cover if that individual is absent. The AstraZeneca Study  Team  (or del egate) will 
provi de rel evant training in administration of the questionnaire. The significance and relevance 
of the data need to be explained carefully  to parti cipating patients so that they  are m otivated to 
comply with data collect ion.
The instructions for complet ion of t he PRO questionnaire are as fo llows:
 The EQ -5D- 5L must be completed prior to any other study  procedures (following 
Inform ed Consent) and before discussio n of disease progress to avoid biasing the 
patient’s responses to the questions. They must be completed in private by the patient
 The patient should be given sufficient time to complete at their own speed
 The patient should not receive help from relat ives, friends or clinic staff to answer the 
questionnaire. However, if the patient is unable to read the que stionnaire (e.g. is 
visually impaired) the quest ionnaire may be read out by  trained clinic staff and 
responses recorded
 On co mpletion of the questionnaire it should be handed back to the person responsible 
for questi onnaire who shoul d check for completenes s
 Only one answer should be recorded for each question
5.3.2 Hospitalizations 
Details on hospitalizat ions (including emergency room/skilled nursing facilit y use) will  be 
collected at each study  visit. Reason, admissi on, discharge dates and ty pe and reason for 
hospitalizati on will  be recorded in the eCRF. Details on hospitalizat ions will also be co llected at

5.4 Pharmacokinetics
5.4.1 Collection of samples
Venous blood samples (4 mL) for determination of roxadustat concentration in plasma will be 
collected at week 4 and week 8, only for patients taking roxadustat. Patients will be instructed 
NOT to take the study  medicati on on the day  of week 4 visi t (not necessary  for week 8). If a 
dose of the study  medicat ion is scheduled for that day , the dose can be given AFTER the 
collect ion of the blood sample. For both visits the date and time of sample co llection wil l be 
recorded as well as the last dosing date and time of study  medicati on. 
Samples will  be collected into appropriately  labelled tubes containing sodium -heparin as 
anticoagulant. Immediately  after collect ion, blood samples will be kept on melt ing ice unt il ready 
for centrifugat ion, which must be done within 30 minutes of collect ion. Bl ood sam ples will be 
centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 minutes at room temperature in order to obtain plasma. Plasma will 
be harvested and transferred into an appropriately labell ed amber polypropylene storage tube and 
stored at -20°C or below, within 30 minutes of centrifugat ion. Sam ples will  be stored frozen at 
the site until shipment. Samples will be sent to the central laboratory  packed wi th sufficient dry  
ice to keep the sampl es frozen. All applicable shipping regulat ions will be fo llowed. Further 
details will be provided in the laboratory  manual.
5.4.2 Determination of drug concentration
For the pati ents receiving roxadustat, samples for pharmacokinet ic (PK) determinat ion will be 
analysed by Covance on behalf of Clinical Bio analysis Alliance, AstraZeneca R&D, using 
validated bioanaly tical methods. Full details of the analy tical methods used will be described in a 
separate bioanalyt ical report.
The pl asma concentration data will be li sted, summarized on the basis of time intervals and 
plotted in scattering with t ime relat ive to the immediate preceding roxadustat dosing t ime. A 
popul ation PK analysis o f data collected in the CKD dialysis program will be performed using 
the non -linear mi xed-effects m odelling technique as outlined in a populat ion PK analysis plan.
5.4.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic samples
PK samples will be disposed of after the Bioanaly tical Report finalizat ion orsix months after 
issuance o f the draft Bi oanaly tical Report (whi chever is earlier), unless requested for future 
analyses.
Incurred sample reproducibilit y analysis, if any , will  be perform ed al ongside the bioanalysis of 
the test samples. The results fro m the evaluat ion will  not be reported in the Clinical Study  Report 
but separately in a Bioanalyt ical Report.

Pharmacodynamic samples will be disposed of during the study. 
5.6 Pharmacogenetics
Pharmacogenetic samples  
will be collected at baseline, i.e., at (week 0) randomization visit.
5.6.1 Collection of phar macogenetic samples
The patient’s consent to participate in the pharmacogenetic research components of the study is 
mandatory. Patients may participate in the study  without participating in genetic sampling. 
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at (week 0) 
randomization visit.  Alt hough genotype is a stable parameter, early sample collection is 
preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patient s who may withdraw due to an AE, 
such patient s would be important to include in any ge netic analysis. If for any reason the sample 
is not drawn at the randomization visit it may be taken at any visit un til the last study visit, 
before starting the closure period. Only one sample should be collected per patient for genetics during the study. 
Samples will be collected, labelled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.
5.6.2 Storage, re-use and destruction of pharmacogenetic samples
 
 
 The 
results of any further analyses will be reported eith er in the Clinical Study Report itself or as an

5.7 Biomarker analysis 
The patient’s consent to the use of donated biol ogical samples is mandatory. Patients may 
participate in the study without part icipating in biomarker sampling.  
Blood samples will be collected at baseline, i.e., at (week0, pre-dose ) randomization visit and at 
week 24 (at any time), and may be  analysed for exploratory biomarkers to assess correlations 
with disease activity, effects of study drug and clinical outcomes (including CV risk).
5.7.1 Storage, use, re-use and destruction of biological samples
Biological samples will be used for analyses of hsCRP and hepcidin. Samples for future research 
will be retained at AstraZeneca or its designee for a maximum of 15 years from the date of the 
Last Patient’s Last Visit, after which they will be destroyed.  The results of this biomarker 
research will be reported either in the Clinical Study Report itself or as an addendum, or separately in a scientific report or publication. The results of this biomarker research may be 
pooled with biomarker data from other studies with the study drug to generate hypotheses to be 
tested in future research.
5.7.2 Labelling and shi pment of biological samples
The Principal Investigator ensures that samples are labelled and shipped in accordance with the 
Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substan ce, Category B Regulations (materials containing 
or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), see Appendix 
C ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’.
Any samples identified as Infectious Cate gory A materials are not shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with AstraZeneca and appropriate labelling, 
shipment and containment provisions are approved.
5.7.3 Chain of custody of biological samples 
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. The Principal 
Investigator at each centre keeps full traceability of collected biolog ical samples from the 
patients while in storage at the centre until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and keeps 
documentation of receipt of arrival.
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival.CCI

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Invest igator is r esponsible for ensuring that all staff invo lved in the study  are 
familiar wit h the content of this sect ion.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condit ion or the deterioration of 
a pre -existing medical condi tion following or during exposure to a pharmaceut ical product, 
whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical condit ion can 
be symptom s (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abn ormal 
resul ts of an invest igation (e.g., laboratory  findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies, an 
AE can include an undesirable medical condit ion occurring at any  time, including run -in or 
washout periods, even if no study  treatm ent has been admini stered.

66(100)The term  AE is used to include bo th serious and non -serious AEs.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study  phase (i .e., screening, treatm ent and 
follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the foll owing cri teria:
 Results in death
 Is immediately life -threatening
 Requi res in -patient hospi talisat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talisat ion 
 Results in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y or substantial disrupt ion of the 
abilit y to conduct norm al life f unctions
 Is a congenital abnormalit y or birth defect
 Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the subject or may  require medical  
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definit ion of a SA E, see Appendix B to the Clinical Study  Protocol .
6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be co llected from the time o f signature of Inform ed Consent 
throughout the treatment period and in cluding the follow -up peri od.
Adverse Events (AEs) will be co llected fro m randomizat ion (after first dose of invest igational 
product) throughout the treatment period and including the follow -up peri od.
6.3.2 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that ar e unresolved at the fo llow up visit in the study  are f ollowed up by  
the Invest igator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in 
the eCRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request addit ional information for any  
patient wi th ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study , if judged necessary .
6.3.3 Variables 
The fo llowing variables will be collect for each AE;
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
 Intensit y or changes in intensit y.

67(100) The invest igator should use the National Cancer Insti tute (NCI) Commo n 
Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 . For terms not 
specified as part of NCI -CTCAE, the fo llowing guidelines should be used to determine 
grade: 
 Grade 1, Mild : Asymptomat ic or mild symptoms that the patient finds easily 
tolerated. The event is of little concern to the patient and/or of little -or-no clinical 
significance; clinical or diagnostic observat ions only; intervent ion not indicated
 Grade 2, Moderate: The pat ient has enough discomfort to cause interference with or 
change in so me of their age -appropri ate instrum ental  activities of daily living (e.g. 
preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing 
money); l ocal or non -invasive i ntervent ion indicated
 Grade 3, Severe: The patient is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in 
many or all usual activit ies. The event is of definit e concern to the patient and/or poses 
substant ial risk to the pati ent’s healt h or well -being; Like ly to requi re medical 
intervent ion and/or close fo llow
-up, including but not limited to hospitalizat ion or 
prolongati on of  hospi talizati on
 Grade 4, Life -threatening: The patient was at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred
 Grade 5, Death: Related to AE
Grade 4 & 5 are SAE criteria and are collected as SAE in the AE eCRF module. The fo llowing 
variables will be co llected:
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the Investigat ional Product (yes or no)
 Action taken with regard to invest igational product
 AE caused patient’s withdrawal fro m study  (yes or no)
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:

 Date of hospitalization
 Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to Study  procedure(s)
 Descript ion of AE
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe AEs. Severit y is a measure of intensit y 
whereas seriousness is defined by  the cri teria in Secti on 6.2. An AE of severe intensit y need not 
necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be 
considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Sect ion 6.2. On the 
other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disabilit y may be considered a mild 
stroke b ut would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Sect ion 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relat ionship between Invest igational Product and each 
Adverse Event, and answer ‘ye s’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do y ou consi der that there is a 
reasonable possibilit y that the event m ay have been caused by  the investi gational product?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medicat ion, study  procedures and 
additional study  drug. Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the 
causal relat ionship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Dto the C linical 
Study  Protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  the pati ent, care provider or reported in response to the open 
question fro m the study  personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous 
Visit/you were last asked?’ or revealed by  observati on will be collected and recorded in the 
eCRF. When co llecting AEs, the recording o f diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and ther e are other 
signs or symptom s that are not generally  part of  the di agnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom  will be recorded separately .

69(100)6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be summarised in the 
clinical study  report. Deteri oration as com pared to baseline in protocol -mandated l aboratory  
values, vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfil any o f the SAE criteria 
or are the reason for discontinuat ion of treatm ent wi th the invest igational product.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign will  
be consi dered as addit ional information. Wherever possible the reporting Invest igator uses the 
clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (e.g. anemia versus low hemoglobin value). In the 
absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non- mandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as AE(s).
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physic al examinat ion as 
compared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Liver enzymes
If a patient meets any of the fo llowing cri teria, please refer to Appendix Dfor further instructi on: 
AST ≥3x ULN, ALT ≥3x ULN, total bilirubin ≥2x ULN.
6.3.8 Disease progression
Disease progressi on can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condit ion attributable to the 
disease for which the invest igational product is being studied. It may be an increase in the 
severit y ofthe disease under study  and/or increases in the symptoms o f the disease. Worsening 
of CKD shoul d be considered a disease progression and not an AE and events, which are 
unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the s tudy.
6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the invest igational 
product, or to the study  procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the st udy, then Invest igators or other site personnel inform the 
appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day  i.e., immediately but no later than 24 
hours of when he or she becom es aware of i t
.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the I nvest igator to ensure that all the 
necessary  informat ion is provided within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life 
threatening events and within 5 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal  or life -threatening adverse even ts where important or relevant informat ion is missing, 
active fo llow-up is undertaken immediately . Investigators or other site personnel inform 
Clinical Study Protocol

70(100)AstraZeneca representatives of any  follow-up informat ion on a previously  reported SAE wi thin 
one cal endar day  i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becom es aware 
of it.
Once the Invest igators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, an 
autom ated em ail alert is sent to the desi gnated AstraZeneca representative.
Ifthe WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study  site personnel  reports a 
SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study  site personnel how to proceed .
The reference document for definit ion of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the AstraZeneca 
drug.
6.5 Overdose
The m aximum  tolerated dose of roxadustat has not been established in humans. For the purposes 
of this study , exceeding the m aximum  allowed dose specified in this CSP (3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg 
per administration, whichever is lower) represents an overdose.
An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the relevant AE 
modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.
An o verdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF module.
If an overdose on an AstraZeneca study  drug occurs in the course of the study , then the 
Invest igator or other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives im mediately, 
or no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Invest igator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided to AstraZeneca.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the s tandard reporting t imelines apply, see Sect ion 6.4. For 
other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.
6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca or its 
represen tative on the p regnancy form.
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study  invest igational product should be 
discontinued immediately .
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an adverse event unless there is a suspicio n that t he 
investigat ional product under study  may have interfered with the effect iveness of a contraceptive

71(100)medicat ion. Congenital abnormalit ies/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs. Elect ive abortions without complica tions shoul d not be handled 
as AEs. The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic 
pregnancy, normal birth or congenital abnormalit y) should be fo llowed up and docum ented even 
if the pat ient was discont inued fro m thestudy .
If any pregnancy  occurs in the course of the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day  i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she beco mes aware of it .
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant 
inform ation is provided within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and wi thin 
30days for all other pre gnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome informat ion is available.
6.6.2 Paternal exposure 
Pregnancy of the patient’s partners is not considered to be an adverse event. However, the 
outcom e of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective terminat ion, ectopic pregnancy, 
norm al birth or congeni tal abnorm ality) shoul d if possible be fo llowed up and documented as 
described in Section 6.6.1 . To capture informat ion about a pregnancy fro m the par tner of a male 
patient, the male patient’s partner consent must be obtained to collect informat ion related to the 
pregnancy and outcome; the male patient should not be asked to provide this informat ion.
6.7 Management of IP related toxicities 
Observed adverse effects demonst rated in nonclinical safet y studi es (refer to Section 4of the IB) 
following administration of roxadustat are primarily  caused by  an exaggerated pharmaco logical 
response, which can be managed in the clinical set ting. The dose algorithm will mit igate 
excessive Hb levels. 
If there are clinical concerns for excessive elevat ion in Hb levels, the invest igator may decide to 
perform  a therapeuti c phlebotomy  instead of, or in addit ion to, a dose hold. For overdose, see 
Secti on6.5.
6.8 Study governance and oversight
6.8.1 International coordinating investigator 
The Internat ional coordinat ing invest igator in collaboration with the sponsor will be responsible 
for the overall design, inte rpretati on, supervisio n, and reporting (presented at internat ional 
congresses and published in peer reviewed journals) of the study , including the development of 
the protocol and any  protocol  amendments.
6.8.2 Independent Endpoint Review Committee 
An Independen
t Endpoint Review Committee (IERC) will be appointed and will adjudicate 
potenti al endpoint events. The committee members will not have access to individual treatment

procedures applicable for the IERC will be detailed in a separate IERC charter.
6.8.3 Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent Data Safet y Moni toring Board (DSMB) committee will be appointed and will 
report to the International Coordinat ing Invest igator and sponsor. 
The DSMB will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of the patients in the outcome study  
by assessing the safet y of the intervent ion during the study , and for revi ewing the overall conduct 
of the clinical study . The DSMB will have acc ess to the individual treatment codes and will be 
able to merge these wit h the collected study  data while the study  is ongoing.
The DSMB charter will be prepared to detail precise roles and responsibilit ies and procedures to 
ensure the integrit y of the stu dy in the review of accumulat ing data and interactions with the 
International Coordinat ing Investigator and sponsor.

local regulati ons prevent reimbursement, Eprex will be centrally  supplied by AstraZeneca. In 
these centrally supplied countries only , pati ents requi ring Eprex doses >45,000 IU/week or 
15,000IU/administration should not be enrolled.
7.2 Dose and treatment regimens
7.2.1 Randomization
Eligible pat ients will be randomized to receive either roxadustat or epoetin alfa in a 1:1 ratio. 
Randomization schedules will be prospectively prepared. Automated randomization and 
assignment to treatment arm will be provided by IWRS/IVRS. The randomizat ion in this study  
will be stratified by country .
The number of tablet bottles (or amount of epoetin alfa supplied b y AstraZeneca) that will be 
dispensed may  vary depending on the dose. Dispensation will be managed by  IWRS/IVRS. The 
administration will be detailed on a dosing card. Doses administered will be recorded in the 
eCRF.
7.2.2 Dose and schedule
The first dose of stud y drug shoul d be administered on Day  1 (week 0), and will mark the 
beginning of the treatment period. This should correspond to a day  when the next dose of 
erythropoi etin analogue would have been administered in pat ient currently treated with 
erythropoi etin analogue. All rando mizat ion visit study  procedures including laboratory  blood 
draws are to be completed prior to administration of the first dose of study  drug. All dose 
adjustm ents shoul d be based on Hb values using Hemocue, a point -of-care device, at v isits 
specified in Table 1. Hb values will be recorded in the eCRF (screening) and IWRS (during 
treatm ent peri od).
Missed dose should not be replaced.
7.2.3 Dosing of Roxadustat
Roxadustat will be dosed orally three time s a week (TIW) throughout the treatment period unless 
dose reduction is required based on Hb levels. For hemodialysis patients, it is reco mmended that 
roxadustat is taken after completion of the hemodialysis sessio n
.
7.2.3.1 Patients treated with erythropoietin an alogue at study entry 
Patients randomized to roxadustat will discont inue any prior ery thropoi etin analogue therapy and 
start roxadustat. The starting dose of roxadustat will be based on the current ery thropoi etin 
analogue dose at screening visit 1 (Table 4). If  the mean hemoglo bin during the screening phase 
(e.g. the average of central laboratory  values at vi sit 1 and visi t 2 or the average of the values at 
visit 2 and the retest of visit 2 value, i f applicable) is less than 10 g/dL, the starting dose will be

74(100)increased by one dose step.  For example, a patient being treated with an average of 10,000 IU of 
epoetin alfa per week with a Hb value of 11 g/dL during the screening period would take 
roxadustat 150 mg orally , three tim es a week (TIW). In contrast, a patient being treated with an 
average o f 10,000 IU of epoetin alfa per week who had a screening Hb of 9 g/dL during the 
screening period would take roxadustat 200 mg orally TIW.

7.2.3.2 Patients not treated with erythropoietin analogue at study entry
The init ial roxadustat dose (administered TIW) is based on a tiered, weight -based dosing scheme 
(Table 5). For exam ple, a patient that has a dry  weight of 80 kg woul d initiate roxadustat 
treatm ent wi th 100 m g orally TIW.

Dose Increases and Reductions :
Dose increases ( ↑) and reductions (↓) are pre -setaccording to dose steps.
The dose steps are as follows: 20, 40, 50, 70, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 mg. 
Example: A dose increase at a dose of 70 mg results in 100 mg as the new dose. A dose reduction at a dose150 mg 
results in 100 mg as the new dos e. 
If patients on 20 mg TIW need dose reduction, change frequency to twice a week, i.e. 20 mg administered twice a 
week. If further dose reduction is needed, reduce frequency to once weekly, i.e. 20 mg administered once a week.
Note: Maximum dose is capp ed at the lower of 3.0 mg/kg or 400 mg per dose administration. 
Dose Adjustment for Excessive Erythropoiesis :
  If Hb increases by >2.0 g/dL within a 4 week period, the dose should be reduced by one dose step.
7.2.3.4 Dose adjustment for excessive erythropoies is 
Excessive erythropoi esisis defined in Table 6. In the event of excessive erythropoi esis, the dose 
may be adjusted, even on visit s without a dose adjustment review. In such cases, dose adjust ment 
reviews are t hen resumed at 4 -week intervals. If a dose adjustment review is scheduled on week 
18, then the next dose adjust ment review will be scheduled on week 24, since there is no 
scheduled visit on week 22.
7.2.3.5 Dose adjustments for excessive Hb ≥ 13.0g/dL
In the event of Hb value ≥13.0g/dL, dosing will immediately be put on hold. Resume dosing at a 
subsequent visit when Hb ≤11.9 g/dL, at a dose that is reduced by two dose steps. After dosing 
has been resumed, the dose adjustment reviews are then continued at 4 -week int ervals fo llowing 
the sam e princi ple as for excessive erythropoi esis.

destruction and return should be signed. Unused and/or returned investigational products should 
be destroy ed at the site according to l ocal regul ations.
7.7 Concomitant and other treatments 
7.7.1 Concomitant medications
Concomitant medicat ions are any  prescript ion or over -the-counter preparations, including herbal 
products and “natural remedies”, used by  a pati ent while participat ing in this clinical study . 
For all conco mitant m edicat ions, an indicat ion for its use should be provided. If the sta ted 
indicat ion is a non -specific condit ion, e.g. “rash”, documentation of the condit ion, as specific as 
possible, should be maintained in the pat ient’s clinical study  records as source documentation.
7.7.1.1 Statins
When coadministered with roxadustat, hy droxymeth ylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor 
(statin) exposure was increased 2 -to 3-fold. For patients rando mized to roxadustat, invest igators 
shoul d consider this interaction and local prescribing informat ion when deciding on the 
appropriate statin dose for individual pat ients, bearing in mind the impact of ethnicit y, other 
concomitant medicat ions, renal and hepatic funct ion. Goals of lipid lowering treatment should be 
maintained as clinically  indicated. The recommended maximum daily  statin doses are: 
simvas tatin 20 m g, atorvastatin 40 mg, rosuvastatin 10 mg, pravastatin 40 mg, fluvastatin 40 mg 
(20 m g if eGFR<30), pi tavastatin 2 mg (1 mg if eGFR<30).
7.7.1.2 Phosphate binders
When coadministered with phosphate binders, roxadustat exposure was reduced. Patients shoul d 
be advised to discuss with the investigator before changing their phosphate binder dose or dosing 
time. To optimize absorption of roxadustat, subjects should take roxadustat with at least 1 hour 
separation fro m their phosphate binder.
7.7.1.3 Herbal medicine
Useof herbal medicine during the study  is not prohibited but strongly  discouraged. All herbal 
and natural remidies should be reviewed by the investigator and if considered safe, may be 
allowed to continue at the same dose.

The fo llowing treatm ents/m edicati ons are prohibit ed during the study : 
 Any other invest igational drug: fro m rando mizat ion unt il EOS.
 Any ery thropoi etin analogue during the treatment period except for study medicat ion 
or rescue medication (see Sect ion 7.7.4.2 ) 
 Iron-chelat ing agents (e.g. deferoxamine/desferrio xamine, deferiprone, or deferaxirox 
therapy ): from 4 weeks pri or to screening until EOS
 Androgens: fro m rando mizat ion onwards until EOS
 Dapsone (at any  dose) from  rando mizat ion onwards unt il EOS
 Chronic doses of acetaminophen/paracetamo l >2.0 g/day  from randomizati on unt il 
EOS
7.7.3 Supplemental iron use
Oral iron supplementati on is allowed for both treatment arms without restrict ion. Oral  iron is 
recommended for dietary  suppl ementati on to support ery thropoi esis and as the first line for 
prevent ion and treatment of iron deficiency, unless the patient is intolerant to this route of 
treatm ent.
In subjects receiving roxadustat, the investigator may  initiate the use of an approved IV iron 
supplement if:
 A pat ient’s Hb level has not sufficiently responded to two or more dose increases of 
study  drug, and
 Ferri tin <100 ng/ml or transferring saturation (TSAT) <20%
Study  treatm ent may  cont inue during IV iron administration. Discont inuat ion of  IV iron 
supplementati on is recommended once the patient is no longer considered to be iron deficient 
(ferrit in >100 ng/mL and TSAT >20%). Use of IV iron will be recorded in the eCRF. In subjects 
receiving epoetin alfa, IV iron supplementation will be given according to standard of care. 
In addit ion to scheduled assessments ( Table 1) iron indices may  be assessed any time (via central  
lab) to evaluate iron storage status of the patients, if considered necessary by the investigator.
7.7.4 Rescue therapy guidelines
Rescue therapy  guidelines are provi ded to optimize the standardizat ion of rescue therapy  by 
investigators and to ensure the safet y of individual study  patients. Rescue therapy  shoul d be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
7.7.4.1 Red blood cell transfusion 
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusio n is allowed in either roxadustat or epoetin alfa treated patients if 
rapid correcti on of  anemia is required to stabilize the pat ient’s condit ion (e.g., acute hemo rrhage)

recorded in the eCRF.
7.7.4.2 Erythropoietin analogue administration in patients randomized to roxa dustat
For pati ents randomized to roxadustat, the invest igator m ay ini tiate use of an approved 
erythropoi etin analogue if all o f the following criteri a are m et:
 A pat ient’s Hb level has not sufficient ly responded to two or more dose increases or 
the maximu m dose limit o f the study  drug has been reached, and
 The patient’s Hb is <8.5 g/dL on two consecutive measurements drawn at least five 
days apart; and
 Clinical judgment does not suggest iron deficiency or bleeding as a cause of lack of 
response or rapid de cline in Hb (see 7.7.4.1 and 7.7.4.2 above for addressing these 
condi tions), and
 Reducing the risk of all immunization in transplant eligible pat ients and/or reduction 
of other RBC transfusio n-related ri sks is a goal
The patient is not allowed to be admini stered both an erythropoi etin analogue and study  drug at 
the sam e time. Treatm ent wi th an erythropoi etin analogue should be stopped when Hb >9 g/dL 
or after a 4 -week cycle has been co mpleted, whichever co mes first. Study  treatm ent shoul d be 
resum ed after t he fo llowing intervals:
 Two days after stopping epoetin 
 One week after stopping darbepoetin alfa 
 Two weeks after stopping methoxy po lyethylene glyco l-epoetin beta (Mircera)
If more than one cycle of ery thropoi etin analogue rescue is required, the invest igator shoul d 
perm anent ly discont inue study  drug. Use of ery thropoietin analogues will be recorded in the 
eCRF.
Note: For pati ents randomized to epoetin alfa, the investigator may  initiate use of a different 
erythropoi etin analogue if clinically indicated. Use of the different ery thropoi etin analogue will 
be recorded in the eCRF and will be considered rescue therapy .
7.7.4.3 Therapeutic Phlebotomy
If there are clinical concerns for a patient due to excessive elevat ion in Hb levels, the invest igator 
may decide to per form a therapeuti c phlebotomy  instead of, or in addit ion to, a dose hold. This 
shoul d be docum ented and di scussed wi th the study  AstraZeneca study  physician.

8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES BY ASTRAZENECA
8.1 Statistical considerations
Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives. A comprehensive SAP will be 
prepared prior to database lock.  It is recognized that Regulatory  Authorities might requi re 
different efficacy  and/or safet y endpo ints or al ternate analyses for approval. The endpoints and 
analyses described in this protocol are intended for the US (FDA) submissio n. Regio nal SAPs 
will fully  describe any changes to endpoint s or analyses that differ fro m those described in this 
protocol . 
8.2 Sample size estimate
Primary efficacy variable: With at least 600 subjects, the study  will provide at l east 99% power 
to demonstrate non -inferiorit y of roxadustat versus epoetin alfa for the primary efficacy  endpoint 
(i.e., Hb change fro m baseline to the average level during the evaluat ion peri od defined as Week 
28 until Week 52). This assumes a difference (roxadustat minus epoetin alfa) of 
-0.30 g/dL, a 
non-inferiorit y margin for this differ ence of -0.75 g/dL and a standard deviat ion of 1.25 g/dL.
To contribute adjudicated CV events for the pooled CV analyses across the phase 3 program: 
approximately  2000 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either roxadustat or active 
control , i.e. epoetin alfa. The sample size for this study  is driven by  the overall requirement of 
adjudicated CV events for the phase 3 program in dialysis -treated CKD subjects (which consists 
of four studi es in total targeting 611 subjects with MACE events). The three other studies in the 
study  program  are FG -4592 -064, 1517 -CL-0613, FG-4592- 063. 
Further informat ion related to the sam ple size determination can be found in the study  stati stical 
analysis plan and the pooled statistical analysis plan.

81(100)8.3 Definitions of anal ysis sets
8.3.1 Intention to Treat Analysis Set (ITT )
All subjects who have been rando mized to study treatment will be included irrespective o f 
their protocol  adherence and cont inued participat ion in the study . Subjects will be analysed 
according to their rando mized study  medicati on irrespect ive of intake of study  medicati on.
8.3.2 Per Protocol Set (PPS)
All rando mized subjects without important protocol deviations and who have received at least 
8 weeks of study  treatm ent and have valid corresponding Hb measurements f rom the central  
laboratory  will be included in the PPS. Subjects will be analysed according to their 
rando mized study medication irrespect ive of intake of study  medicat ion. Subjects with an 
important protocol deviat ion will be included in the PPS up to the time point when the 
violation was met. For criteria for PPS exclusio n, see Table 1 in the SAP. Further details o f 
important protocol deviat ions are available in a Protocol Deviat ion Plan. Subjects will be 
censored at the earliest of date of an important p rotocol deviat ion, the EOS visit, or last intake 
of study  drug . 
8.3.3 Safety analysis set ( SAS)
All subjects who received at least one dose of randomized study  drug will be included in the 
Safety Analysis Set. Throughout the safet y resul ts secti ons, erroneously treated subjects will 
be accounted for in the actual treatment group. If a subject has received both treatments, only 
the init ial period will be ut ilized. On-treatm ent analyses will be emphasized .
8.3.4 Full Analysis Set (FAS)
The FAS consist sof all subjects i n the ITT analysis set who received at least one dose of 
study drug an d have baseline and at least one post -dose Hb assessment. If actual study 
medicat ion received differs fro m the randomized treatment arm, the rando mized treatment 
arm will be used for ana lysis for the FAS.  This analysis set is primarily used for EX -US 
submissio ns
8.3.5 Subjects who will not be included in any analysis sets
Subjects or sites ident ified prior to Database lock (breaking of Sponsor blindness , open -label 
study ) with major Good Clini cal Practi ce vi olations and where the integrit y of the data is 
strongly  questi oned through thorough independent investigat ions will be excluded from all 
analyses and all analysis sets. This includes but are not limit ed to subjects who have been 
ident ified to be part of a potential fraud invest igation, subjects who have not signed an 
inform ed consent, subjects randomized in error (e.g. a subject considered to be a screen fail 
but by  mistake randomized in the IWRS due to a technical error). Further, subjects being 
rando mized more than once will only contribute to the analysis one time. These patients will 
be analyzed according to their first assigned randomizat ion number and treatment code. All 
AE’s reported for the subjects will be assigned to the subject ´s first randomizat ion number. 
All subjects excluded fro m all analysis sets will be properly  documented

82(100)8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Primary efficacy endpoint:
USFDA: The primary efficacy endpo int is the mean change from baseline in Hb averaged 
over week 28 to week 52. A mult iple imputati on approach wi th analysis o f covariance 
(ANCOVA) will be applied as a method to handle missing data. Details of the ANCOVA 
multiple imputation are prov ided in the SAP .
Hb results obtained from the central laboratory  will be u sed for all Hb efficacy analyses. 
Baseline Hb is defined as the mean o f the three last central  laboratory  Hb val ues f rom the 
screening and randomization visit s.
Hb values under the influence of a rescue therapy  will not be censored .
EU health authorities: The primary efficacy endpoint is the mean change fro m baseline in 
Hb averaged over week 28 to week 36, without having received rescue therapy (i.e. RBC 
transfusio n for all subjects or ESA for subjects treated with roxadustat) within 6 weeks prior 
to and du ring thi s 8-week evaluat ion peri od.
8.4.2 Hb related s econdary efficacy endpoints :
The Hb related secondary  efficacy endpo intsare:
The EU primary  endpoint is the first secondary  efficacy endpo int.
Mean change in Hb fro m baseline to the subjects mean level betw een week 28 to week 
52 in subjects with baseline high
-sensi tivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) greater than 
the Upper Limit Normal (ULN )
Proporti on of  total  time of Hb ≥10 g/dL from  week 28 to week 52. The proportion of 
total time will be com puted as fo llows: For each subject, the recorded Hb values will 
first be linearly interpolated between measurements. The ti me this interpolated curve is 
≥10 g/dL will be co mputed and subsequent ly divided by the t ime between the 
measurements at week 28 and week 52. Patients wit hout any  Hb measurements from 
week 28 will not be considered for this variable .
Proporti on of  total  time of Hb wit hin the interval of 10 -12 g/dL from  week 28 to week 
52. The proportion of total time will be co mputed as fo llows: For each subject, the 
recorded Hb values will first be linearly interpo lated between measurements. The time 
this interpol ated curve is wi thin 10 -12 g/dL will be comp uted and subsequent ly 
divided by the time between the measurement at week 28 and week 52. Patients 
without any  Hb measurements from week 28 will not be considered for this variable.

8.5 Adjudicated CV Events Analyses for Safety Assessments 
TheCVevents described in Sect ion 
5.2.1 will be adjudicated by the Independent Event
Review Committee (IERC) according to the IERC charter. The same adjudication co mmitte e
will be used four phase 3 studies, FG -4592-064, 1517- CL-0613, FG -4592 -063, and 
D5740C00002, in the CKD -DDprogram . Analyses of these adjudicated events are described 
ina separate pooled analysis plan.
8.6 Methods for statistical analyses
A detailed Statist ical Anal ysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database lock. Any  
significant changes to the analys es described in this proto col will be highlighted in the SAP 
and th e Clinical Study Report (CSR). Moreover , further details o f the stati stical analyses are

CV history  at baseline will be defined for subjects with history  of any of the following 
diseases:
Myocardial  infarct ion
Percutaneous coronary  intervent ion
Coronar y artery  bypass
Cardi ac failure congestive
Ischaemic stroke
Haem orrhagic stroke
Cerebrovascular accident 
8.6.2 Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint for US
Mean change in Hb fro m baseline to the subjects mean level fro m week 28 to week 52 will 
analyzed with multiple imputation ANCOVA as described in the SAP. The model will contain 
terms for the baseline Hb measurement, treatment arm, CV history , geographic region and 
dialysis durat ion. Non -inferiorit y of roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa will be declared, and 
this test as successful, if the lower bound of the 2- sided 95% confidence interval of the 
difference between roxadustat and epoetin alfa exceeds -0.75 g/dL. The ITT analysis set will 
be used .
8.6.3 Analysis of t he primary efficacy endpoint for EU (Secondary Endpoint for 
FDA)
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for EU i s Hb change from  baseline (BL) to the average Hb of 
weeks 28 to 36, without having received rescue therapy  (i.e. RBC transfusio n for all subjects 
and ESA for roxadustat subjects) within 6 weeks prior to and during this 8 -week evaluation 
periodand will be analysed using MMRM. The model will contain terms for the baseline Hb 
measurement, treatment arm, visit, visit by treatment, CV history , geographi c regi on and 
dialysis durat ion. Data up to visit of We ek 52 will be included in the model. Non-inferiorit y of 
roxadustat compared to epoetin alfa will be declared, and this test as successful, if the lower 
bound of the 2- sided 95% confidence interval of the difference between roxadustat and 
epoetin alfa excee ds -0.75 g/dL . The PPS will be used for non-inferiorit y.In addit ion to the 
comparison based on the PPS populat ion, to address the formal test for non- inferiorit y, resul ts 
will also be provided based on the FAS populat ion, to allow also for a potential sup eriority 
comparison. The latter test is not part of the formal testing sequence.

The CV safet y evaluat ion strategy  is to conduct pooled analyses of adjudicated data across the 
study  program  to ensure that the overall number of events is high enough to provide adequate 
power. Thus, all analyses of CV safet y will be conducted in accordance with the PSAP .
8.6.5 Analysis of the s econdary efficacy endpoints
Secondary  efficacy endpo ints will be tested using a fixed sequence approach to adju st for 
multiple testi ng. If the p -value from a test is less than 0.05, the test will be declared as 
successful and the analysis will cont inue to the next comparison in the sequence. Formal 
statist ical hypothesis testing will be stopped as soon as a test is accompanied by a p -value 
≥0.05. The PPS will be used on the first secondary endpo intfor non-inferiorit y, on treatment 
analysis will be used on the secondary  endpoint related to RBC transfusio nas rescue therapy , 
and the ITT analysis set will be used for all the remaining secondary endpo ints. 
1.The EU primary  endpoint for non -inferiorit yis the first secondary efficacy endpo int 
for FDA (see above).
2.Mean change fro m baseline in LDL cholesterol to week 24 will be analysed using 
ANCOVA. Baseline Hb and baselin e LDL will  be used as covari ates and treatm ent 
groups, CV history , geographi c regi on and di alysis durati on as fixed effects. 
Superi ority will be declared if the upper bound of the 2
-sided 95% confidence interval 
of the difference between roxadustat and epo etin alfa exceeds 0. 
3.Mean change in Hb fro m baseline to the subjects mean level fro m week 28 to week 52 
in subjects wi th baseline hsCRP greater than the Upper Limit Normal (ULN) will be 
analysed analogously as the primary  efficacy  endpoint. Superi ority ofroxadustat 
compared to epoetin alfa will be declared, and this test as successful, if the lower 
bound of the 2- sided 95% confidence interval of the difference between roxadustat and 
epoetin alfa exceeds 0 g/dL.
4.Proporti on of  total  time of interpol ated Hb values ≥10 g/dL from week 28 until week 
52 will be est imated for each subject and used as dependent variable. The difference 
between roxadustat and epoetin alfa will be co mpared using ANCOVA. Baseline Hb 
will be used as a covariate and the treatment group s, CV history , geographi c regi on 
and dialysis durat ion as fixed effects. Non -inferiority  between the groups will be 
declared, and this test as successful, if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence 
interval  of the difference between roxadustat and ep oetin alfa exceeds -0.15.
5.Proporti on of  total  time of interpolated Hb values within the interval 10 -12 g/dL from  
week 28 until week 52 will be estimated for each subject and used as dependent 
variable. The difference between roxadustat and epoetin alfa wil l be co mpared using

copy  of the eCRF will be archived at the study  site when the study  has been locked.
When the co mpleted paper Case Report Forms for the PRO questionnaire has been completed 
by the Patients, the data are to be entered ongoing into the eCRF by the site staff.
Dictionary coding
Adverse events and medical/surgical history  will be cl assified according to the termino logy of 
the latest version the Medical Dict ionary for Regulatory  Activit ies (MedDRA). Medicat ions 
will be classified according to the latest version of the AstraZeneca Drug Dict ionary. 
Classificat ion coding will be performed by  the Medi cal Coding Team at the AstraZeneca Data 
Management Centre.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Recon ciliation
SAE reconciliat ion reports are produced and reconciled wit h the Patient Safet y database 
and/or the invest igational site.
Data associated with human biological samples
Data associated with bio logical samples will be transferred from laboratory (ies) internal  or 
external to AstraZeneca. 
Management of external data
The data collected through third party  sources will be obtained and reconciled against study  
data. The AstraZeneca Data Management Centre determines the format of the data to be 
received f rom external  vendors and coordinates the flow of data to an external environment or 
clinical database (if applicable). The AstraZeneca Data Management Centre will ensure that

10. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY REQUIREMENTS
10.1 Ethical conduct of the study
The study  will be perform ed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Hel sinki and are consistent with ICH/Good Clinical Pract ice, applicable 
regul atory  requi rements and the AstraZeneca policy  on Bi oethics and Hum an Bi ological  
Samples.
10.2 Patient data protection
The Informed Consent Form will incorporate (or, in so me cases, be acc ompanied by  a 
separate document incorporating) wording that complies wit h relevant data protection and 
privacy  legislat ion.
AstraZeneca will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to subjects, any  insurance com pany, 
any emplo yer, their family members, gen eral physici an or any  other thi rd party , unless 
requi red to do so by  law.
Precauti ons are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to the 
ident ity of the subject. In except ional circumstances, however, certain individuals mig ht see 
both the genet ic data and the personal ident ifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a 
medical emergency, an AstraZeneca physician or an Invest igator might know a subject’s 
ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data. Also Regul atory  authori ties may 
requi re access to the relevant files, though the subject’s medical informat ion and the genet ic 
files woul d rem ain physically  separate.
10.3 Ethics and regulatory review
An Ethi cs Committee/Inst itutional Review Board (IRB) shoul d approve th e final study  
protocol , including the final versio n of the Informed Consent Forms and any other written 
inform ation and/or m aterials to be provided to the patients. The Invest igator will ensure the 
distribut ion of these documents to the applicable Ethics C ommittee, and to the study  site staff.
The opinio n of the Ethics Co mmittee/Inst itutional Review Board should be given in writ ing. 
The Investigator should submit the written approval to AstraZeneca before enrolment of any 
patient into the study . 
The Ethi csCommittee/Inst itutional Review Board should approve all advert ising used to 
recrui t pati ents f or the study .
AstraZeneca should approve any  modificati ons to the Informed Consent Forms that are 
needed to meet local requirements.

90(100)If required by  local regulat ions, the protocol should be re -approved by the Ethics Co mmittee 
annually.
Before enrolment of any patient into the study , the nat ional regulatory  authori ty will approve 
the final study  protocol , including the final versio n of the Informed Consent Forms, o r a 
notification to the nat ional regulatory  authori ty is done, according to local regulations.
AstraZeneca will handle the distribut ion of any of these documents to the national regulatory  
authori ties.
AstraZeneca will provide Regulatory  Authori ties, Ethic s Commit tees and Principal 
Invest igators with safety updates/reports according to local requirements.
Each Principal Investigator is responsible for providing the Ethics Co mmit tees/IRB wi th 
reports of any  serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study  conducted 
with the invest igational product. AstraZeneca will provide this informat ion to the Principal 
Invest igator so that he/she can meet these reporting requirements.
10.4 Informed consent
The Principal Invest igator(s) at each centre will:
 Ensure each patient is given full and adequate oral and written informat ion about 
the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study
 Ensure each patient is notified that they  are f ree to di scontinue fro m the study  at any  
time
 Ensure that each patien t is given the opportunit y to ask questions and allowed time 
to consi der the inform ation provi ded
 Ensure each patient provides signed and dated Informed Consent before conducting 
any procedure specifically for the study
 Ensure the original, signed Informed Consent Form(s) i s/are stored i n the 
Invest igator’s Study  File

Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would res ult in the 
subject ’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AEoccurred in a more severe 
form it might have caused death (eg, hepatit is that resolved wit hout hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpati ent treatm ent in an emergency room is not i n itself a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissio ns and/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject wasenrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations whe re important m edical events may  not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi talisat ion, disabili ty or incapaci ty but may jeopardize the subject or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion ofserious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortiso ne 
treatm ent
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by paracetamo l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatm ent wi th N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospitalisat ion

95(100)A GUIDE TO INTERPRETING THE CAUSALITY QUESTION
When making an assessment of causalit y consi der the fo llowing factors when deciding if there
is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE m ay have been caused by the drug.
 Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the subject actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the su spect drug?
 Consistency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
proper ties?
 De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by another aetio logy 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
 Re-challenge experi ence.  Di d the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally 
recommend or support a re-challenge .
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship .
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if fo llowing a review of the re levant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expressio n 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relat ionship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be asse ssed as ‘not related’.
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

Labelling and shipment of biohazard samples
International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 
3categori es(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm ).
For transport purposes the classificat ion of infect ious substances according to risk groups was 
removed from  the Dangerous Goods Regulat ions (DGR) in th e 46th edit ion (2005). Infect ious 
substances are now classified eit her as Category  A, Category B or Exem pt. There is no direct 
relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form tha t, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals. Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
 are to be packed and shipped in accordance wit h IATA Instructi on 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusio n in Category  A. Category  B pathogens are eg, Hepatit is A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Hum an immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ty pes 1 and 2. They are assigned the fo llowing UN 
number and proper shipping name:
 UN 3373 -Biological  Substance, Category  B
 are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650
Exempt -all other materials wit h minimal risk of containing pathogens
 Clinical trial samples will fall into Category  B or exempt under IATA regulations
 Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported at ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging 
(http://www.iata.org/whatwedo/cargo/dangerous_goods/infectious_substances.htm )
 Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry -ice content
 IATA co mpliant courier and packaging material s shoul d be used for packing and 
transportation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as 
applicable
 Samples routinely transported by  road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
requi re that they  are al so packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way  to 
contain any  risk of infect ion or contaminat ion by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment m aterials at all times. The IATA 650 bio logical  sample

97(100)Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Combined Increase of 
Aminotransferase and Total Bilirubin -Hy’s Law
1. INTRODUCTION
During the course of the study  the Invest igator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry .  The invest igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
The Investigator participates, together with AstraZeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria ar e met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  the Invest igational 
Medicinal Product (IMP). 
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/H L cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the outcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2. DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2xULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  medicat ion  irrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase 
(ALP). The el evations do not have to occur at the same t ime or within a specified time frame.
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN  together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  The el evati ons do not have to occur at the same t ime 
or wi thin a specified time frame.
3. IDENTIFICATION OF PO TENTIAL HY’S LAW CAS ES
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perform a comprehensive revi ew of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
 AST ≥ 3xULN
 TBL ≥ 2xULN
When a pat ient meets any of the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in combination, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to AstraZeneca 
representative).

Date 19 September 2018
98(100)The Investiga tor will also rem ain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the 
ident ificat ion criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  the central  laboratory
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  CRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts the Invest igator 
will wit hout del ay:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Sectio n 2of this Appendix 
for definit ion) by reviewing laboratory  reports from all previous visits (including 
both central and local laboratory  resul ts)
4. FOLLOW -UP
4.1 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not met
If the patient do es not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will:
 Inform  the AstraZeneca representative that the patient has not met PHL criteria.
 Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol .
4.2 Potential Hy’s Law Criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investi gator will:
 Notify  the AstraZeneca representative who will then inform the central Study  Team  
The Study  Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  patients’ follow
-up and the continuous review of data. Subsequent to 
this contact the Invest igator will:
 Moni tor the pati ent until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated 
 Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform diagnostic investigat ions as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician
 Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as information becomes available 
 If at any  time (in consulta tion wi th the Study  Physici an) the PHL case meets serious 
criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures

99(100)5. REVIEW AND ASSESSMEN T OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW 
CASES
The instructions in this Section should be fo llowed for all cases where PHL crite ria are m et.
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by  the 
IMP. The AstraZeneca Medical Science Director and Global Safet y Physician will also be 
involved in this review together with other subject matter experts as appropriate. 
According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Invest igator will fo llow the 
instructi ons bel ow.
If there isan agreed alternat ive explanat ion for the ALT or AST and TBL elevat ions, a 
determinat ion of whether the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE will be made and subsequent ly 
whether the AE meets the criteria for a SAE:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE, record the AE /SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and fo llow the AZ standard processes
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to AstraZeneca standard 
processes. 
The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to 
assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no 
alternat ive explanat ion unt il such time as an informed decisio n can be made:
 Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and 
causalit y assessment as per above
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan. Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met. Update the SAE report according to the 
outcom e of the re view

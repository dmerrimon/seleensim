• Monitoring of serious adverse events  (SAEs) , adverse drug reactions , TEs, and 
TEEs  caused by the octaplas™ used for plasma exchange . 
Secondary Endpoint (s): 
• Safety laboratory parameters ( Complete Blood Count ( CBC ), the ‘Chem 7 ’ lab panel 
(Chem 7) , and ionized calcium).   
• Investigator’s assessment of overall safety . 
Summary of Study Procedures and Statistical Analysis Plan: 
Study Procedures:  
Screening:  
At Screening , pediatric patients who require TPE will be identified and informed consent 
will be obtained from the patient or from the legal representative(s) or guardian(s) of the 
patient.  If children are old enough (age usually deemed by each institution) to understand 
the risks and benefits of the study, they should also be informed and provide their written 
assent. The patient’s eligibility will be reviewed based on the inclusion and excl usion 
criteria . A physical examination will be performed , medical history (including current  
relevant concomitant medications ) reviewed , and demographic data  will be recorded. 
Blood samples will be drawn to assess safety parameters (CBC and Chem 7) includi ng the 
patient’s ABO blood group type . A pregnancy test for females who have experienced 
menarche will be performed prior to enrollment .  
1-Week (7-Day) Study Treatment Period:  
The total treatment period will be a maximum of one week  (i.e., 7 days) . Within this period, 
TPE procedure (s) information (e.g., start and stop time of the  TPE) will be documented ,

ionized calcium levels  and the total volume (dose in mL/kg) of  octaplas™ used per infusion 
episode for each patient will be recorded. The type of machine used for TPE will also be 
recorded.    
Within 24 hours before  each TPE procedure , vital signs will be assessed , and blood will be 
drawn for safety labs ( CBC and  Chem 7 ) and for ionized calcium levels. If multiple vital 
signs, and/or laboratory assessments are made before and after the TPE, the assessment 
taken most proximal to the start (pre) and after the end of the TPE (post) should be recorded 
in the case report form ( CRF ). ADR s and changes in concomitant medications will be 
recorded.  
Follow -Up: 
All SAEs, ADRs, TEs  and TEEs  will be recorded with start and stop dates and therapy 
(physical or concomitant medication) for treatment, if applicable , throughout the study 
period . Any other products administered concomitantly and deemed relevant by the treating 
physician during the study  period  should carefully be documented.  At 24 hours after each 
TPE, an ionized calcium reading will be used to assess for citrate toxicity a nd the 
Investigator will provide an assessment of overall safety for the patient’s treatment . 
After the final follow -up for the last TPE in the 1 -week (7-day) study treatment  period , the 
clinical phase  of the study  is considered completed for the patient.  No further study -related 
assessments will be performed, unless safety concerns (e.g., on -going ADRs ) require 
follow -up. 
Statistical Analysis  Plan : 
The primary endpoint  for this study is the rate of occurrence of SAEs, ADRs, TEs, and 
TEEs caused by the octaplas™ used for plasma exchange  during the 7 -day study period . 
All data collected will be summarized and presented descriptively to facilitate the review 
of population homogeneity . Additional review in specific age sub -groups will be performed 
if possible.  No confirmatory hypothesis testing is planned. Any p -value or confidence 
interval presented is to be understood in the exploratory sense.  
All safety parameters will be presented descriptively in full detail, by age group  as well as 
in total.  The safety assessment will include  the occurrence of SAEs , ADRs , TEs and TEEs . 
To facilitate the detection of any possible safety signal, all ADRs  will be characte rized and 
analyzed by seriousness, severity, relation to study drug  and timely relationship to study 
drug administration.  In addition to these pre -planned categories the collected data will be 
examined to identify additional characteristics of interest  such as e.g. particular indications 
for TPE , relevant concomitant medications, or Standardi zed MedD RA Queries ( SMQs )

covering a noticeable number of events.  The rates of ADRs  will be presented for such 
categories, together with the associated 95% confidence intervals, again per age group and 
in total.  
Individual patient profiles  or tabulations  will be generated, displaying the baseline 
characteristics as well as all interventions, treatment details and relevant measurements on 
a time scale.  This will facilitate the review of each individual course of treatment by a 
medical expert to detect any safety signal that might not be reflected in the ADR  rates.  
Vital sign measurements (absolute values and change from pre -TPE) will be summarized 
by descriptive statistics.  All measurements outside age-specific thresholds will be listed 
and reviewed individually.  
All safety laboratory data  (CBC, Chem 7 , and ionized calcium)  will be presented 
descriptively per time po int. All measurements outside age-specific thresholds will be 
listed and reviewed individually.  
All data will be presented in total as well as in sub –groups reflecting the age , gender, 
underlying diagnosis, and/or most relevant medical history and concomitant medications  
as appropriate .

 Page 12 of 50 1 INTRODUCTION  
octaplas™  is a solvent/detergent (S/D) treated and pooled human plasma prepared from units 
of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) pooled according to their ABO blood group. It contains the 
normal constituents of FFP. octaplas™  is a further development of octaplas® which is 
marketed in Europe since 1992. In January of 2013, octaplas™  received regulatory approval 
by the Food and Drug Administration for the U.S. market. For octaplas™ , a new prion 
affinity chromatography column was implemented  in the manufacturing process of the 
product to eliminate potential prion proteins. Furthermore, the time of S/D treatment in the 
manufacturing process has been shortened from 4 –4.5 hours to 1 –1.5 hours. Th ese measure s 
increase the concentration of  plasmin inhibitor and slightly increases  the concentration of  
Protein S compared with octaplas®. octaplas™  has obtained marketing authorization in 
Australia, Germany , Portugal, the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, 
Sweden, Finland,  Switzerland , Malta , and Canada . octaplas® is regis tered in 21 countries 
and octaplas™  is registered in 13 countries including the United States.  
octaplas™  does not contain red blood cells  (RBCs) , leukocytes and platelets. The RBCs  and 
cell fragments are removed in several filtration steps during the productions process. 
Therefore, adverse reaction s caused by the presence of these cells  (e.g., immunization 
against RBC  antigens or febrile non -hemolytic reactions from cytokines libera ted by 
leukocytes ) are not expected to be associated with the infusion of this  product.  
Virus inactivation is performed using the S/D treatment method  using the  virus inactivating 
reagents 1% tri(n -butyl)phosphate (TNBP) and 1% Triton  X-100 (Octoxynol). This virus 
inactivation procedure is effective against enveloped viruses such as Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus , Hepatitis B Virus and Hepatitis C Virus . The effica cy of this virus 
inactivation procedure has been shown in several validation studies . The S/D treatment has 
no effect on non -enveloped viruses such as Hepatitis A Virus ( HAV ) and parvovirus B19. 
However, the presence of neutralizing antibodies towards HAV and B19 in the starting 
plasma and the final product, result in immune neutralization and passive immunization 
which both serve to limit or prevent virus replication and thereby infection in recipients . [1]  
The virus inactiv ating reagents (TNBP and Octoxynol) are removed through liquid and solid 
phase extraction. However  toxicity studies performed in rats and dogs have shown that 
possible trace amounts  are of no toxicological relevance  to humans . Furthermore, no 
teratogenic, embryotoxic or mutagenic effects of TNBP and Octoxynol were observed in the 
toxicity studies performed.  
In total, 15 prospective clinical studies and 9 retrospective studies with octaplas®/octaplas™  
have been conducted. Of the 15 prospective s tudies, 2 were focused on safety aspects only, 
and of the 9 retrospective trials, 3 were mainly studying efficacy. In total, about 495 patients 
have been enrolled in the pro - and retrospective efficacy  studies, including one observational 
study, and the pa tients were exposed to 2592 infusion episodes with octaplas®/octaplas™  or 
Uniplas (a plasma formulation compatible with all ABO blood groups ). 
octaplas™  was developed as an alternative to plasma in order to reduce the risk for a possible  
virus transmission . In addition, the product was developed in order to meet the request for a 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 13 of 50 standardi zed, cell free plasma for infusion  that contains high levels or pro - and anti -
coagulants , in order to improve the therapeutic efficacy and reduce adverse reactions.  
1.1 Ration ale for Conducting the Study  
This Post-Marketing Requirement (PMR) study was requested by the F ood and Drug 
Administration  after octaplas™  received marketing approval in the United States. This PMR 
study is planned to be conducted  in a minimum of 40 pediatric patients  from ≥2 to  20 years 
of age who need therapeutic  plasma exchange  (TPE) . 
The study is intended to obtain additional safety information  on octaplas™  in a routine 
clinical setting via the assessment of adverse drug reactions  (ADRs) , thrombotic events 
(TEs), and thromboembolic events (TEEs) and will be conducted in compliance with the 
protocol , ICH -GCP and other regulatory  requirements .  
1.2 Dose Rationale  
octaplas™  is for intravenous use only. Please refer to the package insert of octaplas™  for 
further information regarding dose.   
1.3 Benefit -Risk Statement  
There are several benefits associated with the administration of octaplas™ . octaplas™  has 
undergone additional steps for viral inactivation and removal. The combination of the S/D 
treatment and immune neutralization ensures a high degree of viral safety for this product. 
Antibodies against leukocytes  are neutralized  and removed  which abolish es the risk for 
immune Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury  (one of the most serious complications of 
transfusions today); this is a very favorable feature of octaplas™  compared to plasma . As 
cells and cellular debris are completely removed by multiple size exclusion filtration the 
occurrence of  adverse reactions attributable to residual blood cells, is reduced in conjunction 
with the use of octaplas™ . The dilution effect on cytokines and allergens from the pooling  
of multiple units of single -donor FFP units diminish es the number and severity of adverse 
reactions that can occur due to  the presence of allergens/soluble substances in plasma. 
Additionally, octaplas™  has uniform and stable levels of both pro - and anti -coagulation 
factors. The combination of the uniformity of these factors  in octaplas™  and the consistent 
size of each unit could produce a more predictable hemostatic response following octaplas™  
transfusion compared to standard plasma.  Comprehensive biochem ical studies confirmed 
that octaplas™  produced with the new column possesses a biochemical quality  identical to 
its predecessor, octaplas®, with the advantage of offering an enhanced  safety profile in terms 
of prion disease transmission such as variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease . 
The adverse reactions that were observed in  1% of subjects who received octaplas™  were 
mild and included pruritus, urticaria, nausea, headache, and paresthe sia. [2] Serious adverse 
reactions that were associated with octaplas™  transfusion included anaphylactic shock, 
citrate toxicity and severe hypotension.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 14 of 50 Other possible adverse reactions that may occur with the use of octaplas™  are excessive 
bleeding caused by hyperfibrinolysis due to low er levels of plasmin inhibitor in the product, 
thrombosis due to low er levels of Protein S, and citrate toxicity (hypocal cemia). The infusion 
rate should not exceed 1 mL/kg/min . Symptoms attributable to citrate toxicity can include 
fatigue, paresthesia and muscle spasms, especially in patients with liver function disorders. 
Because octaplas ™ is made from human plasma, it may  carry a risk of transmitti ng 
infectious agents  such as  viruses and  Variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease . Other adverse 
reactions that have been reported in the post -marketing experience include hypersensitivity 
reactions including anaphylactoid and allergic type of reactions, alkalosis, cardiac arrest, 
circulatory overload, thromboembolism, tachycardia, respiratory arrest or failure, 
bronchospasm, pulmonary edema, dyspnea, tachypnoea, abdominal pain, vomiting, rash, 
erythema, fever and/or chills, chest discom fort or pain, and seroconversions (passive transfer 
of antibodies).  
Large volumes  or fast infusion rates may induce Transfusion Associated Volume Overload 
that is manifested by dyspnea, hypoxia, and increasing oxygen demands. Pulmonary edema 
can often be s een on chest X -ray. High infusion rates may rarely cause cardiovascular effects 
as a result of citrate toxicity (fall in ionized calcium), especially in patients with liver 
function disorders. octaplas ™ should be used with caution in patients with risks fo r 
thrombotic complications because of the potential for increased risk of venous 
thromboembolism. In order to reduce the risk for venous thromboembolism, appropriate 
measures should be considered in all patients at risk for thrombotic complications subject ed 
to coagulation factor support for an extended period of time (e.g., during long -term, large -
volume Therapeutic Plasma Exchange) using octaplas ™. 
Administration of octaplas™  must be based on ABO -blood group compatibility  with the 
recipient . Hemolytic reactions can occur with ABO blood group mismatches . In emergency 
cases  blood group AB can be regarded as the universal plasma since it can be given to all 
patients.   
octaplas™  should not be used in patients with : 
• Immunoglobu lin A (IgA) deficiency  
• Severe deficiency of Protein S  
• History of hypersensitivity to FFP or to plasma -derived products including any 
plasma protein  
• History of hypersensitivity reaction to octaplas™

1. Study treatment period is a maximum of one week (7 days) and will consist of one or more TPEs.  In the event that a TPE begins within the 7 day Treatment 
period and runs past the maximum 7 day  time point, this entire TPE should be followed and all relevant TPE procedures performed (even if lasting greater than 
7 days ). New TPEs starting after the 7 day time poi nt will not be considered part o f the Treatment Period.     
2. Subsequent treatment will be determined at the Investigator’s discretion and will depend upon the clinical setting including the patient’s response to treatment.  
3. Vital signs will include heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure assessment. If multiple vital sign assessments are taken before and/or after 
each TPE, the vital signs that are assessed closest before the start and after the end of each TPE should be recorded.  
4. Refer to Section  7.3.5.2  for definition of blood test to be done. For the first TPE it is mandatory that, pre – and post –TPE samples for CBC and Chem 7 be tested. 
If subsequent infusion episodes are performed, pre - and post -TPE samples should be drawn unless considered not medically necessary by the Investigator (e.g., 
the timing of the pre -TPE sample is close to or overlaps with the timing of the post -TPE sample and it is not ne cessary to perform, etc.). In the event the pre - or 
post-TPE laboratory sample(s) are not drawn, the reason for not obtaining the sample(s) will be recorded in the case report form. These CBC and/or Chem 7 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07

 Page 17 of 50 parameters may be assessed additionally at any oth er time point as medically indicated. If multiple laboratory assessments are made before and after the TPE, the 
assessment taken most proximal to the start (pre) and after the end of the infusion (post) should be recorded in the CRF.  
5. For outpatients, follo w-up will be done via a telephone interview to assess for any ADRs.  
6. Confirmation that the subject s of child bearing potential  are not pregnant must be established by a negative pregnancy test result obtained during Screening.   
7. The Investigator’s evaluation of overall safety will be performed 24  (+/- 2 hours)  hours after each TPE procedure.  
8. If it is impractical to obtain a blood sam ple for testing ionized calcium during the follow -up (e.g., an outpatient situation), a post -study treatment sample to test 
for ionized calcium may be skipped . 
9. The first sample should be drawn within 90 minutes after start of the TPE.  
10. The Follow -up proced ures (ionized CA and Investigator’s Assessment) should be performed 24 hours  (+/- 2 hours)  after the TPE  concludes .  The Follow -up 
procedures may be performed sooner if it is not practical  to obtain these during the 24 hour post TPE  period .  If it is not medically feasible to obtain the Follow -
up assessments, the reason must be clearly documented (e.g. patient discharged prior to 24 hours after the end of the last TPE).  
11. If plasma is needed for administration during the study follow -up perio d, OctaplasTM should be given. After the end of the follow -up, if plasma is needed, this 
should be provided according to institutional standard of care .

discretion per institutional standa rd of care.  
5 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT(S)  
5.1 Characterization of Investigational Product(s)  
The reduced time of S/D treatment within the manufacturing process of octaplas® improved the 
concentration of plasmin inhibitor and slightly increases that for Protein S compared to its 
predecessor, octaplas®. The virus safety of octaplas™ was maintained as shown by virus validation 
studies. With a total inactivation to below the det ection limit, the shortened S/D procedure has a 
time-safety -margin of >98.3% versus >99.5% for the predecessor product.  
5.2 Packaging and Labeling  
octaplas™  is delivered frozen in sterile, pyrogen -free plastic bags containing 200 mL.  The bags

 Page 22 of 50 
 Patients will be followed for one week (7 days) during their therapy which could consist of one or 
more TPE  procedures . The recommended dose is a total plasma volume between 40 to 60 mL/kg , 
as prescribed by the treating physician.  The dosing regimen might differ from the general 
recommendation, depending on the therapeutic treatment plan and the investi gator’s evaluation of 
the respective clinical situation  (e.g. plasma exchange) . The infusion rate of octaplas™  should not 
exceed 0.020 -0.025 mmol/kg BW (body weight)/min, which is equal to <1  mL/kg BW/min.  
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration  
octaplas™  will be used per the approved labeling for the product  (see Appendix  1). octaplas™  
will be administered based on ABO-blood group specificity . In urgent cases , or  in  circumstances 
that no same blood group is available (type A  octaplas ™ for type A recipient), the patient can be 
administered  octaplas ™ that is compatible to  the recipient’s blood group (e.g. type AB octaplas ™ 
can be administered to  a type A  recipient ).  
All attempts should be made to ensure adequate octaplas ™ blood -type specific  inventory is 
available to meet patient orders. Shipment req uests to Octapharma should coincide to meet these 
needs and should be issued promptly , taking into consideration processing and shipment time.  
During the study treatment period, the hierarchy of plasma choice is:  
1. octaplas ™ blood group specific  
2. octaplas ™ blood group compatible  
3. FFP 
Further, if plasma is needed during the TPE follow -up period, octaplas ™ should be administered.

6.1.1 Screening  
The following will take place during Screening:  
• Obtaining voluntarily given, written (signed and dated) informed consent by the patient or 
the patient’s legal representative(s) /guardian(s). If children are old enough (age usually 
deemed by each institution) to understand the risks and benefits of the st udy, they should 
also be informed and provide their written assent.  
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
• Perform physical examination.  
• Review medical history including current  concomitant medication(s) , and blood group type 
(ABO) . 
• Record demographic data (height, body weight (BW), gender, date of birth, race).  
• Blood sample(s)1 will be drawn for the following safety laboratory parameters: CBC and 
Chem 7  (refer to Section 7.3.5.2  for definition) . 
• Pregnancy testing for females of childbearing potential will be performed. Confirmation 
that the subject is not pregnant m ust be established by a negative pregnancy test result.  
6.1.2 1-Week (7-Day) Study Treatment Period  
The total treatment period of the study will be a maximum of one week  (i.e., 7 days) . Within this 
period, TPE procedures are to be documented.  
The following will take place within 24 hours before  each TPE:  
• Vital signs  (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure assessment)  
assessed .  
• Blood sample(s) will be drawn for the following safety laboratory parameters: CBC , Chem 
7 and i onized calcium (refer to Section 7.3.5.2  for definition)2. 
• If multiple vital signs, and/or laboratory assessments are made before the TPE, the 
assessment taken most proximal to the start (pre) of the TPE should be recorded in the CRF.  
                                                 
 
 
1 The following blood volume limits for sampling are recommended, if an Investigator decides to deviate from these, this should  
be justified: NIH Clinical Center Guidelines for Blood Drawn for Research Purposes in the Clinical Center (M95 -9) rev 
06/05/2009: For pediatric patients, no more than 5 mL/kg may be drawn for research purposes in a single day, and no more than  
9.5 mL/kg may be drawn over an y eight -week period.  
2 For the first TPE it is mandatory that , pre– and post–TPE samples for CBC and Chem 7 be tested. If subsequent infusion 
episodes are performed, pre - and post -TPE samples should be drawn unless  considered not medically necessary by the  Investigator 
(e.g., the timing of the pre -TPE sample is close to or overlaps with the timing of the post -TPE sample and it is not necessary to 
perform, etc.). In the event the pre - or post -TPE laboratory sample(s) are not drawn, the reason for not obtaini ng the sample(s) will 
be recorded in the case report form. These  CBC and/or Chem 7 parame ters may be  assessed  additionally at  any other  time point  as 
medically  indicated.  
 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 24 of 50 
 The following will take place  during each TPE:  
• Review and documentation of data regarding any changes in concomi tant medications.

24 (+/- 2 hours)  hours after each TPE , the following will be collected:  
• Any SAEs, ADRs (refer to Section 7.3.2  for definitions) , TEs, TEEs,  as well as concomitant 
medications.  
• Blood sample(s) will be drawn for ionized calcium levels to assess for citrate toxicity.   If it 
is impractical  to obtain a blood sample for testing ionized calcium during the follow -up 
(e.g. an outpatient  situation ), this lab assessment may be skipped . 
After eac h TPE the Investigator will provide an overall Assessment of Safety observed for each 
patient by indicating his or her opinion of one of the following 3  categories best describing the 
patient’s experience with treatment while on study:  
• Excellent : defined a s the treatment was well tolerated by the patient,  
• Moderate : defined as ADR (s) were observed, but easily resolved or not clinically 
significant , 
• Poor : defined as ADR (s) were observed requiring significant medical intervention . 
6.2 Duration of Study  
6.2.1 Planned Dur ation for an Individual Patient  
Treatment up to one week  (7 days)  maximum  will be documented. 24 hours  (+/- 2 hours)  after the 
last TPE,  the final follow -up will be performed to identify and record  any SAEs, ADRs , TEs,

 TEEs,  as well as concomitant medications  and Investigator ’s overall safety assessment . This visit 
will also be the study completion visit.  
6.2.2 Planned Duration for the Study as a Whole  
The study will be considered completed, when all patients have completed the last follow -up 
evaluation  after the last TPE during study treatment  period  (max 1 week, 7 days) . 
The estimated start of this trial is 1st quarter 2015. The estimated end for this study is 4th quarter 
2020. 
6.2.3 Premature Termination of the Study  
Both the Investigator and the Sponsor reserve the right to terminate the study at any time. Should 
this be necessary, the procedures will be arranged on an individua l study basis after review and 
consultation by both parties. In terminating the study, the Sponsor and the Investigator will ensure 
that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patients' interests.  
Furthermore, the Investigator should prom ptly inform the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB) and provide a detailed written explanation. The pertinent 
regulatory authorities should be informed according to national regulations.  
Should the study be prematurely termi nated, all study materials (completed, partially completed 
and blank CRFs, etc.) must be returned to the Sponsor.  
7 ASSESSMENTS  AND METHODS  
7.1 Background  / Baseline Information

7.2 Efficacy Assessments  
Due to the small sample size  with different age groups efficacy will not be measured.   
7.3 Safety Assessments  
7.3.1 Relevant Drug Safety Information  
Any of the following drug safety information shall be collected:  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 26 of 50 
 • Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) 
• Adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) 
• Adverse events that fall into the category of TEs and TEEs  (definitions and reporting 
requirements see Sections 7.3.2  and 7.3.3 ). 
• Post-treatment related safety reports, pregnancies, drug overdose, interaction, abuse, 
misuse, and me dication error (see Section 7.3.7 ). 
Non-serious adverse events (AEs) observed during the trial will not be captured in the case report 
form (except for TEs, TEEs) . 
Post-treatment the Investigator will provide an overall Assessment of Safety observed for each 
patient by indicating his or her opinion of one of the following 3 categories best describing the  
patient’s experience with treatment while on study:  
• Excellent : defined as the treatment was well tolerated by the patient,  
• Moderate : defined as ADR (s) were observed, but easily resolved or not clinically 
significant , 
• Poor : Defined as ADR (s) were observed requiring significant medical intervention . 
7.3.2 Adverse  Events and Adverse Drug Reactions  
7.3.2.1  Definitions  
Adverse event (AE) : An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient receiving an 
IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship wit h this treatment. An AE can 
therefore  be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not related to the 
IMP. 
Adverse drug reaction (ADR) : An ADR is any noxious and unintended response to a medicinal 
product related to any dose.  The phrase “response to a  medicinal product ” means that a causal 
relationship between the medicinal product and an ADR carries at least a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., the relationship cannot be ruled out . 
Withdrawal due to ADR : Is a patient  whose treatment with a medicinal product is discontinued 
because of an ADR.  Any such events will be followed up by the Investigator until the event is 
resolved or until the medic al condition of the patient  is stable.  All follow -up information collected 
will be made available to the Sponsor.  
7.3.2.2  Collection  
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. ADRs will be elicited using 
a standard non -leading question such as  “How have you been since the last evaluation?” If children 
or adolescent patients are unable to adequately understand and respond to this question, the 
information will be obtained from the patient’s guardian and/or Investigator or study n urse.  
Any ADR  or above defined AE  which occurs during the study will be noted in detail on the 
appropriate pages of the CRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms, which represent a 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 27 of 50 
 single syndrome or diagnosis, the latter should be recorded in the CRF. The Investigator 
responsible will grade the severity of all ADRs /AEs  (mild, moderate or severe), the seriousness 
(non-serious or serious) and causality, as defined below ( Sections 7.3.2.3 , 7.3.2.4 , and 7.3.3 ). The 
Sponsor is responsible to assess the expectedness of each ADR/AE  (expected or unexpected), as 
defined below ( Section 7.3.2.4 ). 
In the event of clinically sig nificant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated and 
followed -up until they have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation is available . 
Diseases, signs and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing before the first 
administration of the medicinal product are not considered as ADRs /AEs  when observed at a later 
stage unless they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequ ency (worsening).  
The Investigator responsible should always provide detailed information concerning any 
abnormalities and the nature of, and reasons for any necessary action(s), as well as any other 
observations or comments, which are useful for the interpretation and understanding of the 
patients’ ADRs /AEs . 
7.3.2.3  Severity  
The intensity/ severity of all ADRs /AEs  will be graded  as follows:  
• mild: an ADR /AE, usually transient , which causes discomfort but does not interfere with 
the patient’s routine activities ; 
• moderate : an ADR /AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s 
routine activities ; 
• severe : an ADR /AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of  the patient’s routine 
activities . 
Grading of an ADR /AE is up to the medical judg ment of the Investigator and will be decided on 
a case by case basis.  
7.3.2.4  Causality  
The following causality definitions should be used for classification of each AE: 
   
Probable:  Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relations hip to drug 
intake . 
  Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs . 
  Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable . 
  Re-challenge not required.  
Possible:  Event or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake . 
  Coul d also be explained by disease or other drugs . 
  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 28 of 50 
 Unlikely:  Event or laboratory test abnormality  does not follow a  reasonable time relationship 
to drug intake . 
  Could also be explained by the patient’s clinical state or by environmental factors 
or other therapies administered.  
Not related:  Reports for which sufficient information exists to conclude that the etiology is 
unrelated to the IMP.  
Unclassified:  Reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g., because of 
outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).  
The following causality definitions should be used for classification of e ach ADR:  
Probable:  Reports or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake  
  Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs  
  Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable  
  Re-challenge not required.  
Possible:  Reports  or laboratory test abnormality, with reasonable time relationship to drug 
intake  
  Could also be explained by disease or other drugs  
  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
 
Classification of ADRs:  
ADRs will be classified by the Sponso r as either expected or unexpected : 
• expected : an adverse event that is listed in the current edition of the Investigator's Brochure.  
• unexpected : an adverse event that is not listed in the current edition of the Investigator's 
Brochure, or that differs beca use of greater severity or greater specificity.  
7.3.2.5  Outcome  
The outcome  of all reported ADRs has to be documented as follows : 
1. recovered, resolved  
2. recovering, resolving  
3. not recovered, not resolved  
4. recovered, resolved with sequelae  
5. fatal 
6. unknown  
NOTE:  A patient’s  death  per se is not an event, but an outcome.  The event which resulted in  
patient’s  death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 
4 weeks after treatment with medicinal product ended, and without respect of bei ng considered 
treatment -related or not.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 29 of 50 
 7.3.2.6  Action(s) Taken  
ADRs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care to 
protect the health  and well-being  of the patient . Appropriate resuscitation equipment and 
medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation.  
The action taken by the Investigator must be documented:  
a) in general  
- none  
- medication (other than medicinal product ) or other (e .g., physical) therapy started  
- test performed  
- other (to be specified)  
b) on medicinal product  
- none  
- product withdrawn  
- dose reduced  
- dose increased  
The responsible Investigator will follow -up each ADR until it is resolved or until the medical 
condition of the patient  is stable  and all relevant follow -up information will be reported to the 
Sponsor.  
7.3.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious  AE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose : 
• results in death,  
• is life-threatening  (this implies that the patient was at an immediate risk of death at the time 
of the event, and not a hypothetical situation of what could or would have happened if, for 
example, no treatment had been administered),  
• requires in -patient hospi talization or prolongation of existing in -patient hospitalization 
(hospitalization does not refer to the treatment of an ADR /AE on an out -patient status or to 
hospitalization because of study -related procedures (e.g., infusion at two consecutive days) 
or because of an elective surgical procedure for which the date had been scheduled earlier),  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,  
• is another important medical event (e.g. suspected transmission of an  infectious agent, or 
other reactions that should be reported in an expedited manner although they did not 
immediately result in one of the above seriousness criteria) . 
Medical judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an ADR /AE is serious in other 
situations: Important ADRs /AEs  that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in death 
or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient  or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definitions above, should al so be considered serious.

* Possible sign or symptom of TEE  
** May be outcome of TEE  
To determine/confirm a TE or TEE the following adjudicators will be involved:  
Adju dicator 1 (Investigator)  
On the corresponding safety  reporting form of the CRF, the Investigator is specifically asked if 
the reported event is a TE or TEE in his/her opinion.  
Adjudicator 2 (Octapharma Central Drug Safety Unit, CDSU)  
Once a  TEE/TE is recor ded on the CRF, the event will be forwarded to Octapharma's Drug Safety 
Unit who will process the TEE/TE in routine manner (including assessments of expectedness, 
causality, seriousness, TEE /TE classification of event).  
Adjudicator 3 (Independent Data Monitoring Committee, IDMC)  
The IDMC will receive anonymized case reports and/or lists of all reported adverse reactions. 
Serious cases , probably or possibly related  and suspected TEEs /TEs  (as determined by Adjudicator 
1 and/or Adjudicato r 2) will be reviewed on an ad -hoc basis; other cases like ADRs and not related 
SAEs  will be reviewed on a quarterly basis. The IDMC will then vote on all new cases (simple 
majority), record their judgment and return their decisions back to data management . 
In case, the adjudicators disagree, the following scheme will be applied  (Table 1):

that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative pregnancy test result obtained 
during Screening.  
7.3.6 Vital Signs  and Physical Examination  
Vital signs data (heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and blood pressure assessment) will be 
collected before and after each TPE.  
Physical examination data (dermatological and lymphatic system, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, 
respiratory tract, cardiovascular and ga strointestinal system, musculoskeletal system, neurological 
system, and endocrinological disorders) will be collected at Screening.  
7.3.7 Other Relevant Safety Information  
Post study related safety reports : Any ADR (i .e., any adverse event with a suspected causa l 
relationship to the medicinal product ) which occurs after the completion of the study should be 
reported by the Investigator.  The usual procedure for reporting post marketing safety information 
should be followed, but relation to the clinical study should be stated on the report.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 33 of 50 
 If the Investigator becomes aware that a patient  has died within 4 weeks after the last 
administration  of the product , this should be reported as well, without being considered treatment 
related or not.  
Pregnancies : Every ef fort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of the product . 
Pregnancies occurring during the study  (fetal exposure to the product ) need to be reported.  
In case of pregnancy during the study , the Investigator is asked to complete the pregnancy 
notification form and to send it (by email or fax) to the C linical Project Manager /designee . 
Follow -up information on the outcome of both mother and fetus will be request ed by a Sponsor 
representative.  
Overdose, interaction, abuse, misuse, and medication error : 
The following safety relevant information should be reported as an ADR or, if the reaction fulfils 
one of the criteri a for seriousness , as a serious ADR . 
Drug overdose : An overdose is a deliberate  or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose 
higher than that specified in the protocol, and higher than the known therapeutic dose and of 
clinical relevance . The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdose.  Due to the study design, 
no overdose is expected.  
Interaction : A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance/medicinal product affects the 
activity of the study drug , i.e., the effects are increased or decreased, or they produce an effect that 
none of the products  exhibits on its own.  The reaction must be clearly identified as drug interaction.  
Abuse : An abuse is the deliberate use of a medicinal product that may lead to addiction 
accompanied by harmful phy sical or psychological effects.  This is not relevant for th e medicinal 
product but may be applicable for concomitant medications.  
Misuse : Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside its 
described indication or outside the current state of the art medical practice (off -label -use). The 
reaction must be clearly identified as misuse.  
Medication error : Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a 
medicinal product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical 
form/packaging and instructions for use/labe ling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a 
medication error.  Due to the study design, no medication error should happen.  
7.4 Appropriateness of Measurements  
Only standardized measurements that are widely used and generally recognized as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant  will be used in this study.

 8 DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING  
8.1 Documentation of Data  
8.1.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all the information related to clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in the study, written down in original records or certified copies of original records 
allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical study.  
The Investigator will maintain adequate source records (e .g., case histories or patient files for each 
patient enrolled).  Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time required by 
local regulations.  
For each patient enrolled, the Investigator will indicate in the sou rce record(s) that the patient 
participates in this study.  
All data entered in the CRF must be supported by source data in the patient records with the 
exceptions listed in Section 8.1.2 . 
The I nvestigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IEC /IRB  review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), by providing direct access to source data/records.  
8.1.2 Case Report Forms  
The Spon sor will provide the CRFs in paper or electronic format.  They will be reviewed against 
source documentation at each monitoring visit.  The Investigator should allocate sufficient time 
and space for the review and correction process.   
For each patient enroll ed, an electronic CRF  /eCRF)  must be completed  within the Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system  and approved by the  Investigator or an authorized sub-investigator.   
Study site staff (e.g. research nurse) will be responsible for entering all of the patient data into the 
validated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and study specific 
eCRFs prior to receiving access to the live database for data entry, as defined in applicable SOPs. 
The site is also provided with the appro ved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data 
entry and data issues/questions. The site will be notified once the database is active to begin data 
entry. Additional site training may be provided as refreshers throughout the study, if needed. All  
persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data must appear on the delegation of authority log.  
If any errors in the eCRFs are found during the data review process discrepancies will be generated 
programmatically within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ queries w ill be generated by either a 
monitor or Data Management. The programmed checks fire automatically once an eCRF page is 
saved within the system. The output of the programmed checks is  referred to as ‘discrepancies’. 
Discrepancies are generated by the input of illogical eCRF data. The purpose of these objects is to 
clarify the use, context, or insertion of illogical or missing data with the site or designee.  
All discrepancies (programmed and manual) will be submitted to the site personnel or monitor for 
the site within the EDC system. Once the site responds to a discrepancy, Data Management or the 
monitor will review the new or changed data to ensure an appropriate response and close the 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 35 of 50 
 discrepancy within the system.  The Investigator should ensure the accurac y, completeness and 
timeliness of the data reported to the Sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports.  
The Investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the data reported to 
the Sponsor in the CRFs and in all required reports . 
8.1.3 Changes to Case Report Form Data  
Errors occurring on the EDC system can only be corrected by the investigator(s) or other site 
personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the entire study period. If data is 
changed as a result of a q uery, a comment must be supplied within the query’s text, stating the 
reason for the change, prior to closing. The study monitor should provide guidance to investigators 
and the investigators' designated representatives on making such corrections. In addit ion, any 
changes to a previously saved eCRF page that has not had a query generated will need to have a 
reason specified for the data change. This is handled within the EDC system and relevant prompts 
appear once any changes are made.  
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by Data Management 
for incomplete or ambiguous resolutions. If the query response provided confirms the data as 
correct, the discrepancy will be closed based on the query response. If the respon se does not 
adequately address the question raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks are performed , and programs are run throughout the study until the data is clean 
and the database is ready for lock. All discrepancies w ill be resolved prior to database lock. There 
will be a final run of the programmed checks to ensure all discrepancies are closed out, SDV will 
be confirmed as complete by the monitor, and all eCRFs will be approved by the investigator prior 
to database lo ck. 
All corrections on a CRF and on the source documents must be made in a way that does  not obscure 
the original data.  The correct data must be inserted, dated and  initialed/ authorized  by trial site 
personnel.  If reason for the change is not obvious, then  a reason should be given.  The Principal 
Investigator must, a t a minimum, sign the final CRF  page to attest to the accuracy and 
completeness of all the data.  Once the data have been  entered into the database, they will be 
checked and any discrepancies will  be raised and  returned to the Investigator for resolution.  Data 
will be monitored and tabulated in  accordance with the Data Management Plan.  
8.2 Information of Investigators  
An Investigator’s Brochure will be handed out to the Investigator before the start of  the study.  This 
Brochure contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the Investigator to be 
fully and accurately informed about the safety of the medicinal product under evaluation and the 
respective benefit -risk ratio.  
The Investigator’s Brochure will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and in case new 
information concerning the medicinal product becomes available.  
The Investigator will be kept informed of important data that relate to the safe use of the product 
as the study proceeds.  
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07

 Page 36 of 50 
 8.3 Responsibilities  
The Investigator is accountable for the conduct of the clinical study.  If any responsibilities are 
delegated, the Investigator should maintain a list of appropriately qualified persons to whom 
he/she has delegated significant study -related duties.  
The Investigator may authorize site staff (e.g., sub -investigators, nurses) to enter study data into 
the CRF. This must be documented in the “Delegation of Authority Log“, filled in and signed by 
the Investigator  responsible.  
8.4 Investigator ’s Site File 
At each study site, t he Investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the conduct 
of the study to be fully documented.  Essential documents as required by GCP guidelines and 
regulations (copies of the protocol, study approval letters, all original informed consent /assent  
forms, site copies of all CRFs, drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining 
to the study, etc.) should be filed accurately and kept by the Investig ator for the maximum period 
of time required by local regulations.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining a confidential patient identification code list, which 
provides the unique link between named source records and CRF data for the Sponsor.  The 
Investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for the maximum period of time 
required by local regulations.  
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Investigator 
and the Sponsor.  Should the  Investigator elect to assign the study documents to another party, or 
move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing.  
8.5 Provision of Additional Information  
On request, the Investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data rel ating to the study, or 
copies of relevant source records, ensuring that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained.  This is 
particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are 
encountered.  In case of particular issues o r governmental queries, it is also necessary to have 
access to the complete study records, provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in 
accordance with applicable regulations.  
8.6 Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitor ing Committee (IDMC) will be established by the Sponsor.  The 
IDMC will be composed of recognized experts in the field of immunology,  pediatrics  and/or 
clinical care who are not actively recruiting patients.  
The IDMC will review relevant data periodically d uring the study and will give advice on the 
continuation, modification or termination of the study.  A study specific Standard Operating 
Procedure will define in detail the composition, responsibilities and procedures of the IDMC.

 9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SA MPLE SIZE  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
A minimum of 40 pediatric  patients are planned to be enrolled . 
The purpose of this study is to assess safety and tolerability of octaplas™  in the pediatric 
population by monitoring ADRs  and safety laboratory parameters. The sample size of at least  
40 pediatr ic patients is not derived from statistical considerations of power, but to gather enough 
clinical evidence to obtain a sound and meanin gful medical assessment  for patients ≥  2 and 
≤ 20 years of age . 
9.2 Statistical Analysis  
A formal statistical analysis plan describing all details of the descriptive and explorative analyses 
to be performed will be prepared by the study st atistician and approved by the S ponsor prior to the 
start of the statistical analysis.  
All data collected will be summarized and presented descriptively to facilitate the review of 
population homogeneity and general patterns . Additional review in specific age sub -groups will 
be performed if possible.  No confirmatory hypothesis testing is planned. Any p -value or 
confidence interval presented is to be understood in the exploratory sense.  
All safety parameters will be presented descriptively in full detail, by age group  as well as in total.  
The safety assessment will include  the occurrence of all SAEs  ADRs , TEs, and TEEs . To facilitate 
the detection of any possible safety signal, all ADRs  will be characterized and analyzed by 
seriousness, severity, relation to study drug and timely relationship to study drug administration.  
In addition to these pre -planned categories the collected data will be examined to identify 
additional characteristics of interest such as e.g. particular indications for TPE , relevant 
concomitant medications, or SMQs covering a noticeable number of events.  The rates of ADRs  
will be presented for such categories, together with the associated 95% confidence intervals, again 
per age group  and in total.  
Individual patient profiles  or tabula tions  will be generated, displaying the baseline characteristics 
as well as all interventions, treatment details and measurements on a time scale.  This will facilitate 
the review of each individual course of treatment by a medical expert to detect any safe ty signal 
that might not be reflected in the ADR  rates.  
9.2.1 Population for Analysis  
The safety population (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one infusion  of 
octaplas™ . 
The full analysis set (FAS) is defined according to the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle  and will 
include all patients of the SAF with any information available on the primary endpoint; these are 
all treated patients monitored for SAEs, ADRs , TEs and TEEs  after start of the TPE, and it is thus 
expected that this population will coincide with the SAF.  
The per -protocol  population  will include all patien ts who have completed the infusion episode(s) 
and the final examination without major protocol deviations  that would have an effect on the 
Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07  
No. LAS -213  19-Oct-2018  
 Page 38 of 50 
 evaluation of the primary endpoint. Examples of protocol deviations to be considered in this 
respect would be dosing errors, the use of prohibited concomitant medications, or the occurrence 
of completely unrelated medical events that require an interruption of the study procedures. The 
final decision regarding inclusion/exclusion of patients from the analysis sets will be taken by a 
panel including the Clinical P roject Manager, the study statistician and a medical expert du ring a 
data review meeting before database lock. The decisions taken will be based on a review of 
complete data listings, and documented before the database is locked and the analysis is 
performed.   
9.2.2 Efficacy Analysis Plan  
Efficacy will not be assessed . 
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Plan  
The occurrence of SAEs, ADRs , TEs and TEEs  will be reported.  All these events will be 
characterized and analyzed by seriousness, severity, relation to study drug , and timely relationship 
to study drug administration.   
Vital sign measurements (absolute values and change from pre -TPE) will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics.  All measurements outside age-specific thresholds will be listed and reviewed 
individuall y. 
All safety laboratory data – absolute values as well as changes from baseline – will be presented 
descriptively per time point.  All measurements outside age-specific thresholds will be listed and 
reviewed individually.  
All data will be presented in tota l as well as in sub –groups reflecting age , gender, underlying 
diagnosis and/or most relevant medical history and concomitant medications  as appropriate . 
9.2.4 Handling of Missing Data  
In general, missing data will not be imputed ; for calculations concerning the  body weight, in 
particular the administered doses per kg, the latest available body weight measurement will be 
used.  
9.3 Randomization  / Stratification  / Code Release  
Not applicable.  This is an open -label study.  
9.4 Interim Analysis (if Applicable)  
Not planned.  
10 ETHICAL  / REGULATORY , LEGAL AND ADMINIST RATIVE  ASPECTS  
10.1 Ethical / Regulatory Framework  
The study protocol and any subsequent amendment(s) will be submitted to an IEC /IRB  and to the 
Regu latory Authority . The study will be conducted in compliance wit h the protocol, GCP

FULL PRESCRIBING INF ORMATION  
1 INDICATIONS AND USAG E 
Octaplas is a solvent  / detergent (S/D) treated, pooled human plasma indicated for: 
•Replacement of multiple coagulation factors in patients with acquired deficiencies
odue to liver disease
oundergoing cardiac surgery and liver transplant
•Plasma exchange in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
2 DOSAGE
 AND ADMINISTRATION  
For intravenous use only  
Administer Octaplas based on AB0 -blood group compatibility . 
2.1 Dos
e 
Replacement of coagulation factors in patients with acquired deficiencies  due to liver disease or undergoing cardiac surgery or liver 
transplant  
Initially infuse of 10 to 15  mL Octaplas per kilogram body weight. This should increase the patient’s plasma coagulation factor levels 
by approximately 15- 25%. If hemostasis is not ach ieved, use higher doses.  
Adjust dose based on desired clinical response.  
Monitor response, including measurement of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and/or specific 
coagulation factors.  
Plasma exchange in patients with T TP. 
Completely replace plasma volume removed during plasmapheresis with Octaplas. Generally , 1 to 1.5 plasma volumes corresponds to 
40 to 60 m illiliters per kg.[1,2] 
2.2 Administration  
Administer Octaplas after thawing using an infusion set with a filter.  
Octaplas  should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration , whenever solution and container 
permit.  Do not use if turbid.  
Avoid
 shaking.  
Steps for Thawing:  
•For water bath:
oThaw in the outer wrapper for up to 30 minutes in a circulating water bath at +30°C to +37°C (86°F to 98.6°F). An overwrap
bag may be used to provide further protection of contents if appropriate.
oPrevent water from contaminating the entry port.
oThe minimu m thawing time is 30 minutes at 37°C  (98.6°F) . The thawing time depends on the number of bags in the water
bath. If more than one plasma bag is  thawed in the same water bath , then the thawing time can be prolonged, but should not
exceed  60 minutes.
•For dr y
 tempering system:
oPlace the Octaplas  bags between the heating plates  according to the manufacturer’s  instructions.
oThaw plasma following manufacturer directions between +30°C to +37°C (86°F to 98.6°F). Remove the product when the
thawing process is comp leted . The thawing process may be monitored and recorded using the thawing device printer or
barcode scanner recommended by the device manufacturer.
oMonitor the thawing process and record using the thawing device printer or barcode scanner recommended by t he device
manufacturer.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS  
Do not use Octaplas  in patients with : 
•IgA deficiency
•Severe deficienc y of Protein S
•History of hypersensitivity to fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or to plasma -derived products including any plasma protein
•History of hypersensitivity reaction to Octaplas
5 WARNINGS
 AND PRECAUT IONS  
5.1 Transfusion reactio ns 
Transfusion reactions can occur with AB0 blood group mismatches. Administration of Octaplas must be based on ABO -blood group 
compatibility . 
5.2 Hypervolemia  
High infusion rates can induce hypervolemia with consequent pulmonary edema or cardiac failure. Monitor patients for signs and 
symptoms of pulmonary edema or cardiac failure and institute appropriate management.  
5.3 Hyperfibrinolysis  
Excessive bleeding due to hyperfibrinolysis can occur due to low levels of alpha2 -antiplasmin (also named plasmin inhibitor). Monitor 
for signs of excessive bleeding in patients undergoing liver transplantation.  
5.4 Thrombosis  
Thrombosis can occur due to low levels of Protein S. Monitor for signs  and symptoms  of thrombosis in patients at risk.  
5.5 Citrate Toxicity  
Citrate toxicity can oc cur with volumes exceeding one milliliter  of Octaplas per kg per minute. The infusion rate should not exceed 
0.020- 0.025 mmol citrate per kilogram per minute (i.e. , less than one milliliter Octaplas  per kg per minute). Symptoms attributable to 
citrate toxicity (hypocalcaemia) include e.g., fatigue, paresthesia and muscle spasms , especially in patients with liver function 
disorders . Administer  calcium gluconate intravenously into another vein in order to minimize citrate toxicity.  
5.6 Infection Risk from Human P lasma  
Because Octaplas  is made from human plasma , it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, e.g. , viruses , the variant 
Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and theoretically, the Creutzfeld t-Jakob disease (CJD) agent. ALL infections suspected by a 
physician possibly to have been transmitted by this product should be reported by the physician or other healthcare provider to 
Octapharma [1 -866-766-4860]  or FDA at 1 -800-FDA -1088 or www.fea.gov/medwatch . See Description ( 11) 
6 ADVER
SE REACTIONS  
Serious adverse reactions seen in clinical trials were anaphylactic shock, citrate toxicity and severe hypotension.  
The most common adverse reactions observed in ≥ 1% of subjects included pruritis, urticaria, nausea, headache, and paresthesia.  
6.1 Clinic
al Trials Experience  
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observ ed in the clinical trials of a drug 
cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.  
Adverse reactions observed in clinical trials derive from 9 clinical trials. The mean dose administered ranged from 6 to 15 
milliliters /kg body weight; when used in plasma exchange the dose was between 15 to 75  milliliters/kg.  Two of the studies were 
conducted in healthy volunteers (n=90).  
In total, 359 subjects received about 600 transf usion episodes in these trials.  
The f
ollowing table shows the adverse reactions observed in ≥ 1% of subjects in order of severity:  
Nervous system disorders  
Headache, paresthesia  
Gastrointestinal disorders  
 Nausea  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders  
Pruritis, urticaria  
6.2 Post-M
arketing Experience  
Because post -marketing reporting of adverse reactions is voluntary and from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to 
reliably estimate the frequency of these reactions or establish a causa l relationship to product exposure.

11 DESCR
IPTION  
Octaplas is a sterile, pyrogen free, frozen solution of solvent/detergent ( S/D) treated pooled human plasma. 
The active ingredient comprises plasma proteins such as albumin, immunoglobulins, other globulins, coagulation factors, complement 
proteins and protease inhibitors. The content and distribution of plasma proteins in Octaplas are comparable to reference ranges for 
healthy blood donors, except for Protein S and alpha2- antiplasmin . Within  a mean total protein content of 57 mg/mL, albumin 
comprises  ~50% and immunoglobulin classes G, A, and M comprise ~12% , ~3% , and ~1% , respectivel y. Protein S and alpha2 -
antiplasmin, which are labile to S/D treatment, are controlled to ensure levels in the final product of ≥ 0.4 International U nits (IU) per 
mL. Plasma lipids and lipoproteins are reduced due to S/D treatment and subsequent oil and solid phase extraction .

s manufactured from human plasma collected in US licensed plasma donation centers. All plasma donations are tested for 
viral markers in compliance with US regulation. In addition, the manufacturing plasma pool may not contain a titer of human 
Parvovirus B19 DNA exceeding 10.0 IU per microliter and must have a negative result in a test for human Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) 
RNA by NAT PCR with a sensitivity of ≤ 2.5 log 10 IU/mL .  
Each lot of Octaplas is manufactured from pooled plasma of a single AB0 blood grou p (A, B, AB, or 0). The manufacturing plasma 
pool is limited to 390 kg comprising 630- 1,520 individual donors. Frozen plasma units are thawed and pooled. Sodium dihydrogen 
phosphate dihydrate is added as a buffer against  increase in pH due to loss of CO 2. After filtration through a 1  µm pore size 
membrane, the plasma pool is treated with S/D reagents [1% tri(n -butyl) phosphate (TNBP) and 1% octoxynol for 1- 1.5 hours at 
+30°C (86°F)] to inactivate enveloped viruses. The S/D reagents are removed by sequential  oil and  solid phase extraction  procedures .
Glycine is added to adjust the osmolality. Plasma with glycine is applied to a column filled with affinity ligand resin inten ded for
selective binding of prion protein (PrPSc). The effectiveness of this step in r emoval of prion infectivity from the product has not been
established. After sterile filtration, the product is filled into sterile polyvinyl chloride blood bags, labeled, deep -frozen and stored at a
temperature of ≤ -18°C ( -0.4°F). The finished product is  tested for coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X and  XI, Protein C,
Protein S, alpha2 -antiplasmin (also known as  Plasmin Inhibitor), fibrinogen and ADAMTS13.
The S/D treatment step has been validated to effectively inactivate relevant pathogenic and  model enveloped viruses as summarized in

14 CLINICAL STUDIES  
The Octaplas predecessor product was studied in liver disease, liver transplantation , cardiac surgery and TTP.  
An open -label  parallel group study was performed in surgical  patients who were allocated to receive either a single infusion of 
Octaplas  (n=20) or no plasma treatment (n=26) during open- heart surgery .[10] A historical control group of patients having received 
standard single -donor FFP (n=20) was used to compare the efficacy and safety. The average dose of Octaplas was 700  mL (range 200 
to 3400 mL), compared with 1012 mL (range 500 to 4000 mL) for standard FFP.  The choice of plasma product (Octaplas or FFP) did 
not appear to influence the postoperative course with respect to volume of postoperative bleeding, the need for reoperation s econdary 
to bleeding, or the length of the postoperative hospital stay. This study was not powered to detect any difference in efficacy .  
A prospective, single -blind, randomized study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of Octaplas  compared with stan dard 
FFP in adult patients with coagulopathies due to liver disease (LD) or liver transplantation (LTX), or for the management of newly 
diagnosed thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). [11-13] In total, 55 patients were included  in the study . Three  patients were 
suffering from TTP and all received Octaplas . Of the 24 patients with LD, 11 were treated with Octaplas , and out of the 28 LTX 
patients, 13 received Octaplas . Within the LD and the LTX groups, patients were comparable in all clinical aspects and in the dose of 
plasma given. There were no relevant changes in any of the coagulation factors, but protein  C and fibrinogen improv ed considerably 
in both groups, accompanied by a corresponding improvement in partial thromboplastin time (PTT) levels 24 hours after infusion. 
Similar degrees of correction of prolonged international normalized ratio (INR) and PTT values were achieved wit h both Octaplas  and 
FFP. All 3 patients with TTP attained platelet counts of >50x109/L by Day  10. This study was not powered to detect any difference in 
efficacy.  
A prospective, non- randomized open -label study in intensive care patients was conducted in po st-operative open heart surgery patients 
in the surgical intensive care unit who were in need of plasma transfusion for acute bleeding or for the risk of bleeding.[ 14]  There 
were a total of 67 patients, 36 who received Octaplas (600 mL) and 31 who received FFP (600 mL).  Parameters measured included 
PT, PTT, free Protein S and plasmin inhibitor.  Parameters were measured before treatment and 60 minutes after termination of 
plasma infusion. The decrease in PT and PTT, and the rise in free Protein S were similar between the two study arms. Plasmin inhibitor declined after Octaplas and remained unaffected by FFP. Clinical hemostasis evaluations were also similar between the two treatment regimens. This study was not powered to detect any difference in efficacy.  
In a randomized, open -label, controlled  study, 60 healthy adult volunteers (mean age 32.6±9.1 years) received after a standard 
plasmapheresis (PPh)  of 600  mL plasma, an administration of 1200 mL  of  Octaplas or the predecessor  product  in a cross -over design.   
Coagulation factors (FI, FII, FV, FVII, FVIII, FIX, FX, and FXI) and hemostatic parameters (aPTT, PT and protein C) were assessed 
post-infusion at 15 minutes, 2 hours and 24 hours .  The primary analysis was to demonstrate equivalence for recoveries using a 10% 
margin.  All coagulation and hemostatic parameters met the equivalence criterion.  To verify the assumption of improvement of plasmin inhi bitor ( PI) concentrations, a test for superiority was conducted.  Statistically significant differences between treatments 
were found at 15 minutes (P=0.0012) and 2 hours (P=0.0190) post -transfusion for the per protocol population.  Increased levels of PI 
post-infusion of Octaplas , as compared to the predecessor  product  may be attributable to the increase d concentrations of PI .

Obes ity has a greater detrimental impact on the health of African 
American women ( AAW ) than on any other racial or gender group. Nearly 
80% of AAW are overweight or obese.1 Reduced insulin sensitivity is 
more prevalent in AAW than in white women and men of both races.4-8 
This condition puts AAW at increased risk for the development of Type 2 
diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) and explains its higher prevalence among AAW 
(15% v ersus 7% in whites, respectively).2 The exact mechanism 
underlying these pathophysiological differences remains unknown. We 
found that obese AAW have decrease d parasympathetic (PNS) nerve 
activity  compared to whites ( Figure 2A ) whereas, sympathetic (SNS) 
activity was not significantly increased in this group ( Figure 2B ). 
Reduced PNS activity has been reported in AA children even prior to the 
development of obe sity and its co -morbidities.9, 10 Recent animal studies 
showed that the PNS confers  protection against oxidation11, 12 generated 
in response to different stimuli (ricin poisoning,12 myocardial infarction,13, 
14 fulminant hepatitis15). This effect is in part mediated through the α7 -
nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR).15, 16 In our cohort of AAW, PNS activity was directly correlated with 
insulin sensitivity even after controlling for differ ences in age, blood pressure , and visceral adiposity ( Figure 3 ). 
Equally important, the decrease in insulin sensitivity was associated with increased oxidative stress as measured 
by plasma F2  isoprostanes  levels. Similar associations between insulin resist ance and oxidative stress are found 
in animal models17 and in humans,18 including a single study done in AAW.19 Notably, a 4-week administration 
of galantamine,  a central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and positive allosteric modulator of α7nAChR , increases 
PNS tone and improves insulin sensitivity in high -fat fed mice.20 Taken together these findings lead us to 
hypothesize that the decreased PNS activity in obese AAW has deleterious effects on oxidative stress and insulin 
sensitivity ( Figure 1) . We will test this hypothesis by two specific aims.  
 
2.0 Background  
Approximately 80% of AAW are overweight or obese, and this percentage may increase even more;1 
according to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES) the prevalence of obesi ty in AAW increased by 4.3% in 
a 5-year period, whereas in whites remained the same. Multiple 
studies have reported that for the same body mass index (BMI), 
AAW had ~36 -60% reduced insulin sensitivity compared to whites.4-
8 These racial differences are even present in early adolescence21 
and are not explained by differences in diet.22 Reduced insulin 
sensitivity is a well -known risk factor for the development of T2DM 
and explains the higher prevalence of this condition among AAW 
(15% vs. 7% in whites).2 T2DM is associ ated with a 4 -year reduction 
in the life expectancy of AAW compared to whites.3  
Reduced insulin sensitivity is typically associated with increased 
visceral adiposity, elevated triglycerides, and reduced HDL -
cholesterol;23 AAW, however, have different clinical presentation. 
We recently studied 229 obese women (in collaboration with Dr. H. 
Silver) and found that AAW have reduced insulin sensitivity despite 
lower concentrations of  triglycerides and 20% lower volume of 
viscer al adiposity ( Table 1 ). In addition, we have also shown that 
insulin sensitivity was inversely associated with F2 -isoprostanes 
(Table 2 ). Similar observations have been previously reported by others,24 including Gower et al19 who found an 
inverse relationship between insulin sensitivity with protein carbonyls, a marker of oxidative stress, in AAW but 
not in white women.

parasympathetic (PNS) activity in obese African 
American women, increases oxidative stress

restoration of PNS tone should result in 
decreased oxidative stress and improved 
insulin sensitivity

6/5/17  African Americans have impaired parasympathetic function  
Heart rate variability (HRV) provides a noninvasive  and quantitative method of investigating cardiac 
autonomic modulation.25 Spectral analysis techniques can distinguish between sympathetic and 
parasympathetic sources of HRV, as these rhythms occur at different frequencies. There is consensus that the 
relative power in the high frequency (HF rri) band (>0.15 Hz) r eflects PNS activity, whereas the ratio low frequency 
(LF rri) to HF rri reflects SNS modulation.25 Using this technique, we found that obese AAW have reduced PNS 
activity compared to age and BMI -matched white women ( Figure 2A ). Similarly, Choi et al.26 reported that young 
non-diabetic AA had low PNS activity compared to age -matched whites (log HF rri =3.9±3.2 in AA vs. 5.3±4.7 ms2 
in whites, P<0.05), even in the absence of changes in SNS activity as measured by LF/HF ratio. Impaired vagal 
function in AA is not explained by the presence of hypertension (HTN) because Zion et al9 reported low HF rri 
even in normotensive young AA men without family history of HTN (ln HF rri= 8.9 ± 1.1 vs. 9.7 ± 1.1 ms2; P = 
0.006). Reduced HF rri was also reported in AA indep endently of differences in physical activity and psychological 
factors.27 Low HF rri has been also reported in young AA women28 and AA children.10  
 
Parasympathetic function i s an important regulator of oxidative stress and  inflammation  
Recent studies showed that the PNS confers protection against oxidation and has also been implicated in the 
regulation of inflammation (cholinergic anti -inflammatory pathway).29In animal models stimulation of the PNS 
decreases oxidative stress generated in response to different stimuli 
(ricin poisoning12, myocardial in farction,13, 14fulminant hepatitis15). This 
effect is in part mediated through the α7nAChR,15, 16, 30and also via vagal 
afferents.29 Sub-diaphragmatic surgical vagotomy in rats exposed to 
endotoxin showed increased oxidative stress in the brain,11 and direct 
electrical stimulation of the peripheral vagus nerve during lethal 
endotoxemia inhibited TNF synthesis in the liver.29These findings are 
important because increased oxidative stress and sub -clinical chronic 
inflammation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin 
resistance.17, 18 
 
African Americans have increased oxidation in response to 
lipid infusion  
 Lopes et al31 compared oxidative stress induced by 
standardized acute hyperlipidem ia (4 h infusions of Intralipid®) in 
30 subjects (15 AA and 15 whites, matched by age, gender and 
BMI). They found that hyperlipidemia -induced oxidation, as 
measured by plasma F2 -isoprostanes, was at least 2 -fold higher 
in AAs compared to whites. In this c ohort, AAs were found to be 
more insulin resistant compared to whites as measured by fasting 
glucose, insulin levels and the HOMA index.  
 
Central acetylcholinesterase inhibition improves insulin 
sensitivity in an animal model of obesity  
 Satapathy SK et a l20 examined whether galantamine, a central 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric modulator of 
α7nAChR alleviates obesity -related inflammation and its metabolic 
effect. After 8 weeks on a high -fat diet, mice were treated with 
either galantamine (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally or saline) injections 
for 4 weeks. Galantamine effectively reduced fasting plasma 
glucose and insulin, improved insulin resistance and obesity -associated inflammation by reducing the leve ls of 
inflammatory cytokines. Differences in oxidative stress were not assessed in this study.

Parasympathetic activity is decreased in African American Women  
We studied 28  obese AAW and 12 white women matched by age (42±10 vs. 37±9 years old), BMI (36±3 vs. 
35±4 Kg/m2), blood pressure (SBP 126±13 vs. 126±14 mm Hg) and heart rate (70±11 vs. 64±9 bpm). PNS 
activity was measured with spectral analysis of HRV. Our results showed that AAW have decreased PNS activity 
compared to white women (Figure 2A) whereas sympathetic activity was not increased in AAW compared to 
whites (Figure 2B). In a separate protocol, we studied 18 AAW and 13 white women matched by age (38±7 vs. 
38±9 years old) and BMI (35±4 vs. 35±3 Kg/m2), respectively. Racial differences in SNS activity were evaluated 
with 2 techniqu es. First, we determined the decrease in blood pressure during autonomic withdrawa l with the 
ganglionic blocker trimethaphan.32 At baseline, supine SBP was similar between groups, but the fall in SBP 
induced by autonomic withdrawal with trimethaphan was lower in AAW as compared to obese white women ( -
13±13 mm Hg vs. -24±15mm Hg, P=0.04). Second, in a subgroup of 8 subjects (4 AAW and 4 whites), matched 
by BMI, we measured direct muscle sympathetic nerve activity with microneurography technique. Sympathetic 
activity was lower in obese AAW women compared to whites (22±4 vs. 37±5 burst/min, p=0.06).  
 
Insulin sensitivity is inversely associated with parasympathetic activity in African American Women  
We studied 41 non -diabetic obese AAW (42±9 years old, BMI 39±5 Kg/m2,% 
fat mass 54±6, SBP/DBP128±14/79±9 mm Hg). All subjects underwent 
measurements of insulin sensitivity  using the frequen tly sampled intravenous 
glucose tolerance test analyzed using a modified minimal model (MINMOD) 
formula.33 Parasympathetic and SNS activity were measured with spectral 
analysis  of HRV  according to established guidelines.34, 35 We determined levels 
of  F2 -isoprostanes using GC/MS,36 (Table 2). We found that ~ 50% of the 
subjects were insulin resistant (defined by insulin sensitivity index < 3 min -1/uU 
per ml).37 Insulin sensitivity was directly correlated with indices of PNS activity 
(HF rri), (Figure 3 ). In a multiple linear regression analyses, this relationship 
remained significantly even after adjusting for differences in age, blood pressure 
and BMI (Ra2=0.27, P<0. 01). Measurement of sympathetic activity (LF/HF) was 
not associated with insulin sensitivity. Of note, levels of F2  isoprostanes, a 
marker of oxidative stress, were inversely associated with insulin sensitivity as 
well, (Table 2 ).

6.0 Study Procedures  
 
6.1 Specific Aim 1  will test the hypothesis that acute central acetylcholinesterase inhibition will restore PNS 
activity and reduce oxidation in AAW compared to white women.  
 
Rationale. Obese AAW have decreased PNS activity compared to whites.9, 10, 26 Continuous lipid infusion that 
causes cardiovascular autonomic imbalance (decrease in PNS activity and increase in SNS activity39) induces 
a greater increase in oxidative stress in AA compared to whites.31 Considering that PNS protects against 
oxidation and that central ace tylcholinesterase inhibitors has been shown to suppress oxidative stress in animal 
models.40 We propose to test the hypothesis that the central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor galantamine will 
attenuate oxidation in response to  lipid infusion in obese AAW compared to white women.   
 
Study protocol.  This will be a 2X2 cross -over design ( figure 4 ). 
We will enroll 24 subjects (12 obese AAW and 12 obese white women); subjects will be matched by age, BMI , 
and blood pressure. Screening visit:  After informed  consent is obtained, subjects will be invited to come to the 
clinical research center (CRC) for a screening visit ( screening visit 1 ) that consist of a complete history, physical 
exam , lab work (fasting electrolytes, liver enzymes, creatinine, complete bl ood count, lipid panel, serum  beta-
hCG for women of child-bearing age) , and ECG.   In a separate visit ( screening visit 2 ), subjects will return to 
the CRC to complete a 75g oral glucose tolerance test. For subjects who participated in specific aim 2, we will 
repeat screening visits  1 and 2  if more than 3 months have passed  since the first screenings . 
 
Study visits: Subjects who qualify will be admitted the day  of the study in the CRC (study visit 1) . Blood 
samples will be obtained for DNA analysis. A 24-hr urine collection will be obtained for sodium, creatinine , and 
F2 isoprostanes  measurements. After an overnight fast with the volunteer supine, an intravenous catheter will 
be placed in one arm for blood sampling and in the contralateral arm for lipid in fusion. Body composition will also 
be determined with dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (Lunar IDXA, GE Healthcare, CT, USA).  We will obtain 
cardiovascular autonomic measurements with spectral analysis of HRV and blood pressure variability (BPV) . 
The latter  was previously validated by our group as a reliable measurement of SNS activity35 (standard

6/5/17  techniques ). The following parameters (PNS activity: HF rri; SNS activity: LF sbp, ration LF/HF rri ) will be obtained. 
We will also collect measurements of microvascular circulation with contrast -enhanced ultrasound technique  and 
flow-mediated dilation (standard techniques ). At the end of this period, blood samples will be collected for non -
esterified free fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides, F2  isoprostanes  and cytokines . Then subjects will be randomly 
assigned to drug order using a permuted -block randomization algorithm. The assignment to the treatment group 
will be blinded to the investigators and subjects. The Vanderbilt Investigational Pharmacy will be responsible for 
the storage, preparation, and labeling of all investigational agents [Intralipids®, heparin , and study drug s (16 mg 
p.o. galantamine and placebo) ] and for maintaining accurate drug storage and dispensing logs. The blinded 
medication (single dose) will be a dministered in the morning ,  following the protocol of Lopes et al31. Intralipid® 
20% (Baxter  Healthcare Corp. Glendale, CA) will be infused at 0.8 mL/m2/min for 4h. An initial heparin bolus of 
1000 U will be followed b y 200 U/h infusion during the 4 -h period to activate endothelial lipoprotein lipase and 
accelerate hydrolysis of fatty acids from the glycerol backbone of the triglycerides. Blood samples will be obtained 
at baseline , 2h, and 4 h for triglycerides, NEFA, F2  isoprostanes , and inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL -1β, IL -18, 
IL-6). A urina ry sample will be obtained at 4 h for measurements of urine F2  isoprostanes. Cardiovascular 
autonomic measurements will be repeated at 2 h and 4h. Microvas cular circulation with contrast -enhanced 
ultrasound will be repeat ed at 4h.  We will measure flow -mediated dilation at 2 and 4 hours.  After the study is 
comp leted, we will allow a 2-week washout period before the subject is admitted to the CRC for a second study 
day (study visit 2)  when all the procedures described above will be repeated , except for  DEXA scan . 
 
Rationale for the use of galantamine. Galantamine  hydrobromide (Razadyne®) is a competitive 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor which increases the availability of acetylcholine. Okazaki et al41 showed that central 
acetylcholinesterase inhibition increases PNS tone in an animal model as measured by the decrease in heart 
rate and HF rri. Galantamine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of 
mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's dementia. We chose the dose of 16 mg p.o. based on pharmacokinetic 
studies in normal volunteers and patients with dementia of Alzheimer type.42-45 This dose exhibits linear 
pharmacokinetics after oral administration; the oral bioavailability is about 90%,42 the maximum concentration is 
achieved at 1 hour post -administration, and  it has a short half -life of 7 hours. The FDA has exempted our 
studies from the need of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND).  
 
Endpoints:  The primary analyses will focus on the increase in plasma F2 -isoprostanes levels with lipid 
infusion ( ISO) during placebo versus galantamine. Secondary analyses will focus on the increase in urinary F2 -
isoprostanes, inflammatory cytokines, NEFA, triglycerides and cardiovascular measurements of PNS tone (HF rri) 
and SNS tone (LF sbp, ration LF/HF rri) with lipid infusion during placebo versus galantamine.  
 
Sample size and power calculation: sample size was calculated based on the ability to detect a difference 
in ISO measured in the same subjects during treatment with placebo versus galantamine. Lopes et al31 reported 
that  mean and standard deviation of ISO was 5±2.9 in whites and 12±2.6 in AAs. We observed a standard 
deviation of 2.02 for F -2 isoprostanes (preliminary data). A sample size of 12 would provide 85% power to detect 
a 1.5 mmHg difference in whites (30% improvement in ISO), with a standard de viation of differences of 1.55 
(assuming a correlation of 0.7 between two repeated measurements in the same subject) using a paired t -test 
with a 0.05 two -sided significance level. The stu dy has 99% power to detect a 30 % improvement in ISO in AA.  
For com parison modest caloric restriction in women improves F2 -isoprostanes levels by 50%.46 
 
Interpretation and alternative approach. Previous studies in animal models showed that the stimulation of 
the PNS decreases oxidative stress. However, this effect in humans is largely unexplored. If our hypothesis is 
true then restoration of PNS activity will greatly attenuate lipid -induced oxidation in AAW compared to white 
women. We also anticipate that restoration of PNS tone in AAW will improve sub -clinical inflammation as 
previously observed by Tracey KJ et al29 in animal models. It is well established that lipid infusion induces 
activation of the SNS via increases in NEFA levels.39 We have designed our study to measure both branches of 
the autonomic nervous system and will account for changes in SNS activity with our intervention, in the final 
analysis. Central acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors can potentially induce bradycardia. This side effect has been 
reported to be increased mostly with donezepil (Aricept®) because of its long half life (~80 hours).47 For 
comparison galantamine (our study drug) has a short half -life of 7 hours. The risk of bradycardia will be minimized 
by excluding subjects with AV blockade diagnosed during  the screening visit. There is a possibility that acute 
 8 
6/5/17  restoration of PNS activity may not be enough to suppress lipid -induced oxidation. In specific aim 2, we will 
determine if chronic restoration of PNS activity improves oxidation. Dr. Naji Abumrad (co -mentor) et al48 reported 
that F2-isoprostanes levels are 10  times higher in adipose tissue compared to plasma and decreased within 1 
week after gastric bypass surgery. In specific aim 2, we will obtain fat pad biopsies and will measure changes in 
oxidative stress in adipose tissue usin g this technique.  
 
 6.2 Specific Aim 2.  We will test the hypothesis that chronic restoration of PNS activity with a central 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor improves insulin sensitivity and reduces adipose tissue oxidation in obese AAW 
compared to white women.  Rationale  Our preliminary data showe d that obese AAW have decreased PNS 
activity compared to whites; PNS activity was positively correlated with insulin sensitivity, and the decrease in 
insulin sensitivity was associated with increased oxidative stress as measured by plasma levels of F2 -
isoprostanes. Treatment with a central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increase PNS activity has been shown 
to improve insulin sensitivity and inflammation in an animal model of obesity,49 but it is st ill unknown whether 
similar effects occur in humans. We will test the hypothesis that chronic restoration of PNS activity improves 
insulin sensitivity and reduces adipose tissue oxidation in obese AAW.  
 
 
Study protocol. This is a 2X2 cross -over design ( Figure 5 ). We will enroll 28 subjects (14 obese AAW and 
14 obese white women) . Subjects will be matched by age, BMI , and blood pressure. After informed consent is 
obtained, subjects will complete screening visits 1 and 2  as previously described in section 6 .1. For subjects 
who participated in specific aim 1, we will only repeat screening visits  1 and 2 if more than 3 months have passed. 
Subjects who will be screened for the first time will have the body composition assessment with DEXA scan 
during the study days on ly. Subjects who meet inclusion criteria will report to the CRC in the morning in the 
fasting state to undergo  measurements of insulin, glucose levels , and serum  beta hCG (only women of child -
bearing potential). Subjects will be randomized to drug order using a permuted -block randomization algorithm. 
The investigational pharmacist will provide a 4 -week supply of study drug ( period 1, Figure 5 ). The dosage of 
galan tamine will be slowly escalated to increase tolerability starting with 4 mg p.o. twice  a day (bid) for 4 weeks 
(8 mg/day). Each subject will be provided with the study medication, a medication diary, and verbal and written 
instructions. Follow  up telephone  calls will be placed  one, three , and seven days following randomization and 
then weekly thereafter. Subjects will be instructed on how to keep their diet constant.   After subjects complete 
the 4 -week treatment period, they will be admitted  the day of the study  to the CRC . They will be requested to 
bring their medication diary and pill bottles. A pill count  will be performed . We will use structured case report 
forms to assess compliance, concurrent medications, medical conditions , and advers e events.  
 
The study will start after a 12 -hour,  overnight fast . Subjects will receive the morning dose of the study drug.  We 
will obtain blood samples for measurements of plasma F2 -isoprostanes, inflammatory cytokines, and pancreatic 
polypeptide (marker o f PNS activity).  We will obtain blood samples for  serum  beta hCG (only women of child -
bearing potential). We will obtain a urine sample for F2 -isoprostanes.  We will also obtain baseline blood pressure 
and cardiovascular autonomic measurements (PNS activity assessment: HF rri,; SNS assessment: LF sbp, ratio 
LF/HF rri). Subsequently, the subject will undergo a one-step hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamp  (standard 
techniques ). Subjects will undergo a fat -pad biopsy for measurement of F2 -isoprostanes in adipose tissue  
(patient can opt -out from fat biopsy)  and body composition with dual -energy X -ray absorptiometry (Lunar IDXA, 
GE Healthcare, CT, USA , standard technique s). After completion of period 1 , subjects will stop the medication,

6/5/17  wash  out drug for 4 weeks, and then begin the next treatment period (period 2 ) in which  all the procedures 
described above will be repeated .  
 
Endpoints: The primary analyses will focus on insulin sensitivity as measured by glucose infusion rate (M), 
insulin sensitivity index (M/I) ,during hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamps. Secondary endpoints will focus on 
measurements of F2  isoprostane s in plasma and adipose tissue  (if fat pad biopsy is obtained) , fasting insulin, 
fasting glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiovascular measurements of PNS tone  (HFrri) and 
SNS tone (LF sbp, ratio LF/HF rri), pancreatic polypeptide , and inflammatory cytokines.  
 
Sample s ize and power calculation:  Sample size was calculated based on the ability to detect a difference 
in glucose infusion rate measured in the same subjects during treatment with placebo versus galantamine. We 
observed a standard deviation of 11.4 in glucose i nfusion rate from a previous study.7 A sample size of 14 in 
each racial group would provide 85% power to detect a 10 µmol/Kg FFM/min difference in glucose infusion rate 
(30% improvement) with a standard deviation of differences of 11.4 (assuming a conservative correlation of 0.5 
between two repeated measurements in the same subject) using a paired t -test with a 0.05 two -sided significance 
level.  
 
Interpretation and  alternative appr oaches. If our hypothesis is correct then restoring PNS tone with the 
central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, ga lantamine, will produce a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity and 
adipose tissue oxidation in obese AAW compared to white women. Furthermore, we will also determine if 
restoration of PNS tone will improve obesity  related inflammation. The effect of galantamine on insulin sensitivity 
could be explained by mechanism other than a reduction in adipose tissue oxidation. The PNS is known to 
regulate hepatic glucose production in dogs,50 and galantamine decreases hepatic fat deposit in high -fat fed 
mice.49 To determine changes in insulin sensitivity, we chose to perform a one-step hyperinsulinemic clamp 
technique. The effect of galantamine on insulin sensitivity could be explained by mechanism other than 
restoration of PNS tone. In a study by  Satapathy SK et al20, galantamine also induces weight loss in high -fat fed 
mice. We designed our study to control for this confounding effect; we will advise our subjects not to change 
their diet while in the study. Patient's weight will be collected in each study visit, and we will adjust for changes 
in weight, in the final analysis.  
 
Statistical Considerations  
Data analysis plan:  Standard graphing and screening techniques will be used to detect outliers and to ensure 
data accuracy. We will assess continuous outcomes for normality. If normality is violated, we will apply data 
transformation or consider non -parametric analysis methods . Summary statistics for both continuous and 
categorical variables will be provided by randomization groups to describe the study sample. These basic data 
analyses will be conducted for both study aims.  We are using a 2x2 cross -over design in both study ai ms. 
Although we have designed the study to avoid carryover effect, we will test for carryover effect using the T -test 
approach described in Section 2.3 (page 21) of Jones and Kenwood.51 If there is evidence for a carryover effect, 
we will only use data collected before the crossover to estimate the treatment effects. This would result in a loss 
of power; however it would ensure valid estimates. Most likely, there will be no carryover effect due to the 
carefully chosen washout.  We will use mixed -effect models with a random subject effect and treatment 
(galantamine versus placebo ), race (A A versus whites), and their interaction as fixed effects. In Aim 1, the time 
effect (baseline, 2 h, and 4 h into the lipid infusion) will also be included as a fixed effect in the model. We will 
use an autoregressive model of order 1 [AR(1) ] or other plaus ible covariance structures for the error covariance. 
In addition to evaluating these fixed effects using regression analysis, we will calculate within -subject mean 
differences and 95% confidence intervals for galantamine versus placebo  comparison within ea ch racial group 
and test for treatment effect using paired t -test or sign rank test as appropriate.  
 
Standard Techniques  
10 
6/5/17  Hyperinsulinemic -euglycemic clamps.  Insulin infusion rates were 
chosen to suppress hepatic glucose production and maximally stimulating 
peripheral glucose utilization during the infusion ( 80 mu/m2/min) in insulin -
resistant subjects.52 A priming insulin dose will be given at the time of the 
insulin infusion change. Plasma glucose will be measured every 2.5 -5 
minutes, and an exogenous infusion of 20% glucose will be adjusted to 
maintain the plasma glucose at a target glycemia of 90 mg/dl by a modification 
of the glucose clamp technique.53 Potassium will be administered orally as 
needed to achieve potassium levels above 4.0 mmol/l . Heart rate and ECG 
will be recorded continuously.  
 Spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure.  Blood pressure 
fluctuates with a 10 -second periodicity, and these fluctuations are commonly 
termed “Mayer” waves. T his low -frequency variability (LFSBP) is thought to 
reflect sympathetic regulation of vasomotor tone. LFSBP correlates with direct 
measurements of sympathetic traffic using microneurograp hy. For spectral 
analysis, beat -to-beat data are recorded using the WINDAQ data acquisition 
system (DI220, DATAQ, Acron, OH, 14 Bit, 1000Hz) and processed off  line 
using a custom -written software in PV -Wave language (PV -wave, Visual 
Numerics Inc., Houston, TX).  Detected beat -to-beat values of R -R intervals 
and blood press ure values are interpolated and low -pass filtered (cutoff 2 Hz). 
Data segments of interest are used for spectral analysis. Linear trends are 
removed, and power spectral density is estimated with the FFT -based Welch 
algorithm. The power in the frequency ran ge of low frequencies (LF: 0.04 to 
<0.15 Hz) and high frequencies (HF: 0.15 to < 0.40 Hz) were calculated according to the Task Force 
recommendations.34  
Assays:  Plasma glucose will be measured with a YSI glucose analyzer (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, 
OH). Plasma insulin concentrations will be determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA; Millip ore, St. Charles, MO).  
Lipid Analysis:  Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL will be determined using automated techniques 
(UniCel® DxC 800 Synchron® Clinical System, Beckman Coulter). NEFA will be determined using a 
commercially available enzymatic assay (Wako Chemicals, Dallas, TX). F2  isoprostanes will be measured by 
gas chromatography and negative -ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry.36 Adipose tissue from the 
abdominal subcutaneous tissue will be obtained with a needle biopsy. F2  isoprostanes in adipose tissue will be 
analyzed as previously reported.48 
Contrast -enhanced ultrasound. Imagings will be obtained using a linear -array transducer connected to an 
ultrasound system (L9 -3 transducer, iU22; Phillips Ultrasound, Santa Ana, CA). This equipment has the 
capability to obtain real-time imaging using low (0.08) and high mechanical index (1.2) while the contrast 
(microbubbles; Definity; Bristol -Myers Squibb,Princeton, NJ)) are infused at a constant rate that produce 
moderate opacification in fat and muscle tissue.  We will dilute one vial (2 ml)  in 20 cc of normal saline. The 
medication will be administered intravenously (approximately, 1.2 -1.5 ml/min) in 24 hours.  
We will use one vial per day per subject.  The high mechanical index (1.2) will be used to destroy the 
microbubbles a t the beginning of each recording whereas the low mechanical index (0.08) will allow the 
microbubbles to resonate without destruction, thereby allowing recording of the replenishment of the 
microbubbles in the vasculature. The first seconds (0.5) of record ing after destruction of the microbubbles 
correspond to filling of rapid -filling vessels (arterioles, veins, venules) which will be subtracted leaving only 
measurements of microvascular blood velocity.  Imag es will be  analyzed in our laboratory using Q -Lab; Philips 
software.   
Flow -mediated dilation .Patient will be studied in a quiet, temperature -controlled room (22 -23C). After 15 -min 
of rest in a supine position, the right brachial artery will be imaged with a high ultrasound resolution machine.

6/5/17  The artery will be scanned over a longitudinal section 3 -5 cm above the elbow. The focus zone will be set to 
the depth of the anterior vessel wall. Depth and gain settings will be optimized to identify the lumen vessel wall 
interface. The diameter of the r ight brachial artery will be measured continuously at rest, during reactive 
hyperemia and after 10 minutes recovery period. A pneumatic tourniquet will be placed around the forearm 
distal to the target artery and will be inflated to a pressure 50 mm Hg abo ve patient’s systolic blood pressure 
for 5 min. Reactive hyperemia will be induced by sudden cuff deflation. The brachial artery will be continuously 
imaged for 30 s prior to and 180 s after cuff release.  
 
7.0 Risks  
 
Potential risks and adequacy of protection against risks   
•   Central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can potentially induce bradycardia. However, this risk has been 
reported to be increased only with donezepil (Aricept®) because of its long half-life (~80 hours).47 For 
comparison galantamine (our study drug) has a half -life of 7 hours. We will exclude subjects with AV blockade 
diagnosed during the screening visit by ECG to minimize the risk of bradycardia.  
•   Gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly n ausea, are the most common side effects associated with the use 
of central acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. This adverse event (AE) could be minimized with a dose -escalation 
schedule. For specific aim 2 (chronic study), we are planning to initiate galantam ine with the lower available 
dose 4 mg p.o. twice a day for 2 weeks followed by 8 mg p.o. twice a day (16mg/day, target dose).  
•   The metabolism of galantamine is primarily through the cytochrome P450 system, specifically the CYP2D6 
and CYP3A4 isoenzymes.  We will exclude subjects who have impaired hepatic function and/or who are 
currently using strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 (e.g. , ketoconazole and paroxetine, respectively).  
 
 
8.0 Reporting of Adverse Events or Unanticipated Problems involving Risk to Participants or Others  
 
Any protocols will be reviewed and approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Review Board (IRB) before any 
subject is enrolled. The PI will be responsible for ensuring both data integrity and for ensuring that study 
participants are safely cared for and that all AEs are noted, followed , and reported to the IRB. Any untoward 
medical event will be classified as an adverse event, regardless of its causal relationship with the study. An 
adverse event will be classified as serious if it a) results in death, b) is life -threatening, c) requires inpatient 
hospitalization  or prolongation of existing hospitalization, d) results in persistent or significant disability or 
incapacity, e) is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Serious adverse events will be reported to Dr. Satish R. 
Raj, the Data and Safety Monitoring Officer  (DSMO ), and the IRB  within 10 days of the PI’s notification of the 
event . Non -serious, unexpected adverse events will be reported  to the IRB at the time of the annual continuing 
review.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Plan:  The PI will be responsible for pre paring an administrative progress report 
every 12 months describing the progress of the study and safety data. The reports will be reviewed internally 
by her mentors and also by Dr. Satish Raj, the Data and Safety Monitoring Officer (DSMO). All studies wil l be 
registered in ClinicalTrials.gov prior to enrolling subjects.

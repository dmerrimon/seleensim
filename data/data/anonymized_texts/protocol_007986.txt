G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 7  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 Brief outline of 
treatments:  
 Subjects will complete the screening procedures up to 60 days before dosing to 
determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase. Subjects will be 
instructed  to fast from midnight prior to study visits and to dose with insulin as 
per their usual practice.  
Eligible participants will undergo two episodes of insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and in random order will receive G-Pen™ glucagon 1 mg 
subcutaneously during one episode and Lilly glucagon 1 mg subcutaneously 
during the other episode. The procedure to evaluate the efficacy of the G-Pen™ 
glucagon consists of inducing hypoglycemia by an IV infusion of regular insulin 
diluted in normal saline.   
For treatment visits, s ubjects will check into the clinical research center  in the 
morning still fasting except for w ater.  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) or 
Lilly Glucagon blinded study medication to the following treatment sequenc e: 
Group  Dose 1 Dose 2  
1 G-Pen™ 1.0 mg  Lilly 1.0 mg  
2 Lilly 1.0 mg  G-Pen™ 1.0 mg  
Note: The following is a summary only. Please see section 7.2 for a detailed 
description of the hypoglycemia induction procedur es and see Section 10.2 .1 
for a detailed description of the treatment visit procedures.  
Subjects will have a catheter for IV insulin inf usion inserted in one arm and 
another catheter for blood sampling inserted in the other. The arm used for blood 
sampling will be kept warm by use of a heating pad or similar device to increase 
blood flow to achieve “arterialized” samples.  
Starting plasma g lucose level will be determined by taking  three measurements 
over 30 minutes . After 30 minutes:  
1. Subjects will be given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin :  
a. Dose will be calculated based on the starting plasma glucose level and the 
subject’s self -reported glucose correction factor.  
b. Additional bolus doses of insulin may be given as guided by the investigator’s experience if the trajectory of plasma glucose after 30 
minutes is > 60 mg/dL. Late bolus doses (i.e., within 20 minutes of 
dosing)  shou ld be avoided.  
2. Subjects will be given an  IV infusion of regular insulin. The starting IV 
infusion rate will be based on a subject’s current use of insulin:  
a. For subjects on insulin pump, the pump will be discontinued and IV 
insulin infusion will be started  at 1.5x the recorded  basal rate.  
b. For subjects on long-acting injected insulin:  
i. If the subject took their normal evening or morning dose before the 
visit, IV insulin infusion will be started at 1x the basal rate.*  
ii. If the subject did not take their normal e vening or morning dose 
before the visit, IV insulin infusion will be started at 2x the basal 
rate.*  
c. Guided by experience, the investigator may adjust the IV insulin infusion 
rate at his discretion if the rate of glucose change after 30 minutes is < 1 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 8  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 mg/dL/min.  
* For injected insulin uses, the basal rate will be calculated by dividing the daily 
dose by 24 to calculate the amount of insulin on board in units/hour.  
Plasma glucose measurements will be taken every 15 minutes while glucose is 
>80.0 mg/d L and at 5 -minute intervals once plasma glucose is ≤ 80.0 mg/d L.  
Once the initial plasma glucose measurement < 50 .0 mg/d L is achieved, the IV 
insulin infusion will be stopped. During the 5-minute period after the  IV insulin 
infusion has stopped, the glucos e level is expected to continue to decrease by 
approximately 5 mg/dL  due to the delayed effect of insulin. Once the 
confirmatory plasma glucose reading < 50.0  mg/d L is achieved 5 minutes later, 
subjects will be administered blinded study drug via the subcutaneous route in 
the upper arm, leg or abdom en.  
Following dosing, plasma glucose will be monitored every 5 minutes until 90 minutes post -dosing.  Additional blood samples will be collected at -5, 0, 10, 20, 
30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes and stored at -70C for determination of 
plasma glucagon and potentially insulin levels. After this, the subject will 
resume insulin  pump therapy, if applicable, and will be give n a meal. The 
subject can then leave the clinic after glucose concentration is confirm ed to be 
between 70 and 180 mg/dL . 
Subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding hypoglycemia symptoms at the 
start of the hypoglycemia induction period and periodically until 30 minutes 
post-treatment with glucagon. The hypoglycemia induction procedure  is 
expected to elicit symptoms of a hypoglycemic response. However, the procedure is not expected to be of sufficient duration, or to generate such a low 
glucose concentration in the CNS that it will impair consciousness characteristic 
of severe hypoglycemia.  
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the clinic and the 
study procedures will be repeated with each subject crossed over to the other 
treatment. After study -related procedures are performed on each of the treatment 
days, subjects will be discharged.  A follow-up visit will be conducted 3-14 days 
following administration of the final dose as a safety check.  
Tolerability will be assessed by comparing adverse event reports between the 
groups. In addition, subjects will comple te questionnaires  concerning injection 
site discomfort. An investigator will use modified Draize scales to evaluate the injection sites following each administration.  
Data management and 
statistical analysis:  Data will be entered into an electronic Case R eport Form by site personnel. Data 
will be monitored at on-site visits by Xeris personnel or by a CRO acting as 
Xeris’ agent.  
The primary comparison will be performed using the intent -to treat (ITT) cohort 
defined as all subjects randomized to one of the two sequence groups: G-Pen 
followed by control, or control followed by G -Pen.  A failure is recorded if the 
subject's plasma glucose fails to rise above 70 .0 mg/d L within 30 minutes of the 
start of therapy.  
The following scoring system will be applied to a ll subjects in the ITT cohort.  If 
a G-Pen failure is observed then the treatment  failure score = 1.  Similarly , the 
failure score = 1 if a control failure is observed.  If the treatment outcome is 
missing , then the treatment  failure score = 0.2.  A missing control outcome 
yields a control failure score = 0.1.  An observed success for both groups yields 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 9  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 a failure score = 0.  
The G-Pen acceptance criterion will be based on the sample mean of the 
treatment minus control failure scores from each subject i n the ITT population.  
If Dht is the sample mean and SE is the estimated standard error of the subject 
treatment minus control failure scores, then the G-Pen will be accepted 
provided:   
Dht + 2.6 SE is less than or equal to 0.1.   
This criterion, particula rly the value 2.6, came from Monte -Carlo simulations 
from selected scenarios,  where the population G -Pen failure rate exceeded the 
control rate by 0.1. Under these circumstances the rate of G-Pen acceptance was 
found to be within 0.025 using this criterion. The acceptance criterion for the G-
Pen in this study will be that the  total difference in failures, G -Pen minus 
Control (i.e., Lilly Comparator), shall not exceed 3 and the total number of 
failures for the G-Pen shall not exceed 4, after the 75th evaluable subject 
completes both treatment periods.  
If the total number of subjects with criterion failures (counted in a blinded 
fashion) exceeds 4, a monitoring statistician not otherwise involved with study conduct may provide an unblinded determination of the distribution by treatment 
group for futility only, and communicate a finding of futility (or continue to conclusion) to Xeris’ upper management for further decisions, while the study 
team remains blinded. Success will not be tested and no penalty for thi s futility 
only check is planned.  
Sample Size 
Determination:  Using the above criterion, a sample size of 75 subjects yields probabilities of G-
Pen acceptance of over 90% if the population failure rates of G-Pen and control 
are equal, and the rate of missi ng observations is within 15%.  These results 
were obtained using Monte Carlo simulations with G -Pen and control total 
failure rates up to 5%, and with G-Pen success Control failure, or G-Pen failure 
Control success within 1%.  
Patients may be recruited at approximately 8 clinical sites with a goal of no 
single center accounting for > 20% of the total sample.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 6. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE 
6.1. Indication 
The proposed indication is f or the treatment of severe hypoglycemia. 
6.1.1. Background  
One of the main complications of glycemic control with insulin is the emergence of 
hypoglycemia, and the absolute or relative excess of therapeutic insulin is the determinant of 
risk.  Hypoglycemia in dia betes is defined as “all episodes of abnormally low plasma glucose 
concentration that expose the individual to potential harm” [ ADA], and manifests clinically as 
diaphores is, pallor, nausea, palpitations, tremor, anxiety, cognitive impairment, behavioral 
changes and psychomotor abnormalities, and loss of consciousness, seizure, and coma in severe 
hypoglycemia [ DCCT/EDIC) Study Research Group ].  Recent reports have found that from 6% 
to 10% of deaths of patients with type 1 diabetes are attributable to hypoglycemia 
[Skrivarhaug, U.K. Hypoglycaemia Study Group].   The American Diabetes Association 
Workgroup recommends that patients with drug -treated diabetes (insulin secretagogue or insulin) 
become concerned about developing hypoglycemia at a plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) [ ADA].  
Therapy with insulin causes hypoglycemia during the course of established type 1 diabetes, and 
progressively more frequently over time in type 2 diabetes.  The U.K. Hypoglycemia Study 
Group reported an incidence of 110 hypoglycemic episodes per 100 patient -years in patients with 
type 1 diabetes treated with insulin for <5 years, and an incidence of 320 episodes per 100 
patient -years in those with type 1 diabetes treated for >15 years [ U.K. Hypoglycaemi a Study 
Group].   Type 1 diabetics suffer an average of two symptomatic hypoglycemic events per week – and a severe, temporarily disabling event approximately once a year [ McLeod ].   Insulin- using 
type 2 diabetics typically have several hypoglycemic episodes in a given year, 1- 2 of these being 
severe episodes. There are currently approximately 1.4 milli on type 1 and 3.8 million insulin -
using type 2 diabetics in the US alone [ CDC].  On average, the total insulin- using patient 
population experiences about 3 million severe hypoglycemic events per year.   
The American Diabetes Association recommends that all insulin - and sulfonylurea -using 
diabetics carry glucagon emergency kits (GEKs) and use glucagon as first line therapy in the event of a severe hypoglycemic event. However  a recent survey indicates only about 30% of the 
insulin -using diabetics carry GEKs [ Close Concerns ].  The current standard of care for severe 
hypoglyc emia is an injection of glucagon.  Administration of glucagon with current products (i.e. 
Lilly Glucagon for Injection, and Novo GlucaGen®) is a nine -step process including assembly of 
the kit, aqueous reconstitution of the powdered glucagon, and manual ad ministration of the dose 
[Glucagon, Glucagen ].    
Glucagon is a 29 amino- acid polypeptide with a molecular weight of 3485 Daltons.  The peptide 
is secreted by the alpha cells of the islets of Langerhan’s in the pancreas, and functions as an anti-hypoglycemic agent and a gastrointestinal motility inhibitor . A single glucagon gene 
encodes a larger proglucagon biosynthetic precursor in mammals. Tissue -specific processing of 
proglucagon gives rise to glucagon, and to glicentin, oxyntomodulin, GLP -1, and GLP -2.  As a 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 21  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 natural (non -steroid) hormone synthesized in the pancreatic islet cells, it binds to glucagon 
receptors in the liver, causing liver cells to convert glycogen polymers into glucose molecules.  
The cloned glucagon receptor encodes a 485 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular 
weight of 54,962 Da ltons [ Jelinek ], which signals t hrough both adenylate cyclase and 
intracellular calcium with an EC50 of ~ 1 nM [ Wakelam ].    
6.1.2. Rationale  
Patients with diabetes frequently develop defective regulatory responses to hypoglycemia associated with reduced or absent glucagon responses. This is an important clinical problem, as current  diabetes management with intensive insulin regimens usually increases the risk and 
frequency of hypoglycemic events. 
In response to the unmet medical need for a simple and ready -to-use glucagon for episodes of 
severe hypoglycemia, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is developing a glucagon rescue pen called the 
G-Pen™ , which utilize s Xeris’ biocompatible, non -aqueous peptide/protein reformulation 
technology.  This technology has enabled Xeris to create a concentrated, low volume, stable 
glucagon formulation, pre -mixed and pre -loaded into a prefilled syringe and auto- injector pen. 
This creates a product with a number of advantageous features, including:  a ready -to-use 
treatment with no reconstitution required, precise and rapid dosing, a hidden needle, and enhanced port ability and availability due to room -temperature stability, to provide a superior 
alternative to currently marketed treatments.  
6.2. Non-Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology Experience with 
Glucagon  
Native glucagon for injection (bovine, porcine origin) was approved for use in humans in 1960 [FDA CDER #1 ].  The 29 amino acid sequence of pancreatic glucagon is identical in humans, 
cows, pigs, dogs, and rats, and is also conserved in biosynthe tic versions of glucagon [ Eistrup ].  
Glucagon for injection (rDNA origin) was approved in 1998,  and is currently the subject of two 
approved NDAs ([N DA 20 -928] and [NDA 20- 918]).  Complete NDA -required pharmacology 
and toxicology data have been reviewed and accepted by the FDA, as described in Lilly 
Glucagon [rDNA origin] for injection  and Novo Gluca Gen® (glucagon [rDNA origin] for 
injection) labeling  [Glucagon, Glucagen] .  As Xeris’ drug product is produced by solid- phase 
peptide synthesis (SPPS) , which also conserves the glucagon peptide sequence, the rDNA 
glucagon information is pertinent to the development of G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) for the 
treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  A summary of this information can be found in Xeris’ current 
Investigator’s Brochure, which will be provided to each investigator participating in this study.

6.3. Description and Composition of Drug Product  
Syntheti c glucagon is the drug substance in G -Pen™ (glucagon injection).  Glucagon cGMP 
grade is manufactured, packaged and released by Bachem AG (Bubendorf, Switzerland), 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 22  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 conforms with USP standards and has a Type II DMF filed with the FDA.  G -Pen™ (glucagon 
injection) is a sterile subcutaneous injectable non -aqueous formulation for treatment of severe 
hypoglycemia.  G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) delivers 1 mg of glucagon, with trehalose and 
DMSO as excipients. The drug product is stored at controlled room temperature (20 -25°C) prior 
to use.   
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) is supplied in 1.0 mL long Crystal Zenith® pre -filled cyclic olefin 
polymer syringe with Flurotec® coated plunger .  The pre -filled syringe is loaded into a Molly ® 
single -use, disposable auto -injector from SHL Group , and is packaged in a sealed poly/ foil 
pouch. 
6.4. Clinical Experience with Glucagon  
Glucagon has a long history of medical use in the US, and is currently marketed by Eli Lilly & 
Co. as Glucagon (Glucagon Injection [rDNA origin]), and Novo Nordisk as GlucaGen® 
HypoKit®, both RLDs for treatment of severe hypoglycemia.  Glucagon has a rapid onset of 
action and an extremely short half -life, and its safety, efficacy and clinical pharmacology have 
been well established [ FDA CDER #2 ]. The Agency first approved glucagon for use in humans 
in 1960. 
As of September 25, 2013, IND 115091 went into effect and Study No. XSGP -201 was 
completed in January 2014. This study examined safety, PK, and efficacy of rescue doses (0.5 
and 1.0 mg) of G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) as compared to Lilly Glucagon (1.0 mg) in healthy 
volunteers. The results of this study as well as a summary of clinical pharmacology, published 
studies, post -market surveillance data and immunogenicity of Lilly Glucagon are provided in 
Xeris’ current Investigator’s Brochure.

7.1. Study Overview  
This is a randomized, blinded, two -way crossover comparative efficacy and safety study in 
patients with T1D.  The study involves t wo daytime CRC or comparable setting visits 7 -28 days 
apart, with random assignment to receive G -Pen™ glucagon 1 mg during one session and Lilly 
Glucagon 1 mg during the other .  Patients will complete the screening procedures up to 60 days 
before Randomization to determine eligibility before enrollment to the treatment phase (Table 3 ).  
Table 3:  Randomized treatment sequence 
Group  Dose 1  Dose 2  
1 G-Pen™ 1 mg  Lilly 1 mg  
2 Lilly 1 mg  G-Pen™ 1 mg  
The procedure to evaluate the efficacy of the G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) consists essentially of 
inducing hypoglycemia by IV administration of regular insulin diluted in normal saline.  Each 
participant will undergo two episodes of insulin- induced hypoglycemia in random order and 
receive 1 mg G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) during one episode and 1 mg Lilly G lucagon during 
the other episode.  A combination of one or more IV bolus doses of insulin along an IV infusion of insulin will be used to decrease a subje ct’s plasma glucose to a target <50 .0 mg/dL.  The IV 
insulin infusion will be stopped once the plasma glucose is <50.0 mg/dL. As per Section 11.2, all 
plasma glucose levels will be based on the average of two readings taken at each time point.     
After a confirmatory plasma glucose of <50.0 mg/dL is obtained at least 5 minutes after  the 
initial reading < 50 .0 mg/dL , the subject will be treated subcutaneously in the upper arm, leg or 
abdomen with either 1 mg Lilly Glucagon or 1 mg G -Pen™ (glucagon injection).  
Blood glucose levels will be monitored for 90 minutes post -dosing.  It is believed that blood 
glucose <50 mg/dL will be low enough to gener ate neuroglycopenic and autonomic symptoms in 
most subjects, yet high enough to avoid impairment of consciousness. Consequently, subjects will complete a questionnaire about symptoms of hypoglycemia [ Nermoen ] during the 
hypoglycemia induction phase, and for 45 minutes after treatment with glucagon. 
After a wash -out period of 7 to 28 days, subjects will return to the clinic and the procedure will 
be repeated with each subject crossed over to the other treatment.  
After study -related procedures are performed on each of the treatment days, subjects will be 
discharged after receiving a meal  as per each site’s usual practice.  A follow -up visit as a safety 
check will be conducted 3- 14 days following administration of the final dose.   
7.2. Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure and Justification  
The most commonly used hypoglycemia insulin induction method cited in the literature 
[Nermoen ] involves constant insulin infusion rates many- fold above normal basal infusion rates. 
As hepatic glucose production is determined by the glucagon to insulin ratio, this procedure may not create realistic circ umstances for evaluating the effectiveness of glucagon in raising blood 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 24  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 glucose. The present study, therefore, utilizes a comparatively lower rate of insulin infusion at 
one to two times the normal basal rate, combined with intravenous push of a bolus dose  of 
insulin derived from the subject’s own self -reported glucose correction factor.  
Hypoglycemia Induction Procedure  
Starting plasma glucose level will be determined by taking 3 measurements over 30 minutes 
upon the subject’s arrival at the CRC  (i.e., at 0, 15 and 30 minutes) . After the third measurement  
at 30 minutes : 
1. Subjects will be  given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in saline:  
a. Dose will be  calculated to reduce plasma glucose from the subject’s starting plasma 
glucose level to 50 mg/dL based on the subject’s self -reported glucose correction 
factor.  
b. Guided by experience and the subject’s HbA1c value at Screening, the investigator 
may adjust the starting bolus dose at his discretion. As a guideline, increasing the insulin dose by 20% should be considered for subjects with an Hb A1c > 8 .0%. 
c. An a dditional bolus dose of insulin may be given as guided by the investigator’s 
experience if the trajectory of plasma glucose after 30 minutes is >  60 mg/dL. 
However, late bolus doses (i.e., within 20 minutes of dosing) should be avoided.  
2. Subjects w ill be  given an IV infusion of regular insulin diluted in saline. The starting IV 
infusion rate w ill be  based on a subject’s current use of insulin as fol lows:  
a. For subjects on insulin pump, the current basal rate will be recorded, the pump will be 
discontinued and IV insulin infusion will be started at 1.5x the recorded basal rate.  
b. For subjects on long- acting injected insulin:  
i. If the subject took their norm al evening or morning dose before the visit, IV 
insulin infusion will be started at 1x the basal rate.* 
ii. If the subject did not take their normal  evening or  morning dose before the 
visit, IV insulin infusion will be started at 2x the basal rate.*  
c. Guided by experience and the subject’s HbA1c value at Screening, the investigator may adjust the starting basal rate at his discretion. As a guideline, increasing the basal rate by 25% should be considered for subjects with an Hb A1c > 8.0% . 
d. Guided by experience, the investigator may adjust the IV insulin infusion rate at his 
discretion if the rate of glucose change after 30 minutes is < 1 mg/dL/min.  
* For injected insulin uses, the basal rate will be calculated by dividing the daily dose by 
24 to calculate the amount of insulin on board in units/hour.  
7.3. Interruption and Termination of Dosing  
Dosing will be paused for any SAE that  occurs in a subject receiving treatment until causality is 
fully assessed by the Investigator.  Dosing will cease if the SAE is determined t o be either drug -
related or unknown, and may resume if the SAE is determined to be not drug- related by the 
investigator and the Sponsor is in agreement.

9.1. Allocation to Treatment 
Subjects will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups to receive the appropriate sequence 
of blinded study medication (see Table 3 ).  Approximately 80 patients will be randomized with a 
goal of completing 75 patients, or roughly 37- 38 patients per group.  If there are a large number 
of subjects who are randomized but fail to receive either study drug , compensatory enrollment  
will be  utilized  to achieve at least 75 evaluable subjects. Each subject w ill receive a single 
subcutaneous injection on each  of the two (2) treatment days, with a period of 7- 28 days between 
doses.   
9.2. Blinding  
For t his study, both subject and investigator will be blinded.  The only unblinded study staff will 
be a pharmacist and depending on operational procedures at each site, one or more additional  
trained study staff member whose only role will be to administer the glucagon. (i.e., the unblinded staff administers the dose then leaves the room and does not participate in any other 
study procedures). The subject’s ability to see the injection equipment and procedure will be 
obstructed and the subject will be instructed not to talk with the study staff about their impression of which product he/she received at a particular visit. G -Pen™ is being developed for 
subcutaneous (sc) injection. The marketed comparator is labeled for both sc and intramuscular (im) injection. To help maintain blinding, both drugs will be administered via the sc route in this study.  
The 1 mg G-Pen™ device mak es a series of two audible clicks when the dose is administered. 
To help ensure blinding, the clinical staff will move to an adjoining room during the process of drug administration by the unblinded staff. If operational considerations preclude leaving the  
room, the clinical staff will look away and will use means (e.g., headphones, fingers in ears and 
humming, etc.) to mask sound during dosing procedures.      
Blinding should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety.  Whenever 
possible, the investigator or sub- investigator should consult the Sponsor prior to breaking the 
blind.  When the blinding is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered in the 
CRF.  Subjects for whom the treatment has been unblinded will be with drawn from further study 
treatments, but will still complete a follow -up visit if practical (see Section 10.2.3).  
9.3. Drug Supplies  
9.3.1. Drug Product Formulat ion and Packaging  
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) from Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a non- aqueous, injectable 
liquid formulation of glucagon.  The G -Pen™ drug product consists of 1 mg synthetic glucagon 
peptide dissolved in a primary DMSO solvent, with treha lose added as a stabilizing excipient.

9.3.2. Lilly Glucagon for Injection  
Lilly Glucagon will be purchased commercially  and provided by Xeris . The glucagon will be 
stored at the research pharmacy according to labeled storage conditions.  
9.3.3. Preparation, Dispensing and Administration 
• G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) will be supplied as 0.2 mL of non- aqueous solution in a plastic 
Crystal Zenith (CZ) 1 mL long syringe loaded into a Molly™ disposable auto- injector.  
Subcutaneous administration will be performed by a qualified site staff member  who has read 
the Instructions for Use  (Appendix 4 ). 
• In the case of Lilly Glucagon, a new vial of Glucagon will be reconstituted using 1 ml of 
sterile diluent immediately (i.e., within 2 hours) prior to use and subcutaneous administration 
will be performed as per the label [ Glucagon]  using the administrations sites specified below .  
Study medications will be prepared and dispensed by an unblinded site pharmacist according to the randomization schedule  accessed in the EDC sy stem .  
Study medications will be administered by an unblinded member of the study staff who will not 
be involved in collection or interpretation of study results. Prior to administration, the intended injection site should be examined to ensure it has a normal appearance and is free from signs of inflammation or injury.  The staff member administering the injection will document the 
administration act in the EDC.  
The injection site for a particular subject will remain fixed between the two treatment visits (i.e., arm, leg or abdomen) but will be varied between the left and right upper arm, leg or abdominal 
quadrant for the first and second dose of study medication. The injection site  for each subject 
will be assigned as part of the randomization in the EDC . 
9.3.4. Drug Storage and Drug Accountability  
Unless notified otherwise by the Sponsor, all supplied G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) auto-
injectors are to be stored at controlled room temperature between 20°C to 25°C (68° to 77°F), 
and drug solution should be clear and of a water -like consistency at time of use.  
The investigator or an approved study staff will ensure that the study medications are stored in a 
secure area under recommended storage conditions and in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements.  
The s ite will maintain appropriate documentation of continuous storage conditions and these 
records will be monitored in an on- going basis by the monitor.  Any deviations in the storage 
conditions must be documented (including minimum and maximum temperature excursion as well as estimate of total duration of storage outside the recommended storage conditions).  Such 
deviations must be communicated to the Sponsor as soon as identified by the site with 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 30  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 appropriate course of action taken regarding the future use of  the study medications upon 
consultation with Xeris Pharmaceuticals.  
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss or other 
disposition of the investigational drug products and supplies . Unused drug product will be 
returned to Xeris. Used auto -injectors will be returned to Xeris after accountability is performed 
during site close -out. Other used supplies will be destroyed  according to local regulation and 
applicable Xeris Pharmaceuticals SOPs, following accountability by Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee . 
After administration, used vials of Lilly Glucagon should be returned to the kit and stored under blinded conditions for accountability, while the syringe is disposed as per each site’s standard practice. Used G -Pens  should be returned to the foil pouch, which will be sealed with tape, and 
stored under blinded conditions for accountability. Any devices that fail to function should be handled similarly, but be identified on the pouch label as a failure.  
9.4. Concomitant Medications  
All subjects must be questioned about concomitant medications at each visit.  Medications taken within 4 weeks before Day 0 will be documented in the CRF. Any changes to a subject’s concomitant medication regimen after the first Treatment on Day 0  will also be documented in 
the CRF.  
With the exception of those medications (e.g., warfarin) listed under the exclusion criteria (see Section 8.2 ) and other currently investigational agents which are absolutely proscribed, there are 
no medications that are specifically prohibited during participation in the study. Subjects should be on a stable dose of all concomitant medications for at least 30 days prior to S creening, and 
they will be encouraged to avoid making changes to their concomitant medication regimen 
during participation in the study. In addition, investigators are encouraged to avoid adding to or 
changing a participant’s medications during study participation unless deemed absolutely medically necessary.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A schedule of assessments for this study is provided below in Table 5 .  
10.1. Visit 1 -  Screening (Day - 60 to - 3) 
Subjects will be screened to confirm they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the study.  
Prior to completing any screening activities, the investigator or study team member will obtain 
informed consent from e ach subject in accordance with the procedures described in Section 16.3 
- Subject Information and Consent .  A copy of the consent/authorization form will be given to 
the subject. The original will be kept by the site for the source document. 
Subjects will be instructed to complete a site visit at least 3 days (to allow for receipt of blood 
test results), and no more than 60 days prior to the anticipated date of the first treatment visit 
(Day 0). The following evaluations will be completed during the S creening visit to confirm 
subjects meet eligibi lity criteria for this study:  
1. Assessment of inclusion/exclusion criteria by a study investigator, including a review of the subject’s medical history and medications . 
2. Recording of the subject’s insulin correction factor (i.e., the reduction in blood glucose in mg/d L per 1 unit of insulin taken).  
3. Measurement of height and weight.  
4. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic and genitourinary exams.  
5. Performance of a 12- lead ECG after subject has completed a 10 -minute supine rest.  
6. Assessment of v ital signs, including triplicate measurements of BP, after a 5 -minute 
seated rest.  
7. Urine drug screen. Note: At investigator discretion, subjects with a positive result for other than THC will be allowed to participate if the subject reports use of a concomitant  
medication that explains the result (e.g., positive urine test for opiates in a subject 
reporting use of cough syrup containing Dextromethorphan ).  
8. Urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.  
9. Collection of venous blood for the following test s as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities : hemoglobin A1C, c -peptide, complete blood count (without differential), 
metabolic set (including creatinine, liver set, and electrolytes) , and screening for HIV, 
HBV and HCV ( Table 7 ).  
Once laboratory results are obtained and a final determination of eligibility is made, subjects will be contacted to schedule the first treatment visit. While immediate re -testing of laboratory results 
is not allowed, subjects failing to meet laboratory -based eligibility criteria may be rescreened 
after a 1 -month wait.  
Subjects will be instructed to fast, taking nothing but water by mouth from midnight prior to the 
next visit. S ubjects will be instructed to take their long -acting insulin in the morning, if that is 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 32  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 their usual practice, and that they should also take any corrective insulin as they would normally 
do.  
10.2. Treatment and Follow -Up Phase  
The subject will arrive to the cli nic in the morning having fasted (i.e., with nothing by mouth 
except for water) for at least 6 hours for the two treatment visits only (i.e., Visits 2 and 3), at 
which time the following procedures will be completed:  
10.2.1. Visit 2 -  Treatment 1 (Day 0) 
The following procedures will be carried out at this visit.  
1. Plasma glucose (via YSI) will be assessed . If the result is > 27 0.0 mg/dL, no further 
procedures should be performed, and the visit should be rescheduled after a minimum 24-hour wait.  
2. The subject will be questioned, any changes in concomitant medications  will be 
documented in the CRF , and it will be confirmed that the subject is not receiving a 
medication that is exclusionary.  
3. Women of childbearing potential will receive a urine pregnancy test , which must be 
negative before further participation is allowed.  
4. If it has been more than 30 days since Visit 1, venous blood will be collected for a repeat of baseline hematology and serum chemistry assessments.  However, the visit may 
continue base d on qualificat ion at the Screening visit .  
5. Full v ital signs , including triplicate BP  will be assessed after a 5 -minute seated rest. It 
will be confirmed that the subject continues to meet eligibility requirements for SBP and 
DBP.  
a. Heart rate and single BP will be repeate d immediately prior to dosing and at 30, 60, 
120 and 240 minutes post -dosing with ± 5 minutes for all collections . 
6. Important: a t this point, the subject may be randomized via the EDC system.  
7. Hypoglycemia induction (see Section 7.2), PD/PK determinations and study treatment will be performed as follows: 
a. Subjects will have a catheter for IV insulin infusion inserted in one ar m and another 
catheter for blood sampling inserted in the other. The arm used for blood sampling 
will be kept warm by use of a heating pad or similar device to increase blood flow in 
order to achieve “arterialized” samples. 
b. Three measurements of plasma glu cose concentration will be made over 30 minutes, 
approximately every 15 minutes  to determine the starting plasma glucose level . 
Thereafter, plasma glucose will be determined every 15 ±5 minutes while the 
concentration is >  80.0 mg/dL and every 5±2  minutes once it is ≤ 80.0 mg/dL. Note: 
once the confirmatory glucose < 50.0 mg/dL is obtained, the next plasma glucose to be collected will be at 5 minutes post -dosing with glucagon, at which point the 
schedule of collecting plasma glucose every 5 minutes will resu me. 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 33  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 c. Within 5 minutes of determining of the starting plasma glucose level , , subjects will 
be given an initial IV bolus push dose of regular insulin diluted in saline:  
i. Insulin dose will be  calculated to reduce plasma glucose from the subject’s 
starting plas ma glucose level to a target of 50 mg/dL based on the subject’s self -
reported glucose correction factor.  
ii. For example, if the subject’s starting BG is determined to be 130 mg/dL  and the 
subject’s reported correction factor is 40 mg/d L per unit of insulin, the IV bolus 
push dose would be calculated as: 130- 50 = 80/40 = 2.0 units of insulin.  
iii. Guided by experience and the subject’s HbA1c value at Screening, the 
investigator may adjust the starting bolus dose at his discretion.  
iv. As a guideline, the investigator should consider increasing the bolus dose of insulin by 20% for subjects with an A1c level > 8.0% at S creening. Using the 
above example, the bolus dose would be increased as follows: 2.0 units x 1.2 = 2.4 units of insulin.  
An IV infusion of regular insulin diluted in saline  will be started . The starting IV infusion rate 
will be  based on a subject’s current use of insulin (i.e., continuous infusion pump vs. daily long-
acting injections) and daily basal dose  of insulin as show n below in Table 4 . 
Table 4:  Calculation of Starting IV Insulin Infusion Rate  
Subjects on Insulin Pump Subject s on Long- Acting I njected Insulin  
1. Discontinue the pump  1. Calculate the basal rate in units / hr .  
(i.e., cumulative basal dose / 24 hrs .) 
2. Start IV insulin infusion at 1.5x the current  basal rate  2. Did the subject take their normal daily dose either the evening before or the morning before the visit?  
YES  NO 
3. Start IV insulin infusion 
at 1x the calculated basal 
rate 3. Start IV insulin infusion 
at 2x the calculated basal 
rate 
d. Guided by experience and the subject’s HbA1c value at Screening, the investigator may adjust the starting basal rate at his discretion. As a guideline, increasing the basal rate by 25% should be considered for subjects with an A1c > 8.0%.  For example, if 
the subject’s current basal rate is 0.8 units/hour, it would be increased as follows: 0.8 
units/hour x 1.25 = 1.0 units/hour.  
e. Guided by experience, the investigator may adjust the IV insulin infusion rate at his 
discretion if the rate of glucose change after 30 minutes is < 1 mg/dL/min.  
f. Once an initial plasma glucose measurement < 50 .0 mg/dL is achieved, the IV insulin 
infusion will be stopped. Note: The requirement is that the average of the readings 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 from the 2 YSI leads be < 50.0 mg/dL, but it is not r equired that both readings be < 
50.0 mg/dL. 
i. A first baseline PK blood sample should be collected at the point that plasma 
glucose first reaches a concentration < 50 .0 mg/dL. 
g. After 5 minutes, a confirmatory plasma glucose measurement will be performed.  
i. If plasma glucose remains < 50 .0 mg/dL, randomized study drug will be 
administered (see Section 9.3.3) after collection of a second baseline PK blood sample. 
ii. If plasma glucose has risen to ≥  50.0 mg/dL, the IV insulin infusion will be 
restarted and the sequence repeated until there are two consecutive plasma glucose readings < 50 .0 mg/dL on record. Note: Only 2 total baseline PK samples 
should be collected, even if the IV insulin is restarted. The initial PK sample is collected at the first point that a plasma glucose < 50.0 mg/dL is obtained. The second is collected after the confirmatory reading < 50.0 mg/dL is obtained, even 
if this is more than 5 minute s separated from the initial PK collection.  
Note: If consecutive readings of plasma glucose < 50.0 mg/dL are not achieved 
within 3 hours of the start of the hypoglycemia induction phase, the visit should be terminated.  In this case:  
i. Study drug should NOT be given.  
ii. The visit should be terminated and rescheduled after a 7 -day minimum wash -out 
period.  
iii. If appropriate, insulin pump therapy should be restarted and a meal provided. The 
subject can leave the clinic after plasma glucose is confirmed to be between 7 0 
and 180 mg/dL . 
h. Following study drug administration, plasma glucose will be measured every 5 ±2 
minutes until 90 minutes post -dosing. Note: At their discretion, investigators may 
continue to monitor glucose levels for safety during the remainder of the visit.  
i. At any time post -dosing if a subject exhibits signs of coma or convulsions, or if 
plasma glucose remains < 60 .0 mg/dL at 30 minut es post -dosing, a 25 mL IV bolus 
dose of 50% dextrose will be given. Signs and symptoms should be monitored and if 
the subject’s condition fails to improve within 15 minutes, additional dextrose or other intervention may be given at the discretion of the i nvestigator.  
j. Additional blood samples will be collected at 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 minutes post -dosing with ± 5 minutes per collection, and processed and stored at -
70C for determination of plasma glucagon and potentially insulin levels ( see Table 5 ). 
k. At 240 minutes post -dosing, the subject will resume pump therapy, if applicable, and 
will be given a meal. The subject can then leave the  clinic after plasma glucose is 
confirmed to be between 70 and 180 mg/dL . Note: If necessitated by rising glucose 
levels, insulin pump therapy can be re -started as early as 120 minutes post -dosing. 
Additionally, IV insulin can be administered to non- pump using subjects to prevent 
hyperglycemia, starting at 120 minutes post -dosing with glucagon.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 8. Subjects will complete a questionnaire regarding severity of hypoglycemia symptoms 
(Appendix 1 ) at various time points, including:  
a. Just before the IV bolus push dose  of insulin is given a t the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure.  
b. Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of pl asma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure.  
c. Just before study drug is administered, and  
d. Every 5±2  minutes after glucagon is administered until all symptoms have abated 
(i.e., all symptoms have score = 1) or 45 minutes post -dosing, whichever occurs first. 
9. Local tolerability will be assessed as follows:  
a. Subjects will complete a Visual Analog (VAS) questionnaire regarding injection site 
discomfort ( Appendix 2) at 10 ±5 and 30±5  minutes post -dosing, and again at 240±5  
minutes post -dosing if VAS score reported at 30 minutes is > 0 mm.  
b. Subjects will complete an Injection Site Discomfort Description and Duration Questionnaire  at 10±5 minutes post -dosing. If discomfort is ongoing at 10 minutes 
post-dosing, the questionnaire will be updated before the subject leaves the clinic to 
document the final duration.  
c. An investigator will use the modified Draize scales ( Appendix  3) to assess erythema 
and edema formation at the injection site at 10 ±5 and 30±5  minutes following 
administration.  Any injection site with a score > 0 for either erythema or edema at 30 minutes post -dosing will be re -evaluated for both at 240±5  minutes post -dosing. If 
any scores remain > 1 at the 240 -minute evaluation, the subject may leave the clinic 
but will be instructed to contact study staff if the condition fails to resolve.  
10. Adverse events reported by the subject or observed by an investigator will be recorded in 
the CRF.  
10.2.2. Visit 3 -  Treatment 2 (Day 7- 28) 
The subject will return 7 to 28 days following the first treatment visit.  The procedures to be 
followed at this visit are as listed in Section  10.2.1, with the exception of item s #4 as no blood 
work is required at Visit 3 . At this visit, the  other study medication will be given, so that between 
the two dosing visits, each subject will have  received G-Pen™ (glucagon injection) once and 
Lilly Glucagon once .   
10.2.3. Visit 4 -  Follow -Up (Day 10 -42) 
The subject will attend a follow -up visit within 3 -14 days of completing the final dosing visit or 
premature discontinuation. This visit will include  the following assessments:  
1. Review of changes in concomitant medications  
2. Physical examination, excluding breast , pelvic and genitourinary exams  
3. Body weight. 
4. 12-lead ECG after 10 -minute supine rest

6. Urine pregnancy test (fe males of child -bearing potential)  
7. Blood draws for complete metabolic count and complete blood count  
8. Adverse event questioning by asking the subjects to respond to a non- leading question 
such as “how do you feel?”  
In case of any premature discontinuation of  a subject from the study, the subject will, if possible, 
be scheduled for a final  follow -up visit.  
10.3. Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Sponsor for safety, behavioral or administrative reasons.  If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be 
made to contact the subject to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the 
scheduled visit, and to reschedule the missed visit. This includes contacting subjects via email 
and telephone, including family members or emergency contacts. If such efforts fail, a certified 
letter should be sent to the subject’s last known address requesting the y contact study staff.  
In all  circumstances , every effort should be made to document subject outcome.  Information 
regarding the reason for not completing the study will be recorded in the CRF.  The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return for a f inal visit, 
and follow -up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs.  It will be documented whether or 
not each subject completed the study. Any subject who receives at least one treatment dose of study medication will be included in the safety analysi s.  
If a decision by the investigator or sponsor is made to withdraw a subject, a final visit should be 
scheduled soon after the decision to withdraw is made.  The subject will be asked to return to site 
for the assessments listed in Section  10.2.3.  
If the subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent, no further evaluations 
should be performed, and no additional data should be collecte d.  The Sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent.

Every effort should be made to ensure that the required tests and procedures are completed as 
described.  However, it is anticipated that there may be circumstances outside the control of the 
investigator, who will take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject. 
When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason(s) 
and any corrective and preventive actions taken to ensure that study processes are adhered to as soon as possible.  The study team  and the sponsor will be informed of these incidents in a timely 
fashion. 
For all blood and urine collections , an effort should be made to obtain these samples at roughly 
the same time of day (i.e., morning or afternoon) across all visits  as well  as at the  time periods 
specified in the Schedule of Activities.  In addition, visits to the site must occur within the pre -
defined windows outlined in this protocol , otherwise they will be considered as protocol 
deviations  
11.1. Blood Volume 
There will be approximately 30 PD samples of about 2cc each and 11 PK samples of 8.5 cc each 
drawn at each treatment visit for a total of about 214 cc of blood per visit. These two studies will be 7 to 28 days  apart.  There will be a 10.5 cc sample at Screening and the Follow -up Visit  for a 
clinical chemistry panel and hematology, with an additional 15.5 cc sample at Screening for eligibility determination . A total of about  344 cc of blood will be drawn over the total study, an 
amount that will not exceed 4.6cc / kg body weight  for a 7 5 kg subject ( Table 6 ).

tests.  
Rapid urine drug screen kits  will be provided to sites by Xeris . If a su bject tests positive for other 
than THC, the subject will normally be excluded from further study participation. However, if a 
subject reports use of a concomitant medication (prescription or OTC) that provides a reasonable 
explanation for a positive resul t other than THC, the subject may be allowed to participate in the 
study at the investigator’s discretion. If the subject is not able to provide a reasonable 
explanation but still refutes a positive finding, a urine sample will be sent to the central laboratory for confirmation. The result of this confirmatory test will be considered definitive.  
The remainder of the screening visit should still be completed in this case. 
A central analytical lab will analyze the PK samples collected in this study. The procedures for 
preparing, storing and shipping PK samples to the analytical lab will be provided in a laborator y 
manual that will be provided to all sites prior to the start of the study  To the extent possible 
based on available storage space at the sites, PK samples will be batched so as to reduce the 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 40  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 overall number of shipments. The main and back -up PK samples (i .e., A liquot s 1 and 2) for a 
particular subject should NEVER be included in the same shipment. 
During treatment visits, plasma glucose levels will be measured using a bedside YSI rapid 
glucose analyzer. At each time point  specified in Section 10, the result s of both the black and 
white leads to one decimal place will be record ed in the source documents, with the  average of 
the two values rounded up to the nearest one decimal place accepted as the plasma glucose level for the time point as per the following examples.  
Example #1: black lead = 50.1 and white lead = 49.8 
 Calculation: 50.1 + 49.8 = 99.9/2 = 49.95 = 50.0 mg/dL recorded result  
Example #2: black lead = 74.4 and whit e lead = 74.5 
 Calculation: 74.4 + 74.5 = 148.9/2 = 74.45 = 74.5 mg/dL recorded result  
The glucose analyzer will be set to auto -calibrate  following the standard practice at each site.  
Before each subject visit , performance checks will be made as per the standard practice at each 
site, and sites will maintain a log of these results.  
11.3. Electrocardiogram (12- lead ECG)  
Single, supine 12- lead ECGs will be obtained at the pre -defined time -points outlined in Schedule 
of Activities as follows:  
• 12-lead ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10 
minutes in a supine position. 
• 12-lead ECGs should be obtained before assessment of BP and heart rate, and prior to 
blood collections.  
11.4. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate 
The BP and heart rate will be measured at the times specified in the Schedule of Activities.  
Additional or changes to collection times, or collection of BP and heart rate using automated 
device s is permitted, as necessary, to ensure appropriate subject’s safety.  
BP and heart rate will be measured in the seated  position with the subject’s arm supported at the 
level of the heart, and recorded to the nearest mmHg. The dominant arm will be used throughout the study.  The subject should be rested for at least 5 min . before the BP is obtained. 
Measurements of both the BP and heart rate must be taken at least 2 min . apart and recorded in 
the CRF.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 12. SAFETY AND ADVERSE E VENT (AE) REPORTING 
12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a c linical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.  Examples of AEs include:  
• Abnormal test findings . 
• Clinically significant symptoms and signs . 
• Changes in physical examination findings which are untoward and deemed clinically significant by the investigator.  
• Allergy/hypersensitivity . 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding may be reported as an AE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms,  
• Test resul t requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention , 
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing or discontinuation from the study, 
significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other treatment. 
• Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or Sponsor.  
Repeat of a test based on an abnormal result in the absence of the above conditions does not constitute an AE.  Any abnormal test result determined to be an error does not require reporting 
as an AE.  
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is an AE that either commenced following initiation of study 
treatment or was present prior to study treatment but increased in frequency or severity following initiation of study treatment.  
Standard medical terminology should be used in de scribing AEs.  Informal descriptions should 
be avoided.  
12.2. Reporting Adverse Events 
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship 
to the study treatment will be reported with two exceptions.  Since it is being experimentally 
induced in this study, hypoglycemia will not be considered an AE in this study unless the event meets one of the definitions of an SAE (see Section  12.4). Injection site reactions will not be 
considered an AE unless a skin reaction or pain requires medical intervention.   
For all AEs, the investigator must pursue and attempt to obtain information adequate to 
determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the FDA criteria for 
classification as an SAE, requiring immediate notification to Xeris Pharmaceuticals.  For all 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 42  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 AEs, follow -up by the investigator is required until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level 
acceptable to the investigator to consider it closed . For an unresolved AEs to be considered 
stable, the Medical Monitor  must  concur with that assessment.  
As part of ongoing safety reviews conducted by the Sponsor, any non- serious adverse event that 
is determined to  be serious (according to the FDA definitions of a n SAE) will be reported by the 
Sponsor as a n SAE.  To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may 
be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the 
context of the clinical study.  
12.3. Reporting Period 
For all AEs, the reporting period to Xeris Pharmaceuticals begins from the  subject providing 
informed consent , through the Follow -up Visit. All adverse events will be followed until 
resolution or  the subject is medically stable.  
12.4. Serious Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization  or extends hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant di sability  
• Is another important medical event  
Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important 
medical event.  An important medical event may not be immediately life -threatening and/or 
result in hospitalization or death.  However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent a S AE outcome, the important medical event 
should be reported as serious.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm or blood dyscrasias or convulsions which do not result in hospitalization.  
12.5. Severity Assessment  
On the AE case report forms (CRF), the investigator will use the adjectives “mild,” “moderate,” 
or “severe” to describ e the maximum intensity of the AE.  These intensity grades are defined as 
follows in Table 8  below. 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 43  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 Table 8:  AE Severity Assessment  
Mild Does not interfere with subject’s usual function  
Moderate Interferes to some extent (<50%) with subject’s usual 
function  
Severe  Interferes significantly (≥50%) with subject’s usual function  
The terms “serious” and “severe” are not synonymous.  The term “severe” is often used to 
describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event.  The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance.  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
subject/event outcome or action criteria.  Accordingly, a severe event is not necessarily a serious event.  
12.6. Causality Assessment  
The investigator will use the following question when assessing causality of an adverse event to study drug, where an affirmative answer designates the event as a suspected adverse reaction: “ Is 
there a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event ?” A ‘‘r easonable possibility’’ means 
that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AEs.  The investigator must record the causal relation ship in the CRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in 
accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements, if applicable.   
12.7. Withdrawal Due to Adverse Events  
Withdrawal due to AE should be distinguished from withdrawal due to insuff icient response, and 
recorded on the appropriate CRF.  When a subject withdraws due to an SAE, the SAE must be reported in accordance with the reporting requirements (see Section  12.9 ). 
12.8. Eliciting Adverse Event Information and Reporting 
The investigator is to report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by the study subject.  Each study subject will be questioned about AEs.  Each AE is to be assessed to determine if it meets the criteria for SAEs.  If an SAE occurs, expedited reporting will follow the 
provisions of Section 12.9. 
12.9. Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
If an SAE occurs, Xeris Pharmaceuticals is to be notified within 24 h ours of awareness of the 
event by the investigator.  In particular, if the S AE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals must be made immediately, irrespective of the extent of available AE 
information.  This time frame also applies to follow -up on previously forwarded SAE reports.  
In the rare event that the investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of an SAE immediately (e.g., a study subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the investigator is to report the event within 24 h ours after learning of the event and document the time of first 
awareness of the AE.   
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 44  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 A death occurring during the study, during the per -protocol follow -up period, or within 30 days 
after stopping treatment with test drug must be reported to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its 
designee(s) immediately, whether or not it is con sidered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports 
must be followed by detailed descriptions.  These should include copies of hospital case records 
and other documents when requested.  Telephone and e -mail reports must be confirmed promptly 
either by facsimile or by overnight courier or mail.  
12.10.  Non-Serious Adverse Event Reporting Requirements 
All AEs will be reported on the AE page(s) of the CRF.  AEs should be reported using concise 
medical terminology on the CRFs as well as on the form for collection of the SA E information. 
12.11.  AE Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities  
AE reporting  by the Sponsor , including suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions, will be 
carried out in accordance with applicable regulations.  
The investigator must notify the IRB of  the occurrence of any SAE, in writing, as soon as is 
practicable and in accordance with local regulations.  A copy of this notification must be provided to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited  reporting, an SAE report will be 
prepared for submission to the FDA and any other applicable authorities  by the Sponsor or its 
designee . 
12.12.  Pregnancy 
The active pharmaceutical product in Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ G -Pen™ (glucagon injection) is 
Glucagon, which i s in Pregnancy Category B.  Female subjects able to become pregnant will be 
tested (rapid, urine) for pregnancy at the S creening visit. Any subject found to be pregnant at the 
Screening visit (Visit 1) will not be randomized to treatment. At both treatment  visits and at the 
follow -up visit  (i.e., Visits 2, 3 and 4) , pregnancy test ing will be repeated .   Any subject who is 
found to be pregnant at one of the treatment visits will be withdrawn from the study immediately  
and no further study treatment s will be given. Pregnancy at the follow -up visit will be noted, but 
the visit will be completed. Any pregnancy in a subject who received at least one dose of study 
drug will be followed until resolution (i.e., birth or voluntary or spontaneous termination of the pregnancy).  Any pregnancy outcome that meets the criteria for an SAE will be reported as an 
SAE.  
12.13.  Subject Monitoring  
Subjects will be monitored for AEs throughout the study by the study unit staff.  The principal 
investigator or designated sub- investigator w ill be on site for drug administration and until 4 
hours after administration of study drug to the last subject.  The principal investigator or 
designated sub- investigator will also be on call for the remainder of the treatment visit .  If 
necessary, a phys ician, either at the study site or in a nearby hospital, will administer treatment 
for any AEs.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 Safety parameters, including laboratory results and ECGs, will be assessed by the principal 
investigator or his delegate using the site’s criteria for clinical laboratory and ECG acceptance 
ranges as suggested guidelines in making the medical assessment.  
Scheduled safety measurements will be repeated according to appropriate SOPs or upon request 
from a physician.  Any abnormal repeated measurement will be evaluat ed by a physician and 
repeated if judged necessary.  Further action may be taken on the physician’s request.  
Subjects will be advised to notify their health care professionals (e.g., physician, dentist, and/or pharmacist) that they are participating in a c linical research study of a drug called synthetic 
Glucagon Injection before taking any medicines or undergoing any medical procedure.

 46  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 13. DATA ANALYSIS AND ST ATISTICAL METHODS  
13.1. Efficacy  
The primary objective is to verify that the G -Pen is non-inferior to contro l in terms of 
hypoglycemia relief. The primary comparison will be performed using the intent -to treat (ITT) 
cohort defined as all subjects randomized to one of the two sequence groups: G -Pen followed by 
control, or control followed by G -Pen.  A failure for  either treatment will be recorded if plasma 
glucose remains ≤ 70.0 mg/d L throughout the 0 -30 minute period from the drug administration. 
Consistent with ICH Guideline E9, excluded from the ITT analysis will be subjects who fail to 
meet all eligibility cri teria and/or are randomized to treatment, but receive neither study drug.  
The following scoring system will be applied to all subjects in the ITT cohort.  If a G -Pen failure 
is observed then the treatment failure score = 1 ; similarly the control failure score = 1 if a control 
failure is observed.  If the G -Pen treatment outcome is missing then the treatment failure score = 
0.2.  A missing control outcome yields a control failure score = 0.1.  An observed successful 
plasma gl ucose rising above 70.0 mg/d L within 30 minutes yields a failure score = 0, for either 
treatment.  Therefore, all subjects in the ITT cohort will have G -Pen and control failure scores 
[Koch ].   
13.1.1. Primary Endpoint:  
The G -pen acceptance criterion will be based on the sample mean of the treatment minus control 
failure scores from each subject in the ITT population.  If Dht  is the sample mean of the G -Pen 
minus control failure difference, and SE is the estimated standard error of Dht (square root of the 
estimated G -Pen minus control variance divided by the sample size), then the G -Pen will be 
accepted provided :  
 Dht + 2.6 S E ≤ 0.1.   
This criterion, particularly the value 2.6, came from Monte -Carlo simulations from selected 
scenarios where the population G -Pen failure rate exceeded the control rate by 0.1. Under these 
circumstances the rate of G -Pen acceptance was found to b e within 0.025 using this criterion, 
with missing data rates within 15%.  This bound of 0.025 on the type 1 error rate was observed 
for control failure rates up to 5%.    Monte Carlo simulation rather than asymptotic normality is 
necessary because an obser ved failure from either G -Pen or control is expected to be low, less 
than 5%.  
13.1.2. Sample Size Calculation: 
Using the above criterion, a sample size of 75 subjects yields probabilities of G -Pen acceptance 
of over 90% if the population failure rates of G -Pen and control are equal, and the rate of missing 
observations is within 15%.  These results were obtained using Monte Carlo simulations with G -
Pen and control total failure rates up to 5%, and with G -Pen success Control failure, or G -Pen 
failure Control success within 1%.   
The power and type 1 error bounds were obtained from a simulation model using a 3x3 table of 
outcomes for G -Pen and control.  The three outcomes for each were Success, Failure, and 
Missing .  Probabilities were assigned to each of the 9 cells,  with the missing outcome being 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 47  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 stochastically independent of the Success, Failure outcome combinations.  Also the failure score 
difference, G -Pen minus control, was assigned to each of the nine cells.  To simulate o ne 
replicate of the study, 75 independen t draws were made from the multinomial distribution 
determined by the probabilities from the 9 cells, and the sample mean, estimated standard error were computed.  The G -pen acceptance criterion was applied and either a 0 ( G-pen failed) or 1 
(G-pen accepted) was recorded.  This was repeated 10,000 times to obtain the estimated 
probability of G-pen acceptance under the conditions defined by the cell probabilities. The 
simulations were performed using R version 3.1.2 (2014- 10-31). 
Approximately 80 subj ects will  be randomized at approximately 8 clinical sites with a goal of no 
single center accounting for > 20% of the total randomization . 
13.2. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
The pharmacokinetic endpoints will be derived from the individual plasma glucagon and insulin profiles. The pharmacodynamic endpoints will be derived from the individual glucose profiles.  
13.2.1. Pharmacokinetic Secondary Endpoints:  
The data for each of the ethnicities/races and the overall population will be analyzed 
descriptively w ith AUC, C
max and t max. Consistent with the objectives of the study (see Section  
5.2) PK data will be analyzed from the first 12 subjects to complete treatment with G -Pen in each 
of the following major ethnicities and races in the US: non- Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and 
African -Americans.  
13.2.2. Pharmacodynamic Secondary Endpoints:  
Time for plasma glucose to reach >70 .0 mg/d L, AUC, Cmax and Tmax will be compared 
between the treatment groups using a mixed model with  treatment, period and sequence as terms.  
Symptom relief will be analyzed as aggregate scores for the four autonomic, four 
neuroglycopenic symptoms and 8 total symptoms (see Appendix 1). The time to the minimal score post baseline will be described and compared between the treatment groups using a mixed 
model with  treatment, period and se quence as terms. Similarly, the time to first reporting of “no” 
for the global hypoglycemia question will be described and compared between the groups. 
13.3. Safety Analysis  
All safety analyses will be performed using the safety cohort of subjects, namely those subjects 
receiving at least one dose of the study medication. 
The following variables will be compared between the treatments for safety purposes:  
• Adverse events and serious adverse events  
• Laboratory safety variables (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Physical exa mination (Screening to Final Visit)  
• Vital signs  
• Body weight (Screening to Final Visit)

• Local tolerability, including:  
o Subjective injection site discomfort as reported by subjects using a 100- mm VAS 
and ordinal pain scales ( Appendix 2).  
o Erythema and or edema formation at site of injection  assessed using the Draize 
scale (Appendix 3 
13.3.1. Adverse events:  
All AEs will be coded by the Medical Monitor using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class and study drug. A summa ry table 
indicating the number and the percentage of exposed subjects having at least one AE will be made.  
13.3.2. Laboratory safety assessments:  
Laboratory values (biochemistry and hematology) will be flagged if outside the normal range. A 
listing of abnormal val ues will be presented in an end of text (EOT) listing. The individual 
values will be listed indicating values outside normal range. Laboratory assessments will be 
summarized at S creening and at end of trial.  
13.3.3. Physical examination:  
Subjects with any findings  in the physical examination evaluation at S creening will be listed. 
Changes to physical examination from S creening to end of trial will be recorded as AEs if the 
Investigator judges these as being clinically significant.  
13.3.4. Vital signs and body weight:  
Vital signs will be summarized by descriptive statistics.  
13.3.5. ECG:  
Any deviation from normal ranges of the measured laboratory parameters will be documented and followed as appropriate. The Investigator’s evaluations will be summarized in an EOT 
listing.  
Clinically  significant deviations/changes from the Screening Visit to the Final Visit will be 
documented as AEs if the Investigator judges these as being clinically significant.  
13.3.6. Local Tolerability:  
The incidence of any injection site discomfort (score >0 on the ordinal rating scale) will be 
analyzed descriptively. The incidences of erythema and edema will be analyzed in a similar manner. Descriptive statistics (only) will be provided for time of onset and duration (of 
discomfort) and discomfort description (i.e., pain, irritation, itching, etc.). Mean VAS scores will 
be compared between the treatments.

Safety and efficacy by gender (male, female), age (18 -64 years, 65 years and above), and race 
(non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanics, and African -Americans ) will be analyzed descriptively.  
13.5. Interim Analysis  
If the total number of subjects with criterion failures (counted in a blinded fashion) exceeds 4, a 
monitoring statistician not otherwise involved with study conduct may provide an unblinded 
determinatio n the distribution by treatment group for futility, and communicate a finding of 
futility to Xeris’ upper management for further decisions, while the study team remains blinded. 
Success will not be tested and no penalty for this futility only check is planned.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 14. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During study conduct, Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its agent will conduct p eriodic visits to ensure 
that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices are being followed.  The monitor may review 
source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The investigator and institution will allow Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ m onitor  or its designee , and appropriate regulatory 
authorities, direct access to source documents to perform this verification.  
The study site may be subjected to review by the Institutional Review Board and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Xeri s Pharmaceuticals or its designee , and/or to inspection by 
appropriate regulatory authorities.  It is important that the investigator and study staff are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process.

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 15. DATA HANDLING, RECORD KEEPING, MONITORING AND 
AUDITS  
15.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an 
electronic data record, or both.  A CRF is required and should be completed for each individual 
subject.  The completed original CRFs are the property of Xeris Pharmaceuticals and should not 
be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Xeris Pharmaceut icals or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Xeris 
Pharmaceuticals.  
The investigator has the responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and 
ensuring that these are accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, contemporaneous, enduring and available when required.  The CRFs must be signed by the investigator or by an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained in the CRFs is true.  
Any corrections to entries made in the CRFs  or source documents must be dated, initialed and 
explained (if necessary) , and should not obscure the original entry.  
In most cases, the source docum ents are the hospital’s or physician’s subject chart.  In these 
cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator’s site as well as at Xeris Pharmaceuticals and clearly identify those 
data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will  stand as the source document  
15.2. Record Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regul atory authorities or Xeris Pharmaceuticals, the 
investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent docume nts, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed 
records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e.g., letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports).  The records should be retain ed by the 
investigator according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), regulations, or 
as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer.  The investigator must obtain 
Xeris Pharmaceuticals’ written permission before dispo sing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met.  
15.3. Monitoring  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by Xeris Pharmaceuticals and/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines. 
The Xe ris Pharmaceuticals’ designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact the 
investigator and conduct regular visits to the clinical site.  The monitor will be expected and 
allowed to verify the investigator’s qualifications, to inspect clinica l site facilities, and to inspect 
study records, including proof of IRB review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will 
XSGP -301 Clinical Protocol    
G-Pen™ (glucagon injection)    
 52  
Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 be maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations, including HIPAA requirements.  
The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting 
CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for 
accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross- checked for consistency with source 
documents, including laboratory test reports and other subject records.  Instances of missing or 
uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the investigator.  
The monitor/auditor will also investigate any questions concerning adherence to regul atory 
requirements.  Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact with the site through frequent direct communications with the study site by e -
mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail.  The investigator and al l other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and all questions raised and difficulties detected by the monitor.  
15.4. Audits and Inspections  
The investigator understands that regulat ory authorities, the IRB, and/or Xeris Pharmaceuticals 
or their designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study 
to at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application or for at least 2 years after 
clinical development of the study drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  The investigator is required to guarantee access to these documents and  to cooperate with and 
support such audits and inspections.

TERMINATING THE STUDY  
18.1. Protocol Modifications and Deviations  
The principal investigator must sign this protocol and its amendments (if any) before initiating 
the study at a particular site.  The investigator will make  all reasonable efforts to comply with the 
written protocol.  Protocol modifications to ongoing studies that affect the safety of subjects or that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosing, s tudy assessments, the number of subjects exposed to test drug, or subject 
selection criteria must be made only after consultation between Xeris Pharmaceuticals and the investigator.  All protocol modifications must be reviewed and approved by the IRB befor e the 
revised protocol can be implemented.  Emergency revisions that eliminate an apparent hazard to 
subjects do not require preapproval by the IRB.  However, the IRB must be notified in writing as 
soon as possible after the modification has been made.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to Xeris Pharmaceuticals.  All departures from the protocol must be fully documented 
in the source documents and the CRFs of the subjects involved. 
18.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB, safety problems, or at the discretion of Xeris Pharmaceuticals or 
the principal investigator.  Circumstances that may warrant premature study termination include, but are not limited, to the following:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects, 
• Failure to enter subjects at an acceptable rate,  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol,  
• Insufficient provision of complete and evaluable data, or  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Xeris Pharmaceuticals will promptly 
notify the investigator documenting the reason for study termination, and spec ific procedures for 
termination will be arranged by the sponsor in coordination with the investigator.  After 
notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects within 7 days.  All study 
materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible, and all study 
materials must be returned to Xeris Pharmaceuticals or its designee within an additional 28 days.

APPENDIX 1. HYPOGLYCEMIA SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRE  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the Hypoglycemia Symptom 
Questionnaire at the following time points:  
• Just before the IV bolus push dose of insulin is given at the start of the hypoglycemia 
induction procedure.  
• Every time blood is drawn for evaluation of plasma glucose concentration during the 
induction procedure.  
• Just before study drug is administered. 
• Every 5±2  minutes after glucagon is administered, until all symptoms have abated 
(i.e., all symptoms have score = 1) or 45 minut es post -dosing, whichever occurs first.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will provide verbal responses, which will be record ed on the questionnaire by study staff. Documentation will 
be provided on each com pleted questionnaire as to who completed the form. 
Subject I nstructions:  Please rate the current intensity (severity) of each of the following 
symptoms  on a scale of 1 -6, with a minimum score of “1” meaning the symptom was absent and 
a maximum score of “6” meaning the symptom was severe. For the final question, please answer 
“yes” or “no.”

Protocol XSGP -301 v1.6 Confidential  16 Mar 2017 APPENDIX 2. INJECTION SITE DISCOMFORT ASSESSMENT  
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Injection Site Discomfort  
Investigative Site Instructions:  The subject should complete the 100-mm Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS)  for Injection Site Discomfort at both 10±5  minutes and 30±5 min utes following  the 
injection of study drug, and again before the end of the clinic visit (i.e., at 240± 5 minutes post -
dosing) if  the VAS score at 30±5 minutes is > 0 mm. The subject completes the VAS by drawing 
a single vertical line through the scale corresponding to the perceived intensity (severity) of 
discomfort according to the instructions below. The goal is for the subject t o report the amount 
of discomfort, if any, remaining at each time point, as opposed to reporting the transient pain associated with needle insertion.  
Note: If a subject is unable to physically complete the questionnaire, the subject will indicate the 
point  on the VAS corresponding to their level of discomfort, and study staff will enter a vertical 
line at that point. Documentation will be provided on each completed questionnaire as to who 
completed the form. 
Please verify the length of the VAS line to be 10 0-mm before providing it to the subject.  
Subject I nstructions:  Ignoring any pain from insertion of the needle, please draw a single vertical 
line through the scale below that corresponds to the intensity (severity) of any discomfort you are 
feeling right now  at the study drug injection site.  
Discomfort could include stinging, burning, tingling, throbbing or pain. The further to the right 
you make your vertical mark, indicates the more intense discomfort you are feeling.  
You should normally draw a straight line across the scale to indicate your current level of discomfort. However if you are currently feeling no discomfort, you should circle the vertical line on the left end of scale (above the word “no”). If you are currently feeling the worst 
discomfort possible, you should circle the vertical line on the right end of the scale.

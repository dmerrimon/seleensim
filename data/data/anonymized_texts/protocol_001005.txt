Why are we meeting with you? 
We want to tell you about something we are doing called a research study.  A research study is 
when doctors collect a lot of information to learn more about something.   
and some other
 doctors are doing a study to learn more about children with cancer.  After we tell 
you about it, we will ask if you’d like to be in this study or not. 
Why are w
e doing this study? 
The study is being done to learn more about treatments done after blood or bone marrow 
transplants to help get rid of your own cells in the blood after the transplant.  The study doctors 
hope this tre
atment will make it less likely that your cancer will return.  
 What will happen to you if you are in the study? 
Onl
y if y
ou agree, these things will happen: 
1. After your transplant, once your white blood cells build up again (usually 4-5 weeks),
your doctor will check whether you have any signs of a sickness called graft-versus-host
disea
se (GVHD).  GVHD happens when your donor’s cells attack your own cells after
the transplant, which can cause problems like skin rash, diarrhea, yellow skin or yellow
e
yes.  We  will also test your blood and bone marrow for donor’s cells.  The doctors will
do both these things even if you are not in this study.  The next parts of your treatment
will depend on two things:  1) whether you have graft-versus-host disease, 2) whether
y
our bone marrow has mostly your cells or mostly your donor’s cells, and 3) whether
there are any cancer cells still in your blood
2. If 
you do not have graft-versus-host disease, then the treatments which help your body
a
ccept your donor’s cells will be slowly stopped.  If there are mostly donor cells in your
bone
 marrow, these treatments will be stopped over 10 weeks, and you will start taking a
drug called azacitidine once they are over.  Every 6 weeks you will take azacitidine for

throug
h your veins in the clinic or at home as a shot under your skin.   
 
3. I f there is a mixture of your own cells and your donor’s cells, then the treatments which 
help your body accept your donor’s cells will be stopped over 4 weeks instead of 10.  
You w
ill then take azacitidine in the same way as the group above.  You may also receive 
more
 cells from your donor, called donor lymphocyte infusions on day 5 of each cycle if 
ther
e are enough donor cells.  These cells will be given directly into your veins.   Each 
ti
me you are given more donor cells, the amount of these cells will increase if you are not 
ha
ving too many problems from this treatment.    
 
4. You w ill be watched for signs of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) regardless of which 
tre
atment you are receiving. You will be asked to call your doctor right away if a rash, 
diarrhea or jaundice appears.  If you develop signs of graft-versus -host disease, your 
doctor will start treating that disease by giving you more medicine. You will be asked to 
come back to the clinic more often (maybe as often as once a week) and you may even 
need to spend a night in the hospital.  The doctors will do these things even if you are not 
in this study. 
 
5. I t is possible that the number of donor cells in your blood will change during your 
treatm
ent.  Because of this, your doctor will test your blood 4-8 weeks after each cycle of 
azacitidine and check your bone marrow every two cycles.    
 
6. I f your bone marrow tests show a small number of cancer cells in the bone marrow (less 
than 1 in 100 cells) you will continue with treatments on this study. If the amount of 
cancer cells is large, you may stop the study treatment and get other treatments 
recommended by your doctor. 
 
 Will this study hurt? 
 
D
rawing blood through the central line (the tube that is used to give you medicine and blood) 
does not hurt.  Bone marrow are the cells inside of your bone and you will be given anesthesia 
(medicine to m
ake you sleep) so you will not feel the bone marrow being taken out.  If you get a 
skin rash, it may be itchy. Diarrhea can cause some stomach pain. Yellowing of the skin and eyes 
usually does not hurt. If you get a skin rash and diarrhea, you will probably be admitted to the 
hospital to get pain medicine and other medicine to treat your symptoms.  
 
Will you get better if you are in this study? 
 
The treatment in this study may help keep your sickness from coming back in the future, but 
ther
e is also a chance that it will not help. The doctors might find out something that will help 
other children like you later. 
 
 Do you have any questions?

can talk to someone else. 
 
Do you have to be in the study? 
 
No, you don’t.  No one will be mad at you if you don’t want to do this.  If you don’t want to be 
in t
his study, just tell us.  Or if you do want to be in the study, tell us that.  And, remember, you 
can say yes now and change your mind later.  It’s up to you. 
 
If you don’t want to be in this study, just tell us. 
 
If you want to be in this study, just tell us. 
The doctor will give you a copy of this form to keep.

PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
 
TITLE  
A Phase  1/2, Open -Label,  Dose -Escalation,  Safety  and Tolerability  Study  of NC318  in Subjects  with 
Advanced  or Metastatic Solid  Tumors  
HYPOTHESES  
NC318  will be adequately  tolerated  following  administration  in multiple  ascending  doses  to subjects  with 
refractory  solid  tumors and  that such administration  may result  in clinical  benefit.  
OBJECTIVES  
Primary  Objectives  
1) To evaluate  the safety,  tolerability,  and dose-limiting  toxicities  (DLTs)  of NC318  
2) Define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or pharmacologically active dose (PAD) of NC318 in  
subjects  with advanced or  metastatic  solid  tumors  
Secondary  Objectives  
1) To evaluate  the pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of NC318  
2) To assess  preliminary  efficacy  of NC318  by assessing  objective  response  rate (ORR),  duration  of 
response  (DoR),  and disease  control  rate (DCR)  per Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  
(RECIST) v1.1  
3) To evaluate expression of Siglec -15 in tumor tissue and immune cell infiltrates at baseline and  
following NC318 treatment, and correlate expression level with efficacy and changes in tumor  
infiltrating  lymphocytes  
Exploratory  Objectives  
1) To assess  the immunogenicity  of NC318  
2) To explore  biomarkers  that may predict the  pharmacologic activity  of NC318  
3) To characterize the effect of NC318 on immune markers such as cytokine and immune cell  
phenotypes  
4) To assess soluble S15 level at baseline and changes after NC318 treatment, and correlation with  
efficacy.  
STUDY  ENDPOINTS  
Primary  Endpoints  
1) Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed  by monitoring  frequency,  duration,  and severity  of adverse  
events  (AEs). Note:  Toxicity  grading  per NCI CTCAE v5.0  
Secondary  Endpoints  
1) The endpoints  for assessment  of PK of NC318  include  individual  NC318  concentrations  in serum  
and PK parameters.  
2) The endpoints for assessment of antitumor activity/efficacy include objective response (OR) and  
disease control (DC) based on RECIST v1.1, DoR, progression -free survival (PFS), and overall  
survival (OS)  as per  REC IST v1.1 
3) Tumor biopsy analyses to evaluate Siglec -15 (S15) expression in tumor tissue and immune cell  
infiltrates at baseline and following treatment, and correlate expression levels with efficacy and  
changes  in tumor infiltrating  lymphocytes.

The Phase  1a design  is summarized  below:  
A minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in each cohort beginning with Cohort -1 (8 mg;  
starting  dose).  The first 3 evaluable  subjects  within  a cohort  will be observed  for a DLT  observation  period  
of 28 days, before the next cohort begins enrollment. Only one subject will be dosed on the first day of  
dosing for each cohort (additional subjects can begin in ≥48 hours). The dose will be escalated if 0 of the  
first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled has a DLT. If 1 of the first 3 eval uable subjects enrolled has a DLT,  
then the cohort will be expanded to include 3 additional evaluable subjects, and if no DLT occurs in the  
additional  3 subjects,  then the dose will be escalated.  If a DLT  occurs  in one-third  or more  of the expanded  
cohort, then the MTD will be deemed to be exceeded and the previous dose level will be considered the  
MTD.  Intermediate  dose levels  below  the MTD  may be explored  pending  safety  review.  If only 3 subjects  
were treated at the MTD or PAD, then a minimum of 3 additional evaluable subjects will be enrolled at  
this dose before it  is administered  in Phase 2  of the study.  
If Cohort -1 (8 mg; starting dose) exceeds the MTD, the sponsor and investigators will consider dosing  
NC318  at a lower  dose,  and/or  investigate  8 mg at alternate  dose schedules,  based  on available  safety,  PK, 
PD, and biomarker data. If an alternate schedu le is determined to be safe, re -escalation of NC318 will  
proceed according  to the table below.  
Throughout the treatment period, if > 33% of subjects (a minimum of 6 subjects) experience a ≥ Grade 3  
toxicity related to study drug after completing ≥ 4 cycles , then dose administration will be stopped, and  
the MNTD will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available  
safety  data.  
Subjects who drop out for reasons other than a DLT (e.g., events clearly associated with the u nderlying  
disease,  disease  progression,  concomitant  medication,  or comorbidity),  during  the 28-day DLT  
observation  period  will be considered  non-evaluable  and will be replaced.  Dose  modifications  should  not 
be made during the DLT observation period without discussion with the medical monitor. Intrasubject  
dose escalation  is not permitted;  however,  once  the recommended Phase  2 dose (RP2D)  and schedule  has 
been determined, ongoing subjects in Phase 1 may be per mitted to escalate to the RP2D with approval of  
the medical  monitor.  
 
Phase  1b – Safety  Expansion  
The purpose of Phase 1b was to evaluate additional PD activity of NC318 and confirm the preliminary  
safety  of the dose escalation  cohorts  from  Phase  1a. Several  cohorts  from  Phase  1a were  expanded  at doses  
and schedules equivalent to or lower than the high est dose levels determined to be safe and/or doses  
determined  to be pharmacologically  active.  
 
The following  cohorts  were  expanded  during  Phase  1b: Cohort  2 (80mg),  Cohort  3 (240mg),  and Cohort  4 
(400mg). Phase 1 enrollment of the study is complete. A total of 49 subjects were enrolled across Phase  
1a and Phase  1b. 
 
 
The Phase  1b design  is summarized  below:  
Approximately 36 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in the Phase 1b safety expansion, with each cohort  
enrolling  approximately  9 evaluable  subjects.  If < 3 of 9 evaluable  subjects  experience  a DLT,  the cohort  
will be deemed  safe. If > 1 safety  expansion  cohort  is deemed  safe, then a recommended  dose and schedule  
will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all available safety, PK,  
PD, and biomarker  results.  The safety  expansion  cohorts  may be conducted  in parallel  to Phase  2 and may 
be limited  by the sponsor  to subjects  with specific  tumor types  to achieve a  balance  across  cohorts.

Phase 2  
The trial is currently  enrolling  Phase  2. Phase  2 will evaluate  subjects  with advanced  or metastatic  solid  
tumors characterized as Tumor Mutational Burden High (TMB -H) and/or MicroSatellite Instability High  
(MSI -H)/ deficient MisMatch Repair (dMMR). The following tumor types will be enrolled: Lung, Head  
and Neck  Squamous  Cell Carcinoma  (HNSCC,  Breast,  Endometri al, Melanoma,  CRC,  Urothelial,  
Cholangiocarcinoma,  and other  tumors known  to be  TMB -H and/or  MSI-H/dMMR.  
 
Previously as part of the initial Phase 2 design, a RP2D of 400mg Q2W was tested. 47 subjects were  
treated  at the initial  RP2D.  Based  on further  ongoing  evaluation  of the PK/PD  studies  from  Phase  1/2, the 
RP2D was adjusted to 800mg with an alternative administration schedule. To further evaluate the new  
RP2D,  a Phase 2 Safety  Run-In will  be conducted utilizing  a 3+3 design ( Figure S1 ). 
 
Phase 2 - Safety  Run-in: 
A minimum of 3 evaluable subjects will be enrolled. The first 3 evaluable subjects will be observed for a  
DLT observation period of 28 days. Only one subject will be dosed on the first day of dosing (additional  
subjects  can begin  in ≥ 48 hours).  If there  are no DLTs  observed  in the first 3 subjects,  then Phase  2 Dose  
Expansion  may begin  at the new RP2D. If  1 of the first 3 evaluable  subjects  enrolled  has a DLT,  then the 
cohort will be expanded to include 3 additional evaluable subject s. If there are no DLTs in the additional  
3 subjects, then Phase 2 Dose Expansion may begin at the new RP2D. If a DLT occurs in one third or  
more of the 3 additional subjects then the enrollment will be paused and intermediate dose levels or  
alternative  dose schedules  may be considered.

Phase  2 - Dose  Expansion:  
Phase 2 Dose Expansion will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and PK/PD  
activity of NC318 at the RP2D utilizing a Simon 2 -stage design ( Figure S2 ). Subjects will be stratified  
after enrollment  into two main cohorts based on S15  expression and  tumor type:  
 
• Cohort  1: Select S15+  Tumors  (Lung  (adenocarcinoma),  HNSCC,  Breast)  
• Cohort  2: Alternate  Tumors  (including  Other S15+  Tumors and  S15- Tumors)

Cohort  1: Select  S15+  Tumors  
This cohort  will include  subjects  who are 1) confirmed  as TMB -H and/or  MSI-H/dMMR,  2) express  S15, 
and 3) have  one of the  following  tumor types,  separated into tumor -specific  subgroup:  
• Cohort  1a: NSCLC  (adenocarcinoma)  
• Cohort  1b: HNSCC  
• Cohort  1c: Breast cancer  
 
Each  subgroup  will be independently  assessed  and guided  by the Simon  2-stage  design  and will enroll  
9 evaluable  subjects  in Stage  1. If no responses  are observed  within  a subgroup,  then the subgroup  will be 
discontinued. If at least 1 response is observed, Stage 2 will begin and enroll 8 additional evaluable  
subjects,  for a total of 17 evaluable  subjects  in each  subgroup (1a, 1b,  and 1c).

Cohort  2: Alternate  Tumors  (including  Other  S15+  Tumors  and S15- Tumors)  
This basket  cohort  will include  all other  enrolled  subjects  who are confirmed  as TMB -H and/or  MSI-
H/dMMR but do not fall under the criteria to be included in Cohort 1. Based on results of S15  expression,  
subjects will  be further  stratified  into two subgroups:  
• Cohort  2a: Other  S15+  Tumors  
• Cohort  2b: S15- Tumors  
 
Each  subgroup  will be independently  assessed  and guided  by the Simon  2-stage  design  and will enroll  
9 evaluable subjects in Stage 1. If no responses are observed within a subgroup, then the sub -group will  
be discontinued. If at least 1 response is observed, Stage 2 will begin and enroll 8 additional evaluable  
subjects,  for a total of 17 evaluable subject s in each  subgroup (2a  and 2b).  
DOSE  SELECTION  AND  ADMINISTRATION  SCHEDULE  
During Phase 1 Dose Escalation, various dose levels were evaluated ranging from 8 mg to 1600 mg.  
During  the initial Phase  2 design,  a RP2D of  400 mg Q2W was  tested.  Based  on furthe r evaluation  of the 
PK/PD studies from the original Phase 1/2 design, the RP2D has been adjusted to 800 mg with an  
alternative  administration schedule.  
 
The new RP2D  and administration  schedule  will be  as follows:  
• Initial  Dosing:  800 mg weekly  for 8 Cycles  
• Subsequent  Dosing  (Cycle  9 onwards):  800 mg every  2 weeks  
 
Subjects  will have  regularly  scheduled  visits  on Day 1 of every  cycle.  The duration  of each cycle  is 
dependent  on the dosing  schedule:  
 
• Initial  Dosing : 800  mg weekly  for 8 Cycles  
o Cycle  Duration: 7 days (+3 days  after Cycle  1) 
 
• Subsequent Dosing  (Cycle  9 onwards):  800 mg every  2 weeks  
o Cycle  Duration: 14 days (±3 days)  
Subjects  will begin  with the Initial  Dosing  Schedule  on Cycle  1 (Day  1) and continue  with weekly  dosing  
for 8 Cycles. Beginning with Cycle 9, subjects will follow the Subsequent Dosing Schedule of 800 mg  
every  2 weeks.  Note:  Cycle  9 should  occur  two weeks  following  the last weekly  dose of NC318.  Subjects  
will remain on the Subsequent Dosing Schedule of 800 m g every two weeks until disease progression,  
withdraw  of consent, or  intolerable toxicity  (whichever  comes  first).  
TARGET  SUBJECT  POPULATION  
Men and women, 18 years or older, with advanced solid malignancies that can be evaluable by RECIST  
criteria, that progressed on standard treatment, who have been unable to tolerate standard therapy, who  
have refused standard therapy, or for whom no standard anticancer therapy exists may be enrolled.  
Subjects  must  provide  written  informed  consent  and have  adequate  organ  function.  Presence  of 
measurable disease based on RECIST v1.1, and consent to have a non -target lesion biopsied before  
treatment. Note: Archival tissue may be submitted in place of fresh biopsy at pre -treatment. If a subject  
is scheduled to have a tumor biopsy for the purposes of this study and it is subsequently determined that  
tumor  tissue  cannot  safely  be obtained,  then the subject  may still enroll  in the study.  Subjects  with certain  
serious medical conditions (in addition to the diagnosis  of cancer) would be excluded from participation  
in the trial.

INVESTIGATIONAL  PRODUCT,  DOSAGE,  AND  MODE  OF ADMINISTRATION  
NC318 will be administered by intravenous (IV) infusion, over a minimum of 30 minutes on Day 1 of  
each cycle. Subjects will continue to receive NC318 until disease progression, withdraw of consent, or  
intolerable toxicity (whichever comes first). After com pleting 12 months of treatment, if the subject is  
deriving benefit from NC318 and has not met any of the protocol defined conditions for withdrawal or  
discontinuation,  the subject  will be followed  by the PI per standard  of care.  Subjects  approved  to contin ue 
treatment  will remain  on dose level  assigned  at the time of enrollment  (unless  otherwise  approved  for dose 
modification by the Sponsor). Safety reporting, documentation of disease assessments, and collection of  
survival status will  continue per  protocol.  
STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  PLAN  
The sample size for this study will be determined so that sufficient subjects are included to assess the  
safety,  tolerability,  PK, and PD of repeat  doses  of NC318.  The sample  size is not fixed  and will vary based

1. INTRODUCTION  
This is a Phase  1/2, multicenter,  open -label,  dose-escalation  study.  The study  will be conducted  in 
2 parts. Phase 1 will utilize a 3 + 3 design to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or  
pharmacologically active dose (PAD) for NC318 in subjects with advanced or metastatic solid  
tumors. Phase 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerab ility, preliminary efficacy,  
pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D)  
of NC318. The study is  currently enrolling Phase  2. 
1.1. Background  
1.1.1.  The Role  of the  Immune  System  in Cancer  
The immune  system  is comprised  of diverse  sets of cells designed  to protect  a host from  pathogens  
while distinguishing from host and foreign antigens. This immune response is controlled by a  
series  of checks  and balances  to allow  for robust  immune  responses  to pathogens  while  preventing  
either  an excessive  inflammatory  event  or an autoimmune  response.  Through  immune  
surveillance, the immune system has been shown to recognize, attack, and destroy tumor cells  
(Wolchok 2008 ). The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in cancer tissue among  
various  malignancies  has been  shown  to confer  a more  favorable  prognosis  (Uppaluri  2008 ; Bellati  
2009 ; Oble 2009 ; Nosho 2010 ; Shirabe 2010 ; Bremnes 2011 ; Gooden 2011 ; Schreiber 2011 ; 
Talmadge  2011 ; Mei 2014 ; Salgado  2015 ). Detailed  analysis  of CD8+ T cells and the ratio of CD8+ 
effector T cells/forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) seem to correlate with  
improved prognosis and long -term survival in many solid tumors ( Salgado 2015 ). Although the  
immune system has been shown to recognize and reject a tumor, many tumor s evade immune  
surveillance  or develop  mechanisms of resistance.  
Histologic  evaluation  of multiple  human  cancers  shows  extensive  infiltration  by pro-inflammatory  
immune cells ( Galon 2006 ), that are immune -suppressive leading to tumor progression. In some  
cases, as tumors grow, an "equilibrium" may be reached where tumor growth is matched by  
immune -mediated  tumor  destruction.  However,  malignant  cells may accumulate  certain  mutations,  
making  them  nonimmunogenic,  and/or  immunosuppressive  pathways  become  activated,  allowing  
the tumor to escape immune recognition ( Dunn 2002 ; Schreiber 2011 ; DuPage 2012 ; Matsushita  
2012 ). The accumulation of suppressive cells and an inhibitory cytokine milieu in and around a  
tumor can form an immunosuppressive environment th at prevents successful T cell –mediated  
destruction of malignant cells ( Schaer 2011 ). This balance of immune control is not limited to  
lymphocytes. For example, although M1 macrophages secrete pro -inflammatory cytokines that  
stimulate immunity (including an ti-tumor immune responses), the M2 macrophages have been  
described as promotors of immunosuppression and tumor progression ( Sica 2006 ). Overcoming  
tumor resistance to immune surveillance either through stimulating the immune response or  
preventing  inhibiti on is  the basic rationale  for the  development  of immunotherapies.  
Targeting the immune system is a proven and effective approach for cancer therapies. United  
States  Food  and Drug  Administration  (US FDA) –approved  checkpoint  inhibitors,  such as 
ipilimumab, n ivolumab, and pembrolizumab, allow for the immune response to continue to  
proliferate  by preventing  inhibitory  signals.  Preventing  Siglec -15 (S15)  mediated  immune

 suppression through M2 Macrophages and S15+ tumors is another promising treatment approach  
and is the focus of this clinical trial.  
 
1.1.2.  Immune  Modulators  
Immune  cell receptors  known  as checkpoint  modulators  (collectively  known  as immune  
modulators) provide a critical mechanism for the regulation of an immune response. Checkpoint  
modulation can either diminish an immunosuppressive process or stimulate T cell responses to  
enhance the overall immune r esponse and prevent or reverse tumor progression. Modulation of  
coinhibitory  and costimulatory  receptors  of the immune  system  has become  a proven  approach  for 
the immunotherapy  of cancer  (Chen 2013 ). 
The development  of fully  human  antibodies  that target  and modulate  immunomodulatory  proteins  
in humans  have  led to the discovery  of multiple  validated  targets  for the immunotherapy  of cancer  
(Leach 1996 ; Chen 2013 ). Antibodies that engage the various checkpoint modulators can broadly  
be classified  into two categories  based  on mechanism  of action:  antagonists  (blocking  the 
interaction  between  receptor  and cognate  ligand[s]),  and agonists  (inducing  or facilitating  receptor - 
mediated signaling pathways). Clinical testing of therapeutic antibodies has demonstrated their  
ability to influence the direction and magnitude of the immune responses, leading to tumor  
eradication ( Yao 2013 ). The blocking of coinhi bitory receptors such as cytotoxic T -lymphocyte – 
associated protein 4 (CTLA -4) or programmed cell death protein 1 (PD -1) blockade are the basis  
of US FDA approved therapies to augment an antitumor immune response. Preclinical research  
has demonstrated a ra tionale for targeting the inhibitory receptor S15 found on tumor cells and  
myeloid  cells (Wang  2019 ). 
1.1.3.  Siglec -15 and Immunity  
S15 is a member of the Siglec family ( Sialic acid -binding Immuno globulin Lectins), a distinct  
subgroup  of immunoglobulin  (Ig) superfamily  proteins  involved  in the discrimination  between  self 
and non-self-immune  regulation  (Macauley  2014 ). It is a type-I transmembrane  protein  consisting  
of two Ig-like domains  (IgV  and IgC) and a short  cytoplasmic  tail. It has been  implicated  in playing  
a role in immune  suppression.  
Studies of S15 knock out (KO) mice led to mice developing without physical abnormalities other  
than slightly increased trabecular bone mass and mild osteopetrosis ( Hiruma 2013 ). Like the  
findings by Hiruma et al., KO m ice generated in the Chen lab did not exhibit any noticeable  
phenotype  (Wang  2019 ). However,  follow -on functional  studies  demonstrated  that mice  with S15 
deficiency have enhanced pro -inflammatory cytokine production upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS)  
stimulation and enhanced antigen -specific T cell responses in vivo , suggesting a role for S15 in  
mediating immunosuppression. Subsequent studies demonstrated a key role for S15 -positive  
(S15+) myeloid  cells in  mediating immunosuppression. The S15 KO  mice demonstrate that  
absence of S15+ expression results in a decrease in tumor progression and an increase in survival  
for the glioma GL261 and B16.GMCSF melanoma murine  tumor models. Taken together these  
findings suggest a tumor immune -escape mechanism and opportunity to target S15 as a means of  
enhancing  immune  function and  antitumor responses  in the tumor microenvironment  (TME).  
The interaction  of S15 with its receptor  mediates  immunosuppression.  NC318  blocks  the 
interactions between S15 and its receptor which is expressed on myeloid cells and the T cells of  
the TME  thereby  relieving  inhibitory  signaling  and blocking  immunosuppression.  The rationale

 for developing  NC318  for cancer  is based  on nonclinical  models  that demonstrate  that the targeting  
of S15 can improve  the immune  response and provide  benefit in multiple oncology  indications.  
 
1.2. Overview  of NC318  
NC318 is a humanized modified IgG 1κ monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the extracellular  
domain of the human S15 receptor. Blocking S15 with NC318 may prevent immune suppression  
and result  in augmented  immune  responses  including  some  anti-tumor  immune  responses.  NC318  
is being  developed for the  treatment of  advanced  malignancies.  
 
1.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics  of NC318:  Pre-clinical  Data  
Single -dose and repeat -dose PK of NC318 were characterized in both Sprague Dawley rats and  
cynomolgus monkeys. Concentrations of NC318 in serum were analyzed using a quantitative  
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) method developed by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD, Rockville,  
MD).  Immunogenicity testing was also conducted in conjunction with these studies. Serum  
samples  were  screened  for the presence  of anti-drug antibodies  (ADA)  and confirmed  by immune - 
competition  with free  NC318.  
Repeat -dose PK of NC318  was first investigated  in a Good  Laboratory  Practices  (GLP) -compliant  
repeat -dose study  in Sprague  Dawley  rats. Animals  received  3, 30, or 100 mg/kg  NC318  
(N=9/sex/group; 3/sex/timepoint) by IV tail vein injection on SD 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29. PK analysis  
(excluding  ADA -positive  animals)  showed  that exposure  (Cmax, and AUC)  of NC318  was linearly  
proportional  to dose level,  across  the range  of doses  that were  tested.  Accumulation  of NC318  was 
observed  with every  week  dosing.  Mean  volume  of distribution  ranged  from  51.0 to 80.2 ml/kg  on 
SD 1 and from  24.8 to 54 ml/kg  on SD 29, indicating  limited  distribution  outside  of the vasculature.  
Mean CL on SD 29 ranged from 0.08 to 0.19 ml/h/kg. PK parameters were generally equivalent  
in both genders.  The overall  mean terminal  t½ was 6 to 10  days following  the fifth dose.  
Repeat -dose PK of NC318  was next examined  in a GLP -compliant  repeat -dose study  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  Animals  were  administered  with 0, 3, or 30 mg/kg  NC318  (N=5/  sex/group;  
3/sex  Main  Group  and 2/sex  Recovery  Group)  on SD 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 by 30-minute  IV infusion.  
Animals  at the highest  dose level  received 100  mg/kg NC318  (N=5/sex) on  SD 1  and 60 
mg/kg/dose on SD 8, 15, 22, and 29. The dose level for the highest dose was lowered beginning  
with the second dose due to periorbital swelling observation in male animals and severe toxicity  
in 2 female monkeys that required early sacrifice following the 100 mg/kg dose on SD 1. ADA  
were  observed  in 6 of the NC318 -treated  animals,  which  was associated  with accelerated  CL after 
the fifth dose.  PK analysis  showed  that exposure  (Cmax and AUC)  of NC318  was linearly  
proportional to dose level, across the range of doses that were tested. Slight accumulations were  
observed with every week dosing. The mean volume of distribution (V d) and mean CL) were  
generally  comparable  for males  and females  at all dose levels  on SD 1 and SD 29. Mean  Vd ranged  
from 60 to 80 ml/kg on SD 1 and from 38.8 to 117 ml/kg on SD 29. Mean CL on SD 29 ranged  
from 0.12 to 0.71 ml/h/kg. PK parameters were generally equivalent in both genders. The overall  
mean  terminal t ½ was 5 - 9 days following  the fifth dose.  
The presence of ADA in dosed rats and cynomolgus monkeys correlated with more rapid CL.  
Immunogenicity of human protein therapeutics in non -human species is a common occurrence,  
and immunogenicity  data from  animals  have  little value  for predicting  the risk of immunogenicity  
in humans,  as discussed  in International  Council  for Harmonization  (ICH) -S6(R1)  and (Ponce

 NC318 has been tested in cell -based assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells  
(PBMC). Expression of S15 in healthy human PBMC is limited. Assays using exogenous S15  
fusion protein have been established to assess the activity of NC318. NC318 blo cks S15 fusion  
protein mediated effects on primary human myeloid cells and T cells. THP -1, a human myeloid  
cell line, was stably transduced with S15 to further test NC318. The THP -1.hS15 cells highly  
express S15. NC318 demonstrated blocking of the immunosu ppressive effect mediated by S15  
expressed in these myeloid cells. NC318 was tested in a co -stimulation assay with healthy human  
PBMC. NC318 dose dependently increased IL -2 secretion in the presence of anti -CD3/SEB co - 
stimulation  of PBMC from approximatel y 50% of the tested  donors screened.  
In vivo , mouse NC318 was effective as a monotherapy in three subcutaneous (SC) tumor models  
and one lung metastasis  model.  These  models  may be relevant  to the subset  of human  cancers  with 
S15+ tumor cells or S15+ M2 macrophages. Mouse NC318 treatment increased CD8 T cell and  
tumor specific CD8 T cell infiltration into the tumors and reduced the number of macrophages in  
the TME.  Mouse  NC318  combined  with PD-1 blockade  showed  enhanced  anti-tumor  activity  in a 
SC tumor model. Mouse NC318 can enhance an LPS -mediated immune response in wild type  
mice  that is line  with the outcome  from  LPS challenged S15 KO  mice.  
 
1.2.4.  Non-Clinical  Safety  and Potential  Risks  of NC318  
The toxicology of NC318 has been studied in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems to support  
its use as an investigational drug  in oncology.  
In a GLP -compliant repeat -dose toxicology study of NC318 in Sprague Dawley rats, 178 animals  
(87/sex)  were  randomly  assigned  to four groups.  Each  main  study  group  that received  0, 3, 30 and 
100 mg/kg of NC318 included 15/sex/group; 10/sex/group were sacrificed 4 days (SD 33) after  
the last dose and 5/sex/group  were  sacrificed  following  a 6-week  recovery  period  (SD 75). Animals  
were  subjected  to a full gross  necropsy  on SD 33 (terminal)  or SD 75 (recovery).  The toxicokinetic  
(TK)  satellite  group  included  9/sex/group  with 3, 30 or 100 mg/kg  of NC318  treatment;  
3/sex/group were evaluated at each timepoint. Eight animal s developed ADA against NC318 in  
the main & recovery animals that received NC318. Treatment with NC318 at doses up to 100  
mg/kg had no effect on mortality, physical examinations, cage -side and post dose observations,  
body weights, body weight changes, food  consumption, clinical pathology (clinical chemistry,  
hematology,  coagulation,  and urinalysis),  gross  pathology,  absolute  and relative  organ  weights,  or 
histopathology. The NOAEL for NC318 following 5 weekly IV doses was 100 mg/kg in Sprague  
Dawley  rats. 
In a GLP -compliant  repeat -dose toxicology  study  in cynomolgus  monkeys,  animals  were  
administered  with 0, 3, or 30  mg/kg NC318  (N=5/sex/group;  3/sex Main  Group  and 2/sex  
Recovery Group) on SD 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 by 30 -min IV infusion. Animals at the highest dose  
level received 100 mg/kg NC318 (N=5/sex) on SD 1 and 60 mg/kg/dose on SD 8, 15, 22, and 29.  
The dose level  for the highest dose was lowered  beginning  with the second  dose due to periorbital  
swelling observation in male animals and 2 female monkeys with severe toxicity following the  
first dose on SD 1. Animals were subjected to a full gross necropsy and histopathology analysis  
on SD 31 (terminal)  or 71 (recovery).  Three  NC318  treated  recovery  monkeys  developed  
neutralized antibody (nAb), which was associated with accelerated CL, and t hey were removed  
from  the mean  TK profiling.  No adverse  findings  were  associated  with ADA  positivity.  At terminal  
necropsy,  1 out of 6 animals  at 30 mg/kg  dose and 2 out of 5 animals  at 100/60  mg/kg/dose  showed

 microscopic changes in the kidneys that consisted of minimal degeneration/necrosis of renal  
tubular  cells with intratubular  neutrophilic  inflammation  and intratubular  and/or  tubular  
hemorrhage. Evidence of kidney injury was present at the end of the recove ry period (6 weeks  
after the fifth dose)  in 1 out of 3 animals  at 100/60  mg/kg/dose;  no animals  (0 out of 4) at 
30 mg/kg/dose displayed renal injury suggesting that glomerular findings at 30 mg/kg/dose was  
reversible. The cause of severe adverse effects of  the 2 female animals on SD 1 after 100 mg/kg  
dose was undetermined but the same microscopic changes in the kidneys were observed. There  
was no evidence of any microscopic changes at the lowest dose (3 mg/kg). The microscopic  
changes in the kidney were in a dose dependent manner; however, they were not accompanied by  
any evident clinical findings. The NOAEL of NC318 was 3 mg/kg when adminis tered five times  
over a four-week  interval  to male  and female  cynomolgus  monkeys  by 30-minute  IV infusion.  The 
MTD  was 30 mg/kg.  
 
1.3. Study  Rationale  
Immunotherapies  have  demonstrated  an effective  anti-tumor  immune  response  and induce  
significant clinical bene fit for a subset of patients with cancer. This study will evaluate a novel  
target, S15, which has been shown to mitigate immunosuppressive macrophages in the TME.  
Immunotherapies for cancer have shown great promise, however, there is still an unmet medical  
need  for additional  therapies.  NC318  may be an effective  immunotherapy  for some  cancer  patients.  
1.3.1.  Rationale  for the Safe  Starting  Dose  
The safe starting  dose (SSD)  for NC318  is 8 mg (correlates  to 0.1 mg/kg),  and this was determined  
based on all relevant preclinical pharmacology and toxicology data, including dose -response in  
human  cell-based assays,  and anti -tumor  effects in  mouse  tumor  models.  
NC318 has been well -tolerated and repeated administration of dosages 100 -fold higher (on a  
mg/kg  basis)  than the planned  clinical  starting  dose were  not associated  with any adverse  toxicities.  
A risk assessment  for NC318  was performed  to support  dose selec tion. Relevant  factors  for NC318  
are discussed  below:  
• Mechanism of action:  NC318 does not directly activate T cells. NC318 did not promote  
cytokine release from PBMC, using assays that would have predicted the TGN1412  
cytokine  storms.  NC318  may help to promote  an effective  anti-tumor  immune  response  by 
two mechanisms.  NC318  blocks  the interactions  between  S15 and its binding  partner  on 
T cells or myeloid cells and releases S15 -mediated suppression. NC318 may also bind to  
cells expressing  high levels of  S15 and mediate direct  tumor killing.  
• Nature of the target : S15 is not a master regulator of the immune system such as CD28 or  
CTLA -4. While CTLA -4 KO mice die 3 -4 weeks after birth from lymphoproliferative  
disease  affecting  multiple  organs,  S15 KO mice  developed  without  physical  abnormalities  
other  than slightly  increased trabecular  bone  mass and mild osteopetrosis  (Hiruma  2013 ). 
• Relevance  of animal  models : S15 is conserved  across  mammals  and NC318’s  parent,  5G12,  
is active  in multiple  species including  rodents.  
The rationale for the proposed Phase 1 SSD of 8 mg (0.1 mg/kg) is based on the collection of  
preclinical  pharmacology  and toxicology  data,  including  calculated  and experimentally  assessed

 1.3.3.  Rationale  for Phase  2 Dose  Selection  and Administration  Schedule  
During  Phase  1 Dose  Escalation,  various  dose levels  were  evaluated  ranging  from  8mg to 1600mg.  
During the initial Phase 2 design, a RP2D of 400mg Q2W was tested. As stated in Section 1.2.2 , 
PK/PD modeling shows initial weekly dosing of 800 mg will achieve adequate exposure of  NC318.  
Upon  further  review  of ongoin g Phase  1/2 study,  soluble  S15 levels  that increased  within  24 hours 
of NC318 infusion during Cycle 1 seemed to normalize after cycle 4 (~8 weeks).  Furthermore, T 
cell activation appears critical only for the first 8 weeks of immune checkpoint  therapies. Rizvi 
has shown that a patient responded for months after tumor -specific T cells  decreased after 9 weeks 
(Rizvi 2015 ). Taken together, a new RP2D and  administration schedule  have  been chosen  for 
NC318.  The new RP2D and  administration schedule will be  as follows:  
• Initial Dosing : 800  mg weekly  for 8 Cycles  
• Subsequent  Dosing  (Cycle 9  onwards) : 800  mg every  2 weeks  
Subjects  will remain  on the Subsequent  Dosing  Schedule  of 800 mg every  two weeks  until disease  
progression,  withdraw of  consent, or  intolerable toxicity  (whichever comes  first).  
 
1.3.3.1.     Phase  2 Safety Run -In Rationale  
Based on PK/PD modeling and normalization of soluble S15, NC318 will be given at 800 mg  Q1W 
for 8 cycles and subsequent cycles will be given at 800mg Q2W. During Phase 1 Dose  Escalation  
(n=49),  various  dose levels  were  evaluated  ranging  from  8 mg to 1600  mg. There  were  no DLTs at 
800 mg Q2W. However, there was one DLT at 1600 mg Q2W as previously reported  during annual 
reporting amongst the 4 patients treated in that dose escalation cohort. At 800 mg  Q2W  (n=4),  only 
non-serious adverse  events ≤ Grade  2 were  reported.  
In accordance with the PK/PD data from the ongoing Phase 1/2, the RP2D has been adjusted to  
800 mg with an alternative  administration  schedule.  To evaluate  the new RP2D  and administration  
schedule,  a Phase  2 Safety  Run-In will be conducted utilizing  a 3+3 design.  
 
1.3.4.  Rationale  for Subject  Population  for Phase  2 
To further elucidate the effects of NC318, 6 different tumor types were initially selected for  
investigation  in Phase  2. HNSCC  and NSCLC  will be evaluated,  because  they are both 
immunogenic  histologies  that have  been  proven  to respond  to checkpoint  inhibitors  (CTLA -4 and 
PD-1). Included in the Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies, experiments looked at  
the expression  of S15 on tumor  samples  from  patients  with a variety  of tumor  histologies  including,  
but not limited to, NSCLC, TNBC, and  ovarian cancer.  
Previously the study was designed to enroll patients with low PD -L1 (<50% TPS) based on the  
notion  of mutually  exclusive  expression  of PD-L1 and  siglec -15 as stated  above  due to the lack of 
standardized siglec -15 staining. However, the most recent CLIA validation study has validated  
adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck, and breast cancers for  
siglec -15 staining in tu mors and immune cell infiltrates in the stroma ( Figure 4 ). Therefore, to  
elucidate the effects of NC318, 3 tumor types with CLIA validated siglec -15 positive staining,  
namely adenocarcinoma of the lung, squamous carcinoma of head and neck, and breast cance r, 
were  selected.

 Figure  4:       S15 Expression  in Breast,  Lung,  and Head  and Neck  Tumors  
 
In addition, the following observations have been made based on the data obtained from the  
ongoing  Phase  1/2 trial thus far:  
1. Of the 4 responders (1 CR and 1 PR in NSCLC, 1 PR in HNSCC, and 1 PR in TNBC) of  
96 evaluable subjects enrolled in Phase 1/2, 2 had TMB -H, and 1 had MSI/dMMR.  
Therefore, it is likely that either TMB -H and/or MSI/dMMR status is driving the T cell  
infiltration in the TME of those subjects to respond to NC318. Since all of those subjects  
were refractory to ICI therapies, we hypothesize that NC318 might have alleviated the  
immunosuppressive environment of the TME in those patients for the reactivation of T  
cells.  Therefore,  in cohort  1, we will include  TMB -H and/or  MSI/dMMR  positive  NSCLC,  
HNSCC,  or Breast cancer,  followed by  selection of  S15 expression in the  TME.  
a. The basis for evaluating subjects based on S15 expression came from the data  
obtained in the ongoing Phase 1/2 study ( Shum 2021 ). S15 expression confirmed  
by CLIA validated IHC st aining was associated with 40% disease control (stable  
disease)  compared to only  12% disease  control in the S15 - group.  
2. Since TMB -H and MSI -H have been widely accepted predictors for immunotherapies, a  
separate cohort of TMB -H and/or MSI -H/dMMR tumors that  do not fall under the criteria  
to be included in Cohort 1 has been added to the study. Upon enrollment, subjects will be  
stratified  into two subgroups  based  on S15 expression  (S15+  Cohort  2a and S15- Cohort 
2b) to explore  how vital S15 expression is  in the  TME.  
 
1.3.5.  Rationale  for Efficacy  Endpoints  
Efficacy  endpoints  of this study  are secondary  and include  objective  response  rate (ORR),  duration  
of response (DoR), duration of disease control (DC), and progression -free survival (PFS) by  
investigator assessment based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1  
and modified RECIST (mRECIST).  
RECIST v1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen with  
immunotherapy ( Chiou  2015 ). Immunotherapeutic agents  may produce  antitumor effects  by 
potentiating  endogenous  cancer -specific  immune  responses.  The response  patterns seen with such 
an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents  
and can manifest  a clinical  response  after an initial  increase  in tumor  burden  or even  the appearance  
of new lesions.  Standard  RECIST  may not provide  an accurate  response  assessment  of 
immunotherapeutic  agents.  Therefore,  RECIST  v1.1 will be used with the following  adaptations:

 If radiologic  imaging  shows  initial  progressive  disease,  then tumor  assessment  should  be repeated  
at least 4 weeks but no later than 6 weeks later to confirm disease progression with the option of  
continuing  treatment while  awaiting  radiologic  confirmation of progression.  
In subjects  who have initial  evidence  of radiological  progression  but are clinically  stable  as defined  
below, it is at the discretion of the treating physician whether to continue a subject on study drug  
until repeat imaging is obtained. This clinical judgment decision should be based on the subject's  
overall clinical condition,  including performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data.  
Subjects may receive treatment while waiting for confirmation of disease progression if they are  
clinically  stable  as defined by  the following  criteria:  
• Absence  of clinically  significan t signs  and symptoms  indicating  disease  progression  
• No decline  in Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status  (Oken  
1982 ) 
• Absence  of rapid  progression  of disease  
• Absence  of progressive  tumor  at critical  anatomical  sites (e.g.,  cord compression)  requiring  
urgent  alternative  medical intervention  
If repeat imaging shows < 20% tumor burden compared with nadir, stable or improved previous  
new lesion (if identified as cause for initial disease progression), and stable/improved nontarget  
disease (if identified as cause for initial disease progression), then treatment may be continued or  
resumed. If repeat imaging confirms disease progression due to any of the scenarios listed below,  
then subjects will be discontinued from study therapy. However, if a subject has confirmed  
radiographic  progression  (i.e., 2 scans  at least 4 weeks  but no later than 6 weeks  apart  
demonstrating progression) per mRECIST but the subject is achieving a clinic ally meaningful  
benefit, then an exception to continue treatment may be considered after consultation with the  
medical monitor. Clinically stable subjects at the confirmatory scan should also have no further  
increase in the target lesions, no unequivocal i ncrease in nontarget lesions, and no additional new  
lesions  develop (non -worsening  disease  progression) to continue  study  treatment.  
In determining whether the tumor burden has increased or decreased, site study teams should  
consider  all target  lesions  as well  as nontarget  lesions  (refer to  RECIST  v1.1 guidelines).  
Scenarios  where  disease progression  is confirmed at  repeat  imaging  include the  following:  
• Tumor  burden  remains  ≥ 20% and at least 5 mm absolute  increase compared  with nadir  
• Nontarget  disease  resulting  in initial  disease  progression  is worse  (qualitative)  
• New  lesion  resulting  in initial  disease  progression  is worse  (qualit ative)  
• Additional  new lesion(s)  are found since  the last  evaluation  
When  feasible,  subjects  should  not be discontinued  until progression  is confirmed.  This allowance  
to continue treatment despite initial radiologic progression considers the observation that some  
subjects can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy,  
but with subsequent  disease  response.  Subjects  who are deem ed clinically  unstable  are not required  
to have  repeat imaging  for confirmation of disease  progression.

 1.4. Summary  of Clinical  Experience  
The Phase 1 component demonstrated that NC318 is safe and tolerable when administered as a  
monotherapy  at doses  ranging  from 8  mg to 800 mg. In order  to seek optimal  benefit  for potential  
patients, a revised dosage and administration schedule will be explored using an updated Phase 2  
design. Based on the results of the amended design, the optimal dosing strate gy will be used for  
subsequent  clinical  trials.  During  the ongoing  Phase  2 component  of the study,  analysis  of PK and 
PD has revealed  that doses  ranging  from  240 mg  to 1600 mg  every  2 weeks  are pharmacologically  
active.  
 
1.4.1.  Ongoing  Clinical  Study  NC318 -01 
The FIH clinical trial, Study NC318 -01 completed Phase 1 enrollment with 49 subjects dosed in  
15 tumor types. Subjects received NC318 every two weeks at doses of 8, 24, 80, 240, 400, 800,  
and 1600 mg. NC318 was well tolerated at doses up to 800 mg  every two weeks and expanded  
cohorts of subjects were further evaluated at the 80, 240, and 400 mg dose levels. One Phase 1a  
subject enrolled in Cohort 6 (1600 mg) with Grade 3 pneumonitis died of respiratory failure due  
to healthcare acquired pneumonia o n 28-SEP-2019 and no further subjects were enrolled in the  
1600mg  cohort  (n=4).  As such,  400 mg  every  2 weeks  was determined  as the original  
recommended  Phase  2 dose.  
As of the data cutoff date of 29 -SEP-2021, the treatment -related adverse events (TRAEs) o f any  
grades  experienced  by more  than 5% of patients  in Phase  1 (n=49)  were  pruritis  (16.3%),  diarrhea  
(16.3%),  were  infusion  related  reactions  (10.2%),  fatigue  (8.2%),  elevated  amylase  (8.2%),  
elevated  lipase  (8.2%),  muscular  weakness  (8.2%),  and headaches  (6.1%).  In Phase  1, there  was 1 
case of Grade 3 increased amylase, 3 cases of increased lipase {Grade 3 (n=2), Grade 4 (n=1)},  
and 1 case of Grade 3 Muscle Weakness. TRAEs of any grade experienced by more than 5% of  
patients  in Phase  2 (n=47)  were infusion  reaction  (19.1%),  pruritis  (8,5%),  chills  (8.5%),  influenza - 
like illness  (6.4%), and  nausea  (6.4%).  In Phase  2, there  was 1 Grade  3 Infusion  reaction.  
From  clinical  benefit  aspect  from  Phase  1 and 2 studies  of NC318,  there  were  1 CR in NSCLC,  
3 PR (1 each in NSCLC,  HNSCC  and TNBC)  and 28 SD (stable  disease),  with total disease  control  
rate of 37% and median progression free survival of 5.0 months (Shum, 2021). One subject with  
NSCLC in CR remains on study more than 3 years. One other subject with NSCLC in PR elected  
to discontinue study treatment after nearly 3 years on study. Furthermo re, of the 4 responders, 1  
had MSI,  and 2  had TMB -H, but  no tumor abnormality  data is available  from the  CR subject.  
Additional details regarding clinical experience with NC318 are available in the Investigator’s  
Brochure.  
 
1.5. Research  Hypotheses  
NC318 will b e adequately tolerated following administration in multiple ascending doses to  
subjects  with refractory  solid  tumors and  that such  administration may  result  in clinical  benefit.

3. STUDY  DESIGN  
3.1. Description  of the Study  
This is an open -label, nonrandomized, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety and tolerability,  
define the MTD or PAD, and to assess the preliminary efficacy of NC318 in subjects with  
advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Subjects will receive NC318 on Day 1 of each cycle. Phase  
1 of the study  will begin  with 14-day cycles;  however,  alternate  dose administration  schedules  may 
also be explored  depending  on PK, PD, biomarker,  safety  results,  and feedback  from  investigators.  
The study  will be  conducted in 2 parts:  
• Phase 1 – Dose Escalation and Safety Expansion will determine the PAD, defined as a  
dose that provides  a maximal  biologic  effect,  such as an increase  in biomarkers  of immune  
activation  or reduction  of markers  associated  with immunosuppression,  and/or  the MTD  of 
NC318, including defining the optimal dose administration schedule and the maximum  
number  of tolerated  doses  (MNTD).  Phase  1 enrollment  of the study is  complete.  
• Phase  2 – Safety  Run-In and Dose  Expansion  will further  evaluate  the safety,  tolerability,  
preliminary efficacy, and PK/PD activity of NC318. The study is currently enrolling  
Phase  2. 
 
3.1.1.  Phase  1 
 
3.1.1.1.  Phase  1a - Dose  Escalation  
In Phase  1a, subjects  with advanced  or metastatic  solid  tumors  who progressed  after treatment  with 
available therapies that are known to confer clinical benefit, who are intolerant to treatment, or  
refuse  standard  treatment  were  enrolled.  A 3 + 3 design with  escalating  dose levels  were  explored  
to determine  the MTD  and PAD  of NC318.  The cohorts and dose  levels  evaluated during  Phase  1 
are shown  in Table  2.

Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  18  
 3.1.1.2.  Phase  1b – Safety  Expansion  
The purpose of Phase 1b was to evaluate additional PD activity of NC318 and confirm the  
preliminary safety of the dose escalation cohorts from Phas e 1a. Several cohorts from Phase 1a  
were  expanded  at doses  and schedules  equivalent  to or lower  than the  highest  dose levels  
determined to be safe and/or doses determined to be pharmacologically active. All doses and  
schedules explored during the safety ex pansion will depend on PK, PD, biomarker, and safety  
results.  
The following  cohorts  were  expanded  during  Phase  1b: Cohort  2 (80 mg), Cohort  3 (240 mg),  and 
Cohort 4 (400 mg). Phase 1 enrollment of the study is complete. A total of 49 subjects were  
enrolled  across Phase  1a and Phase  1b. 
 
The Phase  1a design  is summarized  below:  
Approximately  36 evaluable subjects  will be  enrolled  in the Phase  1b safety  expansi on, with  each 
cohort enrolling approximately 9 evaluable subjects. If < 3 of 9 evaluable subjects experience a  
DLT, the cohort will be deemed safe. If > 1 safety expansion cohort is deemed safe, then a  
recommended dose and schedule will be determined in co njunction with the investigators and  
sponsor  based  on all available  safety,  PK, PD, and biomarker  results.  The safety  expansion  cohorts  
may be conducted  in parallel  to Phase  2 and may be limited  by the sponsor  to subjects  with specific  
tumor  types to achieve a  balance  across  cohorts.  
 
3.1.2.  Phase  2 
The trial is currently enrolling Phase 2. Phase 2 will evaluate subjects with advanced or  
metastatic  solid  tumors  characterized  as Tumor  Mutational  Burden  High  (TMB -H) and/or  
MicroSatellite Instability High (MSI -H)/ deficient MisMatch Repair (dMMR). The following  
tumor types will be enrolled: Lung, HNSCC, Breast, Endometrial, Melanoma, CRC, Urothelial,  
Cholangiocarcinoma,  and other  tumors known  to be TMB -H and/or MSI -H/dMMR.  
Previously as part of the initial Phase 2 design, a RP2D of 400 mg Q2W was tested. 47 subjects  
were  treated  at the initial  RP2D.  Based  on further  evaluation  of the PK/PD  studies  from  the original  
Phase 1/2, the RP2D was adjusted to 800 mg with an alternative  administration schedule. To  
further evaluate the new RP2D, a Phase 2 Safety Run -In will be conducted utilizing a 3+3 design  
(Figure  5). 
 
3.1.2.1.  Phase  2 Safety  Run-In to Evaluate  New RP2D  
The first 3 evaluable  subjects  will be observed  for a DLT  observation  period  of 28 days.  Only  one 
subject will be dosed on the first day of dosing (additional subjects can begin in ≥ 48 hours). If  
there are no DLTs observed in the first 3 subjects, then Phase 2 Dose Expansion may begin at the  
new RP2D. If 1 of th e first 3 evaluable subjects enrolled has a DLT, then the cohort will be  
expanded  to include  3 additional  evaluable  subjects.  If there  are no DLTs  in the additional  
3 subjects,  then Phase  2 Dose  Expansion  can begin  at the new RP2D.  If a DLT  occurs  in one-third  
or more of the expanded cohort, then enrollment will be paused and intermediate dose levels or  
alternative  dose schedules may  be considered.

Phase 2 Dose Expansion will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, and  
PK/PD activity of NC318 at the RP2D utilizing a Simon 2 -stage design (Figure 6: Phase  2 Dose  
Expansion  Design (Sim on 2-Stage)  
). Subjects will be stratified after enrollment into two main cohorts based on S15 expression and  
tumor  type:  
• Cohort  1: Select  S15+  Tumors (Lung  (adenocarcinoma),  HNSCC,  Breast)  
• Cohort  2: Alternate Tumors (including Other S15+  Tumors and S15 - Tumors)

Cohort  1: Select  S15+  Tumors  
This cohort  will include  subjects  who are 1) confirmed  as TMB -H and/or  MSI-H/dMMR,  2) 
express  S15, and 3) have one of the following  tumor  types,  separated  into tumor -specific  subgroup:  
• Cohort  1a: NSCLC  (adenocarcinoma)  
• Cohort  1b: HNSCC  
• Cohort  1c: Breast  cancer  
Each  subgroup  will be independently  assessed,  guided  by the Simon  2-stage  design,  and will enroll  
9 evaluable  subjects  in Stage  1. If no responses  are observed  within  a subgroup,  then the sub-group  
will be discontinued.  If 1 or more  response  are observed,  Stage  2 will begin  and enroll  8 additional  
evaluable  subjects, for  a total of  17 evaluable  subjects  within each subgroup  (1a, 1b, and  1c). 
Cohort  2: Alternate  Tumors  (including Other  S15+  Tumors  and S15 - Tumors)  
This basket cohort will include all other enrolled subjects who are confirmed as TMB -H and/or  
MSI-H/dMMR but do not fall under the criteria to be included in Cohort 1. Based on results of  
S15 expression,  subjects will be  further stratified into two  subgroups:  
• Cohort  2a: Other S15+  Tumors  
• Cohort  2b: S15- Tumors

 Each  subgroup  will be independently  assessed,  guided  by the Simon  2-stage  design,  and will enroll  
9 evaluable  subjects  in Stage  1. If no responses  are observed  within  a subgroup,  then the sub-group  
will be discontinued.  If 1 or more  response  are observed,  Stage  2 will begin  and enroll  8 additional  
evaluable  subjects, for  a total of  17 evaluable subjects  within each subgroup  (2a and 2b).  
 
3.2. Measures  Taken  to Avoid  Bias 
This is an open -label study; no formal comparisons will be made between subjects or against  
historical controls. Measurements of safety and efficacy are objective measurements, and only  
comparisons  to pretreatment conditions will be made.  
 
3.3. Number of Subjects  
3.3.1.  Planned  Number  of Subjects  
Up to approximately  187 evaluable  subjects may  be enrolled in this  study.  
• Phase  1a Dose  Escalation  and Phase  1b Safety  Expansion  – 49 subjects enrolled  
• Previous  Phase  2 Design  – 47 subjects  enrolled  
• New  RP2D  Phase  2 Safety  Run-in – Up to 6 evaluable  subjects  
• New  RP2D  Phase  2 Dose Expansion – Up to  85 eval uable  subjects  
Note: Number of planned subjects includes actual enrollment to date under previous  
protocol  versions/amendments  (during  Phase  1 and previous  Phase  2) and expected  
enrollment  under  revised  Phase  2 design.  
 
3.3.2.  Replacement  of Subjects  
Subjects  may be replaced  for any of the  following reasons:  
• In Phase 1  and Phase  2, any subject  who withdraws  from  treatment  before the completion  
of the DLT period  for any  reason  other  than a  DLT (is not  evaluable  for DLTs)  
• A subject  who is scheduled  to have  a biopsy  for the purpose  of this study  and it is 
subsequently  determined  that tumor tissue  cannot safely  be obtained  
• Subject  does not meet  the eligibility  requirements  of the study  (accidental  enrollment)  
3.4. Duration  of Treatment  and Subject  Participation  
After signing the main informed consent form (ICF), screening assessments may be completed  
over a period of  approximately  30 days.  
Subjects will continue to receive NC318 until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or  
intolerabl e toxicity (whichever comes first). After completing 12 months of treatment, if the  
subject  is deriving  benefit  from  NC318  and has not met any of the protocol  defined  conditions  for 
withdrawal  or discontinuation,  the subject  will be followed  by the PI per standard  of care.  Subjects  
approved  to continue  treatment  will remain  on dose level  assigned  at the time of enrollment  (unless  
otherwise approved for dose modification by the Sponsor). Safety reporting, documentation of  
disease  assessments,  and collect ion of survival status will  continue per protocol.

Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  22  
 3.5. Overall  Study  Duration  
The study begins when the first subject signs the ICF. The end of the study will occur when all  
subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or have discontinued study drug and have  
completed  applicable  follow -up assessments.  
The end of the study may be declared when no more than 5 subjects remain on study drug for at  
least 6 months, at which point a database lock of the study may occur to allow for analysis of the  
study data. Any remaining subjects may continue to receive stud y drug and be seen by the  
investigator per standard of care. The investigator will be expected to monitor for and report any  
serious AEs (SAEs) and pregnancies, as detailed in Sections 8.3 and 8.5. The remaining subjects  
will be considered on study until a  discontinuation criterion is met and written notification is  
provided  to the  sponsor.  
 
3.6. Study  Termination  
The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the  
terms specified in the study contract. The investiga tor is to notify the institutional review board  
(IRB)/independent  ethics  committee  (IEC)  in writing  of the study's  completion  or early  
termination,  send a copy  of the notification  to the sponsor  or sponsor's  designee,  and retain  1 copy  
for the site  study  regulatory  file. 
The sponsor  may terminate  the study  electively,  if required  by regulatory  decision  or upon  review  
of emerging data. If the study is terminated prematurely, then the sponsor or designee will notify  
the investigators, the IRBs and IECs , and regulatory bodies  of the decision and reason for  
termination  of the study.  
 
4. SUBJECT  ELIGIBILITY  
Deviations from eligibility criteria are not allowed because they can potentially jeopardize the  
scientific  integrity  of the study,  regulatory  acceptabili ty, and/or  subject  safety.  Therefore,  
adherence  to the  criteria as specified in  the Protocol is essential.

5. TREATMENT  
5.1. Treatment  Assignment  
5.1.1.  Subject  Numbering  and Treatment  Assignment  
All subjects  will sign an ICF and be assigned  a unique  4-digit subject  number  within  the case report  
form  (CRF).  The subject  numbering  process  is defined  in the  CRF  completion  guidelines.  
Investigative sites must complete all applicable CRFs for subjects consented to the trial, even if  
the subject is no t treated  with study  drug.  
Dose level and cohort assignment will occur at time of subject enrollment and as indicated by the  
sponsor. Dose level and cohort assignment will be maintained within the CRF per the CRF  
completion  guidelines.  
All subjects  will be  assigned  to a cohort  to receive  NC318;  there  is no  placebo.  
NC318 must be administered the same day the investigational product is assigned. If there is a  
delay in the administration of investigational product such that it will not be administered within  
the specified timeframe, the  sponsor  must  be notified  immediately . 
Randomization  and Blinding  
This is an open -label nonrandomized  study;  therefore, randomization  and blinding  do not apply.  
 
5.2. Study  Drug  
5.2.1.  Description  and Administration  
The study  drug (NC318) is available  in sterile  frozen  liquid or  sterile  lyophilized formulations  for 
IV infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle (if the infusion is interrupted  
for any non -clinical reason, sites must notify the medical monitor). The drug product will be  
provided in 10 ml vials. Each vial will have 400 mg NC318. The con centration of the NC318  
frozen  liquid  formulation  is 60mg/mL;  total deliverable  volume  is 6.7 ml. When  reconstituted  with 
sterile water, the concentration of the NC318 lyophilized product is 100mg/mL; total deliverable  
volume  is 4.0 mL. For preparation  of the study  drug for infusion,  NC318 -01 should  be diluted  with 
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  27  
 normal saline to a concentration no less than 0.2 mg/ml. The infusion site should not be used for  
blood  sampling.  
 
5.2.2.  Supply  Packaging  and Labeling  
Study drug is supplied in a tamper evident patient kit box containing frozen liquid drug (400 mg,  
60 mg/mL) or refrigerated lyophilized NC318 vials (400 mg). For the frozen liquid formulation,  
the study drug name (NC318), lot number, concentration, amount of drug in vial, volume, and  
storage conditions appear on the vial. For the lyophilized formulation, the study drug name  
(NC318), lot number, amount of drug in vial, and storage conditions appear on the vial. The  
Pharmacy Manual contains additional informa tion regarding supply, packaging, and labeling of  
study  drug.  
The investigator  shall  take responsibility  for and shall  take all steps  to maintain  appropriate  records  
and ensure  appropriate  supply,  storage,  handling,  distribution,  and usage  of study  drug in 
accordance  with the  Protocol and any  applicable laws and regulations.  
 
5.2.3.  Storage  
Study drug must be stored in a freezer ( -20°C to -50°C) if liquid or a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C) if  
lyophilized, protected from light, in a secure, controlled -access location. Receipt and dispensing  
of study drug must be recorded by an authorized person at  the study site. Study drug may not be  
used for any purpose other than that stated in the Protocol. The Pharmacy Manual contains  
additional  information regarding  storage  of study  drug.  
5.2.4.  Accountability  
Detailed information such as requirements for accountabi lity and disposal of study drug can be  
located  within the  Pharmacy  Manual,  which  will be  provided separately.  
 
5.3. Treatment  Compliance  
Compliance  with study  drug dosing  will be calculated  by the sponsor  based  on the drug 
accountability  and infusion  records  documented  by the site staff and monitored  by the 
sponsor/designee.  
 
5.4. Treatment  Interruptions  and Adjustments  
5.4.1.  Dose  Modifications  
Selections and modifications to the study drug are planned for dose -escalation cohorts (after  
consultation with the medi cal monitor). Dose interruptions and modifications also may occur for  
individual  study  subjects.  The identification  of DLTs  will define  the doses  used in planned  cohorts  
(see Section 5.4.2 ). The occurrence of DLTs and other toxicities (related or unrelated  to study  
drug) will guide decisions for treatment interruptions and discontinuation for individual subjects.  
Intrasubject dose escalation is not permitted; however, once the RP2D has been determined,  
ongoing subjects in Phase 1 may be permitted to dose escalate to the RP2D with medical monitor  
approval.

 5.4.2.  Dose -Limiting  Toxicity  and Determination  of Maximum  Tolerated  Dose  
The evaluation  period  for DLTs  will begin  on Cycle  1 Day 1 and will continue  up to and including  
Study  Day (SD)  28. All DLTs  will be assessed  by the investigator  using  National  Cancer Institute  
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v5.0. A DLT will be defined  as 
the occurrence of any toxicity in  Table 3 , except for  events  clearly associated with  the underlying  
disease, disease  progression, a  concomitant  medication, or  comorbi dity.

5.4.3.  Management  of Dose -Limiting  Toxicities  or Other  Urgent  Situations  
In all cases,  investigators may  employ  any measures  or concomitant  medications,  after discussion  
with the medical monitor (w henever possible), necessary  to optimally  treat the  subject.  
 
5.4.4.  Follow -Up of Dose -Limiting  Toxicities  
Any DLT should be followed until it resolves to baseline or appears to have stabilized for a  
minimum of 4 weeks (e.g., 28 days). During follow -up, subjects should be seen as often as  
medically  indicated to assure  safety.  
 
5.4.5.  Procedures  for Cohort  Review and  Dose Escalation  
Telephone conferences  will be scheduled by the sponsor, or sponsor’s  delegate, with study  
investigators to review cohort -specific data and overall safety data, to agree on dose escalation,  
adjudicate individual high -grade AEs as potentially dose-limiting, and guide other major study  
decisions.  
 
5.4.6.  Criteria  and Procedures  for Dose  Interruptions  and Adjustments  of Study  Drug  
Treatment with study drug may be delayed allowing for resolution of toxicity. Subjects may  
resume treatment if no medical co ndition or other circumstance exists that, in the opinion of the  
investigator,  would  make  the subject  unsuitable  for further  participation  in the study.  For toxicities  
that occur outside of the 28 -day DLT period, the treating investigator should contact the medical  
monitor  to discuss  the case of any subject  whose  treatment  has been  delayed  for more  than 4 weeks  
(28 days).  
Instructions for dose modifications and interrupt ions are outlined in Table 4 . Individual decisions  
regarding dose interruptions and reductions should be made using appropriate clinical judgment  
in consultation with the medical monitor, considering the relatedness of the AE to the study drug  
and the subject's underlying  condition.  Adverse  events  that have  a clear  alternative  explanation  or 
transient  (≤ 72 hours)  abnormal  laboratory  values  without  associated  clinically  significant  signs  or 
symptoms may be exempt from dose -reduction rules. Dose interruptions are permitted in the case  
of medical/surgical  events  or logistical  reasons not  related  to study  therapy  (e.g.,  elective  surgery,  
unrelated medical events, subject vacation, and/or holiday s). Subjects should be placed back on  
study therapy within 4 weeks (28 days) of the scheduled interruption unless otherwise discussed  
with the medical  monitor.  The reason  for interruption  should  be documented  in the subject's  study  
record.

5.4.7.  Definition, Procedures, and Supportive Care Guidelines for Immune -Related  
Adverse  Events  
NC318  is an immune  modulator,  and although  no significant  toxicities  were  identified  in 
preclinical  models,  it is possible  that irAEs  (both  nonserious  and serious)  similar  to those  described  
with approved immunotherapies may occur. Adverse events of a potential immunologic etiology  
or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent wit h an immune phenomenon associated with drug  
exposure after all other etiologies have been eliminated . Immune -related AEs may be expected  
based on the nature of NC318, its mechanism of action, and based on reported experience with  
other  immunotherapies.  Special attention  should  be paid to AEs that may be suggestive  of potential  
irAEs. An irAE can occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of  
treatment. Suspected irAEs should be discussed with the medical monitor when possible. If there  
is any suspicion of potential cytokine -release syndrome (CRS), su bjects should be treated per  
institutional  policy.  
Subjects  should  receive  appropriate  supportive  care measures  as deemed  necessary  by the treating  
investigator. Suggested supportive care measures for the management of drug -related AEs with  
potential immun ologic etiology are outlined in Table 5 . Detailed supportive care guidelines for  
specific  irAEs  can be in found  in Brahmer  et al. (Brahmer  2018 ). For each AE, attempts  should  be 
made to rule out other causes, including but not limited to metastatic disease or bacterial or viral  
infection,  which might  require  specific  supportive  care.

• More  potent  immunosuppressive  therapies  should  be considered  for 
events not responding to systemic steroids after discussing with the  
medical monitor.  
• Study drug should be permanently discontinued for clinically significant  
or severe irAEs or for events where steroid course cannot be tapered  
below  7.5 mg/day  prednisone or  equivalent  to manage  symptoms.

5.4.8.  Management  of Infusion  Reactions  
Table 6 shows treatment guidelines for subjects who experience an infusion reaction associated  
with administration of study drug. Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after  
drug infusion and generally resolve completely within 24 hours of completio n of infusion. As of  
29-SEP-2021  data cutoff,  there  were  4 with infusion  reactions  (two grade  1 [n=2]  and two grade  2 
[n=2]) amongst subjects from Phase 1 study (n=49) and 7 had infusion reactions (Grade 1 [n= 1],  
Grade  2 [n=5], and Grade  3 [n=1])  amongst subjects  from Phase  2 study  (n=43).

until the subject is deemed medically stable in the  
opinion  of the investigator.  None.  
Grade 2:  
Requires therapy or infusion interruption but  
responds  promptly  to symptomatic  treatment  (e.g.,  
antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, IV fluids);  
prophylactic  medications  indicated  for ≤ 24 hours.  Stop infusion  and monitor  symptoms.  
Additional  appropriate  medical therapy  may include  but 
is not limited  to the following:  
• IV fluids  
• Antihistamines  
• NSAIDs  
• Acetaminophen  
• Narcotics  
 
Increase  monitoring  of vital signs  as medically  indicated  
until the subject is deemed medically stable in the  
opinion  of the investigator.  
If symptoms resolve within 1 hour of stopping drug  
infusion, the infusion may be restarted at 50% of the  
original infusion rate. Otherwise, dose administration  
will be interru pted until symptoms resolve, and the  
subject  should  be premedicated  for the next scheduled  
dose.  
Subjects who develop Grade 2 toxicity despite adequate  
premedication should be permanently discontinued from  
further  study  drug administration.  Subject may be  
premedicated 1.5 h (± 30  
min) prior to infusion with  
the following:  
• Diphenhydramine 50  
mg orally  (or equivalent  
dose of antihistamine).

5.4.9.  Criteria  for Permanent  Discontinuation  of Study  Drug  
The occurrence of an unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying malignancy will be  
presumed  to be related  to study drug  and will require  that the study drug be  permanently  
discontinued.  Unacceptable  toxicity  is defined  as follows:  
• Grade  4 or a  life-threatening  AE 
• ≥ Grade  2 ocular  irAE  
• Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that, in the judgment  
of the investigator or the sponsor's medical monitor, compromises the subject's ability to  
continue  study -specific  procedures,  or is considered  to not  be in the subject's  best interest.  
• Persistent treatment related  AE requiring  a delay  of study  drug beyond  4 weeks  (28 days)  
5.4.10.  Treatment  After  Initial  Evidence  of Radiologic  Disease  Progression  
Immunotherapeutic agents may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer - 
specific  immune  responses.  The response  patterns  seen with such an approach  may extend  beyond  
the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents and may manifest as a clinical  
response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. As a  
result,  scans  showing  progressive  disea se should  be repeated  within  4-6 weeks  to rule out 
pseudoprogression  at the  discretion of  the PI.  
If radiologic imaging shows  disease progression,  then subjects  have the option  to continue  
treatment  while  awaiting  radiographic confirmation  of progression  as outlined  in Section  7.6.1 . 
 
5.5. Withdrawal  of Subjects  from  Study  Drug  
5.5.1.  Withdrawal  Criteria  
A subject may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be removed from the trial at the  
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur. In addition, a subject may be  
withdrawn by the investigator or the Sponsor if enrollment into the  trial is inappropriate, the trial  
If a subject  is withdrawn,  then every  reasonable  effort  should  be made  to determine  the reason  for 
withdrawal,  and this information should be  recorded  in the  eCRF.  
Discontinuation of study treatment does not represent withdrawal from the study. A subject may  
discontinue  from  treatment  but agree  to remain  on-study,  as long as the subject  does not withdraw  
consent.  
Subjects  must  be withdrawn from  the trial for any  of the following  reasons:  
• The subject is  lost to  follow -up 
• Consent  is withdrawn  for study  (does  not agree  to follow -up); no additional  data collection  
should  occur  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  37  
 Subjects  must  discontinue  from  the study  treatment  but can continue  to be monitored  for any of 
the following  reasons:  
• The subject  becomes  pregnant  
• Consent  is withdrawn  for further  treatment  (agrees  to follow -up) 
• Further  participation would  be injurious  to the subject’s  health  or well being  
• Unacceptable  toxicity  (Section  5.4.9 ). Subjects  with unacceptable  toxicities  must  be 
withdrawn from study drug but will continue to be followed during the safety follow -up 
visits  as specified in Section 6.4  
• The study  is terminated by  the local  IRB or regulatory  authority  
• The study  is terminated by  the sponsor  
• Confirmed radiographic progression of disease per RECIST v1.1.  (except if Sponsor  
approves  treatment continuation)  
• Investigator  decision  to withdraw  subject  
• If, during  the course  of the study,  a subject  is found  not to have  met eligibility  criteria,  then 
the medical monitor in collaboration with the investigator, will determine whether the  
subject  should be withdrawn from the study  
• If the subject is noncompliant with study procedure or study drug administration in the  
investigators opinion then the Sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the  
subject.  
Subjects who discontinue study treatment but agree to remain on -study should continue to be  
followed  according  to the  applicable Post -Treatment Follow -up schedule.  
 
5.5.2.  Withdrawal  Procedures  
If the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study drug, the subject will be withdrawn  
from the study, and the end -of-treatment (EOT) visit should be conducted. Reasonable efforts  
should be made to have the subject participate in the follow -up pe riod. The date on which the  
decision  was made  to discontinue  study  treatment  and the reason  for treatment  discontinuation  will 
be recorded in the  eCRF.  
If a subject discontinues  study  treatment, the  site monitor and  Sponsor  must be  notified.  
 
5.6. Concomitant  Medications  
All concomitant medications and treatments must be recorded in the eCRF. Any prior medication  
received up to 30 days before the first dose of study drug will be recorded. Upon discontinuation  
of study treatment, only post -anticancer treatments and concomitant medications and procedures  
related  to adverse  events  should  be recorded.  Any addition,  deletion,  or change  in the dose of these  
medications  will also be recorded.  Concomitant  treatments/pr ocedures  that are required  to manage  
a subject's medical  condition during  the study  will also be recorded in the  eCRF.

 5.6.1.  Permitted  Medications  
All treatments  that the investigator  considers  necessary  for a subject's  welfare  may be administered  
at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the community standards of medical care. All  
concomitant medications will be recorded on the eCRF, including all prescription, over -the- 
counter, herbal supplements, IV medications and flui ds. If changes occur during the study period,  
documentation of drug regimen, frequency, route, and date may also be included on the eCRF.  
Note : The use of bisphosphonates and  denosumab  are permitted  in this  study.  
 
5.6.2.  Restricted  Medications  
Use of systemic glucocorticoids is restricted to prophylaxis for contrast allergies for radiographic  
procedures, or to modulate symptoms or treat an AE of suspected immunologic etiology. The use  
of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy may be appr oved after consultation with the  
medical  monitor.  
Note : Non-systemic  steroids  are allowed  (e.g.,  inhaled,  intraocular,  intranasal,  and topical  steroids  
are allowed).  A short  course  of steroids  (prednisone  or equivalent)  ≤ 10 mg/day  may be permitted  
with medical monitor  approval.  
Acetaminophen  and nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  (NSAIDs;  e.g., ibuprofen)  may be used.  
Due to the risk of liver injury with the use of high doses of acetaminophen, subjects should be  
advised  to stay  within th e recommended daily  dose of acetaminophen.  
 
5.6.3.  Prohibited  Medications  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria (see Section 4.2 ) are 
not allowed  during  the ongoing  study.  If there  is a clinical  indication  for one of these  medications  
or vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discontinuation from study drug may be  
required. The investigator should discuss any questions regarding this with the medical monitor.  
The final decision on any supportive therapy  or vaccination rests with the investigator and/or the  
subject's primary physician. However, the decision to continue the subject on study drug or  
vaccination  schedule  requires  the agreement  of the investigator, the  sponsor, and  the subject.  
Subjects are p rohibited from receiving the following therapies during the screening and treatment  
periods  of this study:  
• Any anticancer medications, including chemotherapy or biologic therapy other than the  
study  drug.  
• Any immunological -based  treatment  for any reason  from  screening  through  safety  follow -
up visit.  
Note:  Completed adjuvant therapy  (e.g., vaccines) with  medical monitor approval.  
Note : Inhaled  or topical  steroids  and systemic  steroids  at doses  ≤ 10 mg/day  prednisone  or 
equivalents  are allowed.  
Note : Immune  suppressants  are allowed  for treatment  of immune  toxicities  as described  in 
Section  5.4.7 and Brahmer et al.  (Brahmer  2018 ). 
Note : Allergy  shots may  be permitted after consultation  with the medical monitor.

 • Investigational agents other than the study drug from screening through the follow -up 
visits.  
• Concomitant  radiation  therapy.  
Note : Radiation  therapy  to a symptomatic  solitary  lesion  or to the brain  may be considered  
on an exceptional case -by-case basis after consultation with the medical monitor. The  
subject must have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field. Administration of  
palliative radiation therapy will be considered clinical progression for the purp oses of  
determining  PFS.  
• Live vaccines within 30  days before  the first dose of  study  drug and while participating  in 
the study.  Examples  of live vaccines  include,  but are not limited  to, the following:  measles,  
mumps,  rubella,  chicken  pox, yellow  fever,  rabies,  Bacillus  Calmette –Guérin,  and typhoid  
(oral)  vaccine.  Seasonal  influenza  vaccines  for injection  are generally  killed  virus  vaccines  
and are allowed.  However,  intranasal  influenza  vaccines  (e.g.,  FluMist®) are live attenuated  
vaccines and are  not allowed.  
• COVID -19 vaccine within 14 days prior to receiving the first dose of the study drug and 
during the 28 -day DLT period. Note: For 2 -dose COVID -19 vaccines, subjects must wait  
at least 14 -days after 2nd vaccine dose  administratio n. 
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned  
treatments  for clinical  management  should  be removed  from  the study.  Subjects  may receive  other  
medications  that the investigator  deems  to be medically  necessary.  The exclusion  criteria  describe  
other  medications that are  prohibited in this study.

a Subjects will begin with the Initial Dosing Schedule of 800mg weekly (Cycle Duration: 7 days (+3 day window after Cycle 1))  and continue with weekly dosing for 8 cycles.  
Beginning with Cycle 9, subjects will follow the Subsequent Dosing Schedule of 800mg  every 2 weeks (Cycle Duration: 14 days (±3 day window). Note: Cycle 9 should occur  
two weeks following the last weekly dose of NC318. Subjects will remain on the Subsequent Dosing Schedule of 800 mg every two  weeks until disease progression, withdraw of  
consent, or intolerable toxicity (whichever comes first). Alternate dosing schedules may also be explored based on emerging da ta. For Phase 2 Safety Run -In Only: The first 4  
cycles  should be  administered  every  7 days during  the DLT  period.  
b Subjects  who discontinue  study  therapy  for reasons  other  than disease  progression  will move  to Disease  Status  Follow -up and  will continue  to have  radiologic  imaging  performed  
until 1) withdrawal  of consent, 2)  documented disease  progression,  3) start of  new anticancer  treatment,  4) death,  or 5) the end of the study, whichever occurs  first. 
c. Subjects  that experience  site assessed PD  or start a new anti-cancer  therapy  should  be followed  approximately  every  3 months  to assess  for survival  status  until death,  withdrawal  
of consent,  or the end of the study,  whichever  occurs  first. Updated  survival  status  may be requested  by the Sponsor  at any time during  the course  of the study.  Survival  follow -up 
may be performed by  phone.  
d Medical  history  will include  relevant  medical  or surgical  treatment  within  the last 10 years  that are considered  to be clinically  significant by  the investigator.  
e Any prior medication received up to 30 days before the first dose of study drug will be recorded. Upon discontinuation of s tudy treatment, only post -anticancer treatments and  
concomitant medications and procedures related to adverse events should be reco rded. Please also refer to Sections 5.6.2 and 5.6.3 for details on prohibited and restricted  
medications.  
f Comprehensive Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed physician, phy sician's assistant, or an  advanced registered nurse  
practitioner, as local law permits. The comprehensive physical examination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and  
throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdome n (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes, as well as a brief neurological examination. The screening physical  
examination should  also include  a measurement of  height.  
g The targeted  physical  examination  will be a symptom -directed  evaluation  conducted  by the investigator  or a medically  qualified  designee.  Notable  abnormalities  that are considered  
clinically  significant in  the judgment of  the investigator are  to be reported  as AEs  or Medical  History  (if applicable at Screening).  
h During Cycle 1 subjects will be required to stay at the study site for safety observation for 4 hours post end of infusion.  At Cycle 1, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory  
rate, and body temperature) will be assessed  pre-dose, at the end of infusion (+10 minutes), and every 60 minutes (± 10 minutes) for 4 hours post end of infusion. On Day 1 of  all 
subsequent cycles subjects will be required to be observed for up 1 hour post end of infusion or per PI discretion, if in dicated. Vitals signs will be assessed pre -dose, at the end of  
infusion (+10  minutes), and thereafter at the  PI’s discretion.  Subjects  will also  be assessed  for the  onset of  acute AEs.  
i A single 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed at screeni ng, using local standard procedures. Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical  
history. Additional  ECGs  should  be performed  per PI discretion  if any clinically  significant  abnormal  findings  are noted  or as indicated.  All 12-lead ECGs  will be performed with  
the subject  in a recumbent  or semi -recumbent  position  after 5 minutes  of rest and should  generally  not be performed  within  15 minutes  after a  blood collection..  
j All AEs and SAEs that occur after the consent form is signed but before first study treatment must be reported by the inves tigator if they are the result of a protocol -specified  
intervention.  From  the time of first study  treatment  through  30 days followi ng end  of treatment,  all adverse  events  must  be reported  by the investigator.  SAEs  will be collected  for 
90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whi chever is earlier. The severity of AEs will be assessed  
using  NCI CTCAE v5.0  Grades 1  through  4. The  NCI CTCAE  v5.0 severity  of Gra de 5 will not  be used.  
k If a central line is used for study drug infusion, collect blood samples via peripheral blood draw to prevent sample contam ination.  
l On Day 1 of Cycles  1 and 5, subjects will be  required  to stay on-site for 4 hours  post-dose for collection  of PK samples.  
m At Screening, archival tumor tissue ≤ 5 years will be acceptable, however a fresh biopsy is preferred. Optional on -treatment tumor biopsy may be performed at Week 7, prior to  
the first on -study radiologic assessment for subj ects who consent at time of informed consent. A second optional biopsy may be performed at EOT for subjects who consent at  time 
of informed  consent.  
n The initial tumor imaging will be performed within 30 days before the first dose of study drug. Scans per formed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as  
the screening scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 30 days before the first dose of study drug. The sa me imaging technique should be used for a subject  
throughou t the study. Local  reading  (investigator assessment  with site radiology  reading)  will be  used to determine  eligibility  and for subject  management.  
o On -study imaging will be performed at Week 8 and then every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) for the first 6 mont hs and then every 12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days) thereafter. After  
completing  12 months  of treatment,  subjects  will have  imaging  performed  per standard  of care and PI discretion.  Imaging  should  follow  calendar  days and should  NOT  be adjusted  
for delays  in cycle  starts.  If imaging  shows  disease  progression,  then another  imaging  assessment  should  be performed 4 to  6 weeks  later to confirm  progression  per mRECIST.  
p For subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression, radiologic evaluation should be repeated at the time of treatment discontinuation (i.e., date of  
discontinuation  ± 4-week window).  If scan was  obtained within  4 weeks  prior  to the  date of discontinuation,  then a  scan at  treatment  discontinuation (EOT)  is not mandatory.

 6.1. Screening  Period  
Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the subject is enrolled in the study  
(e.g., Cycle  1 Day  1). 
Screening assessments may be completed over a period of approximately 30 d ays. Informed  
consent  must  be obtained  before  performing  any study -specific  procedures  that are not considered  
standard  of care.  However,  procedures  conducted  as part of the subject's  routine  clinical  
management obtained before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline  
purposes with approval of the medical monitor, provided that the procedure meets the Protocol - 
defined criteria. Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligi bility may be performed over  
the course  of 1 or more  days during  the screening  process.  
Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm subject eligibility before  
enrollment  or administration  of study  drug.  Tests  with results  that fail eligibility  requirements  may 
be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error. For  
screening  assessments  that are repeated,  the most  recent  available  result  before  enrollment  will be 
used to determ ine subject eligibility. Additionally, a subject who fails screening may repeat the  
screening process 1 time if the investigator believes there has been a change in eligibility status  
(e.g.,  after recovery  from  an infection).  Treatment  should  start as soon  as possible  after the date of 
enrollment.  
6.2. Treatment  Period  
The treatment period begins on the day the subject receives the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1  
Day 1). Cycle  1 Day 1 should  take place  within  approximately  30 days after the subject  has signed  
the ICF.  
Subjects will have regularly scheduled study visits on Day 1 of every cycle. The duration of each  
cycle  is dependent on the  dosing  schedule:  
• Initial  Dosing:  800 mg weekly for  8 Cycles  
o Cycle  Duration : 7 days (+3 days after Cycle  1) 
• Subsequent  Dosing  (Cycle 9  onwards):  800 mg  every  2 weeks  
o Cycle  Duration:  14 days (±3  days)  
For Phase 2 Safety Run -In Only: The first 4 cycles should be administered every 7 days during  
the DLT period.  
Subjects  will begin  with the Initial  Dosing  Schedule  on Cycle  1 (Day  1) and continue  with weekly  
dosing  for 8 Cycles.  Beginning  with Cycle  9, subjects  will follow  the Subsequent  Dosing  Schedule  
of 800 mg every 2 weeks. Note : Cycle 9 should occur two weeks following the last weekly dose  
of NC318. Subjects will remain on the Subsequent Dosing Schedule of 800 mg every two weeks  
until disease  progression,  withdraw  of consent,  or intolerable  toxicity  (whichever comes  first).  
Addi tional visits will be required on Days 2 and 3 of Cycles 1 and 5. During study visits, the  
subject  will have  clinical  and laboratory  assessments  as outlined  in Table  7 and Table  8. At certain  
study  visits,  subjects  will have  PK, PD, and biomarker  samples  obtained  (see Table  10 and 
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  47  
 Table 11 ). Toxicities will be monitored continuously and will be graded using the NCI CTCAE  
v5.0 criteria.  
During  Cycle  1, subjects  will be required  to stay at the study  site for safety  observation  for 
4 hours post end of infusion. For all other cycles (with the exception of Cycle 5), subjects will  
be required  to stay at study  site for 1 hour post end  of infusion  for observation  or per PI discretion  
if indicated.  
It is recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason during the safety  
observation  period.  During  the safety  observation  period,  subjects  will be assessed  for the onset  of 
acute  AEs.  
Subjects will continue to receive NC318 until diseas e progression, withdraw of consent, or  
intolerable toxicity (whichever comes first). After completing 12 months of treatment, if the  
subject  is deriving  benefit  from  NC318  and has not met any of the protocol defined  conditions  for 
withdrawal  or discontinua tion, the subject  will be followed  by the PI per standard  of care.  Subjects  
approved  to continue  treatment  will remain  on dose level  assigned  at the time of enrollment  (unless  
otherwise  approved  for dose modification  by the medical  monitor).  Safety  reporting  will continue  
through  end of  treatment to completion of  the safety  follow -up period.  
 
6.3. End of Treatment Visit  
When  the subject  permanently  discontinues  (i.e. stops  receiving)  study  drug,  the EOT  visit should  
be conducted. If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, then the EOT evaluations will  
supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT visit in the  eCRF.  
The subject should be  encouraged to  return  for the foll ow-up visit(s).  
6.4. Post-Treatment  Follow -up 
6.4.1.  Disease  Status  Follow -up 
Subjects who discontinue study drug for a reason other than disease progression will move into  
the disease status follow -up period and should continue to be assessed by radiologic imaging to  
monitor  disease  status.  
Information  regarding  post-study anticancer  treatment  will be collected  if new treatment  is 
initiated.  
Every  effort  should  be made  to collect  information  regarding  disease  status  until the earliest  of the 
following:  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• The start of a  new anti -cancer therapy  
• Documented  disease  progression  
• Pregnancy  
• Death  
• End of  the study

 6.4.2.  Survival  Follow -up 
Subjects who experience confirmed disease progression or start a new anticancer therapy will  
move  into Survival  Follow -up. Survival  Follow -up will occur  approximately  every  3 months  after 
the end of treatment and will continue until death, withdrawal of co nsent, or the end of the study,  
whichever  occurs first.  
Subjects will be contacted by phone to collect post -study anticancer therapy and survival status.  
AEs will be collected  through  30 days following  end of treatment.  SAEs  will be collected  for 
90 days after the end of treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new  
anticancer  therapy, whichever is earlier.  
 
6.4.2.1.     Survival  Status  
To ensure current and complete survival data is available at the time of database lock, updated  
survival status may be requested during the study by the Sponsor. Upon Sponsor notification, all  
subjects who do not/will not have a scheduled study visit or study contact during the sponsor  
defined time period will be contacted for their sur vival status (excluding subject that have a  
previously  recorded death event in  the eCRF).  
6.5. End of Study  
The end of the study will occur when all subjects have completed the last study follow -up visit or  
have discontinued (i.e. stopped receiving) study drug and have completed applicable follow -up 
assessments.  Additionally,  subjects  will be considered  as having  completed  the study  if they meet  
any of the  following  criteria:  
• Subject  dies and a date of death  is available  
• Subject  is known to  have  died, however  the date of  death cannot  be determined  
• Consent is withdrawn for any further contact to this study (Every reasonable effort should  
be made to determine the reason a subject withdraws prematurely, and this information  
should  be recorded)  
• The study is terminated by  the sponsor  
• The study  is terminated by  the local  IRB or local health authority  
6.6. Unscheduled  Visits  
Unscheduled  study  visits  may occur  at any time if medically  warranted.  Any assessments  
performed  at those  visits should be  recorded in the  eCRF.  
 
7. CONDUCT  OF STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  AND  PROCEDURES  
Individual study procedures are described in detail below. It may be necessary to perform these  
procedures  at unscheduled  timepoints  if deemed  clinically  necessary  by the investigator.  
Furthermore,  additional  evaluations/testing  may be deemed  necessary  for reasons  related  to subject  
safety. In some cases, such evaluation/testing may be potentially sensitive in nature (e.g., HBV,  
HCV),  and thus local  regulations  may require  that additional  informed  consent  be obtained  from  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  49  
 the subject. In these cases, such evaluations/tes ting will be performed in accordance with those  
regulations. Subjects of childbearing potential must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid  
pregnancy  in order to participate  in the  study.  
 
7.1. Administration  of Informed  Consent  Form  
Valid informed consent must be obtained from the subject before conducting any study -specific  
procedures using an ICF approved by the local IRB/IEC. The ICF should contain all elements  
required by ICH E6 and describe the nature, scope, and possible consequ ences of the study in a  
manner that the subject can understand. Local and institutional guidelines for ICF content and  
administration  must  be followed;  the original  signed  ICF must  be retained  by the investigator,  and 
a copy of the signed ICF must be provided to the study subject. The informed consent process for  
each subject must be documented in writing  within the subject  source  documentation.  
 
7.2. Demography  and Medical  History  
7.2.1.  Demographics  and General  Medical  History  
Demographic data and a complete medical and medication history will be collected at screening  
by the investigator or qualified designee and will include date of birth, race, ethnicity, smoking  
history, medical and surgical history, and current illnesses. Med ical history will include relevant  
medical  or surgical  treatment  within  the last 10 years  that are considered  to be clinically  significant  
by the investigator.  
7.2.2.  Disease  Characteristics  and Treatment  History  
A disease -targeted  medical  and medication  history  will be collected  at screening.  Details  regarding  
the subject's malignancy under study including date of diagnosis, initial and current cancer stage,  
primary  tumor  histology,  and prior  treatments  including  systemic,  radiation,  and surgic al 
procedures  will be  recorded.  
 
7.3. Prior  and Concomitant  Medications  and Procedures  
Prior  and concomitant  medications  and procedures  will be reviewed  to determine  subject  
eligibility. All concomitant medications and measures must be recorded in the eCRF, and any  
medication received, or procedure performed within 30 days before the first dose of study drug  
and up to the end of the follow -up Phase  of the study  will be recorde d in the eCRF.  The medication  
record will be maintained after signing the ICF to document concomitant medications, including  
any changes to the dose or regimen. Concomitant medications include any prescription, over -the- 
counter,  or natural/herbal  preparations  taken  or administered  during  the study  period.  Concomitant  
treatments and/or procedures that are required to manage a subject's medical condition during the  
study will also be recorded in the eCRF. Use of GnRH agonists or antagonists and COVID -19 
vaccines  should also be  recorded in the  eCRF.  
 
7.4. Poststudy  Anticancer  Therapy  
The investigator  or qualified  designee  will review  all new anticancer  therapy  initiated  after the last 
dose of study  drug, including  but not limited to  systemic therapy, radiotherapy,  and surgery.

 7.5. Safety  Assessments  
7.5.1.  Adverse  Events  
Adverse  events  monitoring  will begin  at the time the subject  signs  the ICF. All AEs and SAEs  that 
occur after the consent form is signed but before first study treatment must be reported by the  
investigator  if they  are the result of a  protocol -specified intervention.  
From the time of first study treatment through 30 days following end of treatment, all  adverse  
events must be reported by the investigator. SAEs will be collected for 90 days after the end of  
treatment or 30 days after the end of treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy,  
whichever  is earlier.  
Subjects will be instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the  
occurrence of AEs throughout the study. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects will be  
asked general, nonleading questions such as "How are  you feeling?" All AEs (serious and  
nonseriou s) must be recorded on the source documents and eCRFs regardless of the assumption  of 
a causal  relationship  with the study  drug.  The definition,  reporting,  and recording  requirements  for 
AEs are  described in  Section  8.1. 
 
7.5.2.  Physical  Examinations  
 
7.5.2.1.  Comprehensive  Physical  Examination  
Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed  
physician,  physician's  assistant,  or an advanced  registered  nurse  practitioner,  as local  law permits.  
ECOG  performance  status should be  assessed.  
The comprehensive physical examination will include assessment(s) of the following organ or  
body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system;  
abdomen  (liver,  spleen);  extremities;  and lymph  nodes,  as well as a brief  neurological  examination.  
The screening physical examination should also include a measurement of height. Clinically  
notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator  
are to be reported  as AEs  or medical history.  
 
7.5.2.2.  Targeted  Physical  Examination  
The targeted physical examination will be a symptom -directed evaluation conducted by the  
investigator or a medically qualified designee. The targeted physical examination will include  
assessment(s) of the body systems or organs, as indicated by subject symptoms, AEs, or other  
findings.  Clinically  notable  abnormalities  that are considered  clinically  significant  in the judgment  
of the investigator are  to be reported as AEs.  
 
7.5.2.3.  Vital  Signs and  Weight  
Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature.  
Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the subject in the recumbent, semi recumbent, or  
sitting  position  after 5 minutes of rest.

Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  51  
 During Cycle 1 Day 1, vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature)  
will be assessed  pre-dose,  at the end of infusion  (+10  minutes)  and every  60 minutes  (± 10 minutes)  
for 4 hours post end of  infusion.  
On Day 1 of all subsequent  cycles,  vitals  signs  will be assessed  pre-dose and at the end of infusion  
(+10  minutes)  and thereafter at the  PI’s discretion.  
It is recommended that the subject does not leave the site for any reason during the safety  
observation  period. Subjects will  also be  assessed  for the onset of  acute  AEs.  
Note : Weight will also be assessed at each study visit. Clinically notable abnormalit ies that are  
considered  clinically  significant in  the judgment of the  investigator  are to be reported  as AEs.  
 
7.5.3.  Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the subject in a recumbent or semi -recumbent position  
after 5 minutes of rest and should generally not be performed within 15 minutes of a blood  
collection.  
A single 12 -lead ECG should be performed at screening using  local standard procedures. Clinical  
significant abnormal findings should be recorded as medical history. Additional ECGs should be  
performed  per PI discretion  if any clinically  significant  abnormal  findings  are noted  or as indicated.  
The 12-lead ECGs  readings will be interpreted  by the investigator,  or qualified  designee  at the site 
to be used for immediate subject management. The decision to include or exclude a subject or  
withdraw a subject from the study based on a locally analyzed ECG flagged as "Abnormal,  
Clinically Significant" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consu ltation with the medical  
monitor,  as appropriate.  Clinically  significant  abnormal  findings  before  signing  consent  should  be 
recorded as medical history. Clinically significant abnormal findings after signing consent should  
be recorded  as an AE.  
 
7.5.4.  Laboratory  Assessments  
A laboratory  local  to the study  site and subject  will perform  all clinical  laboratory  assessments  for 
safety  (i.e., blood  chemistries,  complete  blood  count  (w/ differential),  coagulation  tests,  endocrine  
function, and urinalysis). The investigative site will enter the laboratory results and laboratory  
normal  ranges  into the eCRF.  All local  laboratory  assessments  should  be performed  using  standard  
procedures on the days indicated in Table 7 and Table 8. Tab le 9 lists the specific laboratory  
analytes required for each test. Additional testing may be required by the sponsor based on  
emerging  safety  data. Additional tests may  also be  performed if clinically  indicated.  
Safety  Lab tests  must be performed during  screening  period (within  30-day window).  
Cycle 1 Day 1 laboratory samples must be collected prior to study drug administration. Results  
should be reviewed by the investigator or qualified designee and found to be acceptable prior to  
the start of study  drug treatment. Note : If screening  labs were  preformed  within  7 days of Cycle  1 
Day 1, results from screening  can be  used as indicator to be gin study  treatment.  
For all subsequent cycles after Cycle 1, pre -dose laboratory procedures may be performed up to  
72 hours prior to study drug administration. Results should be reviewed by the investigator or  
qualified  designee  and found to  be acceptable  before  treatment is  initiated.

CONFIDENTIAL  52  
 7.5.4.1.  Pregnancy  Testing  
A local laboratory serum pregnancy test will be required for all women of childbearing potential  
during screening and at the EOT visit. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed locally on Day 1  
of each cycle as outlined in Table 7 , as medically indicated, or per country -specific requirement.  
Urine pregnancy tests on Day 1 of each Cycle must be performed and resulted before study drug  
administration. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, then the results should be confirmed with a  
serum pregnancy  test. 
If the serum pregnancy test is negative a fter a urine test was positive, then the investigator will  
assess the potential benefit/risk to the subject and determine whether it is in the subject's best  
interest  to resume study  drug and continue  participation in the  study.  
 
7.5.4.2.  Hepatitis  Screening  Tests  
Hepatitis screening assessments will be performed during the screening period ( Table 8 ) to rule  
out hepatitis  infection;  required  analytes  are shown  in Table  9. Generally,  hepatitis  tests should  be 
performed early in the screening process due to the length  of time needed to obtain the results.  
Additional tests may  be performed if clinically  indicated.  
 
7.6. Efficacy  Assessments  
7.6.1.  Modified  RECIST  v1.1 Assessment  of Disease  
Modified RECIST (mRECIST) will be applied by the site as the primary measure for assessment  
of tumor  response  and as a basis  for Protocol  guidelines  related  to disease  status  (e.g.,  
discontinuation of study therapy). As noted in Section 1.3.4 , RECIST v1.1 has been adapted to  
account  for the  unique tumor responses seen with  immunotherapy ( Wolchok 2009 ). 
If radiologic imaging shows progressive disease, then tumor assessments should be repeated at a  
minimum of 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks later to confir m progression, with the option of  
continuing treatment while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression. Table 12 provides  
instructions  on how to proceed  with treatment  based  on the subject's  clinical  status  once  the initial  
scan showing  radiologic  evidence  of progression is  observed.  
• Subjects  may receive  treatment  while  waiting  for confirmation  of progression  if they are 
clinically  stable  as defined by  the following  criteria:  
• Absence  of clinically  significant  signs  and symptoms  (including  worsening  of laboratory  
findings) consistent with disease  progression  
• No decline  in ECOG  performance  status  
• Absence  of rapid  progression  of disease  
• Absence  of progressive  tumor  at critical  anatomic  sites (such  as spinal  cord compression)  
requiri ng urgent alternative  medical intervention

Abbreviation:  N/A = not applicable.  
As noted above, if disease progression is observed, then the study site may elect to continue  
treatment, repeat imaging at a minimum of 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks later, and assess  
tumor  response or confirmed progression per mRECIST.  
In determining  whether  or not the tumor  burden  has increased  or decreased,  study  site investigators  
should consider all target lesions as well as nontarget lesions. Subjects that are deemed clinically  
unstable  are not required  to have  repeat  tumor  imaging  for confirmation.  If radiologic  progression  
is confirmed  by subsequent  scan,  then the subject  should  be discontinued  from  study  treatment.  If 
radiologic  progression  is not confirmed,  then the subject  should  resume  or continue  study  treatment 
and have the next tumor imaging according to the protocol schedule (see Table 7 ). If progression  
is not confirmed  and the subject  continues  on treatment,  then the date of the next scan that 
documents disease progression (and is confirmed by a second scan at least 4 weeks, but no  later 
than 6 weeks later) will be  considered the  date of  disease  progression.  
If a subject  has confirmed  radiographic  progression  (i.e., 2 scans  at least 4 weeks , but no later than 
6 weeks apart demonstrating progression) per mRECIST, but the subject is achieving a clinically  
meaningful benefit, an exception to continue treatment may be considered after consultation with  
the medical  monitor.  Clinically  stable  subjects  at the confirmatory  scan should  also have  no further  
increase in the target lesions, no unequivocal increase in nontarget lesions, and no additional new  
lesions  develop (non -worsening  disease  progression) to continue  study  treatment.  
 
7.6.1.1.  Tumor  Imaging  
The same  imaging  technique  should  be used  for a subject  throughout  the study.  The baseline  
scan must  be a contrast  computed  tomography  (CT)  or magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI),  except  
in circumstances  where  there  is a contrast  allergy  or with medical  monitor  approval.  When  the CT

 component  of a positron  emission  tomography/CT  uses higher  energy  and thinner  slices,  it may be 
acceptable with medical monitor approval. Images of the chest and abdomen are required for all  
subjects.  
 
7.6.1.2.  Tumor  Imaging  During  Screening  
Initial tumor imaging must be performed within 30 days before the first dose of study drug. The  
site study team must re view pre -study images to confirm that the subject has measurable disease  
per RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions that are located in a previously irradiated area or in an area  
subjected to other locoregional therapy should not be selected as target lesions. If a su bject only  
has lesions in an area previously irradiated or subjected to locoregional therapy, then the subject  
will be allowed to enroll. Additionally, it is recommended that tumor lesions selected for biopsy  
not be selected  as target lesions.  
CT or MRI scan of the brain will be performed at screening if there are signs or symptoms  
suggesting that the subject has disease involvement in the CNS. An MRI of the brain will also be  
required  at screening  for all subjects with melanoma.  
Scans performed  as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as the screening  
scan if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 30 days before the first dose of study  
drug.  
 
7.6.1.3.  Tumor  Imaging  During  the Study  
The first imaging assessment should be performed 8 weeks after the first dose of study drug and  
then every 8 weeks (56 days ± 7 days) for 6 months and then every 12 weeks (84 days ± 7 days)  
thereafter  until disease  progression  is determined.  Imaging  assess ments  may be done  more  
frequently if clinically indicated. After completing 12 months of treatment, subjects will have  
imaging performed per standard of care and PI discretion. Imaging should not be delayed for  
delays  in cycle starts . 
Per mRECIST v1.1, res ponse should be confirmed by a repeat radiographic assessment not less  
than 4 weeks from the date that the response was first documented. The scan for confirmation of  
response may be performed at the earliest 4 weeks after the first indication of response or at the  
next scheduled scan, whichever is  clinically  indicated.  
Imaging should continue to be performed until documented disease progression, the start of new  
anticancer  treatment,  withdrawal  of consent,  death,  or the end of the study,  whichever  occurs  first. 
Disease progression should be confirmed at least 4 weeks, but no later than 6 weeks after the first  
scan indicating progression in clinically stable subjects. Subjects who have unconfirmed disease  
progression  may continue  on treatment  until progression  is confirmed,  provided  that they have  met 
the conditions  detailed  in Section  7.6.1 . A central  imaging  vendor  will not be  used in  this study.  
7.6.1.4.  Imaging  During  Follow -Up 
If the subject  discontinues  study  drug for reasons  other  than disease  progression,  imaging  
assessments  should  continue  at the Protocol -specified  interval  until documented  disease  
progression, the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or the end of the  
study,  whichever occurs  first. 
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  55  
 If scan was obtained within 4 weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment  
discontinuation (EOT) is not mandatory. For subjects who discontinue study therapy without  
confirmed  disease  progression,  a radiologic  evaluation  should  be repeated  at the time of treatment  
discontinuation (i.e., date of discontinuation ± 4 -week window). For subjects who discontinue  
treatment for reasons other than disease progression, every effort should be made to continue  
monitoring their disease status unt il 1) withdrawal of consent 2) the start of new anti -cancer  
therapy,  3) documented  disease  progression,  4) death,  or 5) the end of the study,  whichever  occurs  
first. 
7.7. Pharmacokinetic  Assessments  
Timing of PK and ADA assessments are outlined in Table 10 . After the pre -dose PK sample is  
drawn, subjects will begin the study drug infusion. Predose is defined as within 24 hours before  
administration  of study  drug.  Adjustments  to the timing  of blood  sampling  may be made  based  on 
emerging PK data. The exact date and time of each PK blood draw will be recorded in the eCRF.  
Instructions  for sample  preparation and  shipping  will be  provided in  the Laboratory  Manual.  
7.8. Biomarker  and Correlative  Assessments  
Tumor, whole blood, and plasma samples will be collected at the visits outlined in Table 11 . If a 
central line is used for study drug infusion, collect blood samples via peripheral blood draw  
to prevent sample contamination. Additional biomarke r assessments that might be correlated  
with safety,  response,  or resistance  to treatment  beyond  those  listed  (e.g.,  monitoring  inflammatory  
or immune  markers,  measuring  specific  cell populations,  tumor  markers,  RNA  profiles  of specific  
cell populations, or measuring cell surface markers by flow cytometry,  Western blot, mass  
spectroscopy, or immunoassay) may be evaluated at the discretion of the sponsor using excess  
translational  biomarker  or PK samples.  All analyses  will be conducted  by NextCure  or NextCure’s  
designee.  For information  regarding  handling/shipping  of specimens,  please  refer  to the 
Laboratory  Manual for  the study.  
 
7.8.1.  Tumor  Biopsies  
 
7.8.1.1.  Tumor  Tissue  Collection  Requirements  
Tumor  biopsies  will be collected  as specified  below:  
• Screening:  A fresh  biopsy or collection  of archival  tumor tissue (≤ 5 years) from  a previous  
biopsy  is required at Screening.  
o An archival  baseline  biopsy  obtained within  5 years  for other  purposes  (i.e., not an 
NC318 -01 procedure) may  be utilized  
o Fresh  tumor biopsies  should be  taken  from  nontarget lesions  when  possible.  
o If a subject is scheduled to have a tumor biopsy for the purposes of this study and  
it is subsequently determined that tumor tissue cannot safely be obtained, then the  
subject  may still enroll in  the study.  
• On-treatment  (optional):  An on-treatment  biopsy  may be obtained  anytime  during  Week 
7 (before  the first radiographic  assessment)  for subjects  who consent  for on- treatment  
biopsy  at time  of informed consent.  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  56  
 o On-treatment  biopsies  should  be performed  at the same  site as the screening  biopsy  
whenever  possible.  
• At the End of Treatment  (optional):  An End of Treatment  (EOT)  biopsy  may be obtained  
at the time that study treatment has been discontinued for subjects who consent for EOT  
biopsy  at time  of informed  consent.  
Details and methods for obtaining, processing, and shipping the fresh tumor biopsy samples will  
be provided in the  Biopsy  Collection  Manual for the  study.  
 
7.8.1.2.  Tumor  Tissue  Assessment  
Tumor biopsy samples will be used to investigate molecular signatures associated with response  
or resistance to treatment with the study drug. DNA and/or RNA may be extracted from these  
samples to perform somatic mutation analysis, epigenetic analysis, who le exome sequencing, and  
genetic  expression  analysis.  Tissue  may also be examined  by histology  and immunohistochemistry  
or by exploratory methods to evaluate markers of inflammation and T -effector cell populations,  
growth, signaling, apoptosis, etc. that m ay be associated with safety, response, or resistance to  
treatment  with the  study  drug.  
 
7.8.2.  Whole  Blood  Correlative  Assessment  
Whole blood samples will be used for immune cell population profiling (which may include T  
lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, myeloid, and natural killer cells). Other assays relevant to the  
objectives  of the study,  such as flow cytometry  analysis  of intracellular  cytokines  may be  
performed  based upon  emerging  data.  
 
7.8.3.  Plasma  Pharmacodynamic  Assessment  
Plasma  samples  will be evaluated  to assess  evidence  of NC318  activity.  
Plasma samples will be used to examine markers of inflammation or immune modulation (which  
may include,  but are not limited  to: IFNγ,  IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and TNFα)  pre- and on-treatment  with 
NC318.  Other assays  relevant  to the objectives  of the study  may be performed  based  on emerging  
data.  
 
7.8.4.  Timing  for Plasma and  Whole  Blood  Assessments  
Biomarkers will be analyzed in plasma and whole blood samples collected at baseline and on  the 
days and times outlined in Table 11 . Timing for biomarker samples is outlined in Table 11 . 
Throughout the study, the exact date and time of the biomarker blood draws will be recorded in  
the eCRF along with the date and time study drug was administered  in the clinic. For information  
regarding  handling/shipping  of specimens, please refer to  the Laboratory  Manual for  the study.

 8. SAFETY  MONITORING  AND  REPORTING  
8.1. Adverse  Events  
8.1.1.  Definitions  
For the purposes  of this Protocol,  an AE is defined  as any untoward  medical  occurrence  associated  
with the use of a drug in humans, whether considered drug related, that occurs after a subject  
provides  informed consent  and through the  follow -up period.  
Both  nonser ious and serious  AEs (SAEs)  will be monitored  throughout  the study.  
A pre -treatment event (PTE) is one that occurs after the time of informed consent (e.g. during the  
screening process) but prior to study drug administration. PTEs directly related to a study test or  
procedure  should  be reported  during  the Screening  period.  Conditions  that were  already  present  at 
the time of informed consent  should be recorded on  the Medical History  form  in the eCRF.  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is one that occurs from the time of the first dose of  
study drug through 90 days after the last dose of study drug. TEAEs should be monitored until  
they are resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient ’s stable or chronic condition or  
intercurrent  illness(es).  
Abnormal  laboratory  values  or test results  occurring  after informed  consent  constitute  AEs only if 
they induce  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  are considered  clinically  meaningful,  require  therapy  (e.g.,  
hematologic abnormality  that requires  transfusion), or  require  changes  in the  study  drug(s).  
 
8.1.2.  Reporting  
Adverse  events  monitoring  will begin  at the time the subject  signs  the ICF. All AEs and SAEs  that 
occur after the consent form is signed but before first study treatment must be reported by the  
investigator  if they are the result of  a protocol -specified intervention.  
From the time of first study treatment through 30 days following end of treatment, all  adverse  
events must be reported by the investigator. SAEs will be collected for 90 days after the end of  
treatment  or 30 days after the end of treatment  if the subject initiates  a new anticancer  therapy.  
AEs (including  laboratory  abnormalities  that consti tute AEs)  should  be described  using  a diagnosis  
whenever  possible  rather  than by  individual  underlying  signs  and symptoms.  
The severity of AEs will be assessed using NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grades 1 through 4. The NCI  
CTCAE v5.0 severity of Grade 5 will not be used; AEs resulting in death will be graded  
accordingly  using  Grades  1 through 4  and have  the outcome  noted as fatal.  
If an eve nt is not classified by NCI CTCAE v5.0, the severity of the AE will be graded according  
to Table  13 to estimate  the grade  of severity.  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  58  
 Table  13:      NCI CTCAE v5.0 Grading Scale  
 
Grade  Clinical  Characteristics  
Grade 1  Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  
only; intervention not  indicated.  
Grade 2  Moderate;  minimal,  local,  or noninvasive  intervention  indicated;  limiting  
age-appropriate  activities of daily  living.  
Grade 3  Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening;  
hospitalization  or prolongation  of hospitalization  indicated;  disabling;  limiting  
self-care activities of  daily  living.  
Grade 4  Life-threatening  consequences:  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by nondirective questioning of the subject during the  
screening  process  after signing  the ICF and at each visit during  the study.  Adverse  events  may also 
be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during the screening process or between  
visits, or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. To the extent  
possible,  each AE  should  be evaluated to determine:  
• The severity  grade  (NCI  CTCAE Grade  1 to 4).  
• Whether  there  is at least a reasonable  possibility  that the AE is related  to the study  
treatment:  suspected  (yes) or not suspected  (no).  
• The start and end  dates, unless  unresolved  at final  follow -up. 
• The action taken  with regard to  study  drug.  
• The event  outcome  (e.g.,  not recovered/not  resolved,  recovered/resolved,  
recovering/resolving,  recovered/resolved with sequelae,  fatal, unknown).  
• The seriousness, as  per SAE  definition provided in  Section 8.3.1  
Unlike routine safety assessments, SAEs are monit ored continuously and have special reporting  
requirements  (see Section  8.3.2 ). 
All AEs should be treated appropriately. If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or  
nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on the AE form in the eCRF and the treatment  
should be specified on the Prior/Concomitant Medications or Procedures and Non -Drug Therapy  
form  in the eCRF.  
Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be  
permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any  
changes  in severity,  the suspected  relationship  to the study  drug,  the interventions  required  to treat 
the event, and the  outcome.  
When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (e.g., between visits), each  
change  in severity  will be reported  as a separate  AE until the event  resolves.  For example,  
2 separate  AEs will be reported  if a subject  has Grade  1 diarrhea,  meeting  the definition  of an AE, 
that lasts for 3 days before  worsening  to a Grade  3 severity.  The Grade  1 event  will be reported  as 
an AE with a start date equal to the day the event met the Grade 1 AE definition and a stop date  
equal  to the day that the event  increased  in severity  from  Grade  1 to Grade  3. The Grade  3 event  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  59  
 will also be reported as an AE, with the start date equal to the day the event changed in intensity  
from Grade 1 to Grade 3 and a stop date equal to the day that the event either changed severity  
again  or resolved.  
 
8.2. Laboratory  Test Abnormalities  
Laboratory  abnormalities  that constitute  an AE in their own right  (considered  clinically  
meaningful,  induce  clinical  signs  or symptoms,  require  concomitant  therapy,  or require  changes  in 
study  drug)  should  be recorded  on the AE form  in the eCRF. Whenever  possible,  a diagnosis  rather  
than a symptom should be provided (e.g., "anemia" instead of "low hemoglobin"). Laboratory  
abnormalities  that meet  the criteria  for AEs should  be followed  until they have  returned  to normal  
or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal laboratory test result  
corresponds to a sign or symptom of a previously reported AE, it is not necessary to separately  
record  the laboratory  test result as an additional event.  
Labora tory abnormalities that do not meet the definition of an AE should not be reported as AEs.  
A Grade 3 or 4 (severe) AE does not automatically indicate an SAE unless it meets the definition  
of serious,  as defined  in Section  8.3.1 . A dose modification  for the laboratory  abnormality  may be 
required (see Section 5.4.6 ) and should not contribute to the designation of a laboratory test  
abnormality  as an SAE.  
8.3. Serious  Adverse  Events  
8.3.1.  Definitions  
A serious  adverse  event  (SAE)  is defined  as an event  that meets  at least 1 of the following  criteria:  
• Is fatal  or life-threatening.  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization,  unless  
hospitalization  is a result  of: 
o A routine  treatment  or monitoring  of the studied  indication  not associated  with any 
deterioration  in condition.  
o An elective  surgery  or preplanned  treatment  for a pre-existing  condition  that is 
unrelated  to the indication  under  study  and has not worsened  since  signing  the ICF. 
o A treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the  
definitions  of a SAE  and not resulting  in hospital admission.  
o Any social  reasons  and respite  care,  in the absence  of any deterioration  in the 
subject's  general condition.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability, incapacity, or a substantial disruption of a  
person's  ability  to conduct normal life  functions.  
• Constitutes  a congenital  anomaly  or birth defect.  
• Is an important  medical  event  or a medical ly significant  event  that may not result  in death,  
be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered serious  
when,  based  on appropriate  medical  judgment,  the event  may jeopardize  the subject  or may 
require  medical  or surgical  intervention to  prevent  1 of the outcomes  listed above.

Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  60  
 Symptoms and clinical manifestations of disease progression can be classified as an SAE (if it  
meets  the above  criteria),  however,  progressive  disease  is not  an SAE.  
 
8.3.2.  Reporting  
Within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the  
investigational  product,  the investigator  or qualified  designee  must  complete  the SAE  Report  
Form and submit it to the Sponsor or its designee. Instructions for SAE reporting will be  
provided  by the CRO.  
The sponsor is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety reports to applicable  
regulatory authorities, ethics committees, and pa rticipating investigators, in accordance with ICH  
Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements. The sponsor may be required to report certain  
SAEs  to regulatory  authorities  within  7 calendar  days of being  notified  about  the event;  therefore,  
it is important  that investigators  submit  additional  information  requested  by the sponsor  or delegate  
as soon as it becomes available.  
Investigators  should  provide  all available  information  at the time of SAE  Report  Form  completion.  
Investigators should not wait  to collect additional information to fully document the event before  
notifying Sponsor or its designee of an SAE. When additional information becomes available,  
investigators should submit a follow -up SAE Report Form (separate from the initial report form ) 
with the new information. Any follow -up information to an SAE also needs to be provided to  
Sponsor  or its designee  within 24 hours of  learning  of the new information.  
 
8.3.3.  Reporting  of an Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of investigational product in excess of that  
specified  in the Investigator’s  Brochure  (IB),  unless otherwise  specified in  this protocol.  
Any overdose of a study subject with the investigational product, with or without associated  
AEs/SAEs, is required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to Sponsor or its  
designee  (see Section 8.3.2  for contact  information).  If the overdose  results  in an AE, the AE must  
also be recorded  on the AE eCRF.  Overdose  does not automatically  make  an AE serious,  but if the 
consequences  of the overdose  are serious,  for example  death  or hospitalization,  the event  is serious  
and must  be reported  as an SAE.  NextCure  does not recommend  specific  treatment  for an overdose.  
The investigator will use  clinical judgment to  treat any overdose.  
 
8.4. Emergency  Unblinding  of Treatment  Assignment  
Not applicable.  
 
8.5. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may  
have  interfered  with the effectiveness  of a contraceptive  medication  or method.  When  a pregnancy  
has been  confirmed  in a subject  (or a male  subject’s  partner)  during  maternal  or paternal  exposure  
to study drug, within 90 days of the last dose of study drug or within 30 days after cessation of  
treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, the following procedures should be  
followed  to ensure  subject safety:  
• The study  drug must be  discontinued immediately  (female  subjects only).  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  61  
 • Consent  must  be obtained from  female  partners of  male  subjects.  
• The investigator  must  complete  and submit  the NextCure  Clinical  Trial  Pregnancy  form  to 
the sponsor  or its designee  within 24 hours of learning  of the  pregnancy.  
• A serum pregnancy test must be performed to confirm the urine pregnancy test result  
(female  subjects only).  
• If a negative  serum  test does  not confirm  the urine  pregnancy  test result,  then:  
o The investigator will use his or her expert judgment, based on an assessment of the  
potential benefit/risk to the subject, to determine whether it is in the subject's best  
interest  to resume study  drug and continue  participation in  the study.  
• The EOT  visit evaluations  must  be performed  (female  subjects only).  
Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety  
evaluation. Follow -up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including  
spontaneous  or voluntary  termination,  details  of the birth,  and the presence  or absence  of any birth  
defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following until  
the first well -baby visit. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy form and  
reported  by the investigator  to the sponsor  or its designee.  Pregnancy  follow -up information  should  
be recorded  on the same  form  and should  include  an assessment  of the possible  causal  relationship  
to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome. The baby should be evaluated for the first  
8 weeks or the  duration specified in local  regulations, whichever is later.  
Any SAE o ccurring during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form and  
submitted  to the  sponsor  or designee.  
8.6. Warnings  and Precautions  
Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by  
the sponsor or its designe e, are presented in the IB. Additional safety information collected  
between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications (INs). Any  
important new safety information should be discussed with the subject during the study, as  
necessary, and provided to the IRB. If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to  
the ICF.  
8.7. Data  Monitoring  Committee  
For Phase 1, the sponsor will conduct telephone conferences with investigators in order to review  
cohort -specific data, to review overall safety data from prior cohorts (if applicable), and to agree  
on dose escalation, de -escalation,  and cohort expansion decisions  on a regular  basis.  
For Phase  2, a formal  DMC will  be organized  and comprised of  the following  members  including  
but not limited to: a chairperson, two non -participating physicians specializing in oncology, the  
study medical monitor, a non -voting biostatistician, and representatives of the Sponsor and CRO.  
The committee  will meet  on a regular  basis  to review safety  and tolerability  throughout the  study.  
Additional  information on the  DMC will  be detailed in the DMC  Charter.

 8.8. Immune -Related  Adverse  Events  
Adverse events of a potential immunologic etiology or irAEs may be defined as an AE consistent  
with an immune phenomenon associated with drug exposure after all other etiologies have been  
eliminated. Immune -related AEs may be expected based on the nature o f NC318, its mechanism  
of action, and reported experience with other immunotherapies. Special attention should be paid  
to AEs that may be suggestive  of potential  irAEs.  An irAE  can occur  shortly  after the first dose or 
several months after the last dose of  treatment. Guidance for the assessment, diagnosis, and  
management of irAEs is provided in Section 5.4.7 . Suspected irAEs should be discussed with the  
medical  monitor.  
Based on the known biology of the S15 pathway and its importance in immune function, as well 
as clinical experience with other immunotherapies in oncology, immune -related adverse events  
(irAEs)  are the most likely  class of toxicity.  
 
8.9. Reporting  Product  Complaints  
Any defects with the investigational products must be reported immediately to Nex tCure by the  
site with further  notification  to the site monitor.  During  the investigation  of the product  complaint,  
all investigational products must be stored per instructions in pharmacy manual unless otherwise  
instructed.

9. STATISTICS  
This section  outlines  the statistical  analysis  strategy  and procedures  for the study.  If, after the study  
has begun,  but prior  to any final database  lock,  changes are  made  to primary  and/or  key secondary  
hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, then the protocol will be  
amended (consisten t with ICH Guideline E -9). Changes to exploratory or other non -confirmatory  
analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, but prior to final database lock, will be  
documented  in a supplemental  SAP (sSAP)  and referenced  in the Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR)  for 
the study.  Post hoc  exploratory  analyses will be  clearly  identified in the  CSR.  
Tabular summaries will be presented by dose groups. Categorical data will be summarized by the  
number  and percentage  of subjects  in each category. Continuous  variables  will be summarized  by 
descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median, minimal, and maximal values.  
All analyses,  unless  specified  otherwise,  will be based  on as-treated  population,  which  includes  all 
subjects  who receive  any dose of NC318.  Additional  details  of statistical  analyses  will be described  
in the  SAP.

 9.1. Study  Populations  
The full analysis  set (FAS)  includes  all subjects  enrolled  in the study  who received  at least one full 
dose of NC318.  This population  will be used in all the summaries  and analyses  except  for those  of 
safety analysis set (SAS) and PK. The SAS will include all the subjects who receive any amount  
of study drug. The summaries and analyses of safety data will be performed on the S AS. The PK  
analysis  set (PAS)  will include  all the subjects  whose  blood  samples  are collected  for PK analysis.  
The PK data summaries  and analyses  will be  performed on the PAS.  
 
9.2. Selection  of Sample  Size 
A maximum  of 187 eligible  subjects  in Phase  1 and Phase  2 will be included  in this study.  
 
9.2.1.  Sample  Size for Phase  1 
The primary  objective  of the dose  escalation part  in Phase  1 of the study  is to determine  the MTD  
or PAD of NC318. A 3 + 3 study design will be used for dose escalation. A maximum of 7 dose  
levels will be tested. Therefore, a maximum of 42 subjects, who are evaluable for DLTs, will be  
included  in the dose escalation  phase.  Subjects  evaluable  for DLTs  are defined  as the subjects  who 
take a full dose of NC318 and then are followed up for 28 days for assessment of DLTs. Any  
subjects  who don’t meet  the criteria  will be replaced.  
Phase 1 of the study may also include safety expansion cohorts (Phase 1b)  evaluating doses and  
schedules equivalent to or lower than the highest dose levels determined to be safe and/or doses  
determined  to be pharmacologically  active.  Each  safety  expansion  cohort  will enroll  a total of 
9 evaluable  subjects  (up to 24 additional  subjects).  If < 3 of 9 evaluable  subjects  experience  a DLT,  
the cohort will be deemed safe. If more than 1 safety expansion cohort is deemed safe, then the  
RP2D will be determined in conjunction with the investigators and sponsor based on all av ailable  
safety,  PK, PD, and biomarker  results.  
Phase 1 enrollment of the study is complete. A total of 49 subjects were enrolled across Phase 1a  
and Phase  1b. The following  cohorts  were  expanded  during  Phase  1b: Cohort  2 (80 mg), Cohort  3 
(240 mg), and Coh ort 4 (400  mg). 
 
9.2.2.  Sample  Size for Phase  2 
Phase 2 of the study will further evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and  
pharmacologic  activity  of the recommended  dose of NC318.  In Phase  2, subjects  will be stratified  
after enrollment into cohorts  based on S15 expression  and tumor type.  
 
9.2.2.1.  Cohort  1: Select  S15+  Tumors (Lung  (adenocarcinoma),  HNSCC,  and Breast)  
This cohort  will include  subjects  who are 1) confirmed  as TMB -H and/or  MSI-H/dMMR,  2) upon  
enrollment  are confirmed  to express  S15, and 3) have  one of the following  tumor  types,  separated  
into tumor -specific subgroup: 1a) Lung (adenocarcinoma), 1b) HNSCC, and 1c) Breast cancer.  
The sample size of each subgroup will be guided by the Simon 2 -stage design ( Simon 1989 ). Let  
5% be a clinically  insignificant  response  rate for all tumor  cohorts.  During  Stage  1, each tumor -
specific subgroup will enroll 9 evaluable subjects; if no responses are observed within a  sub-group, 
then the sub -group will be discontinued. If 1 o r more response is observed within a  sub-group,  
then Stage  2 will begin  and 8 additional  subjects  will be enrolled,  for a maximum  of 
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  64  
 17 subjects  within  the sub-group.  Each  tumor -specific  sub-group  (1a, 1b, and 1c) will be 
independently  assessed.  
 
9.2.2.2.  Cohort  2: Alternate  Tumors  (Other  S15+  Tumors/S15 - Tumors)  
This basket cohort will include all other enrolled subjects who are confirmed as TMB -H and/or  
MSI-H/dMMR but do not fall under the criteria to be included in Cohort 1. Base d on the result of  
S15 expression, subjects will be stratified after enrollment into two groups within the cohort: 2a)  
Other S15+ Tumors and 2b) Select 15 - Tumors. Each group in the cohort will be guided by the  
Simon  2-stage  design  (Simon  1989 ). Let 5% be a clinically  insignificant  response  rate for all tumor  
types.  During  Stage  1, 9 subjects  will be enrolled  into each group; if no response  is observed  within  
a group, then the group will be discontinued. If 1 or more responses is observed within a group,  
then Stage 2 will begin and 8 additional subjects will be enrolled, for a maximum of 17 subjects  
per group.  Each  group  (2a and 2b)  will be  assessed independently.  
9.3. Level  of Significance  
There  is no formal  hypothesis  test planned  for this study.  A statistically  significant  level  of 0.05 is 
used for  calculation of  CI. 
 
9.4. Interim  Analysis  
No formal  interim  analysis  is planned.  However,  the safety,  PK and efficacy  data will be regularly  
reviewed  and monitored  for deciding  on dose escalation  in Phase  1 and continuation  in Phase  2 of 
the study.  
 
9.5. Statistical  Analyses  
9.5.1.  Summary  of Baseline  Characteristics,  Demographics  and Other  Analyses  
The number  and percentage  of subjects  screened,  treated,  and the primary  reason  for 
discontinuation  will be displayed.  Demographic  variables  (e.g.,  age, gender),  baseline  
characteristics,  cancer  history  and diagnosis,  and prior  and concomitant  therapies  will be 
summarized  either by  descriptive  statistics or  categorical tables.  
 
9.5.2.  Safety  Analyses  
The safety  assessments  include  adverse  events,  laboratory  tests,  and vital signs.  All the safety  data 
in the SAS will be summarized and listed by phase, treatment group, and cohort. Count and  
percentage  of AE will be  provided.  
 
9.5.2.1.     Adverse  Events  
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is any AE either reported for the first time or  
worsening  of a pre-existing  event  after the first dose of study  drug.  Analysis  of AEs will be limited  
to TEAEs,  but data listings  will include  all AEs regardless  of their timing  to study  drug 
administration.  Adverse  events  will be tabulated  by the MedDRA  preferred  term and system  organ  
class.  Severity  of AEs will be  based on the  NCI CTCAE v5.0 using  Grades  1 through 4.  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  65  
 The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be  
considered  to be treatment -related AEs.  If the investigator  does not specify  the relationship  of the 
AE to study drug, then the AE will be considered treatment -related. The incidence, frequency,  
duration,  and severity  of all AEs  (regardless of  causality) will be  tabulated.  
 
 
9.5.3.  PK Analyses  
The PK analyses will be based off the PAS, and PK time -concentration data will be summarized,  
listed,  and plotted.  PK parameters  (AUC 0-336, AUC 0-∞, Cmax, t½, etc.) derived  from  time-
concentration  data will be  summarized.  
 
9.5.4.  Efficacy  Analyses  
The response will be assessed by CT/MRI image during screening and every 8 weeks (± 7 days)  
post-dosing for 6 months and then every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter (or per standard of care).  
The efficacy study endpoints include ORR, DCR, DoR, PFS, and OS. T umor response will be  
determined according to RECIST v1.1. Time -to-event data (DoR, PFS, and OS) will be analyzed  
using the Kaplan -Meier method. All the efficacy data will be summarized by phase, dose group,  
and cohort.  
• ORR includes RECIST v1.1 complete an d partial response (CR or PR). ORR with 95%  
exact  CI will be  summarized  by phase,  dose group, and cohort.  
• DCR includes RECIST v1.1 complete, partial response, and stable disease (CR, PR or  
stable disease). DCR with 95% exact CI will be summarized by phase,  dose group, and  
cohort.  
• DoR is defined as the duration from the first documented ORR to the first documented  
progressive  disease  or death  due to any cause,  whichever  occurs  first. For subjects  who are 
alive and progression -free at the time of discontinuation from study,  data cutoff for  
analysis,  or use of other  anti-cancer  drug,  DoR  will be censored  at the last tumor  assessment  
date.  
The DoR will only  be analyzed for  the subgroup  of subjects  with an obj ective  response.  
DoR  = (progressive  disease,  death, or  censored date)  – (date  of first  response  + 1) 
• PFS is defined  as from  starting  study  treatment  to the first documented  progressive  disease  
or death  due to any cause,  whichever  occurs  first. For subjects  who are alive  and 
progression -free at the time of discontinuation from study, data cutoff for analysis, or use  
of other  anti-cancer drug,  DOR will  be censored  at the last tumor  assessment date.  
PFS = (progressive  disease,  death,  or censored  date)  – (date  of first dose of study  drug + 1) 
• OS is defined  as from  starting  study  treatment  to death  due to any cause.  For subjects  who 
are alive at the time of discontinuation from study or data cutoff for analysis, OS will be  
censored  at the  date of last  known alive  (LKA).  
OS = (Death or  LKA  date) – (date  of first dose  of study  drug + 1)

 9.5.5.  Pharmacodynamic  and Biomarkers  Analysis  
The PD and biomarkers  are explorative  for this study. These  data will  be listed  only.  
Descriptive  statis tics will  be the primary  methods  for the exploratory  analyses. Among  the 
variables  to be  included in the  exploratory  analyses are:  
• Correlation  analysis  between PD  biomarkers  and the disease  response  to treatment  with 
NC318.  
The immunogenic potential of NC318 will be assessed by summarizing the number and  
percentage of subjects who develop detectable ADAs. The impact of ADAs on PK will be  
assessed  if data allow.  Samples will  be collected  for evaluating  neutralizing  capacity  of ADAs  in 
the future.

No formal  analysis  will be performed  for Data  Monitoring  Committee  purposes.  
 
10. STUDY  AND  DATA  MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Training  of Study  Site Personnel  
Before  the first subject  is entered  into the study,  a NextCure  representative  will review  and discuss  
the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational  
staff and train them in any  study -specific  procedures and  system(s)  utilized.  
The Principal Investigator (PI) will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given  
to all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is  
forwarded  to the  staff involved.  
The PI will maintain a re cord of all individuals involved in the study (medical, nursing and other  
staff).  
 
10.2. Monitoring  of the Study  
During the study, a NextCure representative will have regular contacts with the study site,  
including  visits to:  
• Provide  information  and support  to the  investigator(s).  
• Confirm  that facilities  remain  acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adh ering to the protocol, that data are being  
accurately and timely recorded in the eCRFs, that biological samples are handled in  
accordance with the NC318 -01 Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability  
checks  are being  performed.  
• Perform  source  data verification  (a comparison  of the data in the eCRFs  with the subject’s  
medical  records at  the hospital  or practice,  and other records relevant  to the study)  
including  verification  of informed  consent  of participating  subjects.  This will require  direct  
access  to all original  records for each  subject (e.g.,  clinic  charts).

Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  67  
 • Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the subject’s biological samples is  
reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of/destroyed accordingly, and  
the action is documented,  and reported to the  subject.  
The NextCure  representative  will be available  between  visits  if the investigator(s)  or other  staff at 
the cente r needs information or advice  about the  study  conduct.  
 
10.2.1.  Source  Data  
All source  documents  should  be completed  in a neat,  legible  manner  to ensure  accurate  
interpretation of data. Data reported in the eCRF derived from source documents should be  
consistent  with the source  documents.  
The primary  source  document  for this study  will be the subject’s  medical  record.  If the 
investigator(s) maintains separate resea rch records, both the medical record and the research  
records will be  considered  the source  documents  for the  purposes  of auditing  the study.  
Data recorded on source documents will be entered into eCRFs. The investigator must promptly  
review the completed eCRFs for each subject. A study monitor representing the sponsor will  
review  the source  documents against the  eCRF  on a regular basis throughout  the study.  
The PI at each/the center should comply with all the terms, conditions, and obligations of the  
Clini cal Study  Agreement,  or equivalent,  for this study. In  the event  of any inconsistency  between  
this Clinical  Study  Protocol  and the Clinical  Study  Agreement,  the terms  of Clinical  Study  Protocol  
shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the treatment of subjects and in all other  
respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of subjects, the terms of the Clinical Study  
Agreement  shall prevail.  
Agreements between NextCure and  the PI must be in place before any study -related procedures  
can take place, or subjects are  enrolled.  
 
10.2.2.  Archiving  of Study  Documents  
The Investigator  follows  the principles outlined  in the  Clinical Study  Agreement.  
 
10.3. Study  Timetable  and End of  Study  
An individual subject will be considered to have completed the study if the subject was followed  
through  the last protocol -specified  visit/assessment  (including  telephone  contact),  regardless  of the 
number  of doses of investigational product that  was recei ved. 
Subjects will be considered not to have completed the study if consent was withdrawn or the  
subject  was lost to follow -up (see  Section 5.5.1 ). 
The end of the study (“study completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified  
visit/assess ment  (including  telephone  contact) for the last subject in the  study.  
 
10.4. Data  Management  
Data management will be performed by Syneos Health, on behalf of NextCure, according to the  
study  specific  Data Management Plan .

CONFIDENTIAL  68  
 A Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and query handling.  
The investigator  will ensure  that data are recorded  on the eCRFs  as specified  in the study  protocol  
and in accordance  with the  instructions provided.  
The investigator ensures the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and of  
the provision  of answers  to data queries  according  to the Clinical  Study  Agreement.  The 
investigator will sign the completed eCRFs. A copy of the completed eCRFs will be archived at  
the study  site. 
 
10.5. Medical  Monitor  Coverage  
Each  subject  will be provided  with contact  information  for the PI and the site coordinator(s).  In an 
emergent situation, a subject may present to a medical facility where the treating health care  
provider is not involved with this clinical trial. The treating healthcare provider may require  
additio nal information on the study drug, and the subject should provide contact information for  
the site coordinator(s) or the PI.  
The PI will then be  required to update the  medical  monitor.  
 
11. ETHICAL  AND  REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS  
11.1. Ethical Conduct  of the Study  
The study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that have their origin in the  
Declaration  of Helsinki  and are consistent  with ICH/Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP),  and applicable  
regulatory  requirements.  
 
11.2. Subject  Data  Protection  
The ICF will incorporate  (or, in some  cases,  be accompanied  by a separate  document  
incorporating)  wording  that complies with  relevant data  protection and  privacy  legislation.  
The anonymity of subjects must be maintained. Subjects will be identified by their initials and an  
assigned  subject  number  on eCRFs  and other  documents  submitted  to the sponsor.  Documents  that 
identify the subject beyond initials and subject number will no t be submitted to the sponsor (e.g.;  
the signed  ICF) and must  be maintained  in strict  confidence  by the investigator,  except  to the extent  
necessary  to allow auditing  by the regulatory  authorities, site  monitor, or  sponsor representatives.  
NextCure will not provide individual genotype results to subjects, any insurance company, any  
employer,  their family  members,  general  physician,  or any other  third  party,  unless  required  to do 
so by  law. 
Extra  precautions  are taken  to preserve  confidentiality  and prevent  genetic  data being  linked  to the 
identity of the subject. In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might see both  
the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a subject. For example, in the case of a medical  
emergency, a NextCure medical monitor or an investigator might know a subject’s identity and  
also have access to his or her genetic data. Also, Regulatory aut horities may require access to the  
relevant files, though the subject’s medical information and the genetic files would remain  
physically  separate.

 11.3. Ethics  and Regulatory  Review  
An IRB/IEC should approve the final study protocol, including the  final version of the ICF and  
any other  written  information  and/or  materials  to be provided  to the subjects.  The investigator  will 
ensure  the distribution  of these  documents  to the  applicable  IRB/IEC,  and to  the study  site staff.  
The opinion  of the IRB/IEC  should  be given  in writing.  The investigator  should  submit  the written  
approval  to NextCure  before  enrollment of  any subject into the  study.  
The IRB/IEC  should  approve  all advertising  used to recruit  subjects  for the study.  
NextCure  should  approve  any modifications  to the ICF that are needed  to meet  local  requirements.  
If required  by local regulations,  the protocol  should  be re -approved  by the IRB/IEC annually.  
Before  enrollment  of any subject  into the study,  the final study  protocol,  including  the final version  
of the ICF, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the national  
regulatory  authority  is done, according  to local regulations.  
NextCure will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national regul atory  
authorities.  
NextCure will provide Regulatory Authorities, IRB/IEC, and PIs with safety updates/reports  
according  to local  requirements,  including  suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  reactions  
(SUSARs),  where relevant.  
Each  PI must  inform  the IRB/IEC  of: 
• Changes  in informed  consent  
• Revisions  of other  documents originally  submitted for  review  
• Serious  and/or unexpected  AEs occurring  during  the study  
• New  information  that may adversely  affect  the safety  of subjects  or the conduct  of the study  
• Annual  update  and/or  request  for re-approval  
• Study  completion  
11.4. Informed  Consent  
A copy of the proposed ICF must be submitted to the sponsor for review and comment prior to  
submission to the reviewing IRB/IEC. The ICF must be approved by the IRB/IEC an d contain all  
elements  required by  national, state, local  and institutional regulations  or requirements.  
The PI at each center will:  
• Ensure each subject is given full and adequate oral and written information about the  
nature,  purpose, possible risk and benefit of the  study  
• Ensure  each subject is notified  that they  are free  to discontinue  from the  study  at any time 
• Ensure that each subject is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to  
consider  the information provided  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0

 • Ensure  each subject  voluntarily  provides  signed  and dated  informed  consent  before  
conducting  any procedure  specifically  for the study  
• Ensure  the original,  signed  ICF(s)  is/are  stored  in the Investigator’s  Study  File 
• Ensure  a copy  of the  signed  ICF is given  to the  subject  
• Ensure  that any incentives  for subjects  who participate  in the study as  well as any 
provisions  for subjects  harmed  as a consequence  of study  participation  are described  in the 
ICF that is approved by  an IRB/IEC  
 
11.5. Changes  to the Protocol  and Informed  Consent  Form  
Protocol revisions will be prepared and approved by NextCure and the medical monitor. Minor  
revisions will be submitted as administrative changes. If there are any substantial changes to the  
study protocol, then these changes will be documented in a study protocol amendment and where  
required  in a new version of  the study  protocol.  
All protocol amendments will be signed by the PI and approved by the relevant IRB/IEC and if  
applicable,  also the national  regulatory  authority  approval,  before  implementation.  Local 
requirements are to be followed for revised protocols. Documentation of IRB/ IEC approval must  
be forwarded to the  sponsor.  
NextCure  will distribute  any subsequent  amendments  and new versions  of the protocol  to each PI. 
For distribution to  IRB/IEC  see Section 11.3 . 
If a protocol  amendment  alters  the study  design,  increases  potential  risk to the subject  or otherwise  
affects  statements  in the ICF, the ICF must  be revised  accordingly  and submitted  to NextCure  and 
the IRB/IEC for review and approval before the revised ICF is used. The approved ICF must be  
used to obtain  informed  consent  from  new subjects  prior  to enrollment  and must  be used to obtain  
informed  consent from subjects already  enrolled if they  are affect ed by  the amendment.  
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved by  
each IRB/IEC.  
 
11.6. Audits  and Inspections  
Authorized  representatives  of NextCure,  a regulatory  authority,  or an IRB/IEC  may perform  audits  
or inspections at the clinical sites, including source data verification. The purpose of an audit or  
inspection  is to systematically  and independently  examine  all study -related  activities  and 
documents,  to determine  whether  these  activities  were  conducted,  and data were  recorded,  
analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP, guidelines of the ICH, and any  
applicable  regulatory  requirements.  The investigator  will contact  NextCure  immediately  if 
contacted by  a regulatory  agency  about an inspection at the  site.

 APPENDIX  2.   ADDITIONAL  SAFETY  GUIDANCE  
Assessment  of Severity  
Assessment  of severity  is one of the responsibilities  of the investigator  in the evaluation  of adverse  
events  (AEs)  and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs).  Severity  will be graded  according  to the National  
Cancer  Institute Common  Terminology Criteria for  Adverse Events  (NCI CTCAE) v5.0  as 
provided below. The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the NCI CTCAE  
should be made by the inves tigator based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of  
Grade  1 to 4 as defined below.  
Grade  1 (mild)  An event  that is usually  transient  and may require  only minimal  
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  
interfere  with usual activities of  daily  living.  
Grade  2 (moderate)  An event  that is usually  alleviated  with additional  specific  
therapeutic  intervention.  The event  interferes  with usual  activities  of 
daily  living,  causing  discomfort  but poses  no significant  or 
permanent  risk of harm to the subject.  
Grade  3 (severe)  An event  that requires  intensive  therapeutic intervention.  The event  
interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects the  
clinical  status of the subject.  
Grade  4 (life threatening)      An event,  and/or  its immediate  sequelae,  that is associated  with an 
imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that  
affect  or limit  the ability  of the subject  to perform activities  of daily  
living  (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc.).  
It is important  to distinguish  between  serious  criteria  and severity  of an AE. Severity  is a measure  
of intensity  whereas  seriousness  is defined  by the criteria  in Section 8.3.1 . A Grade  3 AE need  not 
necessarily  be considered  an SAE.  For example,  a Grade  3 headache  that persists  for several  hours  
may not meet the regulatory definition of an SAE and would be considered a nonserious event,  
whereas  a Grade  2 seizure  resulting  in a hospital  admission  would be  considered an SAE.  
The NCI CTCAE  v5.0 can be downloaded  from  the Cancer  Treatment  Evaluation  Program  (CTEP)  
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick_  
Reference_5x7.pdf ). 
Assessment  of Relationship  
Relationship  to Investigational  Product  
The investigator  is required  to provide  an assessment  of relationship  of AEs and SAEs  to the 
investigational  product.  
NextCure,  Inc. 
Protocol  NC318 -01 (Amendment  6) 03Mar2022  
Version  7.0 
CONFIDENTIAL  78  
 An event will be considered “not related” to use of the investigational product if any of the  
following  tests are  met: 
• An unreasonable  temporal  relationship  between  administration  of the investigational  
product  and the onset of  the event  (e.g., the  event  occurred  either before,  or too  long after,  
administration  of the investigational product  for it to be  considered product -related)  
• A causal relationship between the investigational product and the event is biologically  
implausible  (e.g., death as a  passenger  in an automobile accident)  
• A clearly more likely alternative explanation for the event is present (e.g., typical adverse  
reaction  to a concomitant  drug and/or typical disease -related event)  
Individual  AE/SAE  reports  will be considered  “related”  to use of the investigational  product  if the 
“not related”  criteria  are not met.  
“Related”  implies  that the event  is considered  to be “associated  with the use of the drug”  meaning  
that there is “a reasonable possibility” that the event may have been caused by the produc t under  
investigation  (i.e., there  are facts,  evidence, or arguments  to suggest  possible  causation).  
Relationship  to Protocol  Procedures  
The investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol  
procedures on the SAE Report Form. This includes nontreatment -emergent SAEs (i.e., SAEs that  
occur prior to the administration of investigational product) as wel l as treatment -emergent SAEs.  
A protocol -related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the  
study  (e.g.,  blood  collection,  washout  of an existing  medication).  The following  guidelines  should  
be used by  investigators to ass ess the relationship of SAEs to the  protocol:  
Protocol  related:  The event  occurred  due to a procedure/intervention  that was described  in 
the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the  
subject’s  medical record.  
Not protocol  related:  The event  is related  to an etiology  other  than the procedure/  intervention  that 
was described in the protocol (the  alternative etiology must be  
documented  in the  study  subject’s  medical record).

 APPENDIX  3. NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND  
INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND FOOD AND ALLERGY  
ANAPHYLAXIS GUIDANCE FOR ANAPHYLAXIS  
DIAGNOSIS  
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and Food and Allergy Anaphylaxis  
Network (FAAN) define anaphylaxis as a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may  
cause death ( Sampson 2006 ). They recognize 3 categories of anaphyl axis, with criteria  
designated  to capture  from  80% of cases  (category  1) to >95%  of all  cases  of anaphylaxis  (for all 
3 categories).  
1) Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin,  
mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue - 
uvula)  
 
AND  AT LEAST  ONE OF  THE  FOLLOWING:  
• Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea , wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced  
peak  expiratory  flow (PEF), hypoxemia)  
• Reduced  blood  pressure or  associated  symptoms  of end-organ  dysfunction  (e.g.,  
hypotonia  [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
2) Two or more  of the  following  that occur  rapidly  after exposure  to a likely  allergen for  
that subject (minutes to several hours):  
• Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush,  
swollen  lips-tongue -uvula)  
• Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced  
PEF,  hypoxemia)  
• Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse],  
syncope,  incontinence)  
• Persistent  gastrointestinal  symptoms  (e.g.,  crampy  abdominal  pain,  vomiting)  
3) Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that subject (minutes to  
several  hours):  
• Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age specific) or greater than  
30% decrease  in systolic  blood pressure  
• Adults: systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30%  
decrease  from that person’s baseline

Page 5 of 132 29 July 2016  Study Population:  Male and female patients ages 18 to 65 inclusive with active SLE  at screening  
Study Duration After up to a 4- week  screening period, p articipants will receive XmAb5871  or placebo  IV 
every other week for up to a total of 1 6 doses (30 weeks) and will be followed for 6 weeks 
following the last dose  for a total study period of up to 40 weeks . 
Study Procedures:  Eligible patients must have moderate to severe, non-organ threatening, SLE activity defined 
as a SELENA  SLEDAI of  ≥6 (≥4 points of which must come from non- serological 
findings) OR  ≥1 BILAG  B score OR ≥1  BILAG A  score .  Patients must be able and willing 
to discontinue background immunosuppressive medications  and to receive a brief course of 
IM steroid  therapy to enter screening .   
After obtaining informed consent, 160 mg of IM depomedrol will be administered and 
screening studies will be performed .  Over the 2-4 week  period following the initial IM 
depomedrol, per investigator discretion, patients may receive additional IM depomedrol  (up 
to an additional 320 mg during screening)  to treat their  SLE symptoms to a target of disease 
activity improvement  defined as a SELENA  SLEDAI decrease of  ≥4 points OR  a decrease 
in BILAG of  ≥1 severity grade in at least one organ  system that began with A or B (clinical 
criteria without requiring  temporal criteria).   Immunosuppressive therapy will be stopped or 
tapered off over the  2-4 week screening period and must be discontinued b y randomization 
on Day 1 .  Patients on anti -malarial therapy  may continue on their usual dose.  Patients 
entering the study on oral doses of  ≤15 mg of p rednisone per day (or the equivalent) will 
taper their oral steroids to 10 mg per day or less  by randomization  (Day 1) and then may 
continue on a ≤10 mg  daily dose  through the study .  Patients who do not meet the disease 
activity improvement criteria during the 2 -4 week screening period will not be randomized 
into the study and their participation will end.  
Patients must have documented disease activity improvement following the brief course of 
IM steroid therapy d uring the screening period to be randomized into the study on Day 1.  
Those patients who achieve  the required disease activity improvement from the screening 
baseline  will be randomized to receive either XmAb5871 (5 mg/kg) or matching placebo by 
IV administration (double -blinded) over 1-2 hours every 2 weeks from Day 1 through Day 
211 for a total of up to 16 infusions.  Disease activity ( SELENA  SLEDAI, BILAG) on Day 
1 will be considered the baseline disease activity for determination of the efficacy  
endpoint s.  On Day 1, 80 mg of IM depomedrol will be administered and baseline 
procedures including physical exam, blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments, 
PK and PD samples will be performed.  The first infusion of XmAb5871 or placebo  will be 
given IV over a period of 2 hours.   Patients will be observed for at least 2 hours after 
completion of the first study drug administration during which time safety assessments will 
be performed.   
All patients will return to the research facility on Day 8 for safety, PK and PD assessments.  
On study Day 15, patients will receive 80 mg of IM depomedrol in addition to the 
procedures scheduled for that day  and will receive the second IV infusion of XmAb5871 or 
placebo .  Patients  will return on study Days 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 
183, 197 and 211 for XmAb5871 or placebo administration IV over 1 -2 hours and for 
safety, PK and PD assessments.  Patients will be required to remain at the study site for 
observation for at least 1 hour after the completion of each infusion.  
Patients will be followed for the loss of disease activity improvement (LOI) as defined by : 
I. The assessment by the investigator that SLE  disease activity is approp riate for a n 
increase in therapy  (including addition of another lupus therapy, except for 
adjustments in NSAIDs ) AND  
II.There has been  one of the following compared to baseline (Day 1) :
1)a SELENA  SLEDAI increase of ≥ 4 points from maximal improvement OR
2)a w
orsening of at least 1 BILAG A or B score OR
3)t
he appearance of a new BILAG A or B  score .
Patients who meet the criteria for loss of disease activity improvement at any timepoint up 
to and including Day 211 will not receive further infusions of XmAb5 871 or placebo  and 
may receive any appropriate SLE therapy at the discretion of the principa l

 investigator.   
The effect of XmAb5871 on loss of improvement of SLE disease activity will be evaluated 
as the percentage of patients without loss of  disease activity improvement at Day 225 
(primary endpoint) and Day 169 (secondary endpoint) .  Patients with loss of  disease 
activity  improvement at any time -point up to and including Day 225 will be considered 
non-responder s for the primary endpoint .  Patients who discontinue the study early either 
because of loss of improvement or for other reasons will be followed for a further period of 
6 weeks after their last dose of XmAb5871 or placebo .   
All patients completing the treatment period should  be foll owed through D ay 253(EOS ).  
Patient participation is complete once EOS study procedures are performed.  All AE(s) 
(including serious AEs and deaths) and use of concomitant medication information will be 
collected throughout the study from screening through the EOS visit.  Patients developing 
treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) or clinically significant safety lab abnormalities will be 
followed until resolution or until the TEAEs/abnormalities are stabilized.   
Criteria for 
Evaluation:  Disease Activity:  
The following disease activity parameters will be recorded at scheduled intervals  
throughout the study:  
• SELENA  SLEDAI  using the SELENA  SLEDAI hybrid version with the SELENA  
SLEDAI Flare Index  
• BILAG  using the BILAG 2004 
• Physician’s Global Assessment VAS  
Safety: 
The following safety parameters will be recorded at regular intervals during the study:  
• Adverse events (CTCAE v 4.03)  
• Vital signs (supine blood pressure [BP], heart rate [HR], oral body temperature, 
respiratory rate [RR])  
• Twelve -lead electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
• Clinical laboratory testing (clinical chemistry, hematology, coagulation and urinalysis)  
• Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels (IgG, IgM, IgE)  
• B cell and T  cell quantification by flow cytometry  
• Concomitant medications  
• Physical examinations  
Immunogenicity : 
The following immunogenicity parameter will be recorded during the study:  
• Anti-XmAb5871 antibodies ( anti-drug antibodies [ ADA])  
Pharmacokinetics:  
Serum XmAb5871 peak and trough serum concentrations will be measured in this study.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
• Circulating ABC count  
• SLE autoantibody panel , complement levels and cytokine profile  
Pharmacogeno mics:  
• FcγRIIa R1 31H polymorphism  
• FcγRIIb I232T polymorphism  
Statistical Methods: Sample size considerations:  
Sample size is based on a previously completed study of SLE patients treated with disease -
suppressing IM depom edrol therapy for up to 2 weeks following cessation of background 
immunosuppressant therapy.   In that study, by month 6 , 40/41 patients lost the disease

 activity improvement achieved following IM steroid therapy; a 2.4% placebo response.  
Assuming a placebo response of 10% and a 38% XmAb5871 response in preventing loss of 
disease activity improvement, the number of patient s needed for 80% power and 5% 
significance would be approximately 40 per arm.  Adding approximately 10% for 
unevaluable patients, the total number per arm is calculated as 45.  
Statistics:  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the mean, standard deviation, median a nd range (minimum/maximum). Categorical variables will be presented as 
frequency counts and percentages; and time -to-event variables will be summarized using 
Kaplan -Meier methods (median, 95% CI, number of events, number censored, 
Kaplan -Meier figures).  D ata listings will be created to support each table and to present all 
data.   
The primary efficacy endpoint will be evaluated as the percentage of patients without loss 
of disease activity improvement on Day 225. The percentage of patients without loss of 
disease activity improvement on Day  169 will be a secondary endpoint .  Loss of 
improvement (LOI) will be defined as worsening of disease activity that : 
In the opinion of the principal investigator requires  change in treatment  (exclusive of a 
decrease in oral steroid use)  AND one of  
1) A SELENA  SLEDAI increase of ≥ 4 points from maximal improvement OR  
2) A worsening of at least 1  BILAG A or B score OR   
3) A new BILAG A or B  score . 
The Fishers exact test  will be performed on the Efficacy Evaluable Population to  test for 
treatment group differences.  The same analysis  on the ITT P opulation will also be utilized 
for sensitivity analysis.    
In addition to the percentage of patients without loss of disease activity improvement on 
Day 169, the time to loss of S LE disease activity improvement achieved by a short period 
of IM steroid therapy in SLE patients  will be a secondary endpoint . This endpoint  will be 
summarized by treatment arm using Kaplan -Meier methods (median, 95% CI, number of 
events, number censored, etc.) and Kaplan -Meier plots. The log -rank test will be used to 
test for treatment group differences on the Efficacy Evaluable and ITT populations.  
All safety data will be based on the Safety Population. T he number and percent of patients 
experiencing a t reatment -emergent adverse event will be tabulated for each coded 
MedDRA system -organ class and preferred term by treatment arm.  Treatment -emergent 
adverse events will also be tabulated according to intensity and causality by treatment arm.  
Clinical labora tory tests, vital signs, and ECG data will be summarized by treatment arm 
using descriptive statistics.

enrolling investigational site will be allowed to participate.   All 
patients in the study will receive appropriate SLE rescue therapy at the 
discretion of the principal  investigator and discontinue study drug 
infusions at the time of loss of disease activity improvement. , however

 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1. Background  
1.1.1. Role of B Cells in Autoimmunity  
Autoimmune diseases, including connective tissue diseases and bullous diseases, confer high risk 
of chronic symptoms, poor quality of life and progressive disability, and may be life -threatening.   
Recent clinical and experimental approaches have demonstrated that B cells play critical roles in 
the pathophysiology  of autoimmune disease .  They do so not only by well -established 
autoantibody -mediated mechanisms but also by a variety of other  functions  including 
interactions with dendritic cells and T cells.  B cell activation and autoantibody production 
therefore offer an important therapeutic target mechanism for the management  of immune -
mediated conditions .  B cell directed therapies are approved for  both the treatment of rheumatoid 
arthritis ( RA) (rituximab) and systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE) (belimumab).  
B cells are activated through a number of cell surface receptors including the B  cell receptor 
(BCR).  The BCR, once coupled with cognate anti gen, induces a complex signaling pathway that 
results in B cell activation, proliferation and differentiation.  The BCR response to antigen is 
modulated by a number of specialized cell surface co -receptors, or response regulators, which 
inform B cells of their microenvironment.  These response regulators include cluster of 
differentiation 19 (CD19) and CD22.  In addition, B cells have Fcγ receptor IIb (FcγRIIb) on 
their surface.   Activation of FcγRIIb results in down- regulation of BCR signaling and decreased 
B cell function.  FcγRIIb has also been shown to play a crucial role in suppressing autoimmunity  
(Nimmerjahn  et al 2008, McGaha et al 2005, Tarasenko  et al 2007, Brownlie  et al 2008) .   
1.1.2. XmAb5871 
XmAb®5871 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) being developed by Xencor Inc. for 
the treatment of B cell mediated autoimmune disorders such as SLE , RA  and IgG4 Related 
Disease ( IgG4 -RD). 
XmAb5871 is a humanized Fc (fragment, crystallizable) engineered mAb that binds to the human B cell restricted surface antigen CD19 and has enhanced Fc binding to FcγRIIb .  The 
antibody variable region of XmAb5871 has been engineered to increase affinity to human CD19, while the constant region is engineered to increase affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIb (Chu et al 
2008, Horton et al 2011) .

 Page 32 of 132 29 July 2016  
 FcγRIIb is the only Fc receptor (FcR) on B cells and serves as an antibody -sensing 
down- regulator of humoral immunity that is naturally engaged by immune complexes ( Smith  et 
al 2010) .  When sufficient antibody is raised against a given antigen, specific immune complexes 
form and co -engage FcγRIIb an d the BCR with high avidity, selectively suppressing only B cells 
that recogniz e cognate antigen.  In addition, FcγRIIb regulates the activity of other B cell 
stimulators including IL -4, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and B cell activating factor (BAFF) that 
amplify BCR -driven B cell proliferation and differentiation ( Crowley  et al 2009) .   
By simultaneously binding CD19 and FcγRIIb, XmAb5871 mimics the action of 
antigen -antibody complexes and down- regulates B cell activity.  The proposed mechanism of 
action of XmAb5871 of simultaneously binding CD19 and FcγRIIb and down regulating B cell 
activity has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, including inhibition of peripheral B c ells 
from SLE patients ( Horton et al 2011) and in classical animal models of autoimmune disease.    
1.1.3. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  
SLE is the prototypic autoimmune disease, with many immunological abnormalities including the presence of a plethora of autoantibodies, hyperactive B cells, activated T cells, increased cytokines and increased innate immune function.  Hyperactive B cells m ay play a role both as 
the precursors to autoantibody -producing cells and as antigen presenting cells to other cells of 
the immune system such as T cells .  Autoantibodies complexed with their autoantigens stimulate  
plasmacytoid dendritic cells  and neutrophils .  Several groups have shown down- regulation of the 
inhibitory Fc receptor, Fc γRIIb, in mouse models of SLE and on memory B cells and 
plasmablasts from SLE patients.  This correlated with a decreased suppression of BCR induced 
responses in those B cells  and suggested that a critical checkpoint in memory B cell regulation, 
FcγRIIb, might be impaired ( Mackay  et al 2006, Su  et al 2007).  Therefore, targeting this 
receptor to restore a more normal level of suppressive function could potentially help to reduce the activation of the immune system in SLE.   
SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that may affect multiple organs.  The ACR 
Classification criteria for SLE ( Tan et al, 1982) include malar rash, discoid rash, 
photosensitivity, arthritis, serositis, renal disorder, neurologic disorder, hematologic disorder, immunologic disorder (autoantibodies), and antinuclear antibody (ANA), of which any 4 of the 
11 can be present to classify a patient as having SLE.  SLE is typically a disease of young 
women ages 15- 45, with a 10- fold greater incidence in women than in men.  There are some 
ethnic differences, with greater prevalence and severity of disease in persons of  African, 
Hispanic, Asian and Native American descent.  While the risk of mortality has decreased to 
5-10% at 10 years, patients still die of active disease, infection, cardiovascular causes, and

 treatment associated effects.  Despite improved survival, it is estimated that only 15% of patients 
have good to excellent disease control sustained for 1 year (http://www.niams.nih.gov/  
Health_Info/Lupus/default.asp) .  
The frequent remissions and flares that characterize t he disease have made development of 
assessment tools and the design of clinical studies difficult.   The confounding effects of 
concomitant medications have often been considered to be a major reason for the inability to 
show efficacy of potential new thera peutics ( Bruce  et al 2010, Thanou et al 2014).  Trial designs 
other than the frequently utilized model of adding a new drug or placebo on top of standard of 
care have been needed.  Recently, a B iomarker of Lupus Disease study (BOLD , NCT 00987831) 
was completed at Oklahoma M edical Research Foundation that used a design that , by reducing 
potent ial for placebo response, could allow proof -of-concept for new therapeutic agents with 
enrollment of  a much smaller number of patients.  Forty -one SLE patients with active, non- organ 
threatening disease had a brief course of IM depomedrol substituted for their ineffective SLE 
medications.  All achieved disease activity improve ment  following 1-4 injections of 160 mg of 
IM depomedrol given over 2 weeks , with 360 mg the mean amount of steroid given.  The 
investigator then monitor ed the  patients  until they required additional therapy for loss of disease 
activity improvement.  Forty of the 41 required the addition of other therapy within 6 months  
with the overall median time to loss of disease activity improvement of 56 days.  This suggested that the effect of the brief course of IM depom edrol therapy gradually wore off over the first few 
months .  The patients received rescue therapy as soon as disease activity improvement was lost  
and there was a quick response to rescue therapy .  There were no SAEs from disease flares and 
patients did not have disease flares of manifestations that were worse than their  previous disease 
activity  (Merrill  et al 2011) .  In addition, a predictive model using biomarkers of disease 
(Guthridge  et al 2014 ) indicate d the likelihood of an early flare was drastically reduced in the 
absence of activated monocyte s (activated CD11b
hi) and activated naïve B cell s (CD86hi).  
Conclusions from the study were  that patients with moderately severe, non -organ threatening 
SLE can tolerate withdrawal of their ineffective treatments for periods of time and that their 
disease activity can be controlled with a short period of IM steroid therapy.  The design was 
thought to reflect clinical practice and to support a trial design with disease amelioration (steroids) at baseline and immediate treatment if disease activity returns  (Merrill  2013) .  
Therefore, this  design has the potential to study investigational agents that could be added at the 
time of improvement with IM steroid  therapy .  An effective agent would be expected to reduce 
the number of patients who would require additional therapy, and should be able to do so within 
a reasonably short period of study time (6 months) .  Using the BOLD study  design, t he presen t 
study proposes to test if  XmAb5871 can improve on the proportion of patients at 6 months that

 maintain disease activity improvement  induced by IM steroid  therapy  after ineffective (and 
potentially confounding)  agents are discontinued.  This is particularly interesting given the 
demonstrated ability of XmAb5871 to suppress the expression of CD86 on stimulated SLE and 
normal human B cells . 
1.1.4. Current T reatment of SLE  
SLE is currently incurable.  The goals of treatment are to reduce inflammation and damage to the 
organs and to prevent or reverse disease exacerbations.  Therapy is tailored to the organ systems 
involved and the amount of inflammation, but most of the agents used are non -specific 
immunosuppressants that are frequently used in combination.  For milder forms of SLE 
involving skin and/or joints, topical or low dose oral steroids, hydroxychloroquine, NSAIDs 
and/or methotrexate are often the mainstay of therapy.  Involvement of other organ systems often warrants higher doses of oral s teroids together with agents such as azathioprine, mycophenol ate 
mofetil, or belimumab.    
Aggressive treatment is warranted when vital organs are involved to prevent organ damage or failure.  High dose oral or IV corticosteroids with cyclophosphamide, aza thioprine, or 
myco phenolate  mofetil may be used for organ threatening disease in the kidneys, CVS, and 
hematopoetic systems.  Many of the therapeutics are less than optimal therapies particularly for young women because of their long term safety profiles.  For example, long term corticosteroid 
use can lead to hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis, and infection risk, whereas 
cyclophosphamide may lead to sterility and bladder cancer.  Only one new therapy  for SLE , 
belimumab, has been approved in over 50 years . 
Therefore, there is a need for more targeted agents to control the disease long -term.  Because of 
the presumed role of B cells in SLE, the effect of a B cell in hibitor  might provide a more 
long-term solution to disease control.  
1.2.  Non-Clinical Studies  
1.2.1. Pharmacology of XmAb5871 
1.2.1.1. In Vitro Pharmacology  
XmAb5871 has two key functional attributes ; binding to human CD19 (hCD19) and binding to 
human FcγRIIb.  The EC 50 of binding of XmAb5871 to an hCD19 expressing cell line (Ramos) 
is 0.3 nM.  The EC 50 of binding to  human primary B cells is 1.4 nM when measured under 
similar assay conditions.   Human B cells express both CD19 and Fc γRIIb, so the EC 50 of 1.4 nM 
represents the avidity of XmAb5871 for the human B cell surface.  The affinity of XmAb5871 to 
cynomolgus monkey (the relevant toxicology species) CD19 is approximately 6 fold lower than 
Xencor, Inc.  
Protocol Number XmAb5871 -04 Clinical Study Protocol V 2.0 dated 29 July 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 35 of 132 29 July 2016  
 its affinity for human CD19.  No appreciable XmAb5871 binding was detected  with B cells from 
mouse, rat, rabbit, or dog.  
The second functional attribute important for the pharm acology of XmAb5871 is the enhanced 
binding to FcγRIIb relative to binding to other FcγRs.  FcγRs , expressed on a wide variety of 
immune cells , bind to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to mediate a range of 
immunological functions.   FcγRI (CD64), F cγRIIa (CD32a), and FcγRIIIa (CD16a) are all 
activating receptors that signal through the intracellular immunoreceptor, known as tyrosine 
based activation motif (ITAM) .  In contrast,  FcγRIIb (CD32b) signals via the immunoreceptor 
tyrosine based inhibitory motif (ITIM) leading to the down- regulat ion of  immune responses.  
The affinity of XmAb5871 for human FcγRIIb is approximately 8 nM, representing an increase 
of approximately 225- fold relative to human native IgG1.  The binding affinity of XmAb5871 
for the human activating FcγRs is reduced or unchanged except for one allele of a commonly occurring polymorphism in FcγRIIa , the R131 allele .  The affinity of XmAb5871 for the R131 
allele of the activating receptor FcγRIIa (~3 nM) is increased over 150 -fold relat ive to native 
IgG1.  In contrast, a slight decrease in affinity was observed for the H131 allele of FcγRIIa, 
implicating the arginine at position 131 as a key amino acid residue for the capacity of the XmAb5871 Fc to bind to FcγRIIb with increased affinity .  FcγRIIb contains an arginine residue 
at the analogous amino acid position and there are no known polymorphisms at this amino acid position in human FcγRIIb.  
The binding affinities of XmAb5871 to activating FcγRs in human and cynomolgus monkey  
were similar.  However, the significant increase in affinity for the human inhibitory receptor 
FcγRIIb was not observed with the analogous cynomolgus monkey inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb (250 fold less) .  This is probably  due to the absence of an arginine am ino acid residue at position 
131 in the  FcγRIIb  of cynomolgus monkey.  
XmAb5871 inhibits B cell activation by binding to CD19 and FcγRIIb simultaneously.  The 
co-engagement of these 2 receptors is the presumed mechanism by which excess antigen -
antibody complexes down -regulate B cell activity.  In vitro co- engagement of CD19 and FcγRIIb 
by XmAb5871 was shown to inhibit BCR induced calcium release in human B cells.  The effect 
is dependent on both CD19 and FcγRIIb binding and cannot be mimicked by control anti bodies 
that bind to only one of these targets or the other.  Similarly, control antibodies directed against the two targets individually are ineffective in down- regulating B cell activity, even if such 
antibodies were used in combination.

 Because FcγRIIb h as been shown to be d ysregulated  in SLE patients ( Mackay  et al, 2006) , 
B cells from SLE donors were studied in vitro to determine whether they would respond to 
XmAb5871 in a  similar fashion to normal healthy volunteers.  As with the normal B cells, 
XmAb5871 was able to stimulate Fc γRIIb and suppress BCR -induced calcium mobilization, 
B cell proliferation and expression of costimulatory molecules  (CD86)  on SLE -derived B cells.  
In addition, B cell proliferation induced by any of the B cell stimuli LPS, IL -4, and BAFF was 
suppressed by Xm Ab5871 in SLE B cells, just as in normal ( Horton et al 2011).  This suggests 
that even though SLE patients may have less expression of FcγRIIb, their cells are still able to 
respond to Xm Ab5871.

In vivo, XmAb5871 inhibits human B cell function in a model of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.  In 
these studies , engrafted human B cell response to a n in vivo tetanus toxoid antigen  challenge can 
be blocked by XmAb5871.  Tetanus toxoid- specific human IgG production was inhibited by 
XmAb5871, whereas negative control antibodies (e.g., those that bind human CD19 but not human FcγRIIb) did not differ from buffer alone.  These studies sh ow an inhibitory effect on 
specific B cell activation by XmAb5871.  
A murine pharmacology model was also developed in which the murine Fc receptor gene was removed and the human FcγRIIb gene inserted.  These transgenic mice were then used to 
demonstrate the  protective effect of a surrogate antibody that recognizes human FcγRIIb and 
murine CD19 in a collagen -induced arthritis (CIA) model of polyarticular disease.  Treatment 
with the surrogate antibody successfully blocked both the incidence and severity of the disease (for more details, see Investigator Brochure).  
1.2.2. Secondary Pharmacology: Off Target Receptor Binding Studies  
Although the binding affinity of XmAb5871 for FcγRIIb is approximately 225 fold increased,  
the binding affinity to the activating receptor FcγRIIIa , involved in antibody -dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) by NK cells , was reduced approximately 20- fold relative to 
native human IgG1 Fc  (Chu et al 2008) .  ADCC -mediated killing of B cells is an important 
mechanism of depletion of mature B cell populations in humans by the anti -CD20 mAb 
rituximab  (Reff et al 1994 ).  In ex vivo human PBMC cultures, XmAb5871 did not stimulate 
B cell depletion, while 2 known depleting antibodies, rituximab (anti -CD20 ; Reff et al 1994 ) and 
XmAb5574 (an anti -CD19 antibody with the Fc engineered to enhance FcγRIIIa binding ; Horton  
et al 2008)  depleted B  cells in a dose -depen dent manner.

Page 37 of 132 29 July 2016  FcγRIIa , a low affinity, activating FcγR present on human platelets and myeloid cells 
(monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages) , is important in macrophage mediated antibody -
dependent cell -mediated phagocytosis (ADCP).  Two alleles of the gen e encoding FcγRIIa 
generate 2 variants differing at amino acid position 131.  The histidine ( H131) and arginine 
(R131) alleles are reported to be roughly equally distributed with some ethnic variation.  The 
affinity of XmAb5871 for FcγRIIa R131 is increased 150- fold relative to that of wild type IgG1 
binding , but the  affinity for the H131 allotype is slightly decreased relative to IgG1.  Potential 
implications of this increased binding to FcγRIIa R131 (i.e., ADCP) were e xamined in vitro.  In 
vitro phagocytosis experiments demonstrate that monocyte -derived macrophages from R131 
positive donors will, in the presence of XmAb5871, phagocytose Ramos cells (CD19+ B cell 
line) and purified human B cells.  Very little phagocytosis was observed with monocyte -derived 
macrophages from H131 homozygous donors , but  these observations raise the possibility of 
B cell reduction or depletion in R131 positive patients.  However, neither data from the 
first-in-human (FIH) study in healthy volunteers nor data from the multiple ascending dose study 
in RA patients have shown an association of the presence of the R131 allele with the extent of B 
cell count reduction following dosing with XmAb5871. 
In the human FcγRIIb transgenic mouse model, a surrogate antibody that recognizes human 
FcγRIIb and murine CD19 did not cause B cell depletion.  A small reduction in B cell count was 
observed possibly due to inhibition of BCR -mediated proliferation signals.   Interestingly, the 
surrogate antibody did produce B cell depletion in the same strain of mice lacking the human 
FcγRIIb transgene, suggesting that the presence of human FcγRIIb may be protective against B cell depletion mediated by activating FcRs.  
FcγRIIa is the sole FcγR expressed on human platelets .  C ross-linking of FcγRIIa by 
platelet -antigen associated immune complexes has been demonstrated to fully activate platelets 
for secretion and aggregation.  While neither CD19 nor FcγRIIb are platelet -associated antigens, 
the potential for platelet interac tion was evaluated.  In an ex vivo study, the addition of 
XmAb5871 to samples from human donors did not induce platelet activation.  Additionally, in 
the completed human studies in healthy subjects and in RA patients, no changes in platelet count were observed. 
Whole blood assays were also used to monitor for possible cytokine release in response to 
XmAb5871.  No XmAb5871- mediated release of TNF -α or interferon γ (IFN -γ) was observed . 
In the completed FIH single ascending dose study, there were no signs or  symptoms consistent 
with cytokine release syndrome or immunologically mediated infusion- related  reactions.  In the 
Phase 2a study in RA patients, two of 40 patient s (5%) experienced an infusion- related  reaction

 with hypotension, both at a dose of 10.0 mg/kg.   One occurred at the time of the first infusion 
and the other during the second infusion.  It is possible the infusion- related  reactions were 
mediated by cytokine release.  
1.2.3. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Toxicology of XmAb5871  
The cynomolgus monke y was found to be the single most relevant common toxicology species 
based on flow cytometric analysis of XmAb5871 binding to lymphocytes  from different species .  
XmAb5871 cross reacted with B cells from cynomolgus monkey but failed to bind to cells from 
mouse, rat, rabbit or dog.  Human and cynomolgus monkey binding affinities were similar for 
most of the FcγRs, however, the binding affinity to FcγRIIb of the cynomolgus monkey was 
approximately 250 -fold less strong than that  observed for the corresponding human receptor.   
However ex vivo studies  have confirmed that FcγRIIb was engaged by XmAb5871 on 
cynomolgus monkey B cells and was capable of inducing pharmacologically measurable consequences despite the 250- fold lower FcγRIIb binding affinity.  
1.2.3.1. Tissue Cros s-Reactivity Studies  
The CD19 antigen is restricted to B cell lineages  (Nadler  et al 1983, Meeker  et al 1984) .  In a 
cross -reactivity study with a normal human tissue panel, fluorescein -XmAb5871 stained 
mononuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes which were judged to be B cells based on their morphology and/or localization.  Some staining (weak to m oderate) was noted in a variety of 
human cell types which are presumed not to express CD19.  The staining in these tissues was 
often observable only at the higher concentration of antibody tested and not observed in the analogous monkey tissues.  The tissu es include Kupffer cells and endothelium of the liver. 
Endothelium, Hofbauer cells and spindloid cells of placental sections and spindloid cells and Leydig cells of the testes showed weak to moderate staining.  
A companion study with cynomolgus monkey tissues also stained mononuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes and bone marrow precursor cells judged to be of B  cell origin.  No other binding 
was observed in the monkey tissues.  
1.2.3.2. Non-GLP and GLP Toxicology Studies in Cynomolgus Monkey  
In an exploratory non- good laboratory practice (GLP) PK /toxicity study in 12 cynomolgus 
monkeys (two/gender/group), XmAb5871 or vehicle was administered as a single 1 hour IV 
infusion at doses of 3 or 30 mg/kg.  Necropsies were performed in 6  monkeys (1 of each sex per 
group) o n study days 30 and 92.  There were no mortalities and single IV administration of 
XmAb5871 in cynomolgus monkey was tolerated  well at both 3 and 30 mg/kg .  There were no 
test article -related changes identified in clinical observations, food consumption, body weights, 
hematology, serum chemistry, gross or microscopic anatomical pathology parameters.

 A GLP 12 -week repeat -dose toxic ity study was completed in cynomolgus monkeys of both 
genders.  XmAb5871 was administered via a one hour IV infusion at doses of  0, 2, 10 or 
50 mg/kg on an ever y other week  × 6 dosing regimen.  Exposure of cynomolgus monkeys to 
6 administrations of XmAb5871 at 14- day intervals was well -tolerated, with all animals 
surviving to scheduled sacrifice.  No test article -related changes were observed in clinical 
observations, food consumption, body weight, electrocardiography, ophthalmology, hematology, 
serum chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, organ weight, gross observations, or histopathology.  
Dose -dependent decreases in the mean absolu te and relative B cell (CD3 -CD20+) counts were 
observed, relative to baseline levels, on Days 15 and 43; however , recovery of B cell counts to at 
least 75% of baseline occurred during the dosing period for all groups.  The reduction in B cell 
count to less  than 75% of baseline levels (Day - 1) did not occur at any time during dosing for the 
2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg groups.  In the 50 mg/kg group, the B cell count was reduced to 
approximately 45% of baseline on Day 15 (pre -dose infusion #2) and Day 43 (pre -dose infusion 
#4) and recovered to within 75% of baseline counts on Day 71 (pre -dose infusion #6).  No test 
article -effects were noted in T lymphocyte counts or total lymphocyte counts, and no 
microscopic changes were observed in lymphoid tissues.  Because no related effects were 
observed in other endpoints, these changes were not considered to be adverse. 
ADA were detected in animals during the dosing period only in the two lowest dose groups, 
eight in the 2 mg/kg group, and two in the 10 m/kg group.  
A 6-month GLP pharmacokinetic/toxicity study has also been performed  in the cynomolgus 
monkey .  Animals of both sexes were dosed IV with XmAb5871 or vehicle control every other 
week for a total of 13 doses at 0, 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg.  No mortalities occurred in the study and 
no test article -related effects were identified in  clinical observations, body weight, 
electrocardiography and ophthalmology  assessments, urinalysis, hematology, serum chemistry 
and coagulation parameters, and gross and microscopic anatomic evalu ations .  Test 
article -related effects were limited to dose -related reductions in B cells (CD3 -CD20+) observed 
from Day 15 through Day 183.  At all doses, the reduction observed after the first dose was 
maintained throughout the dosing period with no notabl e further reduction with subsequent 
doses.  The B cell count was reduced to approximately 45 -50%, 30 -35% and 25- 30% of baseline 
values in the 10 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg groups.  At all doses, evidence of recovery was 
observed by Day 281 (3 months aft er the last infusion) with levels recovering to within 80% of 
baseline levels by the end of the study (Day 358).  These effects were considered not adverse as 
no related changes  were observed in other endpoints.

 In summary, no adverse test article- related effects have been seen in cynomolgus monkeys 
following IV infusions of up to 200 mg/kg XmAb5871 every 14 days for up to 6 months.  These 
studies therefore identified a no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 200 mg/kg, the 
highest dose studied.  A de tailed description of the non- clinical studies is presented in the 
XmAb5871 Investigator’s Brochure .  
1.3. Clinical Studies  
A FIH, single ascending dose study with XmAb5871 (XmAb5871- 01) in healthy volunteers and 
a multiple ascending dose study in RA patients ( XmAb5871- 02) have been completed.  
1.3.1. A Randomised, Blinded, Placebo -Controlled, Single Ascending Dose Study of the 
Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of XmAb®5871 in Healthy Adult 
Volunteers  
In the FIH study, 48 healthy male subjects were enrolled and  were randomized 3:1 
(XmAb5871:placebo) to receive a single IV infusion of XmAb5871 or matching placebo 
administered over a 2 hour period in a double -blinded manner.  Thirty -six subjects received 
single IV infusions of XmAb5871 at 0.03 mg/kg (N=3) , 0.1 mg/kg (N=3) , 0.2 mg/kg (N=7) , 
0.6 mg/kg (N=6) , 2.0 mg/kg (N=6), 5.0 mg/kg  (N=6) and 10.0 mg/kg  (N=5)  dose levels . Twelve  
subjects received placebo.  All  completed the study . 
XmAb5871 was moderately well tolerated at the doses investigated.  No subjects exp erienced a 
serious adverse event (SAE) or dose limiting toxicity and no subjects discontinued the study 
prematurely.  A total of 32/36 XmAb5871 subjects (88.9%) reported at least 1 
treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) .  The percentage of subjects who ex perienced TEAEs 
in the active group was  similar to that of the subject s in the placebo group (11/12 subjects 
[91.7%]).  The most common TEAEs were gastrointestinal -related : nausea, vomiting, abdominal 
pain, abdominal discomfort, epigastric discomfort and diarrhea.  Such gastrointestinal -related  
TEAEs  were reported by 14/36 XmAb5871 subjects (38.9%) , but  no placebo subjects.  
Symptoms were assessed as mild or moderate in severity  in all except one subject, a subject in 
the 10.0 mg/kg cohort , who reported nausea of severe intensity .  Eight subjects (22%), at doses 
of 0.2 to 10.0 mg/kg, had their XmAb5871 IV infusion temporarily interrupted as a result of the 
infusion- related gastrointestinal symptoms; all subjects were able to continue the infusion after a 
short interruption and symptoms did not recur.  No concomitant medication was required for 
relief of symptoms.  There were no consistent trends in hematology, coagulation, c linical 
chemistry, immunoglobulin levels, electrocardiogram (ECG), or vital sign parameters reported.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that serum concentrations of XmAb5871 increased in an approximately dose proportional manner and declined in an apparent mono- phasic manner.

 Clearance decreased with increasing dose approaching a constant value at the hi gher dose levels.  
Volume of distribution decreased with dose increment approaching a value that was similar to 
physiologic serum volume.  Half-life tended to increase with dose but was relatively constant at 
the four highe st dose levels , averag ing 3.63 +/ - 1.24 days.   Circulating B cell CD19 was 
completely saturated at all dose levels and there was a strong relationship between dose and time to CD19 desaturation . 
Sixteen of 36 (44%) XmAb5871 treated subjects had at least one sample positive for ADA.  
There was no distinct evidence of ADA mediated clearance of XmAb5871 in any ADA positive 
subject other than one subject  (5 mg/kg)  in wh om an accelerated decline in XmAb5871 
concentration was observed in the terminal portion of the concentration time curve .  All positive 
ADA samples were negative in a bioassay to detect neutralizing antibodies against XmAb5871.  
A dose-related reduction of CD20+ B cell count follow ed XmAb5871 administration.  The nadir 
mean CD20+ B cell counts of roughly 40% to 50% of baseline cell coun ts occurred between 
approximately Day  4 and Day 8.  The degree  of the CD20+ B cell count reduction at nadir did 
not significantly increase as dose of XmAb5871 increased.  The recovery of the B cell count 
approximated the observed kinetics of XmAb5871 clearance.  There was no association observed 
between the presence of the Fcγ RIIa R131 polymorphic allele and the CD20+ B cell count at 
nadir.   
Expression of CD86 on B cells is induced by a signaling pathway event downstream of the BCR.  At all doses evaluated , XmAb5871 suppressed the expression of CD86 in ex vivo stimulated 
B cells.  This observation is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of XmAb5871; 
namely, down- regulation of the BCR signaling pathway.   XmAb5871 also attenuated the mean  
anti-tetanus toxoid (TT) response in subjects after a single administration at doses of ≥0.2 mg/kg.  
Additional information on the FIH study can be found in the Investigator Brochure.  
1.3.2. A Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Double -Blinded, Ascending Multiple -Dose 
Study of the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of 
XmAb
®5871 in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis  
A randomized, double -blinded, ascending multiple -dose Phase 2a study has also been completed 
using investigational sites in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia  and the Czech Republic.  This study 
enrolled RA patients who had active disease on stable non- biologic disease modifying anti -
rheumatic drug  (DMARD)  therapy .  The completed Phase 2a study was enrolled in two parts:

 • Part A adminis tered doses of XmAb5871 at 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 or 10.0 mg/kg or matching 
placebo ( 3:1 randomization) by a 2 -hour infusion for up to 6 consecutive doses given at 
2 week intervals.   
• Part B was an extension cohort of 10.0 mg/kg or placebo (2:1 randomization) given up to 
6 times at 2 week intervals.   
A total of 57 RA patients (41 XmAb5871, 16 placebo) were enrolled in the study, 30 in Part A 
and 27 in Part B.  One patient  randomized to Xm Ab5871 discontinued the study before being 
dosed.  Twenty -two patients receive d XmAb5871 in Part A .  Three  patients received 6 doses of 
0.3 mg/kg XmAb5871, 6 patients at each dose level received 6 doses of 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg and one additional patient received 2 doses of 10.0  mg/kg before discontinuing the study.   
In Part B, 15 patient s received 6 doses of 10.0 mg/kg XmAb5871 and 3 patient s received 1 -3 
doses each before discontinuing the study.  Across the study, a total of 223 doses of active drug were administered, of which 2 were partial infusions that were not completed.   
XmAb5871 was generally  well tolerated at doses investigated.  A total of 103 TEAEs were 
reported in 30/40 (75.0%) of the XmAb5871- treated patient s.  Of these,  49 of the 103  (47.6%) 
were regarded as unrelated or unlikely to be related to administration of XmAb5871.  As seen in 
the FIH study, the most common treatment- related AEs in the XmAb5871 groups were nausea, 
vomiting and diarrhea that occurred during the first infusion in 10 of the 40 XmAb5871- treated 
patients  (25%).  The gastrointestinal symptoms were generally  mild to moderate, with vomiting 
of severe intensity reported by only one  patient  (10.0 mg/kg XmAb5871).  Nine patients  (23%) 
had their first XmAb5871 IV infusion temporarily interrupted as a result of the infusion- related 
gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting /nausea or diarrhea).  Seven  of the 9 (78%) occurred in the 
10.0 mg/kg cohort.  In all cases the patient s were able to continue the infusion after a short 
interruption (5-31 minutes) and symptoms did not generally recur on continuation of the infusion 
or during subsequent infusions.  There were no consistent trends in hematology, coagulation, 
clinical chemistry, immunoglobulin levels, electrocardiogram (ECG), or vital sign parameters reported.  
A total of 2 XmAb5871 treatment -emergent SAEs in 2 patients were reported during the phase 
2a study, both in the 10.0  mg/kg XmAb5871 group.  One case of lower extremity deep venous 
thrombosis occurred during the follow -up period, 22 days after the last infusion.  The SAE was 
considered to be possibly related to XmAb5871 by the investigator, but because the onset of the 
event occurred more than 6 half-lives after the las t infusion, the Sponsor considered the event 
unlikely to be related to XmAb5871.  The other SAE was a case of infusion- related reaction that

 occurred at the time of the second  infusion of XmAb5871 and was assessed to be definitely 
related to the administration of XmAb5871 by the investigator.  A second patient also 
experienced an infusion -related reaction with hyp otension (non- SAE)  of moderate severity 
during the first  infusion.  Both were on the 10.0  mg/kg dose and were discontinued from the 
study.  The nature and severity of these infusion- related  reactions were consistent with those 
reported for other monoclonal  antibody therapies.  
Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that serum concentrations of XmAb5871 decreased in an apparent mono- phasic manner over time.  C
max for the first and last dose increased in a slightly 
greater than proportional manner with dose  while the AUC for the first and last dose increased in 
a manner proportional with dose increment.  At the dose levels studied, neither clearance nor volume of distribution showed any significant dose dependence, either for the first or last dose.  
There was li ttle accumulation between the first and last doses  with the every 14 -day dosing 
interval.  
Across all 4 dose levels, last dose clearance averaged 15.16 ± 3.68 mL/day/kg.  Last dose 
volume of distribution averaged 49.27 ± 14.17 mL/kg .  This figure is close to the literature value 
for physiological serum volume.  Last dose half -life averaged 3.51 ± 1.06 days.  
There was no statistically significant difference in clearance or volume of distribution between 
any of the receptor alleles for either FcγRIIa or FcγR IIb. 
Complete CD19 receptor occupancy was seen at doses of 1 .0, 3.0, and 10.0 mg/kg from first 
dose through the completion of dosing.  Peripheral B cell count decreased in all cohorts following the first dose , with cohort mean level s of approximately 52-79% of baseline.  The 
level of reduction did not increase with increasing dose or with subsequent doses and recover ed 
to a mean cohort level of ≥ 80% of baseline levels during the post -treatment period . 
Samples positive for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were found in 7 of 40 (17.5%) XmAb5871 -
treated patients and in 1 of 16 (6.25%)  placebo -treated patient s.  With the exception of the 
placebo -treated patient, all of the ADA were observed in the 10 .0 mg/kg group.  Only 2 of the 
7 patients had positive ADA samples t hat remained positive after a >2 -fold dilution (i.e., the 
majority were of low titer).  One of these 2 patients experienced apparent hypersensitivity 
reactions with vomiting, fever and chills during the second infusion and vomiting, fever, and erythema dur ing the third infusion.  This was associated with the development of an ADA 
response  with titer s that increased over time.  There was no distinct evidence of ADA mediated 
clearance of XmAb5871 in any A DA positive patient .

 In Part B  of the study , more patient s treated with XmAb5871 (10.0 mg/kg) achieved 
DAS28 -CRP low disease or remission at Day 85 than did the placebo treated patient s (5/15 vs 
0/8; 33% vs 0%).  In addition, 40% (6/15) of the XmAb5871 treated patients achieved an ACR50 
and 20% (3/15) achieved an ACR70 .  By comparison, 12.5% (1/8) and 0%  (0/8)  of the placebo -
treated patient s achieved ACR50 and ACR70 responses, respectively .  
The Sponsor will immediately notify the Principal Investigator s if any additional safety or 
toxicology information becomes available during the study.  A detailed description of the 
completed clinical studies is presented in the XmAb5871 Investigator’s Brochure . 
1.4. Rationale for the Clinical Study  
Although glucocorticoids are effective in SLE, long term use of these agents  is not optimal and 
disease exacerbations are common as the therapy is tapered.  There is a clear need for ongoing development of new drugs with different modes of action, different pathways, improved safety profiles and quality of life benefits.  Therapy to reduce B cell proliferation by depleting a needed 
growth factor, BAFF or BLyS, (belimumab) has been licensed as a therapy for SLE and it stands to reason that other therapies directed at B cell function by a different mechanism of action may also be shown to be efficacious , potentially even in non- overlapping subsets of patients .  
FcγRIIb has been shown to play a crucial role in suppressing autoimmunity.  For example, 
autoimmune disease is exacerbated in mice lacking FcγRIIb  (Nimme rjahn  et al, 2008) , and its 
restoration rescues mice in SLE, arthritis, and asthma models  (Brownlie  et al 2008, Dharajiya  et 
al 2010, McGaha  et al 2005) .  Moreover, FcγRIIb polymorphisms affecting activity or 
expression are associated with human autoimmunity  (Floto  et al 2005, Tsuchiya  et al 2006, 
Tarasenko  et al 2007 ) and B cell expression of FcγRIIb is dysregulated in SLE (Mackay  et al 
2006) .  Despite the dysregulation of Fc γRIIb in SLE, XmAb5871 was able to inhibit human SLE 
B cells in vitro ( Horton  et al 2011).  The presumed role of B cells and plasmablasts in SLE  and 
the observations of beneficial effect s on SLE disease activity by B cell directed therap ies support 
the evaluation of non- depleting B cell directed therapies such as XmAb587 1 in patients with 
SLE.  The proposed dose and dosing regimen is based on available data from the non- clinical 
pharmacology and toxicology studies and available data from the completed human studies.  
The GLP 6 -month, repeat -dose toxicity study in cynomolg us monkeys consisted of 13 infusions 
administered every other week, a dosing schedule and duration matching that of the proposed pilot study of XmAb5871 in human patients with SLE .  The maximum dose administered and the 
NOAEL in the cynomolgus monkey study  was 200 mg/kg. XmAb5871 was generally  well-
tolerated when given at doses up to 10.0  mg/kg every other week for 6 doses in patients with RA

 (see above), and there was no evidence of any cumulative toxicity over the 6 doses.  Complete 
CD19 receptor occupanc y was observed in the repeat dose RA study at doses of 1.0, 3.0, and 
10.0 mg/kg from first dose through the completion of dosing.  Trends in improvement in RA 
clinical disease activity were seen at all doses, particularly at 3 .0 and 10.0  mg/kg.   Based on the 
observed safety and tolerability profile, the effects on CD19 receptor occupancy and effects on disease activity in the RA trial, a dose of 5 mg/kg has been selected for this study.  
1.4.1. Risk-Benefit Assessment  
The risks and benefits for the use  of XmAb5871 are currently assessed by the available 
non-clinical data and the information from the completed human studies.  The preclinical data to 
date indicate that XmAb5871 was well tolerated in the cynomolgus monkey, the most relevant single toxicolo gy species.  Both 12- week and 6 -month repeat dose GLP toxicity evaluations have 
been performed in cynomolgus monkey.  No deaths  occurred and no test article- related effects 
were identified in clinical observations, body weight, electrocardiography and opht halmology 
assessments, urinalysis, hematology, serum chemistry and coagulation parameters, or in 
anatomic evaluations  (gross and microscopic ).  At doses up to 200 mg/kg in the 6 -month study, 
mean absolute and relative counts of B lymphocytes were observed to be decreased, relative to baseline levels, in a dose -related manner . B cell counts demonstrated recovery at day 281, and 
this recovery was sustained at day 358.  
The differences between the binding affinities for XmAb5871 to human and cynomolgus 
monkey FcγRs should be considered in light of the toxicology results.  The affinity of 
XmAb5871 for cynomolgus monkey FcγRIIb is approximately 250- fold less than that for human 
FcγRIIb .  Although the desired pharmacologic effect  was observed in cynomolgus monkey (i.e., 
down- regulation of BCR mediated B cell signaling ), target -mediated toxicity may be  more 
difficult to observe in the cynomolgus monkey than in humans.  No significant toxicities have 
been observed in either of the two completed human studies, suggest ing that the toxicology 
species is informative.  
The observed reduction in absolute B cell count  in both the human studies may have occur red 
from the result of redistribution of B cells from the circulation to central compartments, from direct anti -proliferative effect of CD19 engagement or from the inhibition of the B cell pro -
survival effects induced by BCR signaling.  These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.  
B cell counts can be m onitored readily in clinical laboratories and the safety impact of even a 
substantial B cell reduction is considered minimal given the degree to which complete B cell depletion with rituximab is tolerated.  The toxicity and pharmacologic action of B cell depletion 
is now understood well from years of cl inical experience with primary B cell depleting agents

 such as rituximab .  Both the toxicology and human studies of XmAb5871 have indicated the 
reductions in B cell concentration are reversible following discontinuation of the study drug.  
Both clinical studies completed to date have been randomized, double -blinded, placebo 
control led studies with a primary endpoint of safety and t olerability .  Therefore , the clinica l 
benefit of XmAb5871 has not bee n established.  The Phase 2a trial in RA was not powered for 
efficacy, but trends in improvement in RA disease activity among the XmAb5871- treated 
patients compared to those treated with placebo were observed.  
1.4.2. Potential Risks  
Based on preclinical toxicology studies , experience in human studies to date  and class ef fects of 
immunomodulating monoclonal antibodies , patient s rece iving XmAb5871 may be at risk for the 
following adverse events : 
1.4.2.1. Infusion -Related  Reactions  
All monoclonal antibody therapeutics are associated with the risk of both allergic 
(hypersensitivity) and non- allergic (cytokine release syndrome) infusion- related  reactions.  Most 
infusion- related  reactions are mild and may be alleviated by interruption of the infusion and 
reinitiating the infusion at a slower infusion rate after symptoms abate.  
No signs  or symptoms of infusion- related reaction were observed in the FIH study.  In the 
multiple dose Phase 2a study, two patient s, both of whom had received XmAb5871 at 
10.0 mg/kg, experienced infusion- related reactions with hypotension and were discontinued fr om 
the study.  The first patient experienced a severe infusion -related reaction on the second infusion; 
the second patient’s infusion- related reaction was considered moderate and occurred during the 
first infusion.  In both cases, the infusion was stopped and symptomatic therapy given.  The 
symptoms responded quickly and there were no sequelae.  The nature and severity of the 
infusion reactions were consistent with those reported for other monoclonal antibody therapies.  In addition, a third patient developed signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction during the second and third infusions, associated with the development of ADA prior to the second infusion with increasing titers thereafter.  This patient was also discontinued from the study and 
also r ecovered without sequelae.  
Although observed rarely, s evere infusion- related reactions, including deaths following the 
administration of otherwise well- tolerated monoclonal antibodies, have been reported.  Patients  
should be closely monitored during and af ter all infusions, as specified in the study protocol.  In 
the case of an infusion reaction, the infusion should be stopped immediately  and the patient 
managed as per the treatment guidelines listed in Section 6.1.2.3.6.

 All investigators should be well trained in the management of acute infusion -related events 
including administration of epinephrine and other therapeutic modalities.  Emergency 
resuscitation equipment and medications should be present for immediate use in the area where 
patients are receiving their infusions.   
Patients should be monitored closely during and after infusion.  XmAb5871 should be 
administered intravenously at a constant rate over a 2 hour period for the first infusion and over a 
1-2 hour  perio d for subsequent infusions .  Patients will be continuously assessed during the 
infusion and for at least 1 hour following the end of infusion (2 hours following  the first 
infusion) .  During the first infusion, vital signs including blood pressure, heart ra te, respiratory 
rate and temperature assessments will be performed  within 2 hours before the  infusion, at 15, 30, 
60 and 120 minutes after the start of infusion, and at the end of infusion (if different than 
120 minutes from start of infusion) .  In addition, vital signs will be performed  15, 30, 60 and 
120 minutes after the end of the first infusion.  The frequency of vital sign monitoring will be modified at subsequent infusions if the first 
infusion is tolerated well.  A t all subsequent infusions , vital signs will be assessed within 2 hours 
before the infusion, at 30  and 60 minutes after the start of infusion, at the end of infusion (if 
different than 60  minutes from start of infusion) , and at  30 and 60 minutes after end of the 
infusion. 
1.4.2.2. Infusion -Associat ed Gastrointestinal -Related  Toxicity 
The most common XmAb5871 AEs reported in both clinical studies h ave been the occur rence of 
nause a, vomiting, or diarrhea during the first XmAb5871 infusion.  In the FIH  study, 8 subject s 
(over the dose range 0.2 mg/kg t o 10.0 mg/kg) had their XmAb5871 IV  infusion interrupted 
temporarily as a result of the self -limiting gastrointestinal- related  symptoms of short duration 
(abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, epigastric discomfort, nausea and vomiting).  In all cases , the subject s were able to continue the infusion after a short interruption (maximum total 
infusion duration was 2 hours and 54 minutes) and symptoms did not recur.  No concomitant 
medication was required for alleviation of symptoms.  
In the Phase 2a study, 9 patients  (23%) had their first XmAb5871 IV infusion temporarily 
interrupted as a result of the gastrointestinal- related  symptoms (nausea, vomiting or diarrhea).  
Seven  of the 9  (78%) occurred in the 10.0 mg/kg cohorts.  In all cases , the patients  were able to 
continue the infusion after a short interruption (5-31 minutes) and symptoms did not generally 
recur on continuation of the infusion or during subsequent infusions.  No concomitant 
medication was required for alleviation of symptoms.

 Page 48 of 132 29 July 2016  
 The etiology of th ese symptoms is not clear .  There are no known associations of CD19 or 
FcγRIIb and the gastrointestinal tract.  Mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or diarrhea may occur 
during the first infusion of XmAb5871 and should be treated by interrupting the infusion for 
15-30 minutes .  The infusion may be restarted at the original rate once symptoms have resolved.  
Medication for symptomatic relief may be administered if required.  
1.4.2.3. B-Cell Lymphopenia  
B cell lymphopenia, with no notable effect on the total lymphocyte count, was observed in both 
nonclinical toxicology and clinical studies.  In cynomolgus monkey, reductions in B cell levels 
were observed in the 2 repeat -dose GLP toxicology studies performed to date.  In both the 
12-week ( 6 infusions at doses up to 50 mg/kg) and 6- month (13 infusions at doses up to 200 
mg/kg) toxicology studies in which XmAb5871 was administered IV every 2 weeks, reductions 
in cohort mean B cell count were observed.  In the 12- week study, t he B cell count was reduced 
to approximately 45- 50%, 30- 35% and 25- 30% of baseline values in the 10 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg and 
200 mg/kg groups.  At all doses, evidence of recovery was observed by Day 281 (3 months after 
the last infusion) .   
As was the  case in nonclinical toxicology studies, in both clinical studies performed to date, 
reductions in absolute B cell counts were observed with mean reductions to 50- 60% of baseline 
levels and a maximum individual subject reduction to 22% of baseline.  In bot h studies, the 
reductions in ABC were not associated with the presence of the FcγRIIa R131 genotype and 
were not associated with clinical adverse events.  
The recovery of B cell counts after a single dose or multiple doses of XmAb5871 approximated 
the kine tics of the clearance of XmAb5871 from serum in the clinical studies.  Although 
prolonged reductions in B cell counts to the extent seen with B cell depleting therapies have not been observed and are not expected following administration of XmAb5871, B cel l depleting 
therapies have been widely used both in hematologic malignancies and in autoimmune disease states.   Toxicity and pharmacologic action of B cell depletion is well understood and is a 
manageable risk in humans .  Patients will be monitored with qu antitation of B cell counts during 
the trial.   
1.4.2.4. Infections  
XmAb5871 is an immunomodulating agent by virtue of its effect on down regulation of B cell function.  No severe or oppor tunistic infections have been observed in cynomolgus monkey 
toxicology studies  or in the XmAb5871 clinica l program to date, however all patients receiving 
any immunomodulating agent should be monitored for the development of infections , including  
those caused by bacterial, viral and fungal  pathogens .

 1.4.3. Potential Benefits  
The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of XmAb5871 to maintain 
improvement in SLE patients  following a brief course of disease- suppressing IM steroid therapy.  
Based on the effect of XmAb5871 on B cell function observed in in vitro  and in vivo  studies and 
on the trends in improvement in RA disease activity observed, some XmAb5871 treated patients may maintain the improvement in SLE disease activity induced by the brief course of IM steroid 
therapy for the 6 -month duration of the study and not need to have additional therapeutics added 
for disease exacerbation.  The study will use the SELENA SLEDAI  (hybrid version)  with the 
SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index , BILAG  (2004 version)  and Physician’s Global Assessment of 
disease activity  to evaluate the effect of XmAb5871 on disease activity over time . 
1.4.4. Conclusion  
XmAb5871 is being developed for the treatment of SLE, and a double -blind, randomized pilot 
efficacy trial is currently proposed.  Given the established role of B cells in the pathogenesis of 
SLE, the effects of XmAb5871 on B cell function in the absence of complete B cell depletion may provide an attractive therapeutic option for this condition. 
The trial design contains adequate measures to mitigate risk factors, and frequent safety 
monitoring is an i nherent part of the protocol.  In summary, the benefits and risk assessment for 
the application of XmAb5871 appears favorable and supportive for initiation of the proposed 
clinical trial.  
This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, Intern ational Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.  
Aspects of the study concerned with the investigational medicinal product(s) (IMPs) will meet the requirements of standard Good Manufacturing Pr actice (GMP).

o To evaluate the effect of XmAb5871 on autoantibody, complement and cytokine  
levels over time  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1. Overall Study Design and Plan  
This is a double blind, randomized multi ple dose pilot study to investigate the efficacy, safety, 
tolerability, PK, immunogenicity and PD of XmAb5871 in patients with SLE.   The study will be 
conducted in centers with expertise in evaluating patients with this disease.    
All patients  will receive 5.0 mg/kg of XmAb5871 or matched placebo over 1- 2 hours IV on an 
every other week dosing schedule for a total of up to 16 doses.  Patients  will be followed for 
6 weeks after the final infusion.  Approximately 90 patients will be enrolled with a 
1:1 randomization of XmAb5871:  placebo.  
Patients will enter screening  with moderate to severe, non-organ threatening , SLE activity 
defined as a SELENA  SLEDAI of ≥ 6 (≥4 points of which must come from non- serological 
findings) OR ≥1  BILAG B score OR ≥1  BILAG A score.  Patients must be able and willing to 
discontinue background immunosuppressive medications and receive a brief course of IM steroid  
therapy .  After obtaining informed consent, appropriate screening studies will be performed and 
160 mg of IM depomedrol will be administered .  Over the next 2- 4 weeks of the screening  
period, per PI discretion, patients may receive additional IM depomedrol injections (up to an 
additional 320 mg during screening) t o treat their SLE  symptoms to a target of disease 
improvement defined as a SELENA  SLEDAI decrease of ≥ 4 points or a decrease in BILAG of 
≥1 severity grade in at least one organ system that began with A or B (clinical criteria without 
requiring temporal criteria).  Immunosuppressive therapy will be stopped or tapered off over the 
2-4 week screening period.  Patients on anti -malarial ther apy may continue on their usual dose.  
Patients on oral doses of ≤ 15 mg of Prednisone per day (or the equivalent) will be tapered to

 10 mg or less per day by randomization (Day 1) and then may continue on this dose throughout  
the study .  Patients who do not meet the disease activity improvement criteria by Day 1 will not 
be randomized into the study and their participation will end. 
Patients must have documented SLE disease activity improvement following the brief course of 
IM steroid therapy to be randomized into the study on Day 1.  Those patients who  achieve the 
required disease activity improvement from the screening baseline will be randomized to receive 
either XmAb5871 (5 mg/kg) or placebo by IV administration (double -blinded) over 1- 2 hours 
every 2 weeks from Day 1 through Day 211 for a total of up to 16 infusions.  Disease activity 
(SELENA SLEDAI, BILAG) on Day 1 will be considered the baseline disease activity for 
determination of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint s.  On Day 1, baseline procedures 
such as physical exam, blood and urine samples for laboratory assessments, PK a nd PD samples 
will be collected and 80 mg of IM depomedrol will be given prior to administration of study 
drug.  The first infusion of either XmAb5871 or placebo will be given IV over a period of 
2 hours.  Patients will be observed for at least 2 hours aft er the completion of the  first study drug 
administration during which time safety assessments will be performed.   
All patients will return to the research facility on Day 8 for safety, PK and PD assessments.  On 
Day 15, patients will receive an additional  80 mg of IM depomedrol to sustain the disease 
activity improvement long enough for XmAb5871 to reach a steady state level.  On Day 15 and on study Days 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 183, 197, and 211 patients will 
return  for XmAb5871 (5  mg/kg) or placebo administration IV over 1 -2 hours and for safety, PK 
and PD assessments.  Patients will be required to remain at the study site for observation for at 
least 1 hour after the completion of each infusion.  
Patients will be followed for loss  of disease improvement (LOI) as defined by:  
I. The assessment by the principal investigator that the disease activity is appropriate for a n 
increase in therapy  (including addition of another lupus therapy, except for adjustments 
in NSAIDs ) AND  
II. There has been : 1) a SELENA  SLEDAI increase of ≥ 4 points from maximal 
improvement ; OR 2) a worsening of at least one BILAG A or B score;  OR 3) the 
appearance of a new A or B.   
Patients who meet the criteria for loss of disease activity improvement at any timepoint up to and 
including Day 211 will not receive further infusions of XmAb5871 or placebo, i.e., will be

 discontinued from the study, and may receive any appropriate SLE therapy at th e discretion 
of the principal investigator.   
Patients who discontinue the study early either because of loss of improvement or for other 
reasons will be followed for safety for a further period of 6 weeks after their last dose of 
XmAb5871 or placebo (compl eting assessments in schedule of events listed as Day 225 as the 
LOI visit and Day 253[EOS] visit  4 weeks later ) at which time their participation is completed.     
All patients completing the treatment period should be followed through D ay 253(EOS).  Patient 
participation is complete once EOS study procedures are performed.  All AE(s) (including 
serious AEs and deaths) and use of concomitant medication information will be collected 
throughout the study from screening through the EOS visit.  Patients develo ping treatment -
emergent AEs or clinically significant safety lab abnormalities will be followed until resolution or until the TEAEs/abnormalities are stabilized.  
The effect of XmAb5871 on maintenance of improvement of SLE disease activity will be 
evaluated as the percentage of patients without loss of improvement at Day 225  (primary 
endpoint) and Day 169 (secondary endpoint) . 
Assessments will include AE  assessment, physical examination, vital signs, ECG, clinical 
laboratory tests (hematology , clinical chemistry, B  cell and T cell levels, immunoglobulin levels, 
urinalysis, coagulation , PK, PD and immunogenicity.   
Pharmacodynamics of XmAb 5871 will be evaluated by serial measurements of CD19  receptor 
occupancy ( RO) and by enumeration of circulating B  cells and their subsets . 
FcγR polymorphisms will be assessed by FcγRIIa and FcγRIIb genotyping . 
Please refer to Table 6 Schedule of Assessments for a detailed list of procedures performed on 
each study day/visit .  
3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
In the previously completed Biomarkers of Lupus Disease ( BOLD ) study of SLE patients in 
whom a brief course of IM steroid therapy induced SLE disease activity improvement following the cessation of background immunosuppressant therapy, 40/41 patients lost the disease activity 
improvement by month 6, equivalent to a 2.4% placebo response.  Assuming a 10% placebo 
response rate will be observed in this study and assuming that XmAb5871 wi ll provide a 38 % 
response rate ( preventing loss of disease activity improvement ), the number of patient s needed 
for 80% power and 5% significance would be 40 per arm.  Adding approximately 10% for

 drop- outs, the total number per arm is calculated as 45.  The study is designed to obtain 
information on the ability  of XmAb5871 to maintain improvement of SLE  disease activity  after a 
brief course of IM steroid therapy.  S afety of XmAb5871 in SLE will also be evaluated .  
The protocol has been amended to change the time of the primary endpoint from 6 months to 8 
months to account for the more prolonged initial course of IM steroid therapy being given in this study relative to the BOLD study.  
3.3. Selection of Patient Population  
It is anticipated that approximately  90 SLE patients will be enrolled in the study.   Patients 
appropriate for screening will have active SLE without organ- threatening involvement, will be 
able and willing to discontinue their background ineffective immunosuppressive medications, and will be willing to receive a brief course of IM steroid therapy.  Those that achieve a protocol 
defined  level of disease activity improvement will be randomized to receive XmAb5871 or 
placebo and will be followed for the loss of the disease activity improvement effected by the IM 
steroid  therapy . 
3.4. Endpoints  
The study involves assessments of SLE disease activity, safety, immunogenicity, PK, PD and 
pharmacogenomics .  The specific endpoints are listed below.  
3.4.1. Disease Activity  
The pri mary endpoint will be evaluated as the percentage of patients without loss of disease 
activity improvement at Day 253.   The percentage of patients without loss of disease activity 
improvement on Day 169 and time to loss of disease activity improvement wil l be evaluated as 
secondary endpoint s.  In addition, the following disease assessment indices may  be used for 
exploratory analyses of SLE disease activity over time: 
• SELENA SLEDAI  hybrid version with SELENA SLEDAI Flare index  
• BILAG  2004  
• Physician’s Global Disease activity VAS  
3.4.2. Mechanistic Studies  
Blood will be collected and analyzed at Screening, Day 1, Day 29 and either at the first visit with 
loss of disease activity improvement (LOI)  or 2 weeks after the last infusion (Day 225), 
whichever comes first. The  following biomarkers will be explored: changes in autoantibody 
profiling by BioPlex 2200, multiplex evaluation of plasma cytokines , RNA expression to

 determine changes in selected BCR, BAFF and IL4 -mediated signaling responses , and a broader, 
more explora tory evaluation of cytokine and gene expression evaluated via hierarchical 
clustering and principal component analyses .  Samples will be collected and stored from 
additional visit days as given in Table 6 to be utilized for future evaluation of additional analytes 
as deemed appropriate from initial studies.   The results from these studies may be reported  
separately  from the clinical study report.  
3.4.3. Safety  Endpoints  
• Physical examinations  
• Vital signs (supine blood pressure [BP] , heart rate , oral body temperature, respiratory rate 
[RR])  (during the infusion of XmAb5871, vital signs will be obtained in the semi- supine 
sitting position)  
• Adverse event assessment s 
• Twelve- lead electrocardiograms (ECG): PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT 
interval, and QTc interval (Bazett’s correction [QTcB] and Fridericia’s correction 
[QTcF])  
• Clinical laboratory testing (hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urin alysis)  
• B cell and T cell quanti fication by flow cytometry  
• Concomitant medication assessments  
• Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)  levels (IgG, IgM , IgE ) 
• Complement levels C3 and C4 
• Monitoring for pregnancy in women of child- bearing potential  only  
3.4.4. Immunogenicity Endpoint  
• Frequency and titer of anti -XmAb5871 antibodies ( anti-drug antibodies [ ADA] ) 
3.4.5. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints  
Predose (trough) and end -of-infusion (peak) XmAb5871 serum concentrations will be measured 
on selected infusions , at the endpoint disease assessment  timepoint and at EOS .  No PK  
parameters will be computed because no extensive serial post -dose sampling will be done in this 
study.

 3.4.6. Pharmacodynamic Endpoints  
• Absolute B cell counts (ABC)   
• Autoantibody and cytokine levels  
3.4.7. Pharmacogenomics Endpoints  
• FcγRIIa  R131H polymorphism  
• FcγRIIb I232T polymorphism  
3.5. Stoppi ng Criteria  for the Clinical Study  
Participation  for any individual patient  will be stopped if the patient  experiences a possibly drug -
related serious adverse event (SAE) or a possibly drug -related signi ficant non serious AE, which 
in the opinion of the P I or Sponsor’s medical representative, warrants discontinuation of the 
study for that patient ’s well -being.   Discontinuation of the patient  from the study will be 
discussed with the Sponsor. 
The Investigator will make all appropriate safety assessments on an ongoing basis.  The 
Sponsor’s medical representative will review individual safety information as it becomes available throughout the study.  In addition, unblinded aggregate safety inform ation will be 
reviewed by an external Safety Review Committee (SRC) after approximately 15 patients have 
completed the study, and after approximately 45 and 75 patients have completed the study.  The 
SRC will consist of, at a minimum,  two rheumatologists w ith SLE expert ise and a biostatistician 
who will review the data in an unblinded manner.  T he coordinating investigator and the medical 
representatives of the Sponsor (Xencor) and the CRO (PPD)  will review blinded data  only. All 
patients in the study will receive appropriate SLE rescue therapy at the discretion of the principal 
investigator  and discontinue study drug infusions at the time of loss of disease activity 
improvement .   
3.6. Dose Delay and Dose Modification in Patient s Who Experience 
Toxicity  
Patient s experiencing a ≥Grade 2 drug -related hematologic or non- hematologic toxicity will have 
subsequent dosing held until recovery to baseline or ≤Grade 1 values following the AE .  Patient s 
who enter the study with pre -existing disease -related abnormalities of >Grade 1  will have 
subsequent dosing held if there is drug -related worsening to Grade 3 . Dose will be held until 
recovery to baseline or ≤Grade 1 values following the worsening.  
In the event that drug -related toxicity persists for >21 days or such that two  consecutive doses 
are missed, the patient  will be permanently discontinued from the study drug treatment.

 There will be no dose level modification in this study.   
4. STUDY POPULATION  
Patients eligible for screening are m en and women ages 18 to 65 inclus ive with active SLE , 
defined as a SELENA SLEDAI of ≥ 6 (≥4 points of which must come from non- serological 
findings) OR at least one BILAG A or B score . If a single BILAG B score is based on arthritis, 
there must be at least 3 tender and at least 3 swollen joints out of 28 joints counted.  If a single 
BILAG B score is based on rash, there must be involvement of at least 9% of body surface area 
for at least one week, or 5% of body surface area for discoid skin rash.  Patients  must be able to 
provide written informed consent and meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria.   They must be able and willing to stop their immunosuppressants and to be given a brief 
course of IM steroid  therapy .  In the judgment of the investigator, they must have non- organ 
threatening disease (e.g. there is no active nephritis requiring either ongoing induction or 
maintenance therapy, or any other solid organ, CNS or hematologic disorder for which stopping SLE therapy is contraindicated).   Only patients who  have protocol defined disease activity 
improvement by Day 1 will be randomized. 
4.1. Number of Patient s 
It is anticipated that approximately  90 patients will be enrolled in the study.  In a previously 
completed study of SLE patients in whom a brief course of I M steroid therapy induced SLE 
disease activity improvement following the cessation of background immunosuppressant therapy,  40/41 patients lost the disease activity improvement  by month 6;  equivalent to a 2.4% 
placebo response.   If we assume that XmAb5871 will provide a 38% response in preventing loss of disease activity improvement, the number of patient s needed for 80% power and 5% 
significance would be about 40 per arm.  Adding 10% for unevaluable patients , the total number 
per arm is calculated as 45.  
4.2. Inclusion Criteria 
Patients who meet the following criteria will be considered eligible to participate in the clinical 
study : 
1. Able to provide written informed consent. 
2. Adult males and females aged 18 to 65 years inclusive with a diagnosis of SLE as define d 
by the ACR Criteria (≥4 criteria fulfilled).  
3. Patient s have a history of a (+)  ANA, (+) ENA  (anti-RNP or anti -Smith) or a (+) anti-
dsDNA serology documented by laboratory report within the year prior to randomization.

4.4. Patient  Withdrawal and Replacement  
Patient s are encouraged to complete all study evaluations ; however, they may withdraw from the 
study at any time and for any reason.  Every effort will be made to determine why any patient  
withdraws from the study prematurely.  At the time that a patient withdrawals prematurely for any reason, all assessments as listed fo r the Day 225 visit should be performed.  In addition, the 
patient should be scheduled for a follow -up visit 6 weeks from the time of the last infusion of 
study drug, at which time all assessments as listed for the Day 253 (EOS) visit should be 
performed.  All patient s who withdraw from the study with an ongoing AE must be followed, if 
at all possible, until the event is resolved or deemed stable  by the investigator .   
Patient  participation may be terminated prior to completing the study and the reason reco rded as 
follows:  
1. Adverse event  
2. Protocol violation  
3. Loss to Follow -up 
4. Patient  withdrew consent

 Page 60 of 132 29 July 2016  
 5. Other  
A comprehensive  effort must be made to determine the reason(s) why a patient  fails to return for 
the necessary visits or is discontinued from the study.  If the patient  is unreachable by telephone, 
a registered letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the patient  requesting him/her to contact the 
study site .   
Patient s withdrawn due to AEs considered to have a possible relationship to study drug will not 
be replaced .  Patient s withdrawn for a non- drug related reason  will be replaced where the 
Sponsor deems necessary .  The decision regarding the replacement of patients will be 
documented . 
4.5. Termination of the Clinical Study  
If the Investigator  or the Sponsor  becomes aware of conditions or events that suggest a possible 
hazard to patient s if the clinical study  continues, then the clinical study  may be terminated after 
appropriate consultation among  the involved parties.  The clinical study  may be terminated at the 
Sponsor ’s discretion also in the absence of such a finding.  
Conditions that may warrant termination of the clinical study include, but are not limited to:  
• The discovery of an unexpected, relevant, or unacceptable risk to the patient s enrolled in 
the clinical study;  
• Failure to enrol l patient s at the required rate;  
• A decision of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the IMP.   
Should the study be terminated and/or a site be closed for any  reason, all documentation 
pertaining to the study  and IMP must be returned to the Sponsor.  An y actions required for  
assessing  or maintain ing study patient  safety will continue as required,  despite  termination of the 
study by the Sponsor.  
5. INVESTIGATIONAL MEDI CINAL PRODUCT  
5.1. Identity of the Investigational Medicinal Products  
XmAb 5871, the IMP, is an Fc engineered humanized mAb that binds to human CD19 .  
XmAb 5871 contains a modified IgG1 heavy chain Fc region that contains two amino acid 
substitutions in the Fc portion of the heavy chain that results in an increase in affinity to Fcγ RIIb 
binding relative to the native IgG1 Fc.

 XmAb 5871 drug product  will be manufa ctured by  Catalent, Madison, Wisconsin.  The facility 
has been configured for GMP manufacture of biological products.  
XmAb5871 drug product  will be a sterile liquid product supplied in single -use glass vials.   Each 
10 mL glass vial is filled with 10.5 mL of drug product that contains 10 (+/ -5%) mg/mL of 
XmAb5871, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 
20 at pH 7.2.   
Active substance: XmAb5871 
Activity: Humanized anti -CD19, Fc (fragment, crystallizable) engineered mA b with enhanced 
binding to FcγRIIb  
Tested indication: SLE  
Strength: 10 (+/ -5%) mg/mL  
Dosage form: Solution for infusion  
Route of administration: IV  infusion 
Matching placebo without active substance will be supplied also as a solution for IV infusion.  
5.2. Drug Storage and Handling Requirements  
All study medication should be maintained in a storage area of the Pharmacy  in a secure, 
temperature controlled, locked environment with restricted access.  XmAb 5871 or placebo must 
be stored under refrigera tion at 2 to 8oC (+/ - 5oC).  Prior to administration, the parenteral drug 
product  should be removed from storage temperature conditions and allowed to equilibrate to 
room temperature.   Undiluted XmAb5871 or placebo  is stable for up to 24 hours at room 
temperature; however Xencor must be notified if the drug product is left at room temperature for more than 8 hours.  XmAb 5871 or placebo should be mixed by swirling the vial gently before 
diluting to the dosing solution.  DO NOT SHAKE ; excess agitation may cause aggregate 
formation  and foaming .   
The full calculated dose will be administered based on the patient ’s Day 1 weight.  The 
administered dose will be adjusted on subsequent infusion days ONLY if the weight on the  
infusion day differs more than 10% from the weight on Day 1.  The XmAb5871 dose for patient s 
whose weight exceeds 100 kg will be calculated based on a weight of 100 kg.  
XmAb5871 or placebo will be diluted to a final concentration of 5.0 mg/mL in an infusi on bag 
containing 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP.  Prior to dilution , the parenteral drug

 Page 62 of 132 29 July 2016  
 product should be inspected visually.  The drug product  should appear clear to slightly 
opalescent, colorless to yellow; practically free of particulates.  I f particulate matter and/or 
discoloration are noted, the drug should NOT  be administered.  XmAb5871 or placebo should 
not be mixed or diluted with other drugs or diluents such as 5% dextrose in water (D5W). 
The bag should be gently inverted 2 or 3 times to mix the solution.  The bag must not be shaken; 
excess agitation may cause aggregate formation.   Administration of XmAb5871 or placebo will be performed as described in the Pharmacy 
Manual, which will be provided to the sites. Diluted XmAb5871 or placebo should be administered IV at a constant rate over a 1- 2 hour 
period.  XmAb5871 SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR 
BOLUS.  
Vials are single -use containers.  All unused supplies of XmAb5871 and placebo will either be 
destroyed or returned t o the study Sponsor at the end of the study in accordance with instruction 
by the Sponsor.  
5.3. Drug Administration  
Administration of XmAb 5871 or placebo should take place as soon as possible following 
dilution.  If a delay is anticipated, diluted XmAb 5871 or p lacebo may be stored at 2 to 8oC for no 
more than 24  hours or at room temperature for no more than 8 hours prior to infusion.  Diluted 
parenteral drug product should be administered intravenously at a constant rate over a 2 hour 
period for the first infusi on and over a 1- 2 hour period for subsequent infusions .  XmAb 5871 
SHOULD NOT BE ADMINISTERED AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS .   
5.4. Dose Rationale  
The proposed dose and dosing regimen is based on available data from the non- clinical 
pharmacology and toxicology studies with XmAb5871 and available data from the completed 
human studies.  
The maximum dose administered and the NOAEL in the GLP 6- month, re peat-dose toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkey ( IV infusion every other week × 13 infusions) was 200 mg/kg.  
The dosing schedule and duration of the toxicity study provides support for the dose/schedule of 
the proposed study.  The completed FIH study examin ed single doses from 0.03 mg/kg, a dose 
predicted to result in a C max about 5- fold below the estimated minimum anticipated biological 
effect level  to 10.0 mg/kg, a maximum dose based on predicted human PK and PD profiles, 
adequate safety margins, and pract ical considerations.  These doses were generally  well tolerated

 in the single ascending dose study as well as in the 3- month multiple ascending dose study  
(QOW dosing × 6 doses)  in RA patients.   Complete CD19 receptor occupancy was seen in the 
repeat dose RA study at doses of 1.0, 3.0, and 10.0  mg/kg from first dose through the completion 
of dosing .  A trend towards beneficial effects on RA disease activity could be s een in both the 
3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg cohort s as well as in the comparison of XmAb5871 treated (all doses) vs all 
placebo treated patients.   
Based on the observed safety and tolerability profile, the effects on  CD19 receptor occupancy, 
and effects on disease activity in the RA study, a dose of 5 mg/kg has been selected for this 
study.  
5.5. Supply, Pack aging, and Labeling  
XmAb 5871 and placebo will be supplied by Almac.  Investigational medicinal products will be 
packaged and labeled according to applicable local and regulatory requirements. 
XmAb5871 will be a liquid product supplied in single -use glass vials.  Each 10 mL glass vial is 
filled with 10.5 mL of drug product that contains 10 (+/ -5%) mg/mL of XmAb5871, 10 mM 
sodium phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride and 0.01% (w/v) polysorbate 20 at  pH 7.2.  Each 
product vial is intended to deliver at least 10 mL of drug solution or 100 mg (+/- 5%) of 
XmAb 5871.  Matching placebo without active substance will also be supplied as a solution for 
infusion.  All supplies of IMPs must be stored in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions .  The 
IMPs will be stored in a secured area, accessible to authorized persons only, until needed for 
dosing.  
5.6. Drug Accountability, Dispensing and Destruction  
The Investigator or designee is responsible for mai ntaining accurate accountability records of the 
IMPs  throughout the clinical study.  The  drug accountability log includes information such as, 
random  number, amount dispensed and amount returned to the pharmacy (if any).   
All dispensing and accountability  records will be available  for Sponsor review  after database 
lock.  When the S tudy Monitor visits the site , he or she will r eview  the drug accountability log 
provided by the  site pharmacy .  
The site pharmacist (or designee under the direction of the pharmacist) will dispense IMP for 
each patient  according to the protocol  and pharmacy manual, if applicable .

 Page 64 of 132 29 July 2016  
 After receiving Sponsor approval in writing, the site  is responsible for returning all unused or 
partially used IMP to the Sponsor  or designated third party  or for preparing the IMP for 
destruction according to locally compliant procedures .   
5.7. Patient  Identification  
5.7.1. Screening  and Randomization N umbers  
After obtaining oral and written informed conse nt, patients will be screened according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The screening number will be used throughout the screening 
period.  Patients who meet all selection criteria including the required improvement in disease 
activity will receive a randomization number on Day 1.  The patient  number  (i.e. randomization 
number) will ensure identification throughout the study.  The patient  number will be assigned by 
a central telephone/world wide web based randomization system.  
Patient s dropping  out or withdrawing, for any reason, without completing all screening 
evaluations successfully  or who do not meet the requirements for improvement by Day 1 will be 
considered as “screening failures“.   Such patient s will not receive a patient  number , however, 
screening data  will be collected in the electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs).  The Investigator 
will keep a screening log of all patient s screened in order to assess the numbers and 
characteristics of the excluded patient s, and the reasons for t heir exclusion. 
5.8. Administration of Investigational Medicinal Product  
XmAb 5871 will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 1- 2 hours  (first infusion over 
2 hours; subsequent infusions over 1- 2 hours ). 
Study medication will be administered with the p atient in a semi- supine position with the head of 
the bed elevated from 0 to 90 degrees.  If an infusion chair is used, the patient’s legs should be 
horizontal.  For the initial infusion, patients are to remain fasted f or at least 3 hours before 
starting the infusion until at least 1 hour after end of infusion.  During pre -infusion fasting, no 
fluids are allowed except small amounts of water.   During the post -dose fasting period, small 
amounts of clear liquids will be allowed.   At subsequent infusions, pati ents should fast for 1 hour 
prior, may have small amounts of clear liquids during and after the infusion, and may resume 
their normal diet 1 hour later.  
5.9. Compliance  
Dosing will be performed by trained, qualified personnel designated by the PI.  The date and time of dosing will be documented on each dosing day.  Comments will be recorded if there are any deviations from the planned dosing procedures.

 5.10. Concomitant Medications  
5.10.1. Previous / Concomitant Medication  
5.10.1.1.  Disallowed previous or concomitant medications:  
• Prior use of rituximab (or other B cell depleting agents) within 12 months of 
randomization or treatment with any other biologic therapeutics (including belimumab) 
within 6 months of randomization.  
• Use of any investigational agent within 5 half -lives of th e agent (or 6 months if the half -
life is unknown) prior to randomization.

mycophenolic acid, leflunomide, cyclosporine,  cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus, 
6-mercaptopurine ) will be stopped or tapered off during screening .   
• Patients entering the study on oral corticosteroids (not to exceed the equivalent of 15 mg 
of prednisone per day – see Table 1) will taper their oral steroids to 10 mg per day or less   
by randomization (Day 1)  and then may continue on a ≤10 mg daily dose through the 
remainder  of the study. 
Table 1: Prednisone Equivalence  
 
 
 
      
Details of all prior and concomitant medication s will be 
recorded at study entry (i.e., at the first visit) including prior treatment for SLE , prior SLE  
clinical trial participation and prior monoclonal antibody use.  All therapies (prescriptions or 
over-the-counter medi cations, including vitamins and herbal supplements) different from the 
study drug  will be recorded in the eCRF .  Any medicinal product, prescribed or OTC, including 
herbal and other non -traditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication.  Any cha nges 
in concomitant medication must be recorded at each visit  whether or not prescribed by the study 
site.  If the change might influence the patient ’s eligibility to continue in the study, the Sponsor Prednisone  10 mg

 must be informed.  Concomitant medication use may be w arranted for the treatment of AEs.  In 
the interests of patient  safety and acceptable standards of medical care it is expected that the 
Investigator will prescribe treatment(s) at his/her discretion.  All treatments must be recorded in 
the patient s’ case report form (CRF); medication, dose, tr eatment duration and indication. 
The information collected for each concomitant medication includes, at a minimum, start date, 
end date or ongoing, dose and unit, frequency, route of administration and indication. 
5.10.2. Contraception  
Women are considered to be of childbearing potential unless there is a documented reason (i.e., 
postmenopausal by history with no menses for one year and confirmed by FSH [using local 
reference ranges], OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of  bilateral tubal ligation, OR history 
of bilateral oophorectomy).  
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening and at Day 1  prior to study drug infusion and must use 1 highly effective method of birth control during 
the study and 3 months following last dose of XmAb5871.  Highly effective methods of birth 
control include hormonal birth control, IUDs, or any barrier methods (sponges, female condoms) used by the woman in addition to contraception used by their male part ner such as vasectomy or 
condom supplemented with spermicide. 
Male patients of childbearing potential must be willing to practice a highly effective method of 
birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 3 months after the last dose of 
XmAb5871.  Highly effective methods of birth control include vasectomy or a condom in 
combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or IUD used by the woman.

• Body weight, without shoes  (in kg)  
• Body m ass index  
6.1.2. Adverse Events  
Adverse event  reporting will begin upon the signing of the informed consent document  and will 
continue until the last study  visit. 
6.1.2.1. Definitions  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient  administered a n IMP  which does 
not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use  of an IMP, whether or not considered 
related to the IMP.  Adverse events  may include the onset of new illness and the exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions. 
Other untoward events occurring in the framework of a clinical study will be recorded as AEs, 
e.g., those occurring during treatment -free periods (including Screening  or post -treatment 
Follow -up periods), in association with study -related procedures and assessments, or under 
placebo.   For investigational products  or placebo, lack of efficacy is  an ex pected potential 
outcome and should not be reported as an AE unless the event is unusual in some way , e.g., 
greater in severity  than the usual course of disease in a given patient .   
Concomitant illnesses, which existed prior to entry into the clinical stu dy, will not be considered 
AEs unless they worsen during the treatment period.  Pre -existing conditions will be recorded  as 
part of the patient ’s medical history.   
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory results which are not caused by the underlying di sease  
or are not consistent with the patient’s medications  will be recorded as AEs and the relationship

 to the study drug  will be indicated  as in Table 3.  Laboratory values outside the normal range 
will be assigned one of the following categories by the Investigator or designee:  
1. Not clinically significant,  minor out of range value/finding .  AE -  No  
2. Not clinically significant , out of range value/finding explainable by anticipated or known 
effect of study drug or concomitant drugs .  AE - No  
3. Clinically significant but consistent with the patient’s underlying disease .  AE -  No 
4. Clinically sign ificant out of range value/finding  that does not fulfill categories 1 -3.  AE -
 Yes 
6.1.2.2. Recording of Adverse Events  
Adverse events  should be collected and recorded for each patient  from  the date  the informed 
consent form (ICF)  was signed until the end of their participation in the study, i.e., the patient  
has discontinued or completed the study.   
Adverse event s may be volunteered spontaneously by the study  patient , or discovered by the  
study  staff during physical examinations or by asking an open, non- leading question such as 
‘How have you been feeling since you were last asked?’   All AEs and any required remedial 
action will be recorded.  The nature of AE, date (and time, if known) of AE ons et, date (and 
time, if known) of AE outcome to date, severity, and action taken of the AE will be documented 
together with the  Investigator’s assessment of the seriousness of the AE and causal relationship 
to study drug and/or study  procedure . 
All AEs shou ld be recorded individually in the study patient ’s own words (verbatim) unless, in 
the opinion of the Investigator,  the AEs constitute components of a recognized condition, disease 
or syndrome.  In the latter case, the condition, disease or syndrome should be named rather than 
each individual symptom.  The AEs will be coded using the  current version of the  Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ). 
6.1.2.3. Assessment of Adverse Events  
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator with regard to the categ ories  discussed in the 
sections below . 
6.1.2.3.1. Intensity  
The Investigator will assess all AEs for severity utilizing the National Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events ( NCI-CTCAE) grading scale (V  4.03) . AEs 
not contained within CTCAE version 4.3 will be rated on a five -point scale  (see Table 2) :

Page 69 of 132 29 July 2016  Table 2: Severity Grading Scale 
Mild  
(Grade 1)  Mild events are those which are easily tolerated with no disruption of normal daily 
activity.  
Moderate (Grade 2)  Moderate events are those which cause sufficient discomfort to interfere with daily activity.  
Severe 
(Grade 3)  Severe events are those which incapacitate and prevent usual activity.  
Life-threatening 
(Grade 4 ) An adverse event that has life -threatening consequences; for which urgent 
intervention is indicated; that puts the patient at risk of death at the time of the 
event if   immediate intervention is not undertaken; or that causes blindness or 
deafness.  
Fatal  
(Grade 5)  The termination of life as a result of an adverse event.  
W
hen changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted for that day.  Any change in severity of signs and 
symptoms over a number of days will be captured by recording a new AE, with the amended severity grade and the date ( and time , if known) of the change.  
6.1.2.3.2. Causality 
The Investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the IMP and the AE .  One of the 
following categories should be selected based on good medical and scientific judgment, 
considering the definitions below and all contributing factors ( see Table 3 ).

 Table 3: Causality Grading Scale  
Related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurs in a plausible 
time relationship to treatment administration, and which concurrent disease or 
other drugs or chemicals cannot explain.   The response to withdrawal of the 
treatment (dechallenge*) should be clinically plausible.  The event must be 
definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically, using a satisfactory 
rechallenge† procedure if necessary.  
Probably  Related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the treatment, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which follows a clinically 
reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge).   Rechallenge information is 
not required to fulfill this definition.  
Possibly Related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time 
sequence to administration of the treatment, but whi ch could also be explained 
by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.   Information on treatment 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely Related  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to treatm ent administration which makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals or underlying disease provide 
plausible explanations.  
Not R elated  
 A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal 
relationship with treatment administration.   May have negative dechallenge and 
rechallenge information.   Typically explained by extraneous factors (e.g. 
concomitant disease, environmental factors or other drugs or chemicals)  
* Dechallenge is when a drug s uspected of causing an AE is discontinued.  If the symptoms of the AE disappear 
partially or completely, within a reasonable time from drug discontinuation, this is termed a positive dechallenge .  
If the symptoms continue despite withdrawal of the drug, th is is termed a negative dechallenge .  Note that there are 
exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug- relatedness clearly exists 
(for example, as in bone marrow suppression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive dyskinesi a). 
† Rechallenge is when a drug suspected of causing an AE in a specific patient in the past is readministered to that 
patient.  If the AE recurs upon exposure, this is termed a positive rechallenge .  If the AE does not recur, this is 
termed a negative re challenge . 
 
6.1.2.3.3. Action Taken  
Action taken will be defined as:  
• None;  
• Infusion interrupted;  
• Infusion discontinued;  
• Medication given  (details to include medication name, start date and time, stop date and 
time, dose, route, frequency and reason for administration) ; 
• Other  (details of other to be specified)

 Page 71 of 132 29 July 2016  
 6.1.2.3.4. Outcome  
Outcome will be defined as:  
• Death related to adverse event;  
• Not recovered or not resolved;  
• Recovered or resolved;  
• Recovered or resolved with sequelae;  
• Recovering or resolving;  
• Unknown. 
6.1.2.3.5. Seriousness  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that occurs at any dose if it:  
• Results in death;  
• Is life -threatening; this means that the patient  was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not mean that the event hypothetically mig ht have caused death if it were 
more severe;  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation in existing hospitalization;  
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity  or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions ; 
• Is a congenital an omaly or birth defect ; 
• Is an important medical event (see below) . 
Important medical events that do not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not require 
hospitalization may be considered SAEs when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or in a physician’s office, blood dyscrasias or seizures that do not result in in- patient hospitalization, and the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
A distinction should be drawn between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness i s defined by the criteria above.  For example, a mild degree of 
gastrointestinal bleeding requiring an overnight hospitalization for monitoring purposes would be considered a n SAE, but is not necessarily severe.  Similarly, an AE that is severe in intensit y is 
not necessarily an  SAE.  For example, alopecia may be assessed as severe in intensity but would 
not be considered a n SAE.

Page 72 of 132 29 July 2016  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding if an AE is serious and if 
expedited reporting is appropriate. 
6.1.2.3.6. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Infusion -related  Reactions  
All monoclonal antibody therapeutics are associated with the risk of both non-allergic (cytokine 
release syndrome)  and allergic (hypersensitivity) infusion- related  reactions.  
A. Non-allergic  reactio ns (cytokine release):  Most infusion- related reactions are mild and non-
allergic in etiology and may be alleviated by interruption of the infusion and reinitiating the 
infusion at the same of slower infusion rate after symptoms abate.  Signs/symptoms may 
include:  a rthralgia (joint pain); cough; dizziness; dyspnea (shortness of breath); f atigue 
(asthenia, lethargy, malaise); fever; headache; hypertension; hypotension; m yalgia (muscle 
pain); nausea; rash/desquamation; r igors/chills; sweat ing (diaphoresis); tachycardia; 
vomiting.  
B. Allergic (hypersensitivity)  reactions and anaphylaxis.  The Immune System Disorders 
section of NCI -CTCAE 4.03 should be used to help characterize AEs related to 
hypersensitivity and immunogenicity.  To identify cas es of anaphylaxis in this study, the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) definition of anaphylaxis (Sampson et al 2006) will be used  (see Table 4): 
Xencor, Inc.  
Protocol Number XmAb5871 -04 Clinical Study Protocol V 2.0 dated 29 July 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 73 of 132 29 July 2016  
 Table 4: Definition of A naphylaxis  
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one  of the following 3 criteria are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (e.g., 
generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING  
a. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia)  
b. Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a likely  allergen for that patient  (minutes to 
several hours):  
a. Involvement of the skin -mucosal tissue (e.g., generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen lips -tongue -uvula)  
b. Respiratory compromise (e.g., dyspnea, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF, hypoxemia ) 
c. Reduced BP or associated symptoms (e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)  
d. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)  
3. Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient  (minutes to several hours):  
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific) or greater than 30% decrease in systolic BP*  
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person’s baseline  
PEF = Peak expiratory flow; BP = blood pressure.  
*Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mmHg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 
mmHg + [2 ×  age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mmHg from 11 to 17 years.  
 
Monitoring during infusions  
Patien ts should be closely monitored during and after infusion.  XmAb5871 should be 
administered intravenously at a constant rate over a 1- 2 hour period (2 hours for first infusion, 
1-2 hours for subsequent infusions) .  Patients will be continuously assessed dur ing the 1- 2 hour 
infusion and for 1 hour following the end of infusion (2 hours following  the first infusion) .  Vital 
signs including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature assessments will be 
made within 2 hours prior to infusion, 30, 60 and 120 minutes from the start of infusion, at the end of infusion (if different than 120 minutes from start of infusion) and 30 and 60 minutes after 
end of infusion.  During the first infusion, an additional measurement of vital signs should be 
made at 15 minutes after the start of infusion and after the end.  
Severe infusion- related reactions, including deaths following the administration of otherwise 
well-tolerated monoclonal antibodies, have been reported rarely.  As with all monoclonal IV 
antibody therapies, XmAb 5871 should only be administered by healthcare providers and in 
healthcare settings that are prepared to recognize and to manage severe infusion -related  reactions 
and/or anaphylaxis that can be life- threatening.   All investigators should be well trained in the 
management of anaphylaxis (and other acute infusion- related events) including administration of 
epinephrine and other therapeutic modalities.  Medications and equipment for the treatment of 
life-threating anaphylaxis should be available in the immediate area of treatment.

 Management of Infusion -Related Reactions & Cytokine Release Syndrome  
Infusion- related reactions and cytokine release syndrome will be toxicity graded according to the 
NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.3, as defined in Table 5.

REMARK:   An acute infusion -related reaction may occur with an agent that causes cytokine release (e.g., monoclonal 
antibodies or other biological agents).  Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after drug infusion and general ly 
resolve completely w ithin 24 hrs of completion of infusion.  Signs/symptoms may include: Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity 
(including drug fever); Arthralgia (joint pain); Bronchospasm; Cough; Dizziness; Dyspnea (shortness of breath); Fatigue 
(asthenia, lethargy, malaise); H eadache; Hypertension; Hypotension; Myalgia (muscle pain); Nausea; Pruritis/itching; 
Rash/desquamation; Rigors/chills; Sweating (diaphoresis); Tachycardia; Urticaria (hives, welts, wheals); Vomiting.  
The Xencor Medical Monitor should be contacted immediately if questions arise concerning the 
grade of the infusion- related reaction.  
An ADA sample should be drawn at the time of any suspected immunological related AE and at 
the time of each subsequent visit X 4 (and as per pre -specified sampling schedule).  
The following are treatment guidelines for XmAb5871 treatment -related infusion- related 
reactions:

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 75 of 132 29 July 2016  Grade 1 or 2:  
•Discontinue the infusion and administer acetaminophen and/or diphenhydr amine and/or
dexamethasone to treat signs and symptoms if clinicall y indicated.  Once symptoms have
resolved, slow the infusion rate by 50% of the baseline rate.  If, after one hour, the
patient’s symptoms do not return and vital signs are stable, the infusion rate may be
increased every 30 minutes as tolerated to the bas eline rate .
•Vital signs should be measured every 15 minutes or less as clinically indicated.  Forpatients who are able to tolerate an increase in the infusion rate back to baseline andmaintain normal blood pressure for 30 minutes after the rate increase then, at thediscretion of the investigator, the frequency of vital sign assessment may be reduced toevery 30 minutes during the infusion.
•Monitor the patient for worsening of condition; if severity of event increases to a higherGrade (Grade 3, or 4) stop the infusion, administer appropriate treatment, and refer toguidelines below for Grades 3 or 4 infusion- related reactions .
•Patients with maximum Grade 2 infusion -related reaction may continue on study and
should receive prophylactic pre -medication with  acetaminophen 650  mg po and
diphenhydramine hydrochloride 25- 50 mg IV and dexamethasone 10 mg IV (or
equivalent) prior to all subsequent XmAb5871 infusions.
Grade 3 and 4: 
•Stop the infusion and disconnect the infusion tubing from the patient.
•Administer diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV, dexamethasone 10 -20 mg IV (or
equivalent), and other medications/treatment as medically indicated .
•Give epinephrine or bronchodilators as indicated.
•Hospital admission for observation may be indicated.
•Patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion- related reaction or with anaphylaxis should not
receive further XmAb5871 treatment, but will continue to be followed on the protocol.
•Obtain blood sample for cytokine analysis during the event and approximately 24 hourslater.
•Notify the Xencor Medical Monitor immediately .

 Infusion -Associated Gastrointestinal -Related Symptoms  
In th e completed XmAb5871 single -dose FIH study, the most frequently reported treatment -
related AEs were:  nausea (7/36  subject s [19.4%]), vomiting (5/36 subjects  [13.9%]), diarrhea 
(4/36 subjects [11.1%]) and abdominal pain (3/36 subjects [8.3%])  which typically occurred 
during the infusion.  Symptoms were reported over the dose range of 0.2 to 10.0 mg/kg and at a 
similar overall level in each dose group.  In the 8 cases  of nausea and vomiting  in which the IMP 
infusion was interrupted, the symptoms responsible for the interruption resolved quickly and no concomitant medication was required for relief of symptoms.  When vomiting occurred, symptoms resolved very rapi dly following the vomiting episode (1- 3 minutes).  The planned 
infusion was completed without recurrence of symptoms.  No subject was withdrawn and none self-withdrew.  
In the P hase 2a study  in RA patients , 9 patients (23%) had their first XmAb5871 IV infus ion 
temporarily interrupted as a result of the gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting /nausea or 
diarrhea).   Seven  of the 9 (78%) occurred in the 10.0 mg/kg cohorts.  In all but one episode, the 
symptoms were mild to moderate  (one episode of severe vomiting) .  In all cases, the patients 
were able to continue the infusion after a short break (5- 31 minutes) and symptoms did not recur 
on continuation of the infusion or during subsequent infusions.  No concomitant medication was 
required for alleviation of symptoms . 
There is no known mechanism of action by which a mAb with enhanced binding to FcγRIIb would result in infusion- associated, transient GI toxicity seen.  There is also no known 
mechanism of action by which targeting CD19, a B cell restricted antigen, would  produce such 
toxicity.  
Mild to moderate nausea, vomiting or diarrhea may occur during the first infusion of XmAb5871.  The patient should be monitored during the infusion and at the first sign of 
abdominal distress be allowed to elevate the head of the bed to up to a 90 degree position.  
Should nausea occur and become significant and/ or vomiting occurs, the IV infusion should be 
interrupted.  After a 15 -30 minute interruption and if the patient ’s symptoms have substantially 
resolved, the infusion may be r estarted at the original infusion rate.  
6.1.2.4.  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator will review each potential SAE and evaluate the intensity  and the causal 
relationship of the event to IMP.  All potential SAEs will be recorded from signing of informed 
consent until EOS .  Serious AEs occurring after EOS  and coming to the attention of the 
Xencor, Inc.  
Protocol Number XmAb5871 -04 Clinical Study Protocol V 2.0 dated 29 July 2016  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
 Page 77 of 132 29 July 2016  
 Investigator must be reported only if there is (in the opinion of the Investigator) reasonable 
causal relationship with th e IMP. 
The Investigator  is responsible for providing notification to Vigilare of any potential SAE , 
whether deemed IMP -related or not, that a patient  experiences during their participation in study 
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. Vigilare will provide the information to the 
Sponsor .  
As a minimum requirement, the initial notification should provide the following information:  
• Study number  
• Patient number  
• Gender  
• Date of birth  
• Name of PI and full clinical site address  
• Name of the reporter  
• Detai ls of SAE  
• Criterion for classification as ‘serious’  
• Study drug name , dose  and treatment start date  
• Date of SAE onset  
• Date of SAE first awareness (by Investigator or study site staff)  
• Causality assessment  
Vigilare  will request clarification of omitted or discrepant information from the initial 
notification.  The PI or an authorized delegate is responsible for providing the requested 
information to Vigilare within 24 hours of the request. 
Initial reports of SAEs must be followed up as soon as possible  with detailed descriptions ; this 
may includ e clear photocopies of other documents as necessary (e.g., hospital reports, consultant 
reports, autopsy reports , etc.), with the study patient’s personal identifiers removed.  All relevant 
information obtained by the Investigator  through review of these documents will be recorded and 
forwarded to Vigilare  within 24 hours of receipt of the information.  If a new SAE Report Form 
is completed , then the PI must sign  and date the for m.  Vigilare and/or the Sponsor  may also

24 hour telephone number: 610- 977-0899 x4801 
Emergency contact number: 917- 741-5205  
1. E-mail your SAE form to the study specific e -mail address above.  
2. Provide Vigilare with the name of the PI, your name, the telephone number where you can be 
reached and the protocol number and title. 
3. Immediately forward the SAE form and any supporting documentation to Vigilare: this must  
be done within 24 hours of be coming aware of the event.  
6.1.2.5. Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs experienced by a patient , irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until 
the event has resolved  or stabilized , until any abnormal laboratory values have returned to 
baseline o r stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Sponsor medical 
representative, until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, or until the 
patient  is lost to Follow -up. 
6.1.2.6. Pregnancy  
The Investigator and Sponsor ha ve a responsi bility to monitor the outcome of all pregnancies , 
including pregnancies in partners of male participants, reported during the clinical study.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE  unless there is a suspicion that the IMP may have 
interfered with the eff ectiveness of a contraceptive medication.   Elective abortions without 
complications should not be regarded as AE s, unless they were therapeutic abortions (see 
below).  Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy newborn should not be considered an SAE .  All notifications of pregnancy should be documented and reported whether or not there is 
an associated AE or SAE.  
Each pregnancy notification must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor and Vigilare 
within 30 days after becoming aware of the pre gnancy .  In the event of pregnancy in a female 
participant, no more study drug will be given.  However, t he Investigator must f ollow -up and 
document  the course and the outcome of all pregnancies if possible even if the patient  was

 withdrawn from the clinical study  or if the clinical study  has finished.  The follow -up period will 
be deemed to have ended when the health status of the child has been determined on its birth.  
All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Investigator to the Sponsor and Vigilare on 
the pregnancy outcome report form within 30 days after  he/she has gained knowledge of the 
normal delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., maternal serious complicatio ns, therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, neonatal death, 
congenital anomaly, birth defect) and reported within 24 hours of awareness in accordance with the procedure for reporting SAEs.  
6.1.3. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be assessed at Screening and on Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 
141, 155, 169, 183, 197, 211, 225 and 253 (EOS).  On Day 1 , vital sign assessments will be 
made immediately prior to infusion, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the start of  the infusion 
(±5 minutes) , immediately before the EOI (if different than 120 minutes from start of infusion) , 
and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after EOI.  During subsequent infusions, vital signs will be 
measured immediately prior to infusion, 30 and 60 minutes after the start of  the infusion (±5 
minutes) , immediately before the EOI (if different than 60 minutes from start of infusion) , and at 
30 and 60 minutes after EOI.  On non- dosing days vital signs should be measured prior to blood 
sampling.  During the infusion of XmAb5871, vital signs will be obtained in the semi- supine 
siting position.  The following vital signs will be measured:  
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic  [mmHg]); 
• Heart rate (beats per minute [b pm]); 
• Oral b ody temperature (°C);  
• Respiratory  rate (breaths per min ute). 
• Supine BP and heart rate recordings will be made after the study patient  has been 
recumbent and at rest ≥  5 minutes.   
6.1.4. 12-lead Electrocardiograms  
Standard safety 12- lead ECGs will be performed at Screening  and on Days 1, 29, 127, 183, and 
253 (EOS).  On Day 1, supine ECGs will be performed immediately prior to the infusion and 2  
hours after EOI .  On all other visit days, ECGs will be performed only pre -dose.

 The 12-lead ECGs will be performed after the patient  has been resting supine for ≥  5 minutes .  
The ECG will include all 12 standard leads and a Lead II rhythm strip on the bottom of the 
tracing.  The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25 mm/sec.   The following ECG 
parameters will be collected:   PR interval, QRS interval, RR interval, QT int erval, and QTc 
interval ( QTcB  and QTcF ).   
All ECGs must be evaluated by a qualified physician for the presence of abnormalities.   
6.1.5. Physical Examinations  
Physical examinations will be performed at Screening  and on Days  1, 8, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 
169, 197, 225 and 253(EOS).  
The physical examination includes an assessment of general appearance and dermatologic, head, 
eyes, ears, nose, mouth/throat/neck, thyroid, lymph nodes, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, extremities, musculoskeletal, neurolo gic, and psychiatric system  evaluations . 
6.1.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Safety clinical laboratory assessments and f low cytometry for B cell and T cell quantitation and 
for CD19 RO will be performed by ICON Central Laboratories, Farmingdale, NY. PK and 
immunogenicity laboratory assessments will be performed by ICON Development Solutions, LLC , Whitesboro, NY.  Genotyping will be performed by C ancer Genetics Inc., Morrisville, NC.  
Mechanistic studies will be done at O klahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, 
OK. 
Blood samples should be taken using standard venipuncture techniques.  Blood sampling will be 
performed according to local SOPs.  
The following laboratory variables will be determined as outlined below:   
• Hematology: The following hematology  parameters will be assessed at Screening and at 
Days 1, 8, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 183, 197, 211, 225 and 253(EOS):  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential (% and derived absolut e values), mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular

6.4.1. Efficacy Measurements  
Disease activity will be measured at Screening and on Days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169, 197, 
225 and 253(EOS).  The following efficacy assessments will be performed according to the time 
points defined in Table 6  Schedule of Assessments:  
SELENA SLEDAI  
The SELENA SLEDAI is a tool designed to quantitate the amount of SLE  disease activity a 
patient is experiencing at the present time (and in the proceeding 28 days).  The instrument is 
intended to evaluate current SLE  activity and not chronic damage, severity is accounted for in 
part by the "weightedness" of the scale.   Whi le it assesses the organs and systems commonly 
involved in SLE, it is weighted most heavily towards CNS and kidney involvement.  The score will be recorded as  the sum of descriptors present within the 28 days prior to the visit and visit 
day.  
A sample ass essment form is included in Appendix  11.1.1 and instructions for use are in 
Appendix 11.1.4.  
BILAG  
The British Isles Lupus Activity G roup (BILAG) index assesses the month prior to the visit and 
is based on intent to treat logic.  Organ systems are rated on whether the system has never been involved (E), has been involved in the past (D) but is not currently active, currently contains descriptor(s) which are  mild (C), of moderate intensity  (B), or severe in intensity  (A).  Ea ch of 
the 9 systems receives an overall rating which incorporates the intensity and the change (if any) of each feature in that system during the past month.

SELENA SLEDAI Physician Global Assessment A nchored VAS and SELENA SLEDAI 
Flare Index  
The physician’s overall asses sment of the patient’s current disease activity will be recorded on a 
3 point (normalized to 100 mm ) linear horizontal VAS, where the left hand extreme of the line is 
considered “none ” (symptom free and no SLE symptoms) and the right hand extreme is 
considered “maximum” (maximum possible SLE activity).   Anchors at “1” and “2” indicate 
increments for mild and moderate disease activity. The SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index combines 
changes (if any) in the Physician’s Global Disease Activity with a variety of descrip tors that 
define mild/moderate or severe flare.  
A sample PGA form and SELENA SLEDAI Flare Index  are included in Appendi x 11.1.3.  
7. STUDY CONDUCT  
7.1. Schedule of Assessments  
The study consists of a Screening  visit (Day - 28 to Day -1) followed by sixteen infusions of  
XmAb5871 given every two weeks (Days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 
183, 197 and 211) with collection of disease activity assessments, safety  data, PK, and PD. 
Patients will be seen on Day 8 for safety monitoring , PK and PD  and will be followed for 6 
weeks after the final infusion (Days 225 and 253[EOS] ).  Patients who experience loss of disease 
activity improvement will have their study drug infusions discontinued and will receive 
appropriate SLE rescue therapy at the discretion of the principal investigator .  The patient should 
be followed for an additional 6 weeks  from the time of the last study drug infusion .  Assessments 
listed for the Day 225 visit should be performed at the time of loss of disease activity 
improvement  (LOI) .  Assessments listed for the Day 253(EOS) visit should  be performed at the 
follow -up visit 6 weeks from the time of the last study drug infusion.   The maximal study 
duration for an individual patient  will be 253 day s after the first infusion .

 [a] Unless otherwise stated, assessment s should be performed pre -dose.  
[b] If a patient experiences a loss of disease activity improvement  (LOI), they will receive no more infusions of study drug.  Assessments listed above under 
Day 225 should be performed at the time of loss of disease activity improvement and assessments for Day 253 (EOS) should be perf ormed at a visit 6 weeks 
from the time of the last study drug infusion.  
[c] Immunosuppressants may be discontinued anytime from screening start but before  Day 1 .  During screening, investigators may give additional steroids IM 
up to 320 mg total at their discretion to achieve the targeted disease improvement.    
[d] Patients  receive 160 mg depomedrol IM at the beginning of screening and may receive up to additional 320 mg during screening to suppress disease activity 
at the principal investigator’s d iscretion. All patients will receive 80 mg of IM depomedrol on Days 1 and 15.   
[e] On Day 1, vital sign assessments will be made immediately prior to infusion, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the start of t he infusion (±5 minutes), 
immediately before the EOI (i f different than 120 minutes from start of infusion), and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after EOI.  During subsequent infusio ns, 
vital signs will be measured immediately prior to infusion, 30 and 60 minutes after the start of the infusion (±5 minutes), i mmediately before the EOI (if 
different than 60 minutes from start of infusion), and at 30 and 60 minutes after EOI.

 8. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Before database lock , a statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, 
providing detailed methods for the analyses and may supersede the analyses outlined below .  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated 
clinical study report.  
8.1. Study Population  
8.1.1. Disposition of Patients  
The number and percentage of patients  screened, enrolled, randomized and completing the 
clinical study will be presented . 
8.1.2. Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be listed by patient .   
8.1.3. Analysis Populations  
The definitions of study populations are as follows:  
• Enrolled Population:  A ll patients  who were enrolled in the study (signed informed consent, 
met inclusion and exclusion criteria and we re randomized ), whether or not the study drug 
was administered.  
• Intent to Treat (ITT) Population:  All patients  who have received at least a partial dose of 
XmAb5871 or placebo.   
• Efficacy Evaluable Popul ation:  All patients who : 
o Complete study through Day 225 assessments  
o Discontinue due to reaching the protocol specified LOI endpoint (and have not missed 2 or more consecutive doses prior to the LOI visit)  
o Discontinue due to drug -related adverse event (non responder)  
• Safety Population:  All patients  who receive d at least a partial dose of XmAb5871 or 
placebo .  In this study, this will be  equivalent to the ITT population.  
• Pharmacokinetic/Immunogenicity Population:  All patients  who received XmAb5871 and 
for w hom the PK data are considered to be sufficient and interpretable will be included in 
the PK population.  All patients  who received XmAb5871 and have at least 1 post -IMP 
dosing ADA sample drawn will be included in the immunogenicity population.

 Page 91 of 132 29 July 2016  
 • Pharmacodyn amic Population:  All patients  who have received XmAb5871 and for whom 
the PD data are considered to be sufficient and interpretable will be analyzed in the PD 
analyses.   
8.2. General Considerations  
This is a  randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study where descriptive and inferential 
statistics will be employed to analyze the data.  Summary statistics for continuous variables will 
include the mean, standard deviation, median, and range (minimum/maximum); categorical variables will be presented as frequency counts and percentages; and time -to-event variables (if 
any) will be summarized by Kaplan -Meier methods (median, number censored, etc.)  and 
Kaplan -Meier  plots.  Inferential statistical methodologies will be described be low and data 
listings will be created to support each table and to present all data.  
The data will be tabulated with respect to patient  enrollment, patient  disposition, protocol 
deviations, demographic and baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant me dications, 
efficacy, and safety measures.  The efficacy analysis will be performed on the Efficacy 
Evaluable and ITT Populations, and safety analysis on the Safety Population. 
Prior to database lock, a statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document that will provide additional detailed methods and mock table shells for the analyses outlined below.  
Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described and justified in the final integrated clinical study report.  
8.3. Determination of Sample Size  
It is anticipated that approximately 9 0 patients will be enrolled in the study.   Sample size is based 
on a previously completed study of SLE patients treated with IM depomedrol for 2 weeks following cessation of background immunosuppressant the rapy.  In that study, by month 6, 
40/41 patients lost the disease activity improvement achieved following IM steroid therapy; a 
2.4% placebo response.   
Assuming a 10% placebo response  (defined as no loss of disease activity improvement from 
Day 1 to Day 169 ) and a 38% response in the XmAb5871 treatment arm (i.e., a 28% delta 
between treatment arms) , 40 patients  per treatment arm will provide 80% power to detect this 
difference at alpha=0.05 (two -sided) by use of the Fishers exact test .  Adding 10% for 
unevaluable patients , the total number per arm is calculated as 4 5.  
8.4. Treatment Assignment and Drop -Outs  
Approximately 90 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 treatment a llocation scheme; therefore, 
45 patients will be assigned to the XmAb5871 arm and 45 patie nts assigned to the placebo arm.

CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 92 of 132 29 July 2016  There are no stratification factors planned for this randomization.  A clinical research 
organization independent of the clinical trial team will develop the randomization schedule and 
the actual randomization assignment will be made through a secure Interactive Web -Based 
System (IWRS).  
After obtaining oral and written informed consent, patients will be screened according to the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria.  The screening number will be used throughout the screening period.  Patients who meet all selection criteria will then be randomized and receive a patient 
number on Day 1.  The patient number will ensure identification throughout the study.   
Patient s dropping -out or withdrawing, for any reason, without completing al l screening 
evaluations successfully, will be considered as “screening failures“.  Such patient s will not 
receive a patient  number, however, screening data will be collected in the electronic Case Report 
Forms (eCRFs).   The Investigator will keep a screening log of all patient s screened in order to 
assess the numbers and characteristics of the excluded patient s, and the reasons for their 
exclusion. 
8.5. Blinding  
The study will be conducted in a double -blind m anner.  All patie nts, investigators, and study 
staff/clinicians will be blinded to the study treatment assignment (XmAb5871 or Placebo) until 
the study is formally unblinded for data analysis purposes.  The Sponsor’s team members responsible for study conduct and safety monitoring will also be blinded to study treatment.  The 
randomization schedule will be held at an independent clinical research organization not affiliated with the study conduct and will only release the full randomization schedule after the database is formally locked for data analysis purposes.  
However, individual patient treatment assignment may be revealed due to the occur rence of a 
medical emergency  requiring medical intervention or  if the Medical Monitor for the study 
determines that patien t safety r equires knowledge of the study drug  assignment.  Documentation 
of the breaking of the randomization code, including the date and reason for such unblinding, 
must be documented in the EDC system.   
8.6. Study Endpoints and Statistical Analyses  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Efficacy Evaluable and ITT Populations.  The 
Efficacy Evaluable will serve as the primary population for all efficacy analyses and the ITT will be conducted for sensitivity analysis purposes.

 8.6.1. Primary Efficacy Endp oint (Loss of Improvement  at Day 225)  
The primary endpoint will be evaluated as the percentage of SLE patients without  loss of disease 
activity improvement from Day 1 to Day 225 (i.e., responders).  Loss of improvement will be 
defined as wors ening of disease activity that in the opinion of the principal investigator  requires 
a change in treatment (exclusive of a decrease in oral steroids) AND one of:  
1) SELENA - SLEDAI increase of ≥4 points from maximal improvement OR   
2) Worsening of at least 1 BILAG A or B score OR  
3) New BILAG A or B score.  
The number of “responders” will be presented as frequency counts and percentages by treatment 
arm.  The pri mary efficacy analysis will employ the  Fisher’s Exact Test testing for differ ences in 
treatment r esponse rate (patients without loss of disease activity improvement from Day 1 to 
Day 225) between the two treatment groups.  Exact confidence intervals will be computed for 
each treatment’s binomial prop ortion of response . 
8.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoint s  
The percentage of SLE patients without  loss of disease activity improvement from Day 1 to Day 
169 (i.e ., responders)  will be evaluated  as above.  
The time to loss of SLE disease activity improvement achieved by a short period of IM steroid 
therapy in SLE pati ents will be summarized by treatment arm using Kaplan- Meier methods 
(median, 95% CI, number of events, numbe r censored, etc.) and Kaplan -Meier plots.   The 
log-rank test will be used to test for treatment group differences.  
8.6.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints  
The following disease assessment indices will be used for exploratory analyses of disease 
activity over time: 
• SELENA SLEDAI hybrid version with SELENA SLEDAI Flare index  
• BILAG 2004  
• Physician’s Global Disease activity VAS  
The SLEDAI, BILAG and PGA will be su mmarized by treatment arm at each visit using 
descriptive statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum/maximum).  Change from 
baseline will also be tabulated at each visit using the same descriptive statistics.   Categorical 
variables will be pr esented as frequency counts and percentages .

 Additional analyses on exploratory  parameter s will be described in the SAP. 
8.6.4. Safety and Tolerability Endpoints  
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety population (for this study is equivalent to ITT 
population). 
• The number and percent of patients  experiencing a treatment -emergent adverse event will 
be tabulated for each coded MedDRA system -organ class and preferred term  by treatment 
arm.  Treatment -emergent adverse events will also be tabulated accordin g to intensity and 
causality  by treatment arm . 
• All serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse event, or deaths occurring during the course of the trial will be presented in patient  listings.  
• Clinical laboratory tests (observed values) will be summarized descriptively in tabular format  by treatment arm .  Shift tables will be presented for select laboratory parameters.  
In the patient  listings, flags will be attached to values outside of the laboratory’s 
reference limits along with the Investigator’s assessment of clinical significance.  A list 
of all normal laboratory ranges will also be provided.  Clinically significant laboratory 
test abnormalities that were considered AEs by the Investigator will be  presented in the 
AE listings.  
• Vital signs (b lood pressure, pulse, temperature) will be summarized (observed and change 
from baseline) at each visit vital signs are collected using descriptive statistics and patient  
listings.  
• Twelve- lead ECG data (corrected QT intervals: Bazett’s correction and Fridericia’s 
correction) will be summarized (observed and change from baseline) by treatment arm at 
each visit ECGs are collected using descriptive statistics and patient  listings.  
• Concomitant Medications will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients  
in each therapeutic class and preferred term as coded using the WHODrug dictionary  for 
each treatment arm . 
• Physical Examinations will be presented in patient  listings.  
8.7. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
The individual patient  pre-dose (trough) and end -of-infusion (peak) concentration- time data will 
be listed and displayed graphically on the linear and log scales.  The concentration- time data will 
be summarized descriptively in tabula r and graphical formats (linear and log scales).

 8.8. Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
All observed PD data and change from baseline data will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics and will be listed and summarized in tabular and/or graphical form.   Descriptive  
statistics on continuous data will include mean, median, standard deviation, and range, while 
categorical data may be summarized using frequency counts and percentages . 
8.9. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses  
Individual and mean peak and trough serum con centrations of XmAb5871 will be plotted versus 
time on dual y -axis plots along with biomarkers CD19 RO, ABC, B cell subsets and anti -dsDNA 
antibody levels versus time.  In addition, the change in peak and trough concentrations from 
baseline will be plotted  versus time along with change from baseline in the biomarker 
measur ements.  
Direct comparison of PK versus PD will be done using scatterplots of peak and trough serum concentration versus PD biomarker value.  
The peak and trough serum concentrations of XmAb5871 will be examined by FcγRIIa R1 31H 
and FcγRIIb I232T polymorphism s to determine if these genetic characteristics affect 
pharmacokinetics.  
8.10. Data Quality Assurance  
Accurate, consistent, and reliable data will be ensured through the use Good Clinical Pract ices 
(GCP) guidelines regarding clinical data management practices and procedures.  
8.11. Immunogenicity Analysis  
Frequency and titer of anti -XmAb5871 antibodies (ADA)  will be listed .

 The Investigator will allow Sponsor representatives, contract designees, authorized regulatory 
authority inspectors, and the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) to have direct access to all 
documents pertaining to the study.  
9.3. Archiv ing Study Documents  
According to International Conference on Harmonization  (ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IMP.  However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the 
applicable leg al requirements.  
9.4. Good Clinical Practice  
The procedures set out in this clinical study  protocol are designed to ensure that the Sponsor and 
the Investigator abide by the principles of the ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) 
as outlined in CPMP/IC H/135/95 and the Declaration of Helsinki (Version  2008).  The clinical 
study  also will be carried out in keeping with national and local legal requirements  (in 
accordance with Un ited States I nvestigational New Drug [ IND] regulations [21 CFR Parts 50, 
56 an d 312]) . 
The Investigator will be responsible for the care of the patients throughout the study.  If the 
Investigator is not present at the study site, he/she will leave instructions for the staff and contact information  where he/she can be reached.  
9.5. Informed Consent  
Before each patient  is enrolled in the clinical study , written informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient  according to the regulatory and legal requirements of the participating country.  
As part of this procedure, the Investigator  must explain orally and in writing the nature, duration, 
and purpose of the study, and the action of the drug in such a manner that the study patient  is 
aware of the potential ri sks, inconveniences, or AEs that may occur.  The study patient  should be 
informed that he/she is free to withdraw from the study at any time.  He/She will receive all 
information that is required by federal regulations and ICH guidelines.  The Principal Investigator or designee will provide the Sponsor  with a copy of the IRB -approv ed informed 
consent form prior to the start of the study.  
The informed consent document must be signed and dated; one copy will be given  to the patient , 
and the Investigator will retain a copy as part of the clinical study  records.  The Investigator will

 not undertake any investigation specifically required for the clinical study until written consent 
has been obtained.  The terms of the consent and when it was obtained must also be documented.   
If a protocol amendment is required, then the informed consent document may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol.  If the informed consent document is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the responsible IRB/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC), and signed 
by all patient s subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those currently enrolled in 
the clinical study.  
9.6. Protocol Approval and Amendment(s)  
Before the start of the clinical study, the clinical study  protocol and other relevant documents 
will be approved by the IRB, in accordance with local legal requirements.  The Sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient  is enrolled in 
the clinical study.  
This protocol is to be followed exactly.  Any deviations should be agreed by both the Sponsor 
and the Investigator, with the appropriate written and approved protocol amendments made to reflect the changes agreed upon.  Protocol amendments must be released by the responsible staff and must receive IRB approval prior to implementation.  Where a protocol  deviation occurs for 
the well -being of the patient , the Sponsor must be informed of the action. Any deviations and 
protocol violations that occur must be reported to the Sponsor and to the IRB as per local IRB requirements.  
Administrative  changes may be made without the need for a formal amendment, but will also be 
mentioned in the integrated clinical study report.  All amendments will be distributed to all study protocol recipients, with appropriate instructions. 
9.7. Confidentiality Data Prot ection  
All clinical study  findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  Study documents 
(protocols, IBs and other material) will be stored appropriately to ensure their confidentiality.  
The Investigator and members of his/her research team (in cluding the IRB ) must not disclose 
such information without prior wr itten approval from the Sponsor, except to the extent necessary 
to obtain informed consent from patient s who wish to participate in the trial or to comply with 
regulatory requirements.  
The anony mity of participating patients  must be maintained.  Patients  will be specified on study  
documents by their patient number, initial or birth da te, not by name.  Documents that identify

11.1.4. BILAG2004 and SEL ENA SLEDAI Instructions  
GUIDELINES FOR USE OF THE SELENA SLEDAI MODIFIED FOR ASSESSMENT 
OVER 28 DAYS: TO ASSESS DISEASE ACTIVITY  
General guidelines for the SELENA SLEDAI  
(Hybrid Version using SLEDAI 2K Proteinuria Definition)  
• The main principle to keep in mind is that this instrument is intended to evaluate current 
lupus activity and not chronic damage, severity is accounted for in part by the 
"weightedness" of the scale.  
• Points are given exactly as defined.  
• A descriptor is either scored the exact points  allotted or not scored, i.e. given a zero. 
Descriptors are scored only if they are present at the time of the physician encounter or in 
the preceding 28 days. (The SLEDAI 2K instrument is validated both for the original use 
with a 10 day window and for the use of a 28 day window, and any of the SLEDAI 
versions can be used with a 28 day window). Small deviations in this window which are 
allowed in a clinical trial protocol for monthly visits are acceptable in scoring the 
SLEDAI. However, it is never acceptable to fill in gaps which cover activity over 2 -3 
months or more. The reason for this is that disease activity at the visit might have 
changed several times in such intervals and the recording of distant activity becomes 
meaningless.  
 
Please note that in the original SLEDAI the disease activity being scored was meant to 
cover only a ten day period, the modification to 28 days is a more useful assessment for 
use in clinical trials, in order to capture disease activity between monthly visits. However 
the SLE DAI does require documented confirmation of events that may have occurred and 
resolved between visits.  
It is critical to record all new events that have developed during this time, for which there 
are very convincing lupus symptoms and/or signs consistent with glossary definitions for

at the last visit disappears soon after the last visit (within one week) then the item is not 
recorded on the SELENA SLEDAI form.   
•The d escriptors which are scored must be documented by the notes written in the
physician encounter form. This rule generally applies to the clinical data and not to the
laboratory data. The laboratory data is strictly defined as per cutoffs and documentation i s
provided by the reports from the commercial laboratory.
•Descriptors do not have to be new but can be. They can be ongoing, recurrent, or initial
events. Each would be scored the same way. An example would be a malar rash or
mucosal ulcer. In these situat ions a malar rash observed at the initial visit but which
remains unchanged for the next six months, irrespective of any treatment, is scored 2
points each time the SLEDAI is completed. Since the nature of lupus is that clinically
significant manifestation s are not usually fleeting it would be rare for descriptors to be
present during the month and not seen at the time of the encounter. This is discussed in
more detail for each descriptor but is especially relevant for some neurologic, pulmonary,
and cutaneous manifestations. A major exception would be seizure, due to lupus, which
requires solid documentation but obviously would not need to be continuing at the time
of the visit.
•In some descriptors the exclusions written may not be exhaustive. The intent of the
SLEDAI is that the descriptor be attributed to SLE. If the physician does not attribute the
descriptor to SLE it should not be scored, but documentation in support of this decision
must be provided.
Written in italics is the definition for each descriptor precisely provided in the SLEDAI SCORE 
SEIZURE  
Definition: Recent onset (last 28 days). Exclude metabolic, infectious or drug cause, or seizure 
due to past irreversible CNS damage. 
This descriptor is scored if the patient has had a witnessed seizure or convincing description 
(such as tongue biting or incontinence) within 30 days of the current encounter. The patient need 
not have a positive EEG, CT scan, PET scan, QEEG, or MRI. The CSF may be totally normal. 
A seizure is also not counted: 
1.If a metabolic cause is determined.
2. In the presence of a proven infectious meningitis, brain abscess, or fungal foci.
3.If there is a history of recent head trauma.
4. In the presence of an offending drug.
5.In the presence of severe hyperthermia or hypothermia.
6.If the patient has stopped taking anticonvulsant medication.
7. If the patient has a documented sub-therapeutic anticonvulsant drug level.

 PSYCHOSIS  
Definition: Altered ability to function in normal activity due to severe disturbance in the 
perception of reality. Include hallucinations, incoherence, marked loose associations, 
impoverished thought content, marked illogical thinking, bizarre, disorganized, or catatonic 
behavior. Exclude uremia and drug causes.  
This descriptor is scored if any of the criteria above ar e met.  
With regard to drug causes the most problematic situation is glucocorticoids. If the treating 
physician attributes the psychosis to glucocorticoids this descriptor should not be counted.  
ORGANIC BRAIN SYNDROME  
Definition: Altered mental function with impaired orientation, memory or other intellectual 
function, with rapid onset and fluctuating clinical features. Include clouding of consciousness 
with reduced capacity to focus, and inability to sustain attention to environment, plus at least 
two of th e following: perceptual disturbance, incoherent speech, insomnia or daytime 
drowsiness, or increased or decreased psychomotor activity. Exclude metabolic, infectious or 
drug causes.  
a. reduced capacity to focus as exemplified by new inability to perform every day 
mathematical computations or disorientation to person, place, time, or purpose  
 
OR 
b. inability to carry on a conversation  
 
OR 
c. reduction in short term memory  
PLUS: Documented abnormality on neuropsychiatric testing  
Neuropsychiatric testing may take the f orm of a "mini- mental -status exam" or a formal 
neuropsychiatric examination. The important aspect for scoring OBS is that it be reversible. 
Consideration should be given to the improvement of OBS after institution of glucocorticoids.  
This descriptor is not  scored in the presence of a metabolic, infectious, or drug cause. If the 
problem is chronic this descriptor is not scored in SLEDAI but is scored on the damage index.  
VISUAL DISTURBANCE  
Definition: Retinal and eye changes of SLE. Include cytoid bodies, r etinal hemorrhages, serous 
exudate or hemorrhages in the choroid, optic neuritis, scleritis or episcleritis. Exclude 
hypertension, infection or drug causes. 
This is scored exactly as defined with the understanding that it must be supported by objective 
evidence.

CRANIAL NERVE DISORDER 
Definition: New onset of sensory or motor neuropathy involving cranial nerves. Include vertigo 
due to lupus. 
This is scored exactly as defined with the understanding that it must be supported by objective 
evidence. However,  it should be noted that hydroxychloroquine can affect the eighth cranial 
nerve.  
LUPUS HEADACHE  
Definition: Severe persistent headache: may be migrainous, but must be non- responsive to 
narcotic analgesia. 
For this descriptor to be counted, the headache mus t be present for greater than 24 hours and 
must not be responsive to narcotic analgesia. Objective documentation need not be present 
although it is expected that such a complaint, given the severity, would prompt formal testing 
such as MRI, CT, LP, etc. Furthermore, the headache should be of sufficient severity to warrant 
the initiation of glucocorticoids or additional immunosuppressive agents. Scoring of this 
descriptor means attribution of the headache to CNS lupus.  
Most headaches, including most severe a nd/or migrainous headaches are not attributable to lupus 
and this descriptor should only be scored very rarely.  
CVA  
Definition: New onset of cerebrovascular accident (s). Exclude arteriosclerosis or hypertensive 
causes.  
This descriptor is scored if the pat ient has had a CVA within 28 days of the current encounter. A 
patient recovering from a CVA that was documented more than 28 days prior to the current 
encounter is not given points for this descriptor. A patient may have had a previous CVA but to 
be scored  the current CVA must be new.  
This descriptor is scored in the presence or absence of anti -phospholipid antibodies, i.e., the 
precise pathophysiologic mechanism need not be known. 
The CVA is scored even in the presence of a normal CT or MRI. A TIA is also scored if the 
patient gives a convincing history. To exclude atherosclerosis the patient has to have a normal 
carotid and/or vertebral Doppler and cannot have uncontrolled hypertension. 
VASCULITIS  
Definition: Ulceration, gangrene, tender finger nodules, periungual infarction, splinter 
hemorrhages, or biopsy or angiogram proof of vasculitis.  
To score this descriptor the above definitions must be present. For example, erythematous 
lesions on the hands or feet which may be characteristically considered "leukocytoclastic 
vasculitis" but do not fulfill at least one of the above definitions and if not biopsied, are not

 counted. Similarly livedo reticularis is not counted. Healed ulcers with residual scar are not to be 
counted, but be sure to count these in the damage index. A lesion consistent with erythema 
nodosum should be counted regardless of whether it is biopsied or not. Purpura in the presence 
of a normal platelet count should be counted regardless of whether it has been biopsied or not. 
ARTHRITIS  
Definition: More than two joints with pain and signs of inflammation, i.e., tenderness, swelling, 
or effusion. 
Arthritis is scored if it is ongoing; it need not be new or recurrent.  
Arthritis is scored only if more than two joints manifest signs of inflammation. F or example if 
only the right second and left third PIPs are involved or only both wrists, points for this 
descriptor are not given.  
Inflammation is strictly defined in this activity index as the presence of tenderness  (the patient 
complains of pain on palpating the joint or upon going through range of motion) PLUS  any one 
of the following:  
1. swelling  
2. effusion  
3. warmth  
4. erythema, but must exclude overlying cellulitis  
The presence of tenderness alone is not sufficient. A patient's complaints of pain in specific 
joints without objective findings is not sufficient. An exception would be arthritis of the hip in 
which case pain in the groin on range of motion accompanied by decreased range of motion in 
the absence of swelling, warmth, or erythema would be counted.  Inflammation of the tendons, 
ligaments, bursae, and other periarticular structures are not scored. For example subacromial 
bursitis and trochanteric bursitis are not scored. If further evaluation reveals osteonecrosis or 
osteoarthritis, this descriptor is n ot counted.  
MYOSITIS  
Definition: Proximal muscle aching/weakness, associated with elevated creatine 
phosphokinase/aldolase or electromyogram changes or a biopsy showing myositis. 
The patient complains of muscle aching and/or weakness in the proximal muscl es PLUS one of 
the following must be present:  
1. elevated serum creatine phosphokinase and/or aldolase  
2. abnormalities on electromyogram consistent with myositis  
3. biopsy -proven myositis  
URINARY CASTS  
Definition: Heme -granular or red blood cell casts. 
This is sco red if red blood cell casts are seen, even if it is only one. Pigmented casts are counted 
but non- pigmented granular casts, hyaline or waxy casts are not counted.  
HEMATURIA 
Definition: >5 red blood cells/high power field. Exclude stone, infection or other cause.  
With regard to this descriptor, every attempt should be made to see patients when they are not 
menstruating. If this is not possible the urinalysis should be deferred until the next visit.  
This descriptor is not scored if there is documented renal c alculi or infection. The latter must be 
confirmed by a positive urinary culture. However it is acknowledged that associated conditions 
such as chlamydia or urethral irritation may result in mild hematuria and the physician's best 
judgment is warranted. The important point is attribution: there must be other evidence of 
nephritis and other causes of hematuria must be excluded.

 Page 111 of 132 29 July 2016  
 In the complete absence of proteinuria, attribution of hematuria to active nephritis would be very 
unlikely unless pathology is limi ted to the mesangium.  
PROTEINURIA  
Definition: more than 0.5 g/24 hours attributed to lupus nephritis.  
PYURIA  
Definition: >5 white blood cells/high power field. Exclude infection.  
This descriptor is not scored if there is evidence of vaginal contamination ( presence of any 
squamous epithelial cells) or a documented infection. The latter must be confirmed by a positive 
urinary culture. However, it is acknowledged that associated conditions such as chlamydia, 
trichomonas or urethral irritation may result in mild pyuria and the physician's best judgment is 
warranted. The important point is attribution; there must be other evidence of nephritis, 
and other causes of pyuria should be excluded.  In the complete absence of proteinuria, 
attribution of hematuria to activ e nephritis would be very unlikely unless pathology is limited to 
the interstitium.  
RASH  
Definition: Ongoing inflammatory lupus rash. 
A rash is scored if it is ongoing, new or recurrent. Even if it is identical in terms of distribution 
and character to that observed on the last visit and the intensity is improved, it is counted. 
Therefore, despite improvement in a rash, if it is still on going it represents disease activity. The 
rash must be attributable to SLE. A description of the rash must appear in the physical exam and 
should include distribution, characteristics such as macular or papular, and size.  
The following should not be score d: 
1. Chronic scarred discoid plaques in any location.  
2. Transient malar flush, i.e., it is not raised and is evanescent  
A common problem one may encounter is the differentiation between scoring a lesion as "rash" 
and/or "vasculitis". If a lesion meets the desc riptive criteria of the latter it should not also be 
counted as rash, i.e., the score would be 8 points not 10 points. If a separate rash characteristic of 
SLE is present only then would "rash" also be scored. 
ALOPECIA:  
Definition: Ongoing abnormal, patchy  or diffuse loss of hair due to active lupus. 
This should be scored if any of the following conditions are present:  
1. There is temporal thinning which is newly present for less than six months (if temporal 
alopecia is present for more than six months with no change it should not be counted)  
2. Areas of scalp with total bald spots if present for less than six months (does not need to 
have accompanying discoid lesion or follicular plugging)  
3. The presence of "lupus frizz" i.e., short of strands of unruly hair in the frontal or temporal 
area 
If a patient complains of hair loss and there is nothing apparent on exam this descriptor is not 
scored.  
MUCOSAL ULCERS:  
Definition: Ongoing oral or nasal ulcerations due to active lupus. 
An ulcer is scored if it is ongoing, it n eed not be new or recurrent. Ulcers can be present in either 
the nose or oral cavity. Erythema alone without frank ulceration is not sufficient to be scored, 
even if the erythema is present on the upper palate. Ulcers on the buccal mucosa and tongue are 
counted.  
Mucosal ulcers are not counted as vasculitis.

 Page 112 of 132 29 July 2016  
 PLEURISY  
Definition: Classic and severe pleuritic chest pain or pleural rub or effusion or new pleural 
thickening due to lupus. 
This descriptor is scored if the patient complains of pleuritic chest pain lasting greater than 12 
hours. The pain should be classic, i.e., exacerbated by inspiration, to help distinguish it from 
musculoskeletal conditions such as costochondritis, which could be confused with pleurisy. The 
symptom does not have to be accompanied by any objective findings. The presence of objective 
findings such as pleural rub or pleural effusions (in the absence of infection, congestive heart 
failure, malignancy, or nephrosis) is counted, even if not accompanied by symptoms. New 
pleural thickening  should be counted only if other causes as described above are absent.  
PERICARDITIS:  
Definition: Classic and severe pericardial pain or rub or effusion, or electrocardiogram, or echo 
confirmation. 
The symptom does not have to be accompanied by objective findings.  
LOW COMPLEMENT:  
Definition: Decrease in CH50, C3 or C4 below the lower limit of normal for testing laboratory.  
Exclude a low C4 or CH50 in patients with known inherited deficiency of C4. 
INCREASED DNA BINDING  
Definition: >25% binding by Farr assay or above normal range for testing laboratory. 
FEVER:  
Definition: >38°C. Exclude infectious cause.  
This would be scored if one of the following conditions are present:  
1. A documented temperature elevation >100.4°F or >38°C at the time of the visit.  
2. A convincing history from the patient that she/he has been febrile within the preceding 10 
days prior to the visit without any signs or symptoms suggestive of infection. Febrile is 
defined as above and not  simply that the patient felt feverish. In this case the patient need 
not be febrile at the time of the visit for a score of 2 to be given.  
As stated in the SLEDAI, fever secondary to infection is not to be scored although it is 
acknowledged that concomita nt lupus activity and infection can occur. Fever in the presence of 
infection should only be scored on the SLEDAI if other evidence of lupus activity is present.  
THROMBOCYTOPENIA:  
Definition: <100,000 platelets/mm3. 
LEUKOPENIA:  
Definition: <3,000 white bl ood cells/mm3. Exclude drug causes.  
This is exactly as described, WBC <3,000/mm3. The presence of an absolute lymphopenia does 
not count in the SLEDAI. A note of caution, do not confuse this WBC with that used to satisfy 
the ACR criteria for SLE which is W BC <3,500/mm3. 
With regard to current use of possible offending drugs, the following guidelines are to be 
considered:  
1. The nadir after cyclophosphamide, i.e., low WBC at 10 days after receiving 
cyclophosphamide in a patient known to have a WBC ≥ 3,000 at the time of receiving 
cyclophosphamide should not be counted.  
2. Do not score leukopenia appearing after initiation of a new medication known to be 
associated with leukopenia, such as azathioprine or sulfa drugs. If the patient develops a 
WBC <3000 while taking  drugs which may cause leukopenia, score this only if the 
dosage of medication is unchanged since the last WBC determination.

 CLASSIC SELENA SLEDAI FLARE INDEX (SFI) instructions  
THE SELENA SLEDAI FLARE INDEX RULES ARE FOLLOWED EXPLICITLY AS 
WRITTEN. HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME CLARIFICATIONS TO KEEP IN MIND 
WHEN USING THE SELENA SLEDAI COMPOSITE INDEX.  
 
Instructions for using the SELENA SLEDAI Physicians Global Assessment Scale  
This P GA is a modification of the classic analogue scale in that it is anchored with numbers from 
0-3 demarcating mild, moderate and severe disease. Please note several things about this scale. 
The number 3 indicates severe disease and is at the very end of the scale. This refers to the most 
severe possible disease, and does not reflect the most severe ever seen in a particular patient but 
the most severe disease ever seen in all SLE patients. Therefore, the line made by the physician 
along this scale should virt ually never get to this edge. Any disease rated greater than 2.5 is very 
severe. The range of moderate disease covers about 1.5 -2.4. Mild disease falls below 1.5. 
Clearly, this is a bit like a logarithmic scale with greater distances or demarcations possib le 
among more mild -moderate symptoms. This needs to be kept in mind when scoring the 
instrument.  
When scoring the PGA always look back at the score from the previous visit and move the mark 
relative to that previous visit. This is a global assessment, factoring in all aspects of the patients 
lupus disease activity. It should not reflect non- lupus medical conditions.  
These instructions are quite discrete from those given for other analogue (Lichert) scales and are 
specific for the scoring of the SELENA SLED AI PGA.  
 
When is a flare not a flare?  
It is important to keep in mind that on the SELENA SLEDAI flare index flare can be defined 
simply by a decision to institute new therapy for lupus disease activity, whether or not the patient 
meets the other criteria for flare listed. It is important for the physician not to override the intent 
of the instrument which is to actually define flare in this manner. However there are logical 
exceptions, for which a common sense rule may prevail. Switching treatments for saf ety reasons, 
or increasing treatment in patients who are improving might often warrant withdrawal from a 
protocol. However if the protocol allows these medication changes, the flare index will need to 
be scored, but it does not make sense to call these sit uations flares.

he increase in disease activity should be severe enough in all cases such that an increase in 
treatment, commensurate with the severity level chosen, would be appropriate. However it is not 
necessary that the treatment actually be started, given that there are t oo many variables in what 
the patient may have recently started that has not had time to take effect, or treatment withholding due to current infections, side effects, compliance etc.

3.INTRODUCTION
As per International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E9 (1), the purpose of this 
document is to provide a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of 
theanalysis described in the protocol, andto include detailed procedures for executing the 
statistical analy sis of the primary  and secondary  variables and other data.
This Trial Statistical Analy sis Plan (TSAP) assumes familiarit y with the Clinical Trial 
Protocol (CTP), including Protocol Amendments. In particular, the TSAP is based on the 
planned anal ysis specification as written in CTP Section 7 “Statistical Methods and 
Determination of Sample Size.” Therefore, TSAP readers may consult the CTP for more 
background information on the study , e.g., on study  objectives, study  design and population, 
treatments, definition of measurements and variables, planning of sample size, randomisation.
SAS®Version 9. 4 or later will be used for all analy ses.
4.CHANGES IN THE PLANNED ANAL YSIS OF  THE STUDY

This is a parall el-group trial consisting of a screening and run- in period of at least 4 four 
week duration, a 12 -
week randomised treatment period and a three week (21 day s) follow up 
period
For the main safet y anal ysis, data occurring during the treatment period between first double -
blind drug intake date and within 21 day s after the last drug intake date is assigned to and 
analysed under the respective treatment. Data occurring before the first drug intake date is 
assigned to screening/run -in period. Data more than 21 day s after the end of the last treatment 
period and up to and including the date of the study  termination will be assigned to follow -
up.
Any cases of patient being treated with the wrong study  medication will be identified and 
summarized as an important pr otocol violation.
If a patient was treated with a study  medication different from the randomized 
treatment throughout the on
-treatment period, this patient will be included in the 
treated set and will be analy sed as treated under the initial study  medicati on received 
on Day  1 for both efficacy  and safet y analyses. Such a case will be reported as an 
important protocol violation and this patient will be excluded from the per -protocol 
set (PPS)
If a patient was treated with incorrect stud y medication during pa rt of the on-
treatment period, this patient will be included in the treated set and will be anal ysed 
under the initial study  medication received on Day 1 for both efficacy  and safet y 
analyses. For safet y analyses, the actual incorrect study  medication is l isted as the 
actual treatment at onset of an y adverse event in the subject data listings. Such a case 
will be reported as an important protocol violation and a decision will be made 
whether to exclude this patient from the PPS at the blinded report plannin g meeting 
(BRPM) on a case -by case basis before unblinding.
6.2IMPORTANT PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS
A patient’s deviation from the trial protocol is considered “important” if it can be expected 
that the deviation had a distorting influence on the assessment of the treatment effect on the 
primary  endpoint of the trial or could affect the patient’s safet y or rights.
Table 6.2: 1 gives the important PVs for this trial. The final decision with regard to important 
PVs and exclusion from the PP S will be made at the final BRPM. Some important PVs will 
be set automaticall y; others will need a decision at a Medical Quality  Review Meeting 
(MQRM) or BRPM or through team review of the manual PV log.

In the case that a patient is randomized in both t his trial and another trial or is randomized at 
two different sites in this study  the patient will be indicated as having IPV A2 (see Table 6.2: 
1). The following process will be followed with regards to the patient’s data.
Allefficacy  data will be excluded from the anal ysis and the patient will be excluded 
from the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) (this trial or both trials as appropriate).
The only  safet y data which will be reported is exposure and serious adverse events 
(SAEs). Thes e will be analy sed according to the treatment which the patient actually  
received. If the patient is randomized twice in this study  and both treatments are the 
same, the patient’s data will be combined (i.e., the patient is only  counted once). If the 
patient participates in two different trials in the project, he/she will be reported 
separately  for each trial. As well, care will be taken with regard to the SAE narratives 
as to whether data for one patient number is relevant for an SAE under the other 
patient number.
For disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics the patient will be anal ysed 
as treated. If the patient is randomized twice in this study  and the treatments are 
different, the patient will be counted under each treatment. A footnote w ill be 
included in the disposition table identify ing the situation and noting that the patient is 
counted twice for disposition as well as baseline data and important protocol 
violations.
The final decision with regards to important protocol violations an d exclusion from the PPS 
will be made at the final BRPM or database lock meeting before unblinding.

6.3PATIENT SETS ANALYZED
There are four patient sets defined in this trial:
Randomised Set (RS)
This patient set includes all patients who signed the informed consent form and were 
also randomised, regardless whether the patient was treated with trial medication or 
not.
Treated Set (TS)
All randomized patients who were dispensed trial medica tion and were documented to 
have taken an y dose of trial medication.
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS)
This patient set is nested within the TS and includes patients who had baseline and at 
least one post -baseline measurement for at least one  efficacy  endpoint. The FAS will 
be used for the primary  analy ses of the primary  efficacy  endpoint and for all other 
efficacy  endpoints.
Per Protocol Set (PPS)
This patient set is nested within the FAS and only  includes patients who had no 
important PVs which are specified to be excluded from the efficacy  anal ysis. (see 
Table 6.2: 1) .
The final decision regarding which patients are included in PPS will be made at 
BRPM prior to data unblinding.
  If the number of patients in PPS is less than 90% of the number of patients in FAS, the 
primary  anal ysis for the primary  endpoint will also be performed on the PPS as supportive 
analyses.
The anal ysis will be compliant with I CH guideline (5)

6.5POOLING OF CENTRES
This section is not applicable because centre/country  is not included in the statistical model.
6.6HANDLING OF MISSING DATA AND OUTLIERS
Every  effort should be made to collect complete data for each time point on each test day . 
6.6.1 Spirom etry data 
The REML -based MMRM model described in Section 7.3.1 will handle missing data due to 
early drop outs or missing data in between visits which are assumed to be missing at random.
Adjusted multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data in a sensitivity  anal ysis. 
Details are described in Section 7.4. 
FEV 1and FVC measurements
FEV 1and FVC measurements at individual time points that are flagged as unacceptable by  
the vendor will be set to missing prior to appl yingany missing data imputation rules. Missing 
FEV 1and FVC measurements at a given in -clinic visit will be imputed by  the available data 
from the patient at that visit. Completely  missing visits will not be imputed and will be 
handled through the MMRM statis tical model expect for cases where a patient discontinues 
due to an AE indicative of worsening of COPD .For the case of discontinuing due to an AE 
indicative of worsening of COPD , completely  missing visits will be imputed with the worst 
observation observe d before discontinuation. 

Boehringer Ingel heim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1237-0063 Page 15of 23
Proprietary confidential information © 2019 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
Discontinuation due to an AE indicative of worsening of COPD will be determined as 
follows.
Check that the reason for discontinuation on the termination of trial medication is 
adverse event .
Get the AE flagged b y the investigato r as the primary  reason for discontinuation of 
trial medication .
Check whether this AE belongs to the group of AEs identified as corresponding to 
either COPD exacerbation or lower respiratory  disorders.  This will be based on the 
BI system in place for grouping MedDRA preferred terms into medical concepts 
(currently  referred to as pharmacovigilance endpoints).
Additional details on the imputation of missing data for specific cases are provided below:
Any visit occurring more than one day  after discontinuat ion of study  medication which 
has non- missing data will not be used in the anal ysis. 
For patients taking a short- acting beta agonist ( SABA) or short -acting anticholinergic 
(SAMA) as rescue medication during Visit 3 and 4, any  subsequent FEV 1and FVC 
meas urements from the time of rescue use until time of rescue plus 8 hours (e.g., 2:17 to 
10:17) will be set to missing and imputed b y the worst non
-missing (either observed or 
imputed) observation for that visit strictly  prior to the administration of the rescue 
medication (even if it is a pre -dose value, either observed or imputed). If there are FEV 1
and FVC measurements after the 8 -hour window they  will be considered valid and not 
imputed provided that they  are not in the 8-hour window for a subsequent rescu e 
medication use . If rescue medication is taken at any on -treatment in -clinic visit and there 
is no rescue medication time given, data for the entire visit will be considered missing and 
it will be handled the same way  as the case where all measurements af ter rescue use are 
set to missing.
For randomly  missing data (not due to worsening of study  disease or rescue medication 
use), the following rules will be applied:
If one of the two pre -dose measurements at Visit 2 is missing, it will be imputed with 
the other predose measurement.
Missing 10 minute pre -dose measurement at Visits 3 and 4 will be imputed with the 
average of the 23h and 24h post -dose measurements at the same visit if both 23h and 
24h time points have non- missing values, or will be imputed with the non- missing 
measurement at 23h or 24h.
If one of the post -dose 23h and 24h measurements is missing at a visit, then impute 
the missing post -dose measurement with the non -missing one.
Boehringer Ingel heim
TSAP for BI Trial No: 1237-0063 Page 16of 23
Proprietary confidential information © 2019 Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
If both of the post -dose 23h and 24h measurements are missing a nd the 10 -min pre -
dose measurement is non- missing at a visit, then impute missing 23h and 24h 
measurements with the non- missing 10- min pre -dose measurement from the same 
visit.
6.6.2 SGRQ and CAT data
Missing answers for COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and St. Geo rge’s Respiratory  
Questionnaire (SGRQ) will be handled based on related manuals [R12- 1915R12 -2870].
If the baseline SGRQ and CAT 
is missing the patient will be excluded from all SGRQ and 
CAT anal yses, respectively .
Completely  missing visits will not be imp uted and will be handled through the MMRM 
statistical model. 
In cases where an entire on -
treatment visit is missing after a patient discontinues due to an 
AE indicative of worsening COPD, all SGRQ component scores and the SGRQ total score as 
well as CAT score will be imputed using the least favorable prior values for the respective 
scores.
If SGRQ total score and the CAT score is missing at a visit, the patient will be counted as 
non-responder for the SGRQ and CAT responder analy sis, respectivel y,at that visit.  
6.6.3 Safety data
Missing safet y data will not be imputed with the exception of missing AE dates which will be 
imputed according to BI standards (see Boehringer Ingelheim Data Management and 
Statistics Manual (DM&SM) “Handling of missing and incomplete AE dates” (2 ),(3),(4 ).
6.7BASELINE, TIME WINDOWS AND CALCULATED VISITS
The definition of baseline values for FEV 1can be found in Section 5 of the CTP. The mean 
of the two pre -dose pulmonary  function test measurements at Visit 2, 1 ho ur prior and 10 
minutes prior to the administration of the first dose of the randomised treatment, is used as 
the baseline FEV 1and FVC, respectivel y. For CAT and SGRQ the measurements at Visit 2 is 
defined as baseline.
Planned and actual study  day will b e included in the anal ysis data sets. These will both be 
calculated relative to the beginning of study as indicated in the following table (nominal 
visits). See Table 6.7: 1

For End -of-Text ( EoT) tables, the set of summary  statistics for descriptive display s is: N / 
Mean / SD / Min / Median / Max. 
Tabulations of frequencies for categorical data will include all possible categories and will 
display  the number of observations in a category  as well as the percentag e (%) relative to the 
respective treatment group (unless otherwise specified, all patients in the respective patient 
set whether they  have non -missing values or not). Percentages will be rounded to one decimal 
place. The category  missing will be display ed only if there are actuall y missing values.
7.1DEMOGRA PHIC AND OTHER BA SELINE CHA RACTERISTICS
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report. COPD background 
characteristics will be listed only .
GOLD A -D 2017 classifications will be summarized by treatment group.
7.2CONCOMITA NT DISEA SES A ND MEDICA TION
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report. A table of number (%) of 
patients with concomitant diagnoses (CDs) by  system organ class (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT) will be included along with a supporting listing. Concomitant diagnoses will be coded 
with the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
in effect at database lock.
Frequency  tables (%) will be presented for medica l history  and COPD background 
characteristics. 
Pulmonary  medication will be summarized as the number (%) of patients taking pulmonary

7.3TREA TMENT COMPLIA NCE
Only  descr iptive statistics are planned for this section of the report. Summary  statistics will 
be given for percent compliance along with the number (%) of patients with compliance in 
the categories <80% or >120% , 80% - 120%.
7.4PRIMA RY ENDPOINT
In the primary  anal yses, comparisons between treatment groups for the primary  endpoint will 
be based on a mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM). Change from baseline in 
FEV 1AUC 0-24h, will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)- based 
repeated measures a pproach. This model will include treatment, visit and treatment by  visit 
interaction as fixed effects, and baseline as well as baseline b y visit interaction as covariates. 
An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within patient errors . The 
SAS procedure MIXED will be used for the restricted maximum likelihood estimation and 
Kenward -Roger approximation for denominator degrees of freedom. Adjusted mean values 
as well as treatment contrasts will be presented together with 95% confidence i ntervals. The 
primary  treatment comparisons will be the contrasts between treatments after 12 weeks of 
treatment.
PROC MIXED DATA=alldat cl method=reml order=formatted;

MODEL ept = ptrsort *tptno eptbase *tptno

REPEATED tptno / subject= usubjid type=un r rcorr; 
LSMEANS tptno* ptrsort / pdiff=all om cl alpha=0.05 slice=tptno; 
RUN; 
Here tptno is the planned anal ysis day  number for each visit. The endpoint is ept, baseline 
value of the endpoint is eptbase, t reatment is ptrsort and patient number is usubjid .  
In the event of non -convergence, the following methods will be attempted (in order) to 
overcome it:
1. Add the ‘singular=1e -10’ option in the model statement – This raises the threshold at 
which columns are declared linearl y dependent (from ty picall y 1e-12). 
2. Set ‘maxiter=100’ in the Proc Mixed statement – This increases the number of 
convergence iterations used from a default of 50. 
3. Set ‘scoring=4’ to specify  use of the Fisher scoring algorithm in the first 4 iterations. 
4. Include the statement ‘performance nothread’ 
–this removes multi -threading from the
calculations. 
If the number of patients in PPS is less than 90% of the number of patients in FAS, then the 
primary  anal yses for the primary  efficacy  endpoints will be repeated using PPS and the 
results will be presented as supportive anal yse

7.4.1 Adjusted Multiple Imputation sensitivity analysis for missing data
The MMRM primary  analy sis implicitly  accounts for missing observations under the MAR 
(missing at random) assumption. The robustness of the primary  anal ysis to the MNAR 
(missing not at random) assumption will be assessed by  performing an adjusted multiple 
imputation sensitivity  analy sis.
The aim of the multiple imputation approach is to a ssess the robustness of the primary  
analysis with respect to departures from MAR by  apply ing specific shift parameters to 
missing data in the T+O 5/5 arm, corresponding to substantially  worse outcomes for these 
patients. 
As a first step non -monotone missing data will be imputed m = 100 times using MCMC 
(Markov Chain Monte Carlo) under an assumption of MAR to generate m data sets with 
monotone missingness. This large number of imputations is chosen to minimize the standard 
error of the estimates. The seed number will be set to 123763. 
The monotone missing data in the 100 generated datasets will then be imputed once per each 
of the 100 imputations using sequential regression including baseline FEV 1and Week 6 
FEV 1AUC 0-24has covariates in the model, with a shift parameters S applied to the treatment 
arm T+O 5/5 at the first missing visit and no shift applied to the F+S 250/50 treatment arm. 
Subsequent visits will have no additional shift but due to the sequential method, the impact of 
the initial shift wil l propagate to all future visits.
Point estimates for treatment differences and respective p- values will be reported for all S.
Selection of S
a. -250 ml (large shift, conservative anal ysis)
b. -125 ml,
c. negative 
treatment difference from the primary  analysis
7.5SECONDARY ENDPOINTS
7.5.1 Key secondary endpoint
This section is not applicable as no key  secondary endpoint has been specified in the 
protocol.
7.5.2 (Other) Secondary endpoints
The MMRM model described for the primary  analy sis will be performed for the cont inuous
secondary  endpoints. Adjusted mean values as well as treatment contrasts will be presented
together with the 95% confidence intervals. All calculated p -values should be considered
descriptive for the anal ysis of the secondary  endpoints.

7.7EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
Extent of exposure will be summarized us ing descriptive statistics for day s of exposure as 
well as number (%) of patients whose total exposure falls in the categories specified in 
Section 5.4.
7.8SAFETY ANALYSIS
All safet y anal yses will be performed on the treated set. 
7.8.1 Adverse events
Unless otherwise specified, the anal yses of adverse events will be descriptive in nature. All 
analyses of AEs will be based on the number of subjects with AEs and NOT on the number 
of AEs.
For anal ysis multiple AE occurrence data on the CRF wi ll be collapsed into an AE provided 
that all of the following applies:
All AE attributes are identical (LLT, intensity , action taken, therapy  required, seriousness, 
reason for seriousness, relationship, outcome) .
The occurrences were time -overlapping or t ime-adjacent (time -adjacency  of 
2occurrences is given if the second occurrence started on the same day  or on the day  
after the end of the first occurrence).
For further details on summarization of AE data, please refer to (3, 4) .

The anal ysis of adverse events will be based on the concept of treatment emergent adverse 
events. That means that all adverse events occurring between first drug intake till last drug 
intake + residual effect period will be assigned to the randomised tr eatment. All adverse 
events occurring before first drug intake will be assigned to ‘screening’ and all adverse events 
occurring after the residual effect period wi llbe assigned to ‘post -treatment’ (for listings 
only). For details on the treatment definiti on, see Section 6.1.
According to ICH E3 AEs classified as ‘other significant’ needs to be reported and will 
include those non -serious and non-significant adverse events with 
(i) ‘action taken = discontinuation’ or ‘action taken = reduced’, or
(ii) marked haematological and other lab abnormalities or lead to significant concomitant 
therap y as identified b y the Clinical Monitor/I nvestigator at a Medical Quality  Review 
Meeting.
An overall summary  of adverse events will be presented. 
The frequency  of subjects with adverse events will be summarised by  treatment, primary  
system organ class and preferred term (mention MedDRA levels to be display ed in the 
tables). Separate tables will be provided for subjects with other significant adve rse events 
according to ICH E3 and for subjects with serious adverse events.
The sy stem organ classes will be sorted alphabetically , preferred terms will be sorted by  
frequency  (within s ystem organ class).
7.9LABORATORY DATA
The absolute eosinophil count rec orded at Visit 1 and 2 will be anal ysed descriptively .
7.10 VITAL SIGNS
Only  descriptive statistics are planned for this section of the report.
7.11 ECG
Not applicable since ECG data will not be collected in the database.
7.12 OTHERS
Not applicable since there were no ad ditional endpoints.

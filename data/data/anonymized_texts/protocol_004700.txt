Alcon – Business Use Only  3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Study Rationale and Purpose  
The investigational  contact lens is intended for the optical correction of refractive ametropia 
in persons with nondiseased eyes . 
The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical performance of the investigational Alcon 
serafilcon A contact lenses with marketed AOHP conta ct lenses .  
 
 
The design of this study is justified based upon preclinical and clinical 
testing, as described within the Investigator’s Brochure.  AOHP contact lenses were chosen as 
the comparator product because these lenses also are reusable contact lenses  (see Package 
Insert for AOHP co ntact lenses) . 
 
 
 
 
.  
3.2 Trial Objective  
The objective of this study is to assess the clinical performance of two reus able silicone 
hydrogel contact lenses when worn on a daily wear modality.  
3.3 Risks and Benefits  
Contact lenses may offer improved peripheral vision and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles.  Material properties and design characteristics of the Alcon sera filcon A contact 
lens are  features consistent with successful contact lens wear.  
A summary of the known potential risks and benefits associated with the investigational  
Alcon serafilcon A contact lens can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure  (see Package 
Insert for AOHP contact lenses) . Risks are minimized by compliance with the eligibility 
criteria and study procedures, and through close supervision by a licensed clinician during 
exposure to the study lenses. The potential harms associated with on -eye exposure to the new 
lens materials include toxicity response, blurred vision and ocular discomfort. In general, the 
risks with the investigational  contact lens are anticipated to be similar to other marketed soft 
contact lenses.

Alcon – Business Use Only  The site personnel wi ll educate subjects on proper hygiene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to 
wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming. The site personnel will also advise the 
subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prompt follow -up of symptoms, such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or hyperemia.  
3.4 Subject Population  
The study population includes approximately 68 volunteer su bjects to be enrolled at 
approximately 5 sites, with approximately 14 subjects enrolled per site. The study population 
will consist of subjects with normal eyes (other than the need for optical correction for 
myopia ), who are adapted, existing wearers of s oft contact lenses in both eyes  for at least the 
past 3 months and who wear contact lenses at least 5 days per week and at least 8 hours per 
day.  
Subjects mus t be screened according to the full list of inclusion/exclusion criteria in Section  1 
of this protocol.  
Rescreening of subjects is not allowed in this study.  
3.5 Outline of Study  
This will be a multi -site, prospective, randomized, double -masked , bilateral, cr ossover  study 
comparing 2  reusable soft contact lenses. The expected duration of subject participation in the 
study  approximately 28 days (~14 days per each lens type) , with 7 scheduled visits.  Subjects 
will be asked to wear their habitual spectacles only (no contact lens wear) during the  washout 
period s of 2 (at least 48 hours) to 4 days after Visit 1 and after Visit 4.   
4 TREATMENTS ADMINISTERED  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 manner to receive treatment (lens) in crossover 
sequence Test product then Comparator product or Comparator product then Test product, 
respectively.

Designated study staff will provide the study lenses to the subjects in accordance with their 
randomization schedule. Throughout the study, the investigator or delegate must maintain 
records of study treat ment dispensation and collection for each subject. This record must be 
made available to the study monitor for the purposes of verifying the accounting of clinical 
supplies. Any discrepancies and/or deficiencies between the observed disposition and the 
written account must be recorded along with an explanation.  
The investigator should make every effort to collect unused lenses, foils , and supplies from 
subjects.  
It is the investigator ’s responsibility to ensure that:  
• All study products are accounted for an d not used in any unauthorized manner . 
• All unused products are available for return to the Study sponsor, as directed . 
• Any study lenses associated with a device deficiency or with any product -related 
adverse event [ i.e., ADE or SADE] are returned to the study sponsor for investigation. 
Refer to Section 7.3 of this protocol for additional information on the reporting of 
device deficiencies and AEs and the return of study products associated with these 
events.  
4.3 Worn Lens Collection, Storage and Return  
Worn le nses from designated sites are to be returned to the study sponsor  as indicated in the 
MOP.  
5 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS  
5.1 Unscheduled Visits  
Any visit that occurs between regularly scheduled visits is an Unscheduled Visit. If a subject 
requires an Unsch eduled Visit, he/she must be advised to return to the office wearing the 
study lenses, if at all possible (unless he/she is experiencing a sign or symptom [as indicated

conduct all procedures  specified in Table  1-1 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments .  
The investigator may perform additional procedures for proper diagnosis and treatment of the 
subject. The investigator must document this information in the subject ’s source documents.  
If during an Unscheduled Visit the subject is discontinuing from the study, the investigator 
must refer to 5.2 Discontinued Subjects . 
Unplanned Lens Replacement is to be used in the event of a device deficiency or i f a lens is 
lost or damaged, so as to maintain lens wear until the follow -up visit.  
5.2 Discontinued Subjects  
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study after signing 
the informed consent, including screen failures. Subjects m ay discontinue from the study at 
any time for any reason. Subjects may also be discontinued from the study at any time if, in 
the opinion of the investigator, their continued participation poses a risk to their health. 
Discontinued subjects will not be rep laced ( i.e., their subject numbers will not be 
reassigned/reused).  
Should a subject exhibit any clinically relevant signs, symptoms, or other clinical 
observations that possibly could be associated with suspected sensitivity or intolerance to one 
of the st udy treatments, the investigator must document those observations on an AE Form.  
Any subject who exits early from the study (excluding screen failures) must undergo all 
procedures outlined in Table 1-1, as possible . 
The investigator must document the reaso n for study or treatment discontinuation in the 
subject ’s case history source documents.  
To ensure the safety of all subjects who discontinue early, investigators must assess each 
subject and, if necessary, advise them of any therapies and/or medical proce dures that may be 
needed to maintain their health.  
5.3 Clinical Study Termination  
The study sponsor reserves the right to close the investigational site or terminate the study in 
its entirety at any time, for reasonable cause.

The above events are based upon the categories provided in the ISO 11980 and the US FDA 
Premarket Notification (510(k)) Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses  
Device Deficiencies  
A device deficiency is inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliabili ty, safety, or performance. A device deficiency may or may not be 
associated with patient harm (i .e., ADE or SADE); however, not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency. The investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Devic e Deficiency eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency and report any patient 
harm separately. Examples of device deficiencies include the following:  
• Failure to meet product specifications (e .g., incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)  
• Lens/solution cloudy  
• Lens surface/edge defect  
• Torn lens during handling/in pack  
• Packaging deficit (e .g., mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)  
• Suspect product contamination  
7.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any 
problems, the investigator should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions  shown 
below and report as applicable : 
• “Have you had any health problems since your la st study visit? ” 
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take because of a new health issue 
since your last study visit? ” 
Additionally, changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnaires evaluated 
during the study are to be reviewe d by the investigator. Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnaire response  that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the investigator, is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically relevant change s will be reported regardless of causality.

Approved Date: 08 Jul 2022  Page 35 of 42 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  7.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting  
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent. Any preexisting medical conditions or 
signs/symptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study (i .e., before  informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study and should be recorded in the Medical 
History section of the eCRF.  
In addition, temporary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the investigato r assesses that the symptom(s) can reasonably resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.  
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity, treatment (if applicable), outcome, and assessments of the  seriousness 
and causality. In addition, the investigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and comparator  products on the Device Deficiency eCRF. The site must 
submit all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device d eficiencies to the study sponsor 
immediately as follows : 
• ADEs or SAEs  are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .  
• A printed copy of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency  eCRF  must be included with product returns.   
• Additional relevant inf ormation after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
• Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary, Autopsy Report,  
Certificate of Death, etc ., if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Ad verse 
Event  and Adverse Device Effect eCRF.  
Note:  Should the EDC system become nonoperational, the site must complete the appropriate 
paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect  and/or Device Deficiency  Form. The 
completed form is emailed to the study sponsor at msus.safety@alcon.com according to the 
timelines outlined above; however, the reported information must be entered into the EDC 
system once it becomes operational.  
Any AEs and device deficiencies for nonstudy marketed devices/products ( i.e., CLEAR 
CARE  Cleaning & Disinfecting Solution ) will be considered and processed as spontaneous

Approved Date: 08 Jul 2022  Page 36 of 42 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  (following the postmarket vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the 
device ’s/product ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
Study sponsor representatives may be contacted for any protocol -related question.  
Further, depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency being reported, the study 
sponsor may request copies of applicable portions of the subject ’s medical records. The 
investig ator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory authorities or IRB/IEC.  
Intensity and Causality Assessments  
Where appropriate, the investigator must assess the intensity (sever ity) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of any subjective symptom(s), as defined below:  
Intensity (Severity)  
Mild  An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily tolerate the sign or 
symptom.  
Moderate  An AE is moderate if the sign or symptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.  
Severe  An AE is severe if the sign or symptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability to work or engage in their usual acti vities.  
For every AE in the study, the investigator must assess the causality (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study procedure). An assessment of causality will also be performed 
by study sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown bel ow: 
Causality  
Related  An AE classified as related may be either definitely related or possibly related 
where a direct cause and effect relationship with the medical device or study 
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility that 
the AE was caused by the medical device or study procedure.  
Not Related  An AE classified as not related may either be definitely unrelated or simply 
unlikely to be related ( i.e., there are other more likely causes for the AE).

V-CLN -0028661  Status: Approved , Version: 4.0 
Approved Date: 08 Jul 2022  Page 37 of 42 
 
Alcon – Business Use Only  The study sponsor will assess the AEs and may upgrade the investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality. The study sponsor will notify the investigator of any AEs that 
are upgraded from nonserious to serious or from unrelated to related.  
7.4 Return product an alysis  
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # which will be provided by study sponsor after the 
case is entered in the study sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Manag ement System. These 
products should be returned to the sponsor at the end of the study, unless instructed otherwise 
by the sponsor.  
7.5 Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events   
The investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjec ts during the 
study and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study.  
The investigator should provide the study sponsor with any new safety information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to p reviously reported AEs) that may affect the safety 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ongoing at time of  subject  
discontinuation or  exit from study, any additional information received at follow -up should 
be documented in the eCRFs up to  study completion (i .e., database lock).  
Any additional data received up to 1 month after subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the study sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after this 
time period will be considered a nd processed as spontaneous and should be communicated to 
the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local requirements.  
The investigator should also report complain ts on non -Alcon products directly to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory requirements.  
7.6 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study  
Women who are pregnant at the time of study entry are excluded from participation. 
However, pregnancy should be included in the pregnancy eCRF when a woman becomes 
pregnant during the st udy. Pregnancy is not reportable as an AE; however, complications may 
be reportable and will be decided on a case –by-case basis.

Alcon – Business Use Only  8 CONFIDENTIALITY, BIAS, AND MASKING  
8.1 Subject Confidentiality and Methods Used to Minimize Bias  
The investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anonymity is maintained throughout the 
course of the study. In particular, the investigator must keep an enrollment log with 
confidential identifying information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of 
each study participant. All documents submitted to the sponsor will identify the subjects 
exclusively by number and demographic information. No other personally identifying 
information should be transmitted to the sponsor.  
This study is double -masked with subjects randomized to use Alcon  serafilcon A  or AOHP 
contact lens for the duration of 2-week treatment  period .  
The investigator and sponsor personnel (other than site monitors, clinical operations lead , 
person responsible for generating the randomization schedule, and unmasked  clinical data 
managers) involved in reporting, obtaining, and/or reviewing the clinical evaluations will be 
masked to the identity of the contact lens being administered. This level of masking will be 
maintained throughout the conduct of the study. Unmask ing will occur only after all planned 
study data have been validated, and the database locked.  
8.2 Unmasking of the Study Treatment  
Masked information on the identity of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the study. In the event of a medical emergency where the knowledge of subject 
treatment is required, individual investigator(s) will have the ability to unmask  the treatment 
assignment for a specific subject. If time allows, the appropriate study sponsor representative 
should be contacted prior to unmasking.  The study sponsor must be informed of all cases in 
which the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally, the study 
sponsor may be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory 
reporting requirements.

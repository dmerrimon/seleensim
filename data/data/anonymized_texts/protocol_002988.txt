  ID: 201969K     High Level Pulsed Heat Versus Low Level Steady Heat in Subjects With Chronic Low Back Pain December 3, 2019             
  Carewave Series 5 Clinical Trial:  A randomized double blinded two arm study comparing pain relief in an active Series 5 device group (113 °F) versus a Series 5 lower temperature group (96.8 °F) in subjects with chronic low back pain.   Study Overview 1. This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and suitable for FDA submission in order to obtain claims such as, “provides temporary pain relief for people with chronic lower back pain.” 2. The study is designed as a randomized double blinded two arm placebo controlled trial.  3. The active arm (N=50) receives two active Series 5 heating units (Soovu Labs Inc.) that pulse heat to 45°C (113°F). The active Series 5 placebo arm (N=50) gets two identical appearing units (Soovu Labs Inc.) that produce low level of heat at 35-36°C (96.8 °F). For reference skin temperature is about 33 °C and room temperature 23 °C. 4. The study hypothesis is that in subjects with chronic low back pain, the active high level pulses heating device group will show a statistical improvement in pain scores as compared to the low level steady heat group as measured by the primary outcome measure, the Numeric Pain Scale (NPS). 5. Subjects will be told the study is examining the pain relieving effectiveness of two different levels of heat.  6. Subjects must have chronic low back pain with a pretreatment level of pain 4 or greater on a 0-10 point scale. By definition chronic low back pain is a condition that has been present for at least 6 months and must be present more days than not over the course of a week. 7. No use of pain medications during the four hour trial. However, pain medications including schedule IIIs can be taken up to 30 minutes before the start of the trial. Medications permitted during the trial include medications such as tramadol, codeine, NSIADs, gabapentin and acetaminophen. Non-pain medications for medical indications are permitted at any time. Subjects taking schedule II opioids are excluded from the study. Schedule II opioids include oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, fentanyl and methadone. 8. Ages 22 through 70. 
9. Exclusion criteria- sciatica if present must be rated significantly less than the non -radiating component of the low back pain,  pregnancy, skin lesions such as open skin or sores, scar tissue, skins grafts, old burns over the treatment area or neuropathic sensory loss over the treatment site. 10. Pre-treatment assessments include, Numeric Pain Scale (static and bending), and a pre-study questionnaire (history, treatment preferences, short form Brief Pain Inventory, and short form Magill), and a timed walking test.  11. Each treatment session lasts approximately 30 minutes with pain assessments throughout using NPS (primary outcome measure). Secondary outcome measures include measures of comfort, willingness to endorse their treatment and a timed walking test including the number of strides. 12. All subjects are followed for a 4 hour post treatment period with intermittent pain assessments (NPS). 13. At the end of the post treatment period, subjects complete a post study usability questionnaire and a blinding questionnaire.   Study arm #1- Active treatment group (two heating units) 1. Subjects randomized to this group will receive two active Series 5 heating units. The active heating units produce waves of heat of up to 45°C. All subjects will start at 45°C (113° F). 2. The treatment session is approximately 30 minutes of active treatment with heat.  3. Pain is assessed using a standardized instrument (the numerical pain score) both static and with bending/flexion. 4. Assessment times include pretreatment (T-0) after 5 minutes of treatment (T-5), after 10 minutes of treatment (T-10), after 15 minutes of treatment (T-15), and after 30 minutes of treatment (T-30).  5. Pain is also assessed after treatment ends. This assessment is done at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post-treatment. After 60 minutes into the post-treatment, pain is assessed every 30 minutes up to 4 hours post-treatment. 6. Number of subjects in active treatment arm - up to 50.    Study arm #2- Low level heat treatment group (two low level heat units) 1. Subjects randomized to this group will receive two placebo Series 5 heating units. These devices look exactly like the active heating units but produce low level heat at 35-36°C (96.8 °F). 2. The treatment session is approximately 30 minutes of active placebo treatment.  3. Pain is assessed using a standardized instrument (the numerical pain score) both static and with bending/flexion. 4. Assessment times include pretreatment (T-0) after 5 minutes of treatment (T-5), after 10 minutes of treatment (T-10), after 15 minutes of treatment (T-15), and after 30 minutes of treatment (T-30).  
5. Pain is also assessed after treatment ends. This assessment is done at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes post-treatment. After 60 minutes into the post-treatment time, pain is assessed every 30 minutes up to 4 hours post-treatment. 6. Number of subjects in placebo arm - up to 50.    Inclusion criteria 1. Chronic low back pain. By definition chronic low back pain is a  condition that has been present for at least 6 months on more days than not. If there is a radiating component of the low back pain the radiating component must have a pain rating less than the non-radiating component of the low back pain. 2. Subjects must have pretreatment level of pain 4 or greater.  3. Ages 22 through 70 4. Pain medications can be used prior to the trial; however, none can be used during the approximate four hour trial. Other non-pain medications are permitted as needed.  5. Medications permitted during the trial include medications such as tramadol, codeine, NSIADs, gabapentin and acetaminophen.   Exclusion criteria 1. Sciatica or radicular pain without non-radiating low back pain, cancer, radicular pain greater than the non-radiating component of low back pain, pregnancy, skin lesions such as open skin or sores, scar tissue, skins grafts, old burns over the treatment area 2. Subjects must have a cell phone for clinic contact and follow-up. 3. Medications including oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, fentanyl and methadone are excluded from the trial.   
 Primary measure: pain using Numerical Pain Scale 1. Numerical Pain Scale (see figure 1) at rest compared to the NPS after 30 minutes of treatment.  Secondary measures  1. Comfort scale and  willingness to recommend treatment assessments (see figure 2). These assessments are administered after the treatment session and at end of the post-treatment period. 2. Numerical Pain Scale (see figure 1) with painful movement. Painful movement is defined as any movement that increases the amount of pain the subjects experience. This movement may include stretching, bending forward backward or sideways as well as any other movements identified by the subject.  Other measures  1. Speed walk. Time for an individual to walk a total distance of 60 feet. (Assessing walking speed in clinical research: a systematic review (J eval. Clinic Practice 2008 14(4) 552-562, or  www.physio-pedia.com/10metre_Walk_test) Walk 60 feet but time only the middle 20 feet. The number of strides over the middle 20 feet will also be recorded. 2. Pain relief for up to 4 hours after treatment session ends using the Numeric Pain Scale 3. Skin observation at baseline, at the end of active 30 minute treatment and at the end of 4 hours. The subject will be asked how the skin feels and observed for any redness.  Study methods 1. Prior to initiation subjects will complete a short pre-study questionnaire about their chronic back pain (see figure 3). The questionnaire asks subjects about the history of their back pain, pain rating, and past and present treatments.  2. All subjects will be told that they are testing devices with two different temperatures and the effect of the different temperatures on low back pain. The words low temperature or higher temperature are not used. The low level temperature Series 5 device 35-36°C (96.8 °F) functions as an active placebo. All subjects will view a short presentation that explains the pain scale, double blinded trials and active versus placebo conditions to standardize the study approach.  
3. At initiation of each trial, subjects will be shown the device active or placebo. The devices look identical. Subjects will be asked to indicate the area of worst pain by pointing to the spot. This will be the starting position of the device. Once treatment starts the subject can adjust the location of the device to the most effective area. The starting temperature of the active device will be 36 °C in the low temperature series 5 device and 45°C in the higher temperature series 5 device.  4.  Any location change will be recorded. Subjects can also change the temperature setting anytime during the study. The change will be made by the study assistant using the phone app. This will be also be recorded. Subjects in the placebo group can also ask to change the location or temperature with the same response by the study assistant. All requests will be recorded. Series 5 devices are controlled using one of two methods, tapping on the device can turn the device on or off, or via blue tooth connection on a cell phone app. For this study we will use the blue tooth interface because it is simpler than tapping the device especially if the subject wishes to change the temperature as the devices are placed on the low back possibly making it difficult for some subjects in pain to reach the device to properly tap it.   The research assistant (RA) will have a dedicated cell phone that paired with the subject’s heating units and only those Series 5 devices. The RA can lower the temperature at the subject’s request. The cell phone app contains an on/off switch to the paired unit, a temperature monitor and the ability to lower the temperature of the unit. For this study the temperature cannot be increased over 113 or 96.8 °F in the study units ( Higher versus lower temperature series 5 units respectively). To support study blinding subjects will not have access to the cell phone app.   5. Pain will be measured both at rest and with an activity that each subject identifies as causing pain such as bending forward, backward or laterally or stretching.  6. Subjects will be required to stay for the full 4 hours post-treatment period even if their pain returns to baseline.  7. At the end of the post-treatment period subjects will complete a blinding questionnaire (see figure 4) and treatment usability questionnaire (see figure 5). The blinding questionnaire will also be administered at the end of the post-treatment period.  8. The study timeline and assessment schedule are shown on figure 7.   
Data analysis of primary outcome measure  Primary analysis will consist of a two-sample t-test comparing change in numeric pain score (0 – 10 point scale) from baseline to 5, 10, 15, and 30 minute time point between the active and control arms using participants with complete observations. We will also analyses the pain level data at regular endpoints up to 4 hours post treatment. Residual change scores will be tested for departure from normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. If a statistically significant department from normality is observed, we will use the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test instead of a two-sample t-test. Secondary analysis will use two-sample t-tests to compare comfort with device (measured on a 0-10 scale) between arms and willingness to endorse treatment for others (measured on a 0-10 scale) between arms and pain with movement. Statistical tests will be conducted at the alpha = 0.05 level.

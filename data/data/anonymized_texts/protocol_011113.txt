Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 5 1. Introduction 
This document describes the pla nned analysis that will be used for Study 150998-006 clinical 
study report. This randomized, p arallel-group study is designed to assess the safety and 
efficacy of abicipar pegol (her eafter referred to as abicipar) compared with ranibizumab in 
treatment-naïve patients with neovascular age-related macular d egeneration (nAMD). 
There will be two database locks . The first database lock (refe rred to as primary DBL) will 
occur when all patients have completed the Week 52 visit, or ex ited earlier. The study will be 
unmasked to a restricted group for primary analyses. 
The second database lock (referr ed to as final DBL) will occur when all patients have 
completed the study entirely (W eek 104 visit) or e xited early f rom the study. 
The analysis plan will support  both primary and final DBL, but some analyses will be 
reduced for the final DBL. For example, demographic, baseline d isease characteristics, and 
medical history will not be re-produced at the final DBL.  
1.1 Primary Study Objectives and Design 
The study objectives are to assess  the safety and efficacy of a bicipar compared with 
ranibizumab in treatment-n aïve patients with nAMD. 
The clinical hypotheses are: 
 Multiple intravitreal injections of 2 mg abicipar have an accep table safety profile in 
treatment-naïve patients with nAMD  
 The efficacy of at l east 1 of the 2 abicipa r regimens is non-in ferior to that of monthly 
ranibizumab intravitreal injections as assessed by the proporti on of patients with stable 
vision at Week 52 
This is a multicente r, double-masked, randomized, 104-week, par allel-group, active-
controlled study to eva luate the safety and efficacy of abicipa r in treatment-naïve patients 
with nAMD. Approximately 900 patie nts will be randomized by reg ion with a 1:1:1 
allocation ratio to r eceive one of the follo wing three treatmen ts: 
 Treatment group 2Q8: 2 mg abicipar administered at baseline (Da y 1) and Weeks 4 and 8, 
followed by doses at 8-week intervals through Week 96  
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 6  Treatment group 2Q12: 2 mg abicipar administered at baseline (D ay 1), and Weeks 4 and 
12, followed by doses at 12-week intervals through Week 96  
 Treatment group rQ4: 0.5 mg ranibizumab adminis tered every 4 weeks from baseline 
(Day 1) through Week 96  
Regions are defined primaril y based on geographical locations (eg, North America, EAME 
[Europe, Africa, and Middle East],  Asia Pacific, and Latin America). For randomization 
purposes, some regions are combined and the following 3 regions are used: North America, 
Asia, and the rest of the world. The defined 3 regions for rand omization will be used for 
statistical analysis. Within each region, randomiz ation to treatment groups will be stratified 
by baseline value for best-corre cted visual acuity (BCV A ≤ 55 v ersus > 55 ETDRS letters), 
central retinal thickness (CRT  ≤ 400 versus > 400 microns), and lesion type of choroidal 
neovascularization (predominantl y classic versus minimally clas sic or occult) in the study 
eye.   
The study design including treatme nt and visit schedules is shown in Figure 1 below. 
1.2 Sample Size  
For the primary efficacy endpoint of stable vision (ie, patient s who lose fewer than 15 letters 
in BCV A from baseline) at Week 52, a sample size of 240 patient s in each treatment group 
will provide approximately 95% pow er with a 2-sided alpha level  of 0.05 to demonstrate 
non-inferiority of an abicipar gr oup versus ranibizumab with a non-inferiority margin of 
10%.  This calculation is base d on the assumption of a 90% resp onse rate for both groups. 

Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 7 With an anticipated dropout rat e of approximately 20% over the 52-week period, a total of 
900 patients will be enrolled so that approximately 720 patient s (240 per group) will 
complete 52 weeks as required for  the primary endpoint evaluati on. 
1.3 Database Lock and Procedures of Maintaining Masking 
The study will be unmasked to a restricted group for the primar y analysis following the 
Week 52 database lock. Access to randomization codes and unmask ed information will be 
strictly limited to team memb ers who will be working on data analysis, study report 
completion, and submission-related documents. To maintain the i ntegrity of the ongoing 
study, Allergan personnel who become unmasked after the Week 52  database lock will not 
participate in any masked activ ities during the remaining part of the study until after the final 
database lock at study completi on. In particular, the unmasked study statistician(s) and 
programmer(s) will no longer  be involved in any ongoing study conduct or data review 
activities. Other statisticians  and programmers, who are still masked to study treatment, will 
assume these responsibilities until study completion.  
2. Analysis Populations and Data Conventions 
2.1 Analysis Populations 
The following 3 populations will be used for statistical analys is: intent-to-treat (ITT), per-
protocol (PP), and safety. 
The ITT population inc ludes all randomized p atients. The ITT po pulation will be used for all 
efficacy analyses. The PP population includes all randomized and treated patients who do not have protocol 
deviations that impact the prim ary efficacy variable. The PP population will be used for 
analyses of the primary and sec ondary efficacy variables. Prima ry considerations for PP 
definition include treatment compliance that would represent th e intended regimen 
adequately.  
Specifically, the PP population will include patients who 
1. Received at least 9 study treatme nts (including sham) and atten ded at least 9 scheduled 
monthly visits during the firs t year (before the Week 52 visit) , and; 
2. Had not missed 3 or more consecutiv e study treatments (including sham) before the 9
th 
study treatment, and; 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 8 3. Did not have any major pro tocol deviations that impacted effica cy outcomes prior to the 
Week 52 visit   
The PP population will also include patients who discontinued f rom the study as a result of 
treatment failure without a major deviation prior to Week 52 th at impacted efficacy outcomes 
(even if they met c riteria #1 or #2 above) .  Patients who escaped to standard of care by 
meeting the protocol criteria before Week 52 and study exit are  considered as treatment 
failures. Final determination of the PP population will be made  based on masked review of 
the data. Detailed specifi cation will be documented separately  prior to the primary database 
lock.   
The safety population includes all treated patients and will be  used for all safety analyses. 
Analyses for ITT and PP populations will be based on randomized  treatment group, whereas 
analyses for safety populations w ill be as treated, ie, based o n the actual treatment that the 
patient received. 
2.2 Handling Mis-randomization and Mis-stratification 
In the event of mis-stratifica tion that resulted in randomizati on under the wrong stratum, all 
PP analyses will be based on the actual stratum to which the patient belongs. ITT analysis 
that uses the randomization str atification factor(s) will be ba sed on the stratum as randomized 
for the primary efficacy analysis and the actual stratum to whi ch the patient belongs for other 
analyses such as model-based approaches. 
2.3 Analysis Visit Windows 
Analysis visit windows are defi ned according to study days, whi ch are defined in Table 1. 
Visit windows defined in Table 1 will be applied to all by-visi t analyses of efficacy and safety 
variables. Out-of-window visits  (including the ex it visit) and unscheduled visits will be 
reassigned to the visit that the  actual study days fall within. 
In cases where multiple visits occurred within a single visit w indow, which resulted in 
multiple data points for the same window, t he last visit with non-missing data will be used 
for analysis.

2.4 Data Conventions 
Unless stated otherwise in specific subsequent sections, data c onventions and definitions 
listed below will be applied to all analyses. 
 Day 1 is defined as the day when the patient receives the 1st study treatment. 
Study day = visit date – date of the 1st study treatment + 1 
 For patients who were randomi zed but did not receive any study treatments after 
randomization, the date of randomiz ation will be used as Day 1. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 10  Study duration will be calculated for each patient as: 
Study duration for the primary DBL = date of the Week 52 visit (or early exit if 
discontinued before the pri mary DBL ) – date of the 1st study treatment + 1 
Study duration for the final DBL  = date of the Week 104 visit (or early exit) – date of the 
1st study treatment + 1  
 Unless otherwise specified, baseli ne data refer to assessments performed at the Baseline 
(Day 1) visit prior to the 1st study treatment. Screening or uns cheduled visits prior to 
Day 1 visit will be used for baseline in the absence of pertine nt data at the baseline visit. 
 If ungradable images result in mis sing baseline CRT, the manual read data for retinal 
thickness at the center point, i f available, will be used for a nalysis. If the manual read 
data at baseline is not ava ilable, CRT on confirmation reading at screening will serve as 
baseline CRT. 
 Descriptive statistics include the sample size (N), mean, stand ard deviation (SD), median, 
minimum (Min), and maximum (Max) for continuous/ordinal data an d the frequency 
distribution includes sample s ize (N), frequency count, and percentage for categorical 
data. 
 The difference between groups will be calculated as abicipar mi nus ranibizumab. 
 Medical Dictionary of Regulator y Activities (MedDRA) nomenclatu re will be used to 
code adverse events, medical p rocedures, biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy findings. 
 The Anatomical-Therapeutic-Che mical classification text from Wo rld Health 
Organization (WHO) Drug Dictiona ry will be used to code all med ications for drug class 
and for drug name. 
 Whenever applicable, the metric system will be used (eg, kilogr ams [kg] and centimeters 
[cm]) and all clinical laborato ry data will be presented with t he Standard International 
(SI) units. 
3. Disposition and Exit Status 
3.1 Disposition and Exit Status 
Patient disposition will be summa rized as a frequency distribution by treatment group using 
the ITT and PP populations. For t he Week 52 analysis, patients who are still in the study will 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 11 be classified into the ongoing cat egory. Reasons for early exit will be summarized into the 
following categories as cap tured on the study exit eCRF. 
3.2 Significant Protocol Deviations 
Significant protocol deviations will be class ified based on the  type of deviation for each 
treatment group. Summary of signifi cant protocol deviations wil l be done for the ITT 
population.  
4. Demographics and Other Ba seline Characteristics 
4.1 Demographics 
Demographic data are collected a t the screening visit. Patient’ s age (years), sex, and race will 
be summarized for each treatment group using the ITT and PP pop ulations. Patient age will 
be classified into categories  of less than or equal to 65 years and greater than 65 years.   
4.2 Baseline Characteristics 
Baseline characteristics include  height (cm), w eight (kg), iris color, lesion type 
(predominantly classic , minimally classic, or occult), lesion s ize, subretinal or intraretinal 
fluid, intraretinal cysts, pigme nt epithelial de tachments, poly poidal choroidal vasculopathy, 
and smoking status. Ocular characteristics of the study eye at baseline include lens status, 
study eye as the better-seei ng eye (defined as baseline BCVA study-eye  > BCVA non-study eye ), 
BCV A, CRT, and intraocular pressu re. Summaries of baseline characteristics will be done for 
the ITT and PP populations.   
4.3 Prior Medications/Procedures 
Prior medications are defined as those received prior to the first study treatment. For analysis 
purposes, a medication will be con sidered as a prior medication if it satisfies at least one of 
the following: 
 The start date is prior to Day 1, regardless of the stop date; 
 The start date is unknown but  marked as > 1 year; or 
 The stop date is prior to or on D ay 1, regardless of the start date 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 12 For medications with a partial  start or stop date where > 1 yea r is not marked for the start 
date or ongoing is not marked for  the stop date and the day and /or the month is unknown, 
comparison to the 1st study treatment date (Day 1) will start with the year followed  by the 
month, if applicable, for deter mination of prior medications. I n cases where a full 
determination cannot be made ba sed on the partia l information, the start date will be assigned 
to the 1st day of the month if the day of the month is missing or to Janu ary if the month of the 
year is missing; conversely, the stop date will be assigned to the last day of the month if the 
day of the month is missing or to December if the month is miss ing. This missing data 
imputation will only be used to determine whether a certain med ication is considered a prior 
medication. Prior medications w ill be summarized by treatment g roup under each drug class 
and drug name. A separate analysi s for prior oph thalmic medicat ions used in the study eye 
will be performed based on WHODDE base preferred names. 
Summary of prior medications w ill be based on the ITT populatio n. 
4.4 Concomitant Medications/Procedures 
Concomitant medications are defined as those non-study medicati ons received after the first 
study treatment. For analysis pur poses, a medication will be co nsidered as concomitant if it 
satisfies at least one of the following: 
 The start date is on or after the  Day 1 treatment  date regardle ss of the stop date;   
 The stop date is after the Day 1 t reatment date, regardless of the start date; or 
 The stop date is unknown but marked as ongoing  
For medications with a partial start or stop date, the same con ventions and algorithms as 
described for prior medications will be used for determination of concomitant medications. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized in the same way as p rior medications.   
Concurrent procedures including those ocular and nonocular procedures performed after 
study treatment will be coded usi ng MedDRA. The number and perc entage of patients with 
any concurrent procedures will be tabulated and presented by tr eatment group as a frequency 
distribution for each primary s ystem organ class (SOC) and pref erred term. A separate 
summary for ocular concurrent procedures in the study eye will be performed. 
The number and percentage of patients who escaped to standard-of-care will be tabulated by 
medication names for each treatment group. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 13 Summary of concomitant medicat ions/procedures will be based on the ITT population. 
4.5 Medical History 
Medical history will be coded using MedDRA. 
Data will be summarized by frequency distribution for each uniq ue primary SOC and 
preferred terms using the IT T population based on the following  two categories: 
 Previous medical conditions, and 
 Medical conditions at study initiation 
Further, ocular history for the study eye will be summarized si milarly. 
5. Efficacy Analyses 
The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are listed below. Primary efficacy endpoint:  
 The proportion of patients with sta ble vision (ie, patients who lose fewer than 15 letters in 
BCV A) from baseline at Week 52 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  Mean change from baseline in BCV A at Week 52 (key secondary end point) 
 Mean change from baseline in CRT  as assessed with SD-OCT and quantified by the 
central reading center at Week 52 
 Proportion of patients with a gai n of 15 or more ETDRS letters in BCV A from baseline at 
Week 52 
 Mean change from baseline in The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-
25 (NEI-VFQ-25) composite score at Week 52 
Analyses of the primary efficac y endpoint and the key secondary endpoint for testing non-
inferiority will be performed using the PP population. Analyses of the primary and secondary 
efficacy endpoints for testing s uperiority will be performed using the ITT population.  
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 14 5.1 Collection of Primary Efficacy M easurement and Derivation of 
Primary Efficacy Variable 
BCV A will be recorded on the CRF a s the number of letters corre ctly read. For a given eye, 
the 4-meter distance (standard)  of BCV A is tested first. If the patient correctly reads at least 
20 letters at 4 meters, BCV A score will be set as the sum of 30  and the number of letters read 
correctly. If the patient correctly reads less than 20 letters at 4 meters, the BCV A is measured 
again at 1 meter. The BCV A score will be set to the number of l etters read correctly at 
1 meter plus the number of letters read correctly at 4 meters. For each patient, BCV A data 
will be collected for both eyes  at the screening, baseline visit (Day 1 but prior to the study 
treatment), and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 76, and 104/early exit  visits; and for the study eye 
only at all other scheduled visits. 
For patients who received any non-study anti-vascular endotheli al growth factor (VEGF) 
treatments in the study eye, data after the 1st such treatment will be excluded from all efficacy 
analyses. 
5.2 Primary Efficacy Analyses 
The primary efficacy endpoint i s the proportion of patients wit h stable vision at Week 52, 
defined as vision loss of fewer than 15 letters in BCV A from baseline. Patients who escaped 
to standard of care by meeting the protocol criteria will be se t to failures for the primary 
endpoint of stable vision at W eek 52. Confirmation for meeting the protocol criteria is based 
on the marked reasons captured on th e Standard of Care eCRF, which states: “Loss of 
≥ 30 letters in BCV A from base line (in any post-baseline visit), and persistent fluid 
(subretinal and intraretinal)  by OCT, judged to be the cause of  the BCV A loss (not explained 
by reasons other than the progres sion of neovascular AMD).” 
5.2.1 Statistical Hypothesis 
The statistical hypothesis for testing non-inferiority of abicipar to ranibizumab with regard to 
stable vision at Week 52 can be stated as follows: 
Null hypothesis: Abicipar (2Q12 or 2Q8) is inferior to ranibi zumab by the specified non-inferiority margin of 
10% or more in the proportion of patients with stable vision at Week 52. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 15 Alternative hypothesis: 
Abicipar (2Q12 or 2Q8) is inferior to rani bizumab by less than the specified non-inferiority 
margin of 10% or is superior  to ranibizumab in the proportion of patients with stable vision 
at Week 52. 
The null and alternative hypothe ses can be mathematically state d as follows:  
Ho1:  P 2Q8 -  P rQ4 ≤  - 10%  
Ha1:  P 2Q8 -  P rQ4 >  - 10%  
And H
o2:  P 2Q12 -  P rQ4 ≤  - 10% 
Ha2: P2Q12 -  P rQ4 >  - 10% 
where P2Q8, P2Q12 , and  PrQ4 are the probabilities of stable  vision at Week 52 for the abic ipar 
2Q8, abicipar 2Q12, and ranibizumab treatment groups, respectiv ely. 
5.2.2 Primary Analyses of Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary analysis of the primar y efficacy variable will be performed using the PP 
population based on a stratified me thod with Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) weights. 
Within the framework of this m ethod, the difference in the prop ortions between each abicipar 
arm and ranibizumab (abicipar  group minus ranibizumab group) an d the corresponding 
2-sided 95.1% confidence interva l for non-inferi ority testing w ill be calculated. Specifically, 
the confidence intervals for treatment group differences will b e calculated using the CMH 
weighted method with the baseline  BCV A (≤ 55 versus > 55 ETDRS letters) as a 
stratification factor as  described in Yan and Su ( 2010). Missing data for BCV A will be 
imputed using the last observati on carried forward (LOCF). The formal non-inferiority test 
will be performed at Week 52 with a non-inferiority margin of 1 0% at an alpha level of 
0.049. This alpha reflects an adj ustment of 0.001 fo r the unmasked data review by the data 
safety monitoring committee (DSMC)  for safety assessments. The total alpha spent of 0.001 
for the DSMC is based on the  assumption of no more than 10 unma sked reviews during the 
study, with 0.0001 allocated to each review. Thus, the overall alpha for the study is preserved 
at 0.05 level. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 16 For hypothesis testing, if the lo wer limit of the 95.1% confide nce interval for the difference 
between an abicipar group and rani bizumab is greater than or eq ual to -10%, non-inferiority 
of the abicipar group is established. 
Multiplicity for the primary efficacy analysis will be controll ed using a gatekeeping 
procedure defined by the following sequence to control the over all type I error rate at 0.05 
level: 
Step 1:   Testing for non-inferiority of abicipar 2Q8 against ranibizum ab 
Step 2:   Testing for non-inferiority of abicipar 2Q12 against ranibizu mab 
Hypothesis testing for abicipar 2Q12 against ranibizumab is val id only if non-inferiority for 
abicipar 2Q8 against ranibizumab is established. If both abicipar groups have dem onstrated non-inferiority to ra nibizumab using the PP 
population, hypothesis testing for superiority will be performed using the ITT population for 
each abicipar group following the same order as defined above f or non-inferiority testing. 
Superiority of abicipar will be demonstrated if the lower confi dence limit for the treatment 
difference is greater than zero.

The key secondary efficacy variab le is the mean change in BCV A from baseline. Other 
secondary efficacy variables incl ude the mean change from basel ine in CRT as assessed by 
SD-OCT, proportion of patients with BCV A improvement of 15 letters or more from 
baseline, and mean change from ba seline in Health Outcomes NEI-VFQ-25 composite score.   
5.3.1 BCV A Mean Change from Baseline   
For the key secondary efficacy endpoint mean change from baseli ne in BCV A at Week 52, 
statistical analysis for non- inferiority will be based on the P P population using a mixed-effect 
model for repeated measures (MMRM ), which includes BCV A data fr om baseline (Day 1) to 
Week 52. The model will include  treatment group, region, baseli ne BCV A in the study eye, 
baseline CRT (≤ 400 µm or > 400 µm)  in the study eye, lesion ty pe of choroidal 
neovascularization (predominantl y classic versus minimally clas sic or occult) from the 
confirmation at screen ing, visit, visit-by-baseline BCV A intera ction, and treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed covariates  using an unstruc tured covariance matrix. The difference in 

Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 19 BCV A mean change from baseline between each abicipar arm and ra nibizumab (abicipar 
group minus ranibizumab group) a nd the corresponding 2-sided 95 .1% confidence interval 
(CI) will be calculated based on t he MMRM model. The formal non -inferiority test will be 
performed at Week 52 using a mar gin of 5 letters. Non-inferiori ty of abicipar will be 
established if the lower limit of the CI is > - 5.0 letters. Te sting for non-inferiority in mean 
change will also be performed us ing the ITT population and the same MMRM model as a 
sensitivity analysis. 
Testing for superiority of abicip ar over ranibizumab in BCV A me an change will be 
performed using the ITT population with the same MMRM model.   
As a sensitivity analysis, BCV A mean change will be analyzed us ing an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOV A) model, whic h includes the treatment group, region, baseline CRT 
(≤ 400 or > 400 microns), and lesio n type of choroidal neovascu larization (predominantly 
classic versus minimally classic or occult) from the confirmati on at screening as fixed effects 
and baseline BCV A as a covariat e. In this model, missing data w ill be replaced by LOCF and 
the analysis will be performed f or the PP population. Treatment  differences between each 
abicipar group and ranibizumab  and the corresponding 2-sided 95 .1% confidence intervals 
for the difference will be cal culated based on the least–square  means and appropriate 
contrasts from the s ame ANCOV A model. 
Tipping point analysis as described in Section 5.2.4.2 will be performed for BCV A change 
using the PP population. The tipping region will be constructed  based on the combinations of 
values for δ 2Q8, δ2Q12, or δ rQ4 that resulted in a lower bound of the 95.1% CI for the differen ce 
of abicipar (2Q8 or 2Q12) minus ranibizumab less than -5 letters. 
5.3.2 SD-OCT CRT Mean Change from Baseline   
The electronic SD-OCT images wi ll be evaluated and graded by th e Fundus Photograph 
Reading Center (FPRC). The graded results will be captured on t he evaluation form and used 
for statistical analysis. In the  event of excess fluid at baseline and ungradable images that 
result in missing baseline CRT, the  manual read data for retinal thickness at the center point, 
if available, will be used for analysis. CRT is measured as the thickness of the subfields, which is the  central 1000 µm from the 
center of the fovea. Analysis of CRT mean change fro m baseline in the study eye will be performed using the 
same MMRM model for superior ity testing based on the ITT population
 as described in 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 20 Section 5.3.1 for the key efficacy variable of BCV A change. The only difference is that 
baseline CRT will be included in the model as a continuous vari able instead of a dichotomy 
(eg, ≤ 400 µm or > 400 µm) as used for randomization.   
5.3.3 BCV A Improvement of ≥ 15 Letters from Baseline 
The proportion of patients with a BCV A improvement of ≥ 15 lett ers from base line in the 
study eye at each postbaseline visi t will be calculated for eac h treatment group. Between-
group comparisons and the 95.1% confi dence intervals for the between-group difference will 
be performed using the same method as described for the primary  efficacy variable in 
Section 5.2.2 for superiority t esting using the ITT population.  
5.3.4 NEI-VFQ-25 Mean Change from Baseline in Composite Score  
The NEI-VFQ-25 will be administe red at the Baseline/Day 1, and at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 52, 
76, and 104/early exit visits. Detai led analyses and analysis v isit windows are described in 
Section 7 for health outcome data analysis. 
As a secondary efficacy variable, change from baseline at Week 52 in the overall composite 
score will be analyzed for supe riority testing using the ITT po pulation and MMRM as 
described in Section 5.3.1 for the key secondary efficacy varia ble of BCV A change. The 
model will include the treatme nt group, region, baseline BCV A i n the study eye, baseline 
VFQ score, visit, and treatment-b y-visit interaction as fixed c ovariates using an unstructured 
covariance matrix. Treatment di fferences and the corresponding 95.1% confidence intervals 
will be constructed us ing the MMRM model.

6.1.1 Exposure to Study Treatments 
Exposure to study treatment will be evaluated by the number of study injections (including 
sham), the number of active study injections (excluding sham) a nd exposure days. Patients 
who have missed any study treatment(s) will be enumerated. Dura tion of treatment based on 
the days from the 1st to the last active study injections (excluding sham) will be c alculated. 
Descriptive statistics will be tabulated for each treatment gro up using the safety population.   

Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 24 6.2 Adverse Events 
A TEAE is an adverse event that  occurs after the initiation of the study treatment (ie, the 
onset date is the same as or aft er the study treatment date), o r an adverse ev ent with onset 
prior to the study treatment tha t worsened in severity or becam e serious after the initiation of 
the study treatment. The inciden ce of TEAEs will be calculated by treatment group and 
presented as the number and per centage of patients experiencing  the TEAE during the 
reporting period.   
The following summaries of TEAE da ta will be performed: 1) overall summary, 2) all 
TEAEs regardless of causality, 3) treatment-related TEAEs, 4) o cular TEAEs (study eye 
versus non-study eye), 5) nonocular TEAEs, 6) treatment-related ocular TEAEs, and 7) 
TEAEs of special interest. An additional summary will be provid ed for 8) treatment-emergent 
serious adverse events (TE SA Es) and 9) AEs leading to study discontinuation. 
The 1) overall summary will pres ent the number and percentage o f patients with TEAEs, 
ocular/nonocular TEAEs in the stu dy eye, treatment-related ocul ar/nonocular TEAEs, AEs 
leading to study discontinuation, TE SAEs, and death in each tr eatment group. Treatment-
related ocular TEAEs will also be summarized for injection-rela ted and drug-related TEAEs. 
Injection-related TEAEs are thos e TEAEs marked as related to th e study treatment 
administration. 
Further, tabulations of TEAEs  or TE SAEs based on MedDRA coded terms, primary system 
organ class (SOC) and/or preferred terms (PTs) will be sorted by the frequency of occurrence 
as detailed below. 
 Summary for 3) treatment-rela ted TEAEs, 5) nonocular TEAEs, 8) TE SAEs, and 9) AEs 
leading to study discontinuation w ill be sorted by primary SOC in alphabetical order. 
Within each SOC name, TEAEs (TE SAEs or AEs) will be tabulated by PT in descending 
order. A patient with multiple o ccurrences of the same PT withi n the reporting period will 
be counted only once for that PT.   
 Summary for 2) TEAEs by severity will be sorted by primary SOC in alphabetical order 
and by the worst severity (maximum severity) experienced for a given patient. Within 
each SOC, TEAEs will be tabulated  by PT in descending order and  by severity. The 
severity of a TEAE is defined a s the greater of the onset sever ity and maximum severity 
recorded on the CRF for each unique PT reported by the patient.  
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 25  Summary for 4) ocular TEAEs, 6) tre atment-related ocular TEAEs,  and 7) TEAEs of 
special interest of intraocular inflammation will be sorted by preferred term in descending 
order. A patient with multiple o ccurrences of the same preferre d term within the reporting 
period will be counted only once for that PT. 
All tabulations will be sorted in descending order of frequency  following this sequence from 
left to right: star ting from abicipar  groups 2Q8, 2Q12, and ran ibizumab every 4 weeks (rQ4).  
For the Week 52 analysis, AEs reported from baseline to Week 52 will be determined by AE 
onset date using the following criteria: 
 For patients who completed the  Week 52 visit, include AEs with an onset date ≤ Week 52 
visit date 
 For patients who did not complete the Week 52 visit due to earl y dropout or missed visit, 
include AEs with an onset date ≤ 365 days from the date of the 1st injection prior to early 
exit 
For cases where the AE onset date  is partially or completely mi ssing and does not allow for a 
full determination of whether th e AE occurred within the Week 5 2 period, those AEs will be 
included in the W eek 52 analysis.  
6.2.1 TEAEs of Special Interest 
TEAEs of special interest include  intraocular inflammation and those potentially related to 
systemic VEGF inhibition. TEAEs related to systemic VEGF inhibi tion will be categorized 
by arterial-thromboembolic events (ATEs, defined as nonfatal st roke, nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, or vascular death [ including deaths of unknown cause]), hypertension, nonocular 
hemorrhage, proteinuria, and others . Data for these two types o f TEAEs will be summarized 
by MedDRA preferred terms. 
TEAEs included in the intraocular  inflammation table will follo w a two-step selection 
process: first to identify the MedDRA preferred terms that may represent an intraocular 
inflammation followed by a thorough medical review of any relev ant details reported for the 
adverse event including ocular e xamination findings. The incide nce of TEAEs for intraocular 
inflammation of special interes t will be summarized by treatmen t group and presented as the 
number and percentage of patien ts. TEAEs identified based on Me dDRA preferred terms but 
not considered as intraocular in flammation of special interest will be displayed in a separate 
data listing. 
Allergan Confidential 150998-006 Analysis Plan 
Statistical Analysis Plan for 150998-006 CSR (Amendment 1) 26 TEAEs included in the events pote ntially related  to systemic VE GF inhibition table will be 
identified following the same pro cess. A summary for arterial t hromboembolic events or 
other adverse events that are pot entially related to systemic V EGF inhibition will be done by 
the following categories of A TE, hypertension, nonocular hemorrhage, proteinuria, and others 
by preferred terms. 
In addition, TEAEs potentially relat ed to systemic VEGF inhibition will be summarized 
separately for patients who recei ved the following anti-VEGF injections in the non-study 
eye: ranibizumab, bevacizumab, p egaptanib, and aflibercept. 
The selection and review of all TEAEs of special interest will be performed in a masked 
fashion and finalized prior to database lock and study unmaskin g.

Subgroup analyses will be performed on the pooled data from the 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies. 
Analysis will be carried out for  the integrated summaries of safety and efficacy. Subgroup 
analyses will not be performed for  the individual clinical stud ies. 
9. Interim Analyses 
No interim analyses are planne d for this study. However, an ind ependent DSMC will assess 
the unmasked safety data during t he study. To preserve an overall alpha of 0.05 for the study, 
an adjustment of 0.001 will be made and an alpha level of 0.049  will be used for testing 
purposes. Therefore, 95.1% confidence intervals will be constru cted for the primary efficacy 
analysis.

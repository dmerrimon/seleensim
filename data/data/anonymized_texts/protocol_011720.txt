INTRODUCTION   
Why is this study being done?  
You are being asked to participate in a clinical research study.  The purpose of clinical  research 
is to look at the nature of disease and try to develop improved methods to diagnose and treat 
disease.  The doctor  or clinicia n in charge of the study believes you meet the initial 
requirements to take part in the study.  Before agreeing to participate, it is important for you 
to read and understand the following explanation of the research procedures.  This Consent 
and Authoriza tion form describes the purpose, procedures, benefits, risks and discomforts of 
the study.  It also describes the alternatives available to you, and your right to withdraw (quit) 
from the study at any time.   
 
Please read this information carefully and ask  as many questions as you like before deciding 
whether or not you would like to take part in this research study.  
 
The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pain relief after total hip replacement 
surgery via anterior approach with a psoas compartment block versus a periarticular local 
anesthetic injection. The anterior  approach  (via the front side of the body)  for total hip 
replacement  is a tissue -sparing alternative to traditional hip replacement surgery (which uses 
an approach  on the back  side of the body ) that provides the potential for less pain, faster 
recovery and improved mobility . The technique allows the surgeon to work between muscles 
and tissues without detaching them from either the hip or thighbones - sparing the tissue from 
trauma. Despite these advantages, total hip replacement can still be associated with significant 
pain in the immediate postoperative period. Surgeons use various methods intraoperatively to 
alleviate postoperative pain . One technique that is possible with the  anterior approach  is called 
a psoas compartment block.  The psoas is an anterior hip muscle that helps with flexion.  With 
an anterior approach, an anesthetic  drug can be in jected directly into the psoas muscle , where 
it spreads to the nerves responsible fo r sensation around the surgical site,  allowing for pain 
relief. Alternatively, the surgeon can use a periarticular local anesthetic injection. In this 
technique an anesthetic "cocktail" of four drugs is injected to the surrounding tissues at 
several locati ons at the surgical site. Either  of these techniques can be used as standard of

                                                                      care and the local anesthetics being used are all approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA).  
 
A total of 100 of Dr. Verner ’s patients will take part in the study at  William Beaumont Hospital 
Royal Oak.  
 
How long will I be in the study?  
If you decide to take part in this study, your participation is expected to last  approximately  3 
weeks. To take part you must be undergoing a primary total hip  replacement  with an anterior 
approach , and be able to comply with the study requirements.   You may not take part in this 
study if you are currently enrolled in another related research study which could alter or 
influence the study results.   
 
DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY  
What will happen if I take part in the research study?  
You are being asked to take part in this research study because  you are undergoing total hip 
arthroplasty with an anterior approach. The results of th is study will compare the  effective ness 
of two dif ferent techniques for managing postoperative pain.  
 
If you agree to take part in this study y ou will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to receive 
either : 
A. An intraoperative p soas compartment  block  
B.  An intraoperative p eriarticular  anesthetic  injection 
 
You are being invited to participate because you are eligible for the study based on your 
information so far.  None of the information collected so far will be used for research unless 
you agree to participate in thi s study by signing this  Consent  and Authorization Form.  
 
If you agree to be in thi s study and sign and date this C onsent  and Authorization  form, you 
will be as ked to do the following things;  below is a table describing what will occur during 
participation :

After your surgery, y ou will be asked to report  on a sheet of paper your  pain scores both while 
resting and while you are up and moving. Additionally, you will be as ked to fill out two 
questionnaires on postoperative days one and two to asse ss how you are reacting to  your pain 
medications and how well you are recovering from your surgery.  
 
PARTICIPANT  RESP ONSIBILITIES   
You will  be asked to note any side effects or medical problems you may experience while you 
are taking part in this study.  For any illnesses or injuries, you should contact the study doctor  
immediately at the number listed on this consent form or in an emergency situation  call 911 
(or go to the nearest hospital emergency room) .    
 
RISKS, SIDE EFFECTS AND DISCOMFORTS  
Ask your physician what the standard of care risks are as well as the study risks.  
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in the study?  
 
Standard of Care Risks : 
 
Less Frequent (occurring from 1% to 10% of the time)  
 Low blood pressure  
 Nausea  
 Vomiting  
 Low heart rate  
 Anxiety  
 Numbness of skin  
 Pain 
 Itching  
 Fever  
 Dizziness  
 Chills 
 Reduced sensation of your hip area (where the surgery will take place)  
 Block failure (this is when the block does not work, thus causing pain after surgery)  
 
Rare (occurring less than  1% of the time)  
 Runny nose  
 Allergic reaction  
 Temporary or permanent nerve damage  
 Infection

Version # 01.06.16      
 
                                                                       Perioperative injury secondary to numbness or weakness, such as falling if trying to    
walk before the block wears off   
 
There is a rare risk of breach of confid entiality (release of information which personally 
identifies you). Every research study involves some  risk to your confidentiality. It is possible 
that other people could find out you are in the study or see your study information .  But we 
will take every  step to keep this from happening.  
 
BENEFITS  
What are the benefits of taking part in this study?  
There may be no direct benefit to you from taking part in this study.  However, you may have 
improved pain relief  if one technique proves superior . It is hoped that the results of this study 
will help doctors  learn which treatment is most effective  for pain management . 
 
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS  
What are my choices other than  taking part in this study?   
You do not have to take part in this study to receive treatment f or your condition. Your 
alternative is to not participate in this study and receive standard  medical care  as prescribed 
by your doctor (which may include one of the study treatments) .  
 
ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS  
What are the costs of taking part in this stud y? 
There will be no additional cost to you for the study procedures  (questionnaires, pain scores)  
described in this consent .  Routine procedures you would have had done  even if you were not 
taking part in this study , such as your surgery, hospitalization, anesthesia, and pain 
medications  will be billed to your health insurance company and/or group health plans  as 
usual. If these routine care costs are not covered by your health insurance /group health plan , 
the cost will be your responsibility. The study wil l cover the cost of the questionnaires.  
 
COMPENSATION  
What happens if I am injured because I took part in this study?  
Your involvement in this study is voluntary. The possible risks and side effects which might 
occur during the course of the research stud y have been described in this Consent and 
Authorization form.  A research injury is any physical injury or illness caused by your 
participation in this study.  
 
Should you experience a research injury, there are no designated funds provided for 
subsequent m edical care or compensation by either the study doctor /clinician  or William 
Beaumont Hospital .  
 
Every effort to prevent any injury resulting from this study will be taken by your study d octor 
and William Beaumont Hospital .  Immediate necessary care, emerg ency treatment, and 
professional services will be available to you, just as they are to the general community. You 
and/or your insurance company will be responsible for the costs. Compensation (such as for 
lost wages and/or pain and suffering) is not avail able.

1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY AND/OR SCHEMA 
Figure 1. Protocol Schema  
"The need for early ASCT in an era of new drugs  is the most important clinical question in 
myeloma today."  Robert A. Kyle and Vincent Rajkumar, Blood 2008; 111:2962  
 
This is a phase II clinical trial for newly diagnos ed patients with sympto matic multiple myeloma 
eligible for stem cell transplant (SCT). In this  trial we ask whether th e regimen of lenalidomide 
and dexamethasone achieves a response profile 2 a nd 3 years into the disease that is similar to 
the response profile achieved with the more conventional approach of initial therapy followed by 
early high-dose melphalan with stem cell transpla nt. In this randomized phase II trial, neither 
arm can be considered standard therapy because there is no established st andard initial therapy 
for myeloma at this time, nor is there an es tablished role for maintenance therapy with 
lenalidomide. Lenalidomide and low-dose dexame thasone are acceptable, effective and widely 
used initial therapy based on phase II and III tria l data but there have be en no direct comparisons 
of thalidomide and dexameth asone, bortezomib and dexameth asone, and lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone as initial therapies. Therefore, th ere is no established stan dard initial therapy. 
This phase II trial is designed so that results from the two treatment arms will be compared directly to each other using a “pick-the-winner” approach.

Lenalidomide is initially dosed at 25mg/day for 21 of 28 days. Dexamethasone is dosed at 40mg 
weekly. Dexamethasone dosed in this fashion (4 da ys per cycle) is considered low-dose (d) while 
dexamethasone given in pulses on days 1-4, 9- 12 and 17-20 is considered high dose (D). 
Lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone (Ld) is the standard dose-schedule based on a recent 
phase III trial and is the dose-schedule we use in this trial. 
 
Newly diagnosed untreated patients with myelom a will receive Ld for 4 cycles and then undergo 
conventional stem cell mobilization with cy clophosphamide and G-CSF (10ug/kg/day) or 
plerixafor and G-CSF and stem ce ll collection. Mobiliza tion with cyclophosphamide is preferred, 
but plerixafor is also allowed. Th en all patients will be stratifi ed into high- and standard-risk 
groups. High-risk patients are those who have baseline high-risk cytogenetics or FISH 
(hypodiploidy, presence of t(4; 14) or del 17p) or baseline β2-microglobulin > 3.5.  All other 
patients will be designated as standard-risk. After stratification, pati ents will be randomized 
either to continue Ld or to undergo standard high-dose melphalan and SCT. 
 
On the Ld arm, patients will resume Ld with prophylactics and dose reductions as indicated. 
 
On the SCT arm, patients will undergo up to 2 SCT.  Achievement of at least a 90% reduction in 
myeloma from baseline (very good pa rtial response, VGPR) after the 1st SCT will determine the 
need for a second SCT. Patients w ho do not achieve a VGPR after the 1st SCT will undergo a 2nd 
SCT. Patients who do not ac hieve a VGPR after the 2nd SCT will receive lower-dose Ld 
(L=10mg/day on days 1-28 every 28-day cycle, d=20mg flat dose weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28-day cycle) beginning 3 months after the 2
nd SCT. Patients who are high-risk will 
also receive lower-dose Ld after the 1st or 2nd SCT. 
 
All patients will continue on those arms of therapy until progression of disease.

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
Multiple Myeloma (MM)  
MM is an incurable plasma cell malignancy with over 16,000 new cases and 11,000 deaths 
estimated in the U.S. in 2006.1 It accounts for 10-15% of all he matologic malignancies, with a 
median age at diagnosis of 63 ye ars. Median overall survival remains 4-5 years and long-term 
myeloma-free survivors are rare.  Age and race  influence the incide nce of MM. MM rarely 
occurs before the age of 40.2 Its incidence increases rapidly w ith age and is lowest among Asian 
peoples, intermediate among Caucasians in Amer ica and Europe, and hi ghest among blacks in 
the USA. The differences in the incidence of MM in different c ountries appear to be due to 
genetic rather than environmental factors. 
 
The numerous clinical manifest ations associated w ith MM result from bone marrow replacement 
by myeloma plasma cells and the pathologic effects resulting from thei r overproduction of a 
monoclonal immunoglobulin molecu le (“M protein”), which incl ude bone destruction, anemia, 
hypercalcemia, immunodeficiency and renal dysfunction.3 A number of chemotherapeutic 
regimens are employed to treat myeloma. Decad es ago prednisone added to oral melphalan 
became the mainstay of therapy (MP) although complete response (CR) was rare (< 5%) and 
median survival did not exceed 3 years.4 The addition of other alkylati ng agents, anthracyclines 
and vinca alkaloids to MP did not improve su rvival. Until recently, regimens employed as 
standard initial therapy include d VAD and single-agent dexameth asone with response rates that 
ranged from 40-70% with unc ommon complete responses.5 
 
Over the past 15 years autolog ous stem cell transplantation (S CT) has been shown in several 
phase III studies to provide higher CR and su rvival rates than historical alkylator-based 
therapy.6,7 Although neither achievement of CR nor SCT is a cure, SCT likely adds 1 year to 
survival compared to historical therapy.  For over a decade, the importa nce of achieving a CR (or 
> VGPR) has been well established with respect to overall survival. In the IFM 90 trial, the 5- 
year overall survival was significantly higher in those with CR or VGPR (72%) 3 months post- 
SCT than in those with PR (39%).6 This point was driven home wi th the results of the IFM 94 
trial in which patients not achieving at least a VGPR after the first SCT ha d a survival advantage 
with a second SCT. The CR+VGPR with tandem SCT on IFM 94 was 50%. 
 
Because the new agents available to treat my eloma are so effective, many patients and 
physicians are questioning the ro le of high-dose melphalan with  SCT in the treatment of the 
disease. They question the need for the morbidity and investment of time associated with 1 or 2 
SCT when the response rates with the new ag ents, lenalidomide and bortezomib in initial 
therapy, for example, are as high as those ach ieved with historical therapies and high-dose 
melphalan with SCT. In addition to being suppor ted by the improved response rates noted with 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

recently approved novel agents, these concerns ar e supported by several la rge studies that have 
demonstrated no difference in overall survival with  SCT early or late in the course of disease, 
and by retrospective evaluations showing that patients achieving complete responses with 
standard therapy have similar survivals to thos e achieving complete response (CR) with SCT. 
This trial asks whether continue d combination therapy with the new agent lenalidomide and low- 
dose dexamethasone (Ld) is as effective as initial  therapy with Ld followed by SCT. In the initial 
phase II trial of lenalidomide and high-dose dexamethasone (LD) investigators at Mayo Clinic 
reported a progression-free survival of about 3 ye ars in myeloma patients of various ISS stages. 
(It is important to note that patients continuing on long-term lena lidomide therapy on that trial 
received low-dose dexamethasone). 
 
Although the median progression-free survival after high-dose melpha lan with SCT is 30 
months, two large SCT tria ls have clearly demonstrated no diff erence in overall survival between 
patients receiving early or delayed SCT. Theref ore, delay of high-dose melphalan will not put 
patients at risk. 
 
Novel agents and response rates  
 
Over the past 5 years the FDA has approved thalidomide, bortezomib and the thalidomide- 
analogue lenalidomide for the treatment of myeloma.8 The effectiveness of these new agents 
combined with dexamethasone a nd other traditional medications has changed the treatment of 
myeloma. Phase III trials have shown higher response and survival rates with thalidomide 
combined with MP (MPT) versus MP or two cy cles of intermediate-dose melphalan (100mg/m2) 
with SCT.9,10 Similarly, thalidomide when combined  with pulse dexamethasone (TD) was 
superior to D alone as initial ther apy in a transplant-eligible population.11 With thalidomide as 
part of a tandem SCT strategy in a recent larg e phase II trial, median  overall survival was 6.5 
years.12 
 
Phase II trials of bortezomib-b ased regimens in initial therap y have also shown very high 
complete and overall response rates.13-16 One can now expect comple te and near complete 
response rates with initial therapy for myeloma at levels previously  attained only with high-dose 
therapy and SCT. The Spanish intergroup (PETHEM A) recently reported results of a phase III 
trial of VMP (bortezomib+MP) ve rsus MP for patients who we re not stem cell transplant 
candidates. The CR+VGPR rates were 45% in the VMP and 10% in the MP  arm. Both VMP and 
MP contain pulse oral melphalan, a leukemogenic agent; the long-term effects of combining it 
with bortezomib are not known and it is not advisable to  use VMP in a young patient who is a 
candidate for SCT because of the risk of leukemia and the deleterious effects of oral melphalan 
on hematopoietic stem cells. Stem cell mobiliza tion and collection are im paired in patients 
receiving more than 200mg of prior oral melphalan. 
 
In a phase II trial of LD in newly diagnosed  MM patients, those who received LD as their 
primary therapy and continued on it (with re duction in the dexamethasone dose) until 
progression of disease had a 24%  CR and 43% VGPR (CR+VGPR = 67%) best response rate. 
Median time to progression of disease was 32 months.17 At 1 year, the CR+VGPR rate was 56%,

indicating continued responsiveness in years 2 an d 3. There was no difference in response rate 
based on ISS stage.  A phase II I ECOG trial comparing lenalidomid e with high-dose (LD) versus 
low-dose dexamethasone (Ld) was halt ed because of significantly better survival in the Ld arm at 
one year (96% vs 88%). Best overall response rates at 1 year were different in the arms, 
however, with CR+VGPR of 52% in  the LD versus 42% in the Ld  arm. Whether continued use 
of Ld for an additional year increase d the CR+VGPR rates is currently unknown. 
 
With these improvements in response, the sign ificance of attaining CR in myeloma and the 
definition of CR have become cr itical issues in therapy. Th e latter has undergone several 
iterations over the past 20 year s and now is defined as normaliza tion of the marrow , of the serum 
and urine immunofixation studi es and of the free light ch ain levels and ratio also.18 The 
significance of CR has recently been re-exa mined in a retrospective evaluation of 721 
consecutive patients treated at MD Anderson fr om 1/87 to 5/06. Patients achieving CR with 
initial therapy, those achieving CR after SCT (wit h PR or NR to initia l therapy) and those 
undergoing SCT in CR from initial therapy all ha d similar long-term medi an survivals of 10 to 
14 years as is shown in Figure 2.19 The MD Anderson investigator s state that these results 
suggest "that high-dose therapy provided no furt her benefit after CR had been achieved with 
initial therapy. A randomized trial may be useful to clarify this question. " In the light of such 
results and statements, patients, their physicians  and myeloma specialists are questioning the role 
of high-dose melphalan and SCT.  Not surpri singly, SCT physicians are responding to these 
concerns. Jean-Luc Harrousseau, a pioneer in  MM SCT trials, has written "SCT is being 
challenged again by the introduction of novel ag ents such as bortezomib, thalidomide, and 
lenalidomide."20 Another pioneer, Bart Barlogie, has written “Although high CR rates may 
translate into extended survival for MEL treatment of patients with good-risk ( sic) myeloma, this 
may not hold true following treatment with the newer non-genotoxic agents.”21

A trial conducted at MSKCC (IRB  00-077) contributed to the tr end towards better responses 
with initial therapy.22 On that phase II trial, newly diagnos ed Durie-Salmon (DS) stage II and III 
myeloma patients received doxor ubicin and dexamethasone (AD)  followed by thalidomide and 
dexamethasone (TD). (NB: The DS staging system, not the ISS, was used for IRB 00-077.) 
Based on intent-to-treat the ove rall response rate was 84.4% ( 38/45) and the CR+VGPR rate 
36% (16/45). The AD/TD schedul e was developed afte r calling attention to the risk of 
thromboembolic complications when thalidomid e was simultaneously used with doxorubicin.23 
The rate of thromboembolic complications in the final version of IRB 00-077 was 10%,

equivalent to the rate with VAD. There were no treatment-related deaths and the incidence of 
neuropathy was nil. All patients on the MSKCC clinic al trial IRB 00-077 had DS stage II or III myeloma. The DS 
staging system was used for 30 years, despite  the fact that newer staging systems were 
developed. The continued use of DS  staging was based upon the need  to clearly describe and in 
some cases stratify the patients enrolled on clinic al studies. The majority of DS stage I patients, 
for example, did not need to be treated at diagnosis and would not be appropriate for aggressive 
initial therapy trials. 
 
The International Staging System (ISS) for myel oma was developed and validated several years 
ago and has been integrated into cl inical research here and elsewhere.24 It has supplanted the DS 
staging system and represents a major advance in staging because it does no t require inclusion of 
skeletal survey findings, the most inaccurate and confusing component of the DS system, and 
because of its objectivity and ease of application. ISS stage I patients have a serum albumin level 
> 3.5g/dl and β2 microglobulin (B2M) < 3.5mg/dl while ISS stage III patients have B2M > 
5.5mg/dl. ISS stage II patients are neither stage I nor III. 
 
After assessing all of the patien ts enrolled on all versions of MSKCC clinical trial IRB 00-077 
(n=64) for response and survival by ISS stage, we  learned that the respon se rate to therapy was 
similar in all ISS groups but that ISS stage II and III patients, and patients  with extramedullary 
disease (EMD) regardless of stage, had poorer ove rall survival. ISS stage II and III patients had a 
median survival of 3.5 years while the median su rvival of ISS stage I patients had not been 
reached with a median follow-up of 4 years. Patients with EMD had a median survival of 1.8 
years. Based on this analysis, we defined ISS stag e II or III patients, a nd those patients with 
EMD, as high risk. Patients with ISS stage I myeloma without EMD were defined as standard 
risk. A subsequent clinical tria l at MSKCC (IRB 06-067) was desi gned for patients with high- 
risk myeloma defined as ISS stage II or III or  having EMD. The CR+VGPR  rate is 53% in the 
first 27 patients treated. (Landau H, Come nzo RL, unpublished observation). Of note, one 
responder on that trial (not a SCT candidate) rela psed within 6 months of completing therapy on 
06-067 and has responded to 3 cycles of Ld. 
 
Since the phase II clinical trial 06-067 was design ed, the cytogenetic data on risk profiles in MM 
have been more cogently assessed. For many year s the presence of dele tion 13q (del 13q) was 
considered a marker of high-ris k MM; we did not find it to be such a marker in patients on 00- 
077 and therefore discounted it and other cytogenetic findings in  the design of 06-067. Current 
thinking, however, based on large numbers of pati ents treated similarly,  views hypodiploidy and 
the presence of the t(4;14) or del 17 p by FISH, as well as an elevated β2 microglobulin (> 3.5; 
i.e., ISS stage II and III), as markers of high risk.25 A recent retrospective evaluation of over 
1000 cases of myeloma evaluated by FISH supported this view and put the prior significance of 
del 13q in a better perspective.26 Del 13q is easily appreciated on standard karyotype. The 
identification of del 13q on karyot ype was a reflection of the prol iferative rate of the myeloma 
and of the ease with which that  particular abnormality could be visually appreciated with 
traditional metaphase spreads and Giemsa banding.

In this trial, then, we use a ne wer definition of risk: after stem  cell collection and prior to 
randomization patients will be st ratified into high-risk and st andard-risk groups based on the 
criteria of high-risk cytogenetics or FISH  (hypodiploidy, t(4;14)  or del 17p) or β2 microglobulin 
(B2M) > 3.5. All others will be c onsidered standard risk. The response rates to treatment with Ld 
or with tandem SCT are not different in thes e groups. A recent study from the University of 
Calgary, Canada, has found that patients with  and without t(4;14) re sponded equally well to 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone treatment, with little difference between the patient groups in 
either the response rate (CR + PR) or event-free survival.27   However, with conventional 
treatment and SCT, although the response rates are not different in those with t(4;14), the median 
progression-free survival in those patients  af ter SCT may be as short as 9 months and is 
different than that of pa tients without the t(4;14).28   We do not know yet whet her the use of Ld 
before and after SCT, as we propose, will modi fy that outcome. Sin ce the fraction of newly 
diagnosed patients with t(4;14) or del 17p is about 20% of patients, and effective therapy (e.g., 
thalidomide, SCT, bortezomib) is available at pr ogression of disease (i.e.,  removal from study), it 
does not make sense to exclude th ese patients from this trial. 
 
Stem cell transplant  
 
There have been two large prosp ective trials in France (IFM 90) and in UK (MRC 9), and one 
large retrospective study of myeloma patients in No rdic countries, showing a survival benefit for 
SCT compared to conventional chemoptherapy.6,7,29 In IFM 90, patients less than 65 years of age 
with DS stage II or III MM were randomized to  either SCT after up to  6 cycles of VMCP 
alternating with BCNU, vincristine, Adriamycin  and prednisone (BVAP)  or to conventional 
chemotherapy with 18 cycles of VMCP altern ating with BVAP. The SCT regimen was MEL 140 
mg/m2 and TBI, and recombinant interferon alpha (IFN α) was administered to patients in both 
groups until relapse. By intent-to-treat, SCT patien ts had a significantly higher response rate than 
those receiving conventional chemotherapy (CR+ VGPR 38% versus 14%). At a median follow- 
up of 37 months in the chemotherapy group a nd 41 months in the SCT group, the latter had 
significantly longer PFS and OS. Multivariate anal ysis of prognostic fact ors demonstrated that 
low B2M and treatment-group assignment were si gnificantly related to prolonged EFS and only 
a low B2M was significantly related to prolonged OS. 
 
Recent reports of 2 other tria ls have cast doubt on the be nefit of SCT compared with 
conventional chemotherapy. In a multi-center tr ial conducted in Spain, patients whose myeloma 
responded to initial chemotherapy were ra ndomized to SCT or continued standard 
chemotherapy.30 The CR rate was significantly higher in the SCT arm (30% vs. 11%) but no 
difference was seen in EFS and OS. However,  randomization did not occur at diagnosis, 
introducing a selection bias, and only three-quarter s of the patients enro lled were randomized. 
SCT is a useful salvage treatment for patients wi th primary refractory multiple myeloma; hence, 
those patients would have been excluded by the trial design. In addition, the median PFS was 
higher in the SCT arm (42 months vs. 33 months ), a difference that might have achieved 
statistical significance had the size  of the patient groups been larger.

In a large intergroup trial in th e United States, patients under 70 (n=516) received initial therapy 
with VAD and were then randomized to SCT or to vincristine/ca rmustine/melphalan/ 
cyclophosphamide/prednisolone (VBMCP).31 There was selection bias in  this trial also. Of 813 
patients registered and assigned  to treatment arms, only 516 we re randomized and then only 424 
were treated as planned. There were no differen ces seen in response rate, PFS and OS between 
the arms. 
 
Simply comparing conventional chemotherapy with  SCT is not as salient an issue, however, 
because the results of SCT have improved w ith the use of melpha lan alone at 200mg/m2 (less 
morbidity) and with tandem MEL 200 SCT. Patients not achievi ng a VGPR after the 1st SCT 
benefit from a 2nd SCT, based on the result s of the IFM 94 trial.32   In this randomized trial 1 and 
2 SCT were compared in 399 patients up to 60 ye ars of age.  The 7-ye ar EFS and OS were 
significantly improved in the tandem SCT arm (20%  vs. 10% and 42% vs. 21%, respectively). In 
the IFM 94 trial, 75% of patients underwent the 2nd SCT and treatment-related mortality was less 
than 5%. 
 
Because of concerns about the cost and risk of  tandem SCT, defining th e patients who benefited 
from tandem SCT was important. In th e IFM 94 trial, the only factor  that distinguished patients 
who benefited from tandem SCT was response to the 1st SCT. Patients with < 90% reduction of 
the M-protein (i.e., those not achieving a VGPR) after the 1st SCT had a longer OS in the tandem 
SCT arm. Patients experiencing CR or VGPR after the 1st SCT had the same OS with or without 
the 2nd SCT. Therefore, in this trial, comparing cont inued Ld to early SCT,  patients randomized 
to SCT will receive a second MEL 200 SCT if their response to the 1st SCT is not at least a 
VGPR with respect to the ba seline M-protein studies. 
 
Early versus delayed stem cell transplant  
 
In addition to the important tria ls described above, there have been two trials examining the 
question of early versus delayed SCT in newly diagnosed patients.33,34 In the first trial, conducted 
at Mayo Clinic in the early 1990's, 118 patients with multiple myeloma had stem cells mobilized 
and collected within 6 months of diagnosis, follo wed by transplantation only at progression of 
disease.33 Eleven had transplants early due to progressive disease. Overall, with 7 years of 
follow-up at the time of the repo rt, 67 had had SCT, 9 had died of progressive disease before 
SCT, and 42 were alive in plateau phase. Median surviv al of the group was 58.5 months. 
Predictors of survival were markers of the bi ology of the myeloma a nd not treatment-related 
variables: B2MG, bone marrow labeling index (S phase), and hemoglobin level predicted overall 
survival. The investigators concluded "early cr yopreservation of blood stem cells followed by 
transplantation at progression is a feasible approach to therapy in patients with myeloma. The 
underlying biology of the disease has a grea ter impact on survival than the timing of 
transplantation. A prospective rando mized trial is required to answer  definitively the question of 
the optimal timing of blood cell transplantation."

In the mid-1990's Jean-Paul Fermand and his co lleagues in the Group ‘‘Myelome Autogreffe’’ 
performed a multi-center prospective randomized trial comparing early and delayed timing of 
autologous SCT for newly diagnosed untreated patients with MM.34 After enrollment, all patients 
received 1 to 2 cycles of intensified CHOP (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, vincristine and 
prednisone; the second cycle also included G-CSF)  followed by stem cell collection and then 
randomization to early versus late  SCT. The early transplantation group (n = 91) received 3 to 4 
cycles of VAMP (V, A and methylprednisolone) followed by autologous SCT with lomustine, 
etoposide, cyclophosphamide, MEL 140 and TBI. Patien ts in the late transplantation group (n = 
94) received VMCP as induction therapy until a st able plateau phase was reached. Once patients 
showed either disease progression while receiving  VMCP, disease resistan ce (no response or < 
PR after 6 courses of VMCP), or relapsed afte r responding (n = 81), they then received monthly 
VAMP followed by autologous SCT as rescue therapy. At a median follow-up of 58 months, 
there was no significant difference in OS with an  estimated median OS in  the early group of 64.6 
and in the late group of 64 mont hs. There was a significant differ ence in EFS (medians of 39 and 
13 months in the early and late groups respective ly). Treatment-related mortality in both groups 
was notable -- 10% and 14% in the early and late  groups -- and not surpri sing given the intensity 
of the regimen. 
 
In this trial, comparing continued Ld to Ld and SCT, the optimal SCT strategy (tandem MEL 
200) will be available to all patients, either on st udy for those randomized to SCT or off-study at 
progression of disease for those ra ndomized to continued Ld. At the three collaborating centers 
treatment-related mortality in autologous SCT for myeloma is < 1% in all categories of MM 
patients. In the last 3 ASCT trials at MSKCC (IRB # 98-107, 04- 024, 05-080) over 100 patients 
have been treated and there has been 1 treatment-related death (on IRB # 98-107) due to 
transfusion-related bacterial sepsis. At TMC, there has been no treatm ent related death among 
the more than 60 myeloma patients who have  received an ASCT in the past 4 years.35 In 
addition, the Ld regimen is likely more effectiv e than the combination chemotherapy regimens 
used on these historical trials and less toxic as well. 
 
Lenalidomide and multiple myeloma  
Lenalidomide (Revlimid®, CC-5013) is a thalidomide an alog and a proprietary IMiD® 
compound of Celgene Corporation.  Its anti-neopl astic activity stems fr om several potential 
mechanisms of action, including direct inducti on of apoptosis, inhibi tion of angiogenesis, 
inhibition of pro-survival signal s to tumor cells, and stimulation of host anti-tumor immunity.36 
Lenalidomide is FDA-approved for the treatment of  low- or intermediate -1-risk myelodysplastic 
syndrome (MDS) with deletion 5q cytogenetic ab normality and transfusion-dependent anemia, 
based on a 64% rate of achieving transfusio n-independence (including 33% achieving a 
cytogenetic complete response) in this populatio n of MDS patients in a multi-center phase II 
trial.37 Lenalidomide is also approved in combination with dexamethasone for 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.

In pre-clinical studies, lenalidomide has been shown to have direct anti-myeloma activity, 
inducing apoptosis or G1growth arrest in mult iple myeloma cell lines and in primary patient 
myeloma cells resistant to melpha lan, doxorubicin and dexamethasone.38 A close analog of 
lenalidomide, CC-4047, decreased the binding of myeloma cells to bone marrow stromal cells, 
and decreased the production of pro-myeloma survival factors such as IL-6 and TNF- α within 
the bone marrow environment.39   Thalidomide, lenalidomide, a nd CC-4047 all increase T cell 
proliferation following T cell receptor-mediated activation, leading to increased IL-2 and IFN- γ 
secretion.40-42   These cytokines in turn can augment na tural killer (NK) cell activation and 
strengthen NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against myeloma 
cell lines and primary patient myeloma cells.43,44 
 
In clinical studies, lenalidomide has demonstrated significant activ ity in both relapsed/refractory 
and untreated multiple myeloma.   Two phase I trials enrolled  a total of 44 patients with 
relapsed/refractory myeloma at lenalidomide dos es of 5, 10, 25, and 50mg daily.  Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in al most all patients in the highest dose cohort after 
28 days of therapy, requiring dose reductions to 25 mg/day, which was determined to be the 
MTD.  One patient had thromboembolism; other toxicities were generally mild and included 
rash, leg cramps, fatigue, and lightheadedness.  Clinical responses were noted in both trials.45,46 
 
A phase II multicenter study randomized 101 re lapsed/refractory myeloma patients to 
lenalidomide 15mg BID or 30mg daily for days 1- 21 of every 28 days.  Dexamethasone could be 
added for progressive disease (PD) at 4 weeks or stable disease (S D) at 8 weeks.  Thirty-eight 
percent achieved a minimal response ( ≥25% reduction in paraprotein) or better, including 6% 
CR, and another 47% had stable di sease.  An additional 10 of 30 (33%) achieved a PR or better 
after the addition of dexamethas one.  Median time to progress ion (TTP) was 6 months.  Grade 
≥3 neutropenia and thrombocytopeni a were seen in 28% and 18% of  patients, respectively, more 
commonly in the BID dosing cohort.47    A larger multicenter study examined the efficacy of 
lenalidomide monotherapy in relapsed/refract ory myeloma at 30mg daily for 21 of every 28 
days.  A greater than 50% reduc tion in paraprotein levels was required for response.  Of 222 
patients enrolled, 53 (25%) achi eved a response (PR or CR) and 152 (71%) had SD, with median 
TTP of 6 months.  Neutropeni a (40%) and thrombocytopenia (23%) were the most common 
grade 3/4 adverse events in th is heavily pretreated population.48 
 
In two double-blind multicenter internationa l phase III clinical trials (MM-009, North 
American, 353 patients; MM-010, Europe, Australia , and Israel, 351 patien ts), patients with 
relapsed or refractory MM not resistant to dexa methasone (D) were treated with D 40 mg daily 
on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20 every 28 days and were randomized to receive either lenalidomide 
(L) 25mg daily orally on days 1-21 every 28 days or placebo.49,50 At a median follow-up from 
randomization of 17.1 months (M M-009) and 16.5 months (MM- 010), both studies showed 
significant improvement with LD compared to  D in overall response (OR) (MM-009: 61% vs 
20.5%, p<.001; MM-010: 59.1% vs. 24%, p<.001, resp ectively), time to progression (TTP) 
(MM-009: 11.1 months vs. 4.7 months, p<.001; MM-010: 11.3 months vs. 4.7 months, p<.001, 
respectively), and overall survival (OS) (MM-009: 29.6 months vs. 20.5 months, p<.001; MM- 
010: not estimable vs 20.6 months , p<.001, respectively). In a subg roup analysis on patients with

impaired creatinine clearance, no significant difference in response ra te, TTP, or OS was 
observed in patients with creati nine clearance above or below 50 ml/min who were treated with 
LD; however, for 16 patients with creatinine clearance <30ml/min, me dian TTP and OS was 
shorter than for those with creatinine clearance > 30ml/min, but still significantly longer than for 
patients treated with D. Lenalidomide in combination with dexa methasone received FDA 
approval in the use of relapsed/re fractory multiple myeloma on June 29th, 2006. 
 
LD has also been examined as a first-line therap y for multiple myeloma.  In a phase II study, 
investigators from Mayo clinic treated 34 newl y diagnosed myeloma patients with LD on the 
same schedule used in  the phase III trials.17 In follow-up presented in 12/07 at the American 
Society of Hematology annual meeting, th e data on this tr ial were up-dated.51 At 1 year, 31 of 34 
(91%) patients had objective responses ( ≥50% paraprotein reduction) , with 6 (18%) CR and 13 
(38%) VGPR (CR+VGPR = 56%).  No patients experienced pr ogression of disease within the 
first 5 months of therapy. Forty-seven percent experienced grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity, 
most commonly fatigue (15%), muscle weakne ss (6%), anxiety (6%), pneumonitis (6%), and 
rash (6%). Of the 34 patients on the trial, 21 rece ived LD (4 cycles) as their primary therapy and 
continued on Ld to progression of disease. In those patients, best overa ll responses were 24% CR 
and 43% VGPR (CR+VGPR = 67 %) and the median time to progression was 32 months. 
 
On the ECOG phase III trial the one-year survival of 96% with Ld  is the highest ever reported 
for an initial therapy tr ial in multiple myeloma.52 On that trial there was a 9% incidence of 
thromboembolic complications despite prophylaxi s with aspirin (325mg).  Ld has now become a 
frequently used initial therapy for myeloma because the toxicity and safety profile is better than 
LD and likely better than that of thalidomide and dexamethasone. In add ition, the availability of 
bortezomib as well as SCT give options for sec ond-line therapies should Ld be ineffective. 
 
In this trial we have chosen to use lenalidom ide at the starting dose of 25mg QD on days 1-21 
every 28 days, with built-in dose reductions for to xicity, because this is the regimen studied in 
the largest number of patients and is the FDA-approved dose. We also will use low-dose 
dexamethasone based on superior  survival in the ECOG phase III trial. In addition, for 
thromboembolic prophylaxis, we will use as pirin for those with no risk factors for 
thromboembolic complications and prescribe prophylactic low-molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) for those with risk f actors (prior deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus > 6 
months prior to enrollment, obesity (body mass index greater than 30), history of vascular 
disease, documented coronary artery disease, pa cemaker, or insulin-dependent diabetes). For 
patients whose insurance will no t cover LMWH, full-dose Coumadin can be used. Patients who 
experience thromboembolic complications on this trial will be fully anticoagulated and continue 
on therapy. 
 
On this trial then, we are comparing treatment approaches in which the response data indicate 
near parity.  On this trial, at 1-year in the Ld  arm, the CR+VGPR rate is likely to be in the 45% 
range. Cyclophosphamide (used for mobilization) may increase the response rate. It is difficult to 
know what the 2-year CR+VGPR rate will be but on the Mayo Clinic phase II trial patients 
continuing to receive Ld showed improved resp onses as noted above with CR+VGPR of 67%

and median time to progression of almost 3 years.  Of note, continuing lenalidomide in 
responding patients until progression of diseas e is standard practice at this time.53 
 
In the SCT arm the CR+VGPR rates will be in the 50% range but adding maintenance low-dose 
Ld for those failing to achieve VGPR after tw o SCT and for those with  high-risk disease may 
increase those rates. It is important to note th at patients experiencing pr ogression of disease in 
either arm of this trial will be able to rece ive effective second-line therapy with bortezomib- 
based treatment and for those in the Ld arm with SCT. 
 
There is no patient jeopardy attached to being in ei ther arm of this trial. It is also important to 
note that this trial uses a "pick-the-winner" trial design that provides a challenge to Ld to show 
equivalence to SCT. 
 
 
 
4.0 OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.1 Design  
 
Newly diagnosed patients with symptomatic multip le myeloma eligible for SCT will receive Ld 
for 4 cycles and be evaluated fo r response after every cycle. Pati ents with progressive disease 
after at least one cycle of treat ment, and patients with  stable disease after 4 cycles will be 
removed from study. Since the rate of progressi ve disease on Ld was 0% in the Mayo Clinic 
phase II trial described above, we expect that patients who experience  progression of disease 
after 2 or 4 cycles of Ld will be extremely rare. 
 
After completion of 4 cycles of Ld, all patients will then  undergo conventional stem cell 
mobilization with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF (10ug/kg/day), or plerixafor and G-CSF, and 
stem cell collection. Mobilization with cyclophosph amide is preferred, but plerixafor is also 
allowed. 
 
After stem cell mobilization and collection, patients  will be stratified.  Stratification will be 
based on baseline cyto genetics, FISH and β-2 microglobulin. High-risk patients are those with 
hypodiploidy, t(4;14) or del 17p, or β-2 microglobulin greater than 3.5, while all others will be 
considered standard risk. 
 
Patients will then be randomized to conti nued Ld or high-dose melphalan with SCT. 
 
On the SCT arm, patients not achiev ing VGPR by 3 months after the 1st SCT will undergo a 2nd 
SCT. All patients, after one or  two SCT, will receive mainte nance L as described below. 
On the continued Ld arm (or non- transplant arm), patients will c ontinue Ld as described below. 
Clinical and myeloma status will be evaluated every month during the initial 4 cycles of Ld and 
every 3 months thereafter as described in S ection 12 below. Beyond 3 years of treatment, the 
patients will be followed yearly for PFS and OS. At progression of disease patients will come off

study and be treated with alte rnative therapies. Patients on the Ld arm may have high-dose 
melphalan with SCT at progression of disease. 
 
Evaluation of the diseas e will occur according to the sche dule outlined in table 7, section 10. 
 
 
 
4.2 Intervention  
 
In the initial 4 cycles of therapy, patients will  receive oral lenalidomid e at the starting dose of 
25mg on days 1-21 every 28 days (one cycle) with  dose adjustments for cr eatinine clearance and 
dose reductions for toxicity as described belo w. Patients will receive low-dose oral 
dexamethasone at 40mg weekly on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle with dose 
reductions as below for toxicity (the weekly dos e could be split over 2 da ys in the week i.e. 
20mg on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 for better tolerance). 
 
For thromboembolic prophylaxis, patients with no  risk factors for thromboembolic complications 
will receive aspirin (325mg or 81mg). Risk factors include prior deep vein thrombosis or 
pulmonary embolus (> 6 months prior to enrollment), obesity, history of vascular disease, 
documented coronary artery disease, pacemaker, or insulin-dependent diabetes. Those with one 
or more risk factors wi ll be prescribed prophylactic low- molecular weight heparin (LMWH). For 
patients whose insurance will not cover LMWH, Co umadin (INR 2-3) can be used. Patients who 
experience thromboembolic complications on this  trial will receive Coumadin (INR 2-3) and 
continue on therapy. 
 
Patients will be evaluated by th eir physician monthly during the fi rst 4 cycles of Ld and patients 
will have response of the myel oma assessed with se rum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum 
immunofixation (IF) and quantitative immunoglobul ins, and serum free light chain assay. 
Patients with non-secretory myelom a will not have bone marrow asse ssment repeated if they are 
clinically stable.  Patients with progression of di sease after at least one cycle of treatment with 
Ld and patients with stable disease afte r 4 cycles will be removed from study. 
 
After 4 cycles of Ld, eligible patients will undergo stem cell m obilization and collection with 
standard-of-care cyclophosphamide and Neupogen (G-CSF), or with plerixafor and G-CSF. 
Mobilization with cyclophosphamide is preferred, but  plerixafor is also a llowed. Ld will be held 
for at least 2 weeks prior to stem cell mobilization. 
 
Within 2 weeks after stem cell mobilization and collec tion has been completed, patients will be 
stratified and randomized by the biostatistician wo rking with the Clinical Trials Office at the 
registration center of MSKCC to either continued Ld or SCT. 
 
For continued Ld, patients will resume Ld at the last dose tolerated during the initial 4 cycles, 
with prophylactics and dose reductions as indi cated. Treatment on the continued Ld arm will 
resume at the treating physician’s discretion. Lenalidomide will be cont inued until progression of 
disease or as tolerated. Low-dose dexamethasone will be continued for 1 year, as tolerated. Dose

adjustments will follow guidelines detailed in se ction 9.2. Patients will be seen every 3 months 
by their physician and their disease will be reasse ssed for the first 3 years on study. Patients will 
also have a CBC and pregnancy test performed monthly as long as they remain on treatment. 
Beyond 3 years of treatment, the patients wi ll be followed yearly for PFS and OS. 
 
 
 
For SCT, patients are admitted to the hospital. High-dose melphalan is administered in a single 
dose on day -2 or split dose on days -3 and - 2, through a central venou s catheter. Melphalan 
dose-adjustments are made for age and creatinine clearance. Patien ts with creatinine clearance > 
51ml/min receive melphalan at 200mg/m2. Patients with creatinine clearance < 51ml/min (to be 
evaluated within 2 weeks of SCT) will receive 140mg/m2.  Patients > 70 years old receive 
140mg/m2 also. Each SCT in a tandem SCT is a clinic ally discrete event an d these rules of dose 
adjustment apply to each SCT. Therefore, it is po ssible, that patients will  get different doses of 
melphalan in tandem SCT. 
 
Patients will receive stan dard supportive care measures in SCT as previously described except 
that Neulasta (PEG-filgrastim) and not Ne upogen is used after SCT on day +1 to aid 
hematopoietic recovery.35,73,74 
 
Post-SCT after discharge patients are followed on a regular basi s as per standard of care and as 
deemed necessary by their treating physician.  At 3 months after the first SCT patients will have 
response of the myeloma asse ssed with serum protein elec trophoresis (SPEP), serum 
immunofixation (IF) and quantitativ e immunoglobulins, serum free  light chain assay and bone 
marrow studies. Patients with non-secretory my eloma will have a bone marrow assessment at 3 
months post-SCT. 
 
Patients with less than a VGPR at 3 months post-SCT will undergo a second SCT. At 3 months 
after the 1st or 2nd SCT, all patients will begin mainte nance L(L=10mg/day on Days 1-28 of 
every 28 days cycle escalated to 15 mg after 3 cycles, if tolerated). Lenalidomide will be 
continued until progression of disease, as tole rated. Dose adjustments will follow guidelines 
detailed in section 9.2. 
 
For 12 months post-SCT all patients will receiv e prophylactic acyclovir 400mg PO twice a day 
adjusted for renal function and a daily proton-pump inhibitor. 
 
During the first 3 years on study, patients ar e seen and evaluated every 3 month by their 
physician and will have response of the myeloma asse ssed with serum protein electrophoresis 
(SPEP), serum immunofixation (IF) and quan titative immunoglobulins, and serum free light 
chain assay. Patients with non-secretory my eloma will not routinely have bone marrow 
assessment repeated if  clinically stable. 
 
Beyond 3 years on study, patients will be seen ev ery once a year with disease assessments at 
those visits for PFS and OS assessment.

5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.1  Lenalidomide (Revlimid®)  
 
Lenalidomide (L) (REVLIMID®, CC-5013), a thalidomide analogue, is an 
immunomodulatory agent with anti-angiogenic prope rties.  The chemical name is 3-(4-amino- 
1-oxo 1,3-dihydro -2 H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione  and it has the following chemical 
structure: 
 
O O H 
N 
N O 
 
 
NH2 
 
3-(4-amino-1-oxo 1,3-dihydro-2 H-isoindol-2-yl) piperidine-2,6-dione 
 
The empirical formula for lenalidomide is C 13H13N3O3, and the gram molecular weight is  
259.3. 
 
 
 
Formulation  
 
Lenalidomide is an off-white to pale-yello w solid powder. It is soluble in organic 
solvent/water mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric 
carbon atom and can exist as the optically active forms S(-) and R(+), and is produced as a 
racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero. 
 
Lenalidomide is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 25 mg capsules for oral administration. 
Each capsule contains lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following inactive 
ingredients: lactose anhydrous, microcrystalli ne cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate. 
 
Supporter: Celgene Corporation will provide lenali domide free of charge through the 
Revlimid REMS® program to enrolled patients. 
 
Mechanism of Action  
 
The mechanism of action of lena lidomide remains to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide 
possesses immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic properties.  It inhibits production in the 
bone marrow of cytokines (IL-6, TNF- α, VEGF) important for growth and survival of 
myeloma cells, inhibits COX-2 expression, and decreases tumor angiogenesis.  Lenalidomide 
can directly induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apop tosis in some but not all myeloma cell lines. 
It also stimulates T cell proliferation and cy tokine secretion and NK cell cytotoxic activity.

Storage  
 
Lenalidomide should be stored at room temperat ure away from direct sunlight and protected 
from excessive heat and cold. 
 
Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
Lenalidomide, in healthy volunteers, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with 
maximum plasma concentrations occurrin g between 0.625 and 1.5 hours post-dose.  Co- 
administration with food does not alter the ex tent of absorption (A UC) but does reduce the 
maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) by  36%. The pharmacokinetic disposition of 
lenalidomide is linear. Cmax and AUC increas e proportionately with increases in dose. 
Multiple dosing at the recommended dose-regi men does not result in drug accumulation. 
Pharmacokinetic sampling in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients was not performed. 
In multiple myeloma patients maximum plasma  concentrations occurr ed between 0.5 and 4.0 
hours post-dose both on Days 1 and 28.  AUC and Cmax values increase proportionally with 
dose following single and multiple doses. Expos ure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 
57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma 
proteins is approximately 30%. 
 
The metabolic profile of lenalidomide in humans has not been studied. In healthy volunteers, 
approximately two-thirds of lenalidomide is e liminated unchanged through urinary excretion. 
The process exceeds the glomerular filtration rate  and therefore is partially or entirely active. 
Half-life of elimination is approximately 3 hours. 
 
Administration  
 
Lenalidomide is an analogue of thalidomide, a known human teratogen that causes severe life- 
threatening human birth defects.  Because of this toxicity, and to limit potential fetal exposure 
to lenalidomide, patients must follow the birth control guidelines outlined in Appendix C.  All 
women of childbearing potential must follow th e protocol-dictated timelines for pregnancy 
testing. 
 
Lenalidomide is administered orally.  It may be  taken with or without  food at approximately 
the same time each day. 
 
Celgene Corporation will supply Revlimid® (lenalidomide) to stud y participants at no charge 
through the Revlimid REMS® program.  All physicians who prescribe lenalidomide for 
research subjects enrolled into this trial and all research subjects enrolled into this trial must

5.6  Plerixafor (Mozobil) 
General Information  
Mechanism of Action: Plerixafor is an inhibitor of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and blocks 
binding of its cognate ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 α (SDF-1α). SDF-1α and CXCR4 are 
recognized to play a role in the trafficking and homing of human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the marrow compartment. Once in the marrow, stem cell CXCR4 can act to help anchor these 
cells to the marrow matrix, either directly via SDF-1 α or through the induction of other adhesion 
molecules. 
 
Formulation  
 
Mozobil (plerixafor injection) is a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colorless to pale yellow, 
isotonic solution for subcutaneous injection. Each mL of the sterile solution contains 20 mg of plerixafor. Each single-use vial is filled to deliver 1.2 mL of the sterile solution that contains 24 
mg of plerixafor and 5.9 mg of sodium chloride in Water for Injection adjusted to a pH of 6.0 to 
7.5 with hydrochloric acid and with sodium hydroxide, if required. 
 
Preparation  
 
Vials should be inspected visually for particulat e matter and discoloration prior to administration 
and should not be used if there is particulate matter or if the solution is discolored. 
 
The recommended dose of Mozobil is 0.24 mg/kg body weight by subcutaneous (SC) injection. Use the patient’s actual body weight to calculate the volume of Mozobil to be administered. Each vial delivers 1.2 mL of 20 mg/mL solution, and the volume to be administered to patients should be calculated from the following equation: 
0.012 X patient’s actual body weight (in kg) = volume to be administered (in mL) 
 
Recommended Concomitant Medications: Administer daily morning doses of G-CSF 10 
micrograms/kg for 4 days prior to the first evening dose of Mozobil and on each day prior to 
apheresis. 
 
Begin treatment with Mozobil after the patient has received G-CSF once daily for four days. 
Administer Mozobil approximately 11 hours prior to initiation of each apheresis for up to 4 
consecutive days.

 Ld increases the risk of thrombotic events. All patients with no risk factors for 
thromboembolic complications will begin thromboembolic prophylaxis with aspirin 325mg or 81mg daily at the start of treatment.  [Aspirin-intolerant patients should receive 
prophylactic daily low molecular weight he parin (LMWH) or an ticoagulation with 
Coumadin (INR 2-3).] Risk factors include prio r deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary 
embolus (> 6 months prior to enrollment), obesity (body mass index greater than 30), 
history of vascular disease, documented corona ry artery disease, pacemaker, or insulin- 
dependent diabetes. Those with one or more risk factors will  be prescribed prophylactic 
low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH). For patients whose insurance will not cover 
LMWH, Coumadin (INR 2-3) can be used. Patients who experience thromboembolic 
complications on this trial will receive Coumad in (INR 2-3) and continue on therapy. 
Concurrent use of recombinant erythropoietin is discouraged due to reports of increased 
thromboembolic events in patients receivi ng Ld with erythropoietin. For information on 
the risk of venous thromboembolism with co mbined oral contraception see Appendix B: 
Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Accept able Birth Control 
Methods. 
 Concurrent use of erythropoie tin requires full anticoagulation of patients with therapeutic 
doses of LMWH or Coumadin. Anticoagu lation should be managed as per MSKCC 
anticoagulation guidelines for platelet counts <50,000/mm
3. Anti-microbial prophylaxis is 
not required and is left  to the discretion of the treating physician. 
 Prednisone to treat lenalidomide-related rash es is permitted in small doses of no more 
than 10mg per day. 
 Standard supportive care meas ures may be used at the disc retion of the treating physician.  
 
 The lenalidomide starting dose will be based on baseline calculated creatinine clearance 
as follows: 
 
 
Lenalidomide Starting Dose Based on Renal Function at Study Entry  
Baseline Calculated 
Creatinine Clearance 
(by Cockcroft-Gault)  Starting Lenalidomide Dose  
≥ 60 ml/min 25mg daily on Days 1 - 21 of each 28-day cycle 
≥ 30 and < 60 ml/min 10mg daily on Days 1 - 21 of each 28-day cycle 
 
 
 At investigator discretion, patients star ted with a reduced lenalidomide dose due to 
baseline calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30ml/min but < 60ml/min, may have their 
lenalidomide dose gradually increased in a step -wise manner at the start of Cycle 2 or at 
the start of subsequent treatment  cycles, if they tolerated the prior treatment cycle without 
requiring dose modifications, in terruptions or delays due to toxicity.  Lenalidomide dose 
titrations are permitted in 5mg increments on the same dosing schedule (daily on Days 1- 
21 of each 28-day cycle) up to the maximu m allowable target dose of 25mg daily on

Days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle.  The lenali domide dose may only be in creased at the start 
of a new cycle of therapy, may only be incr eased once every 28 days  (or less frequently), 
and may only be increased if the prior trea tment cycle was completed without requiring 
dose modifications, interruptions or delays due to toxicity. 
 
 If a dose of lenalidomide is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same 
day.  If it is missed for the entir e day, it should not be made up. 
 
 Patients who take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide s hould be instructed to 
seek emergency medical care if needed and contact study staff immediately. 
 
 Response to Ld as initial ther apy will be assessed after ever y cycle of therapy. Patients 
with progression of disease after at least one cy cle, or patients with stable disease after 4 
cycles will be removed from study and offered other therapies including SCT. After 4 cycles of therapy, patients w ith a response to Ld will have Ld held for at least 2 weeks 
prior to stem ce ll mobilization. 
 
 
 
Stem cell mobilization and collection  
 
 All patients will have blood stem cells mobilized according to institutional practices. 
This may include either cyclophosphamide or plerixafor based on AIBW as below and in 
Appendix G) and G-CSF (Neupo gen) given at 10ug/kg s ubcutaneous daily based on 
actual body weight with leukapheresis be ginning as per institutional practices. 
Mobilization with cyclophosphamide is prefer red, but plerixafor is also allowed. Patients 
will receive prophylaxis antibiotics according to institutional practices. 
 
 Once stem cell collection begins, a target of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells per kg will be sought, 
allowing the collection of adequate stem cel ls for up to 3 stem cell transplants in a 
patient's lifetime. We will seek a minimal acce ptable collection of 4 x 106 CD34+ cells 
per kg, allowing two SCT with th e minimum acceptable dose of 2 x 106 CD34+ cells per 
kg per SCT. 
 
 Patients failing to collect  the minimum dose may be mobilized as per institutional 
guidelines a second time. Patients who are m obilized twice and have  less than 4 million 
stem cells (CD34+ cells) collected per kg wi ll be removed from st udy. The likelihood of 
this happening is less than 2%. 
 
 Blood stem cells will be cryopreserved according to institutional practices. 
 
 Then all patients will be stra tified into high- and standard-r isk groups. High-risk patients 
are those who have baseline high-risk cytoge netics or FISH (hypodiploidy, presence of 
t(4;14) or del 17p) or baseline β2-microglobulin > 3.5.  All other patients will be 
designated as standard-risk. Af ter stratification, patients wi ll be randomized either to 
continue Ld or to undergo standa rd high-dose melphalan and SCT.

Continued Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone  
 
 Patients who are randomized to receive cont inued Ld will be treate d as described above, 
but with dexamethasone at 20 mg weekly on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (the weekly dose could 
be split over 2 days in the week i.e. 10 mg on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 for 
better tolerance). Lenalidomide (L) will remain  at a dose of 25mg (or at the last tolerated 
dose) daily for days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. Lenalidomide will be continued until 
progression of disease, as tolerated. Low-dose dexamethasone will be continued for 1 year (from the start of initial treatment) , as tolerated. Dose adjustments will follow 
guidelines detailed in section 9.2. 
 
 Pregnancy tests must be performed as in Tabl e 7, footnote 4, during the initial 4 cycles of 
Ld, all breaks in therapy including the break be tween completing the initial 4 cycles of Ld 
through stem cell mobilization and collec tion, randomization and resumption of Ld. 
 
 Dose reductions of lenalidomide wi ll be made as described below. 
 
Stem cell transplantation  
 
 For SCT, patients are admitted to hospital. 
 
 High-dose melphalan is administered in a sing le dose on day -2 or a split dose on days -3 
and -2, through a central venous catheter. Melphalan will be ad ministered at a dose of 140 
or 200 mg/m2. Melphalan dose-adjustments are made for age and creatinine clearance. 
Patients > 70 years of  age receive 140mg/m2. Patients with creatinine clearance < 
51ml/min (to be evaluated within 2 weeks of SCT) receive 140mg/m2.  Each SCT in a 
tandem SCT is a clinically discrete event and th ese rules of dose adju stment apply to each 
SCT. Therefore, it is possible that patients will get different doses of melphalan in tandem 
SCT. 
 
 Melphalan will be given based on ideal body weight (IBW- Appendix G) for patients who 
weigh 100-120% of their IBW. For patients  who weigh less than 100% of their IBW, 
dosing should be based on actual body weight (ABW). For patients who weigh more than 
120% of their IBW, dosing should be based on the adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW). 
 
 Ideal Body Weight Formulas: 
 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet For patients less than 5 feet, subtract 2.3 kg/inch 
 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight Formula: 
AIBW = IBW + [(0.40) x (Actual BW - IBW)]

 Patients will receive standard supportiv e care measures in SCT as per MSKCC 
institutional practices. 
 
 Post-SCT after discharge patients are followe d on a regular basis as per standard of care 
and as deemed necessary by the treating physician through month 3 post-SCT.  This 
applies to all SCT. 
 
 Patients may then be seen and evaluated monthly. 
 
 Patients will be assessed for dise ase response 3 months after the 1st SCT. 
 
 Patients will receive a 2nd SCT 3 to 6 mont hs after the 1st SCT if the respons e to the first 
stem cell transplant is less than a VGPR, pr ovided they have full y recovered from the 1st 
SCT. 
 
 
 Recovery from the 1st SCT (i.e., from high-dose melpha lan and SCT) is defined by 
achievement of the following clinical criteria: 
➢ Mucositis and gastrointestinal symptoms  resolved, off hyperalimentation and  
intravenous hydration.  
 
➢ Liver and renal function tests within the inclusion criteria for initial autograft. 
 
➢ Off antibiotics and Amphotericin B form ulations or voriconazole for proven, 
probable or possible infections (defined  in accordance with the EORTC/MSG 
criteria).75 Patients who have been treated fo r an infection but  are continuing 
antibiotics, Amphotericin B or voriconazole fo r prophylaxis are eligible to continue on 
protocol with approval of the Principal Investigator. 
 
➢ Completed administration  of any radiotherapy. 
 
➢ Patients who develope d symptoms of cardiac insuffic iency after initial enrollment 
will require repeat cardiac testing and must me et the same criteria as for initial study 
entry. 
 
➢ Pulmonary function tests must meet  initial study entry criteria. 
 
 Patients will be assessed fo r myeloma response every 3 mont hs beginning 3 months after 
the 2nd SCT for the first 3 years. 
 Beginning 3 months post 1st or 2nd SCT, all patients will receive maintenance L 
(L=10mg/day on Days 1-28 every 28 day cycle,  escalated to 15 mg after 3 cycles, if 
tolerated). Lenalidomide will be continued until  progression of disease, as tolerated. Dose 
adjustments will follow guidelines detailed in section 9.2.

C) Instruction for init iation of a New Cycle  
 
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle of initial therapy or 
continued Ld therapy if: 
 The ANC is ≥ 1,000/μL 
 The platelet count is ≥ 50,000/μL 
 Hemoglobin is ≥ 8g/dL 
 
 Any  drug-related  rash,  allergic  reaction/hypersensitivity,  sinus  bradycardia/  other 
cardiac arrhythmia adverse event, dyspepsia,  gastritis, gastric or  duodenal ulcer or 
confusion or mood alterations that ma y have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 severity; 
 
 Any other drug-related adverse events th at may have occurred have resolved to ≤ grade 
2 severity. 
 
 
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle of  lenalidomide 
maintenance therapy if: 
 
 The ANC is > 500/ μL 
 The platelet count is > 50,000/ μL 
 Hemoglobin is > 8g/dL 
 Any drug-related rash, allergic reaction/hyper sensitivity, sinus bradycardia/ other cardiac 
arrhythmia adverse event, dyspepsia, gastritis , gastric or duodenal ulcer or confusion or 
mood alterations that may have occurred has resolved to ≤ grade 1 severity; 
 Any other drug-related adverse events th at may have occurred have resolved to 
≤ grade 2 severity. 
 
 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated weekly and 
a new cycle of treatment will not be initiated until the toxicity has resolved as described above. 
If the toxicity does not resolve within four week s, the patient will disc ontinue the treatment. If 
discontinuation of the treatment occurs before ran domization, the patient will be taken off study; 
if after randomizati on, the patient will remain on study until progression of disease.  If dosing of 
lenalidomide or dexamethasone was halted during the previous cycle and was restarted with a 
one-level dose reduction without requiring an in terruption for the remainde r of the cycle, then 
that reduced dose level will be initiated on Day 1 of the new cycl e. If dosing of lenalidomide or 
dexamethasone was omitted for th e remainder of the pr evious cycle or if the new cycle is 
delayed due to toxicity newly encountered on the scheduled Day 1, then the new cycle will be 
started with dose modifications as describe d in Section 9.2, Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

10.0 EVALUATION DURING TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
During the initial 4 cycles of Ld, a patien t history, physical exam, Revlimid REMS® 
requirements and toxicity assessments will be performed every month. Complete blood counts 
(CBC) will be performed every two week s during the first 4 cycles (16 weeks). 
 
For all patients response assessment as describe d in Section 12 will be performed after every 
cycle of initial Ld therapy and will include a bone marrow biopsy after completion of 4 
cycles, as is shown in Table 7 below. The re sponse of patients who receive SCT will be 
assessed as in Table 7 begi nning 3 months after the 1st SCT. Patients not achieving a VGPR 
will undergo a 2nd SCT within 6 months of the 1st SCT and be followed for response as in 
Table 7.  The response of patien ts who receive tandem SCT will be assessed as in Table 7 
beginning 3 months after the 2nd SCT. 
 
The toxicities of continued Ld and mainte nance L will be assessed in both arms. 
 
While on study assessment for adverse events  will be done using NCI version 3.0 CTC 
criteria as such events occur and at each monthly follow-up visit. 
 
Patients will be removed from study at the time of progression of dise ase. The end-of-study 
evaluation will be within 1 month of discontin uation of Ld or of doc umenting progression of 
disease and will include the assessment as described in Table 7. 
 
All patients will undergo annual as sessments of myeloma status as described below in Table

 Rare treatment-emergent adverse events of angioedema (an allergic  skin disease which 
includes small areas of swelling involving the skin and/or the lini ng of the nose, mouth, 
stomach, and intestines) and serious skin re actions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome 
(SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).   SJS and TEN are serious allergic skin 
reactions that begin as a rash in one area and later cover more of  the body leading to 
separation of the top layer of  skin (could be body-wide) wh ich have been reported with 
lenalidomide during commercial us e.  These events have the pot ential to result in death. 
Medical journals have reported patients with allergic skin reaction with thalidomide who 
also developed the same type of reaction with lenalidomide. 
 
 Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) and tumor fl are reaction (TFR) have commonly been 
observed in patients with Chronic Lymphoc ytic Leukemia (CLL), and uncommonly in 
patients with other lymphomas,  who were treated with lena lidomide.  There have been 
rare reports of TLS in patien ts with Multiple Myeloma (MM)  treated with lenalidomide, 
and no reports in patients  with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) treated with 
lenalidomide.  Tumor lysis syndrome is a me tabolic complication caused by the break- 
down products of dying cancer cells.  Co mplications include hyperkalemia (high 
potassium), hyperphosphatemia (high phosphorus), hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria (high uric acid in blood and urine), hypocal cemia (low calcium), and consequent acute 
uric acid nephropathy and acute renal failur e (kidney damage).  Tumor lysis syndrome 
can occur with or without treatment of cancer.  Tumor flare reaction is a condition that 
involves any of the following:  increase in si ze of the cancerous lymph nodes, rash and 
slight fever. 
 
 The rare adverse event of rhabdomyolysis ha s been seen with lenalidomide treatment. 
This is a serious condition involving destructi on of skeletal muscle that can lead to 
kidney damage.  Signs and symptoms include dark, red or cola colored urine, muscle 
tenderness and stiffness, ach ing (myalgia) or weakness. 
 
 An immune system disorder known as graf t versus host disease ha s been observed in 
subjects who have received le nalidomide in the setting of  allo-transplantation. This 
disorder is defined as damage  to organs in the body when  donor cells attack host organs 
which may cause yellowing of the eyes and skin, itchy dry skin, or muscle weakness. 
 
Hematological Toxicity  
 
Lenalidomide is associated with significant neutr openia (decrease in white blood cells that help 
fight infection) and thrombocytopenia (decrease in  platelets that help wi th blood clotting). You 
will have your blood counts ch ecked frequently when starting treatment with lenalidomide. 
 
Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism  
 
Lenalidomide, in combination with dexamethas one, has been associated  with an increased 
incidence in thrombotic or thromboembolic  events, including DVT, pulmonary embolism, 
thrombosis, and thromboembolism, particularly among patients with MM receiving concomitant 
therapy with an erythropoietic agent and, to a lesser extent, in  patients with MDS treated with 
lenalidomide monotherapy. Prophylaxis to reduce the risk of thrombosis should be considered in 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval Date: 13-Feb-2018

accordance with study protocols, particularly in pa tients with additional underlying risk factors, 
such as prior history of a thrombotic event. 
 
Patients with MM taking lenalidomide and dexame thasone, and to lesser extent patients with 
MDS or lymphomas taking lenalidomide monothera py, as well as patients taking combined oral 
contraceptives or hormone replacement th erapy have an increas ed risk of venous 
thromboembolic events. Physicians should discus s the risk/benefit of contraceptive methods or 
hormonal replacement with their pa tients. Effective measures to a void pregnancy must be taken. 
 
Second new cancers  
 
According to researchers, patients with cancer  have a higher risk of  developing a second new 
cancer when compared to people without cancer.  In  clinical studies of newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma, a higher number of second cancers were  reported in patients treated with induction 
therapy (treatment as first step to reducing  number of cancer cells) and/or bone marrow 
transplant then lenalidomide fo r a long period of time compar ed to patients treated with 
induction therapy and/or bone marrow transpla nt then placebo (a capsule containing no 
lenalidomide).  Patients should make their doc tors aware of their medical history and any 
concerns they may have regardin g their own increased risk of other cancers. Cancers such as 
acute myeloid leukemia, B-cell lymphoma, basa l cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma 
of the skin have been see n, as well as tumor flare. 
 
Neoplasms benign, malignan t and unspecified (including cysts and polyps)  
 
Reports of progression to acute myeloid leukemi a (AML) have been received from MDS studies. 
It is unclear whether lenalidomide indeed increa ses the risk of AML or if progression merely 
reflects the natural course of the disease.  AML is the rapid multiplication of abnormal cells 
which accumulate in the bone ma rrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. 
AML is a very serious conditi on which may result in death. 
 
Other Risks  
 
 Patients taking lenalidomide and dexamethas one for multiple myeloma should be careful 
taking drugs that may increase chance of  having blood clots (for example drugs to 
increase red blood cell count or hormone replacement therapy). 
 
 Cases of transient (for a s hort time) liver laboratory abno rmalities were reported in 
subjects treated with lenalidomide.  Your doc tor will monitor laboratory tests closely and 
recommend treatment interruption until improvement in laboratory results. 
 
 Lenalidomide has been shown to increase the level of digoxin in the blood in some 
patients; please tell your doctor if you are taking digoxin.

Stem cell mobilization and collection  
 
Central Venous Catheter 
 
The patients may need to have central venous catheter placed to have stem cells collected. 
Patients with small stature or small arm veins w ill likely need a catheter placed for stem cell 
collection. A central venous catheter is a flexible sterile tube that will be placed into a large vein 
that runs under your collarbone so that blood can be withdrawn and medications given to you 
more easily and with less discomfort.  This tube  is usually placed under local anesthesia.  There 
is a lot of experience with the use of these catheters. 
 
The most common complications ar e clotting and local infection that sometimes lead to a general 
infection in the blood. Clotting may require the remova l of the catheter or treatment of the clot by 
medicines that dissolve blood clots. Infections will be treated with antibiotics and sometimes 
removal of the catheter may be required. There is also a small risk of puncturing the lung at the time of the catheter insertion. If this occurs, pl acement of a temporary chest tube to re-inflate the 
lung may be required and there are no l ong-term effects once it has resolved. 
 
Side-effects can include: 
 
Likely  
 Clotting 
 Local infection  
 
Less Likely  
 General infection of blood 
 
Rare but serious  
 Puncturing of lung upon catheter insertion 
 
Stem cell mobilization  
 
Patients will have stem cells mobilized. Mobi lization with cyclophosphami de is preferred, though 
Mozobil is also allowed. Following chemotherapy for stem cell mobilization, they will receive G-
CSF (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) as per institutio nal practices.  Neupogen will help to move the 
stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloods tream.  Once the number of stem cells in the 
blood stream is high enough, patients  will be collected over 2-5 days, while still receiving the 
Neupogen injections. A procedure called leukapher esis will be done to collect the stem cells. 
During this procedure, blood will  be collected either through your central venous catheter or 
from a vein in one arm, processed through a machine to remove the white blood cells (stem 
cells), and then the rest of the bl ood will be returned to the patien t through the catheter or a vein

in the other arm.  The leukaphere sis procedure will last several hour s each time.  Patients will be 
asked to sign a separate consent form for the leukapheresis procedur e.  Enough stem cells will be 
collected for at least two autologous stem cell transplants. The stem cells will be frozen 
(cryopreserved) until the time when they  will be given back to the patient. 
 
Stem cell transplant  
 
A couple of weeks after the stem  cells have been collected, pa tients randomized to stem cell 
transplant will undergo an autologous stem ce ll transplant using high- dose chemotherapy with 
melphalan given through a central venous catheter.  Since this high-dose treatment destroys the 
normal bone marrow in addition to the myeloma cell s, blood stem cells must be given back to the 
patient.  The previously collected stem cells will  be thawed and given back to the patient through 
the central venous catheter,  similar to a blood transfusion; two days after the patient received the 
melphalan.  On the day after that, the patient w ill be given Neulasta by injection under the skin. 
Neulasta helps the bone marrow to produce new white blood cells  and needs to be given only 
once. After completion of the stem cell transplant, the patient will be followed in the out-patient 
clinic. 
 
At 2 and 4 months after the transplant the respon se of the patient's myel oma will be evaluated. If 
the patient has not had a greater than 90% reduction in myeloma si nce the start of treatment, the 
patient will undergo a second stem cell transplant with st em cells already collected. If the patient 
has had a greater than 90% reduction in myeloma,  the patient will not have a second stem cell 
transplant. 
 
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA FOR THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE/OUTCOME ASSESSMENT  
 
Responses will be determined according to the IMWG Response Criteria (that have 
supplanted the older European Group for Bl ood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) 
criteria)76,77 using standard electrophoretic and immunof ixation tests of blood and urine for a 
monoclonal protein (M protein), the serum free light chai n assay, and the bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy with imm unohistochemical staining.  A Response Review group that 
includes Pathology, Clinical Chemistry, and He matology will formally score responses. The 
group meets every Tuesday in the early afternoon in Pathology. Research study assistants 
prepare patient data for review and record response decisions. 
 
For all patients, responses will be assessed after every cycle of initial Ld therapy, including a 
bone marrow aspirate and biopsy after the initial 4 cycles. Patients will have response of the 
myeloma assessed with serum pr otein electrophoresis (SPEP), se rum immunofixation (IF) and 
quantitative immunoglobulins, and serum free ligh t chain assay. Patients with non-secretory 
myeloma will have the bone marrow  assessment repeated after 4 cycles of initial Ld therapy if 
they have been otherwise clinically stable (i.e., without new lytic lesions, soft-tissue 
plasmacytomas or hypercalcemia). Bone marr ow assessment is defined in Section 8.0. 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
IRB Number: 08-121 A(24) 
Approval Date: 13-Feb-2018 
48 - 
  
 
 
For patients randomized to continued Ld, response s will be scored at least every 3 months for 
the first 5 years (and every 6 months beyond 5 year s) until progression of disease. For patients 
randomized to SCT, responses will be scored at 3 months after the first and, if performed, 3 
months after the second SCT, in cluding a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and then every 3 
months for the first 5 years (and every 6 months  beyond 5 years) until progression of disease. 
Testing for response assessment will include serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), serum 
immunofixation (IF) and quantitative immunoglobul ins, and serum free light chain assay. 
Patients with non-secretory myeloma will not ha ve bone marrow studies performed if they 
have been clinically stab le as described above. 
 
Annually during the first 5 years after enrollment , and at the time of end-of-study evaluation 
for progression of disease, patients will have response of the myeloma assessed with serum 
protein electrophoresis  (SPEP), serum immunofixation (IF) and quantitative 
immunoglobulins, serum free light chain assay and bone marrow assessm ent (see table 7 for 
schedule of bone marrow biopsie s). Patients in either arm who experience progression of 
disease will undergo end-of-study assessments and will be removed from study to receive 
other therapy in consultation with their physic ians. They will continue to be followed for 
overall survival. 
 
Response criteria are as follows for patients  with measurable M protein or free light 
chains: Adapted from Durie et al, “International uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma, 
Leukemia 2006; 20:1467-73” [78]. 
 
 Stringent Complete Response (sCR) = CR as defined below plus normal FLC ratio and 
absence of clonal cells in bone  marrow by immunohistochemi stry or immunofluorescence. 
 
 Complete Response (CR) = Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and 
disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacy tomas and <5% plasma cells in bone marrow. 
 
  Unconfirmed Complete Response (uCR) = All criteria for CR are met, except a bone 
marrow biopsy is not available. 
 
  Near Complete Response (nCR) = Normalization of M-protei n as detected by Serum 
Protein Electrophoresis, but M-protein is  still detectable by immunofixation. 
 
 Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  = 90% or greater reduction in serum M- 
component plus urine M-co mponent <100 mg per 24 hours 
 
 Partial Response (PR) = >50% reduction of serum M-pr otein and reduction in 24-h 
urinary M-protein by >90% or to <200 mg per 24 h. If the serum and urine M-protein are 
unmeasurable, a >50% decrease in the difference betw een involved and uninvolved FLC 
levels is requires in place of  the M-protein criteria. If seru m and M-protein are unmeasurable, 
and serum free light assay is also unmeasurable , >50% reduction in plasma cells is required in 
place of M-protein, provided baseline bone ma rrow plasma cell percentage was >30%. In 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

addition to the above listed criteria , if present at baseline, a >50% reduction in the size of soft 
tissue plasmacytomas is also required. 
 
  Stable disease (SD) = Not meeting criteria for sCR, CR, nCR, VGPR, PR, or POD. 
 
  Progressive Disease (PD) = Laboratory/Biochemical Relapse or Progressive Disease: 
Required any one or more of the following: 
o 1) Increase of >25% from lowest response level in: 
▪ a) Serum M-component (the absolu te increase must be >0.5 g/dl) and/or  
▪ b) Urine M-component (the absolu te increase must be >200 mg/24h  
and/or  
▪ c) The difference between involve d and uninvolved FLC levels (only in  
patients without measurable serum and urine M-protein levels). The  
absolute increase must be >10mg/dl and/or  
▪ d) Bone marrow plasma cell percenta ge (the absolute % must be >10%).  
o 2) Definite development of new bone le sions or soft tissue plasmacytoma or  
definite increase in the si ze of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas. 
o 3) Development of hyperc alcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg /dl or 2.65 
mmol/l) that can be attributed solely to  the plasma cell proliferative disorder. 
 
 Clinical Relapse (i.e., progressive dise ase requiring re-treatment or alternate 
treatment) = Clinical relapse or progressive disease requires one or more of: 
Direct indicators of increasing disease and/or end organ dysfunc tion (CRAB features). It is 
not used in calculation of time to progression or pr ogression-free survival, but is listed here as 
something that can be reported optionall y or for use in clinical practice. 
o 1) Development of new soft tissu e plasmacytomas or bone lesions.  
o 2) Definite increase in the size of existing plasmacytomas or bone lesions. A  
definite increase is define d as a 50% (and at least 1c m) increase as measured 
serially by the sum of the products of  the cross-diameters of the measurable 
lesion. 
o 3) Hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dl) [2.65 mmol/l] 
o 4) Decrease in hemoglobin of >2 g/dl [1.25 mmol/l]  
o 5) Rise in serum creatinine  by 2 mg/dl or more [177 μmol/l or more]  
 
 
 
Complete response requires confirmation by bone marrow assessment. 
Special considerations in assessing response  
Low-level urinary M proteins may vary from measurement to measurement. For an increase 
in urinary M protein to be consid ered progression of di sease it must be an absolute increase of 
at least 200 mg/day.

In quantitative immunoglobulin serum studies, the levels of heavy and light chain are often 
discrepant for technical reason s. If the discrepancy leads to equivocal response values, the 
heavy-chain value will be used since the heavy-ch ain value is usually a mo re reliable indicator 
because of its longer half-life and non-renal metabolism. 
 
 
 
In 2% of patients, only the serum free light ch ain level can be measured as the M protein. In 
these patients, the response cr iteria are based on changes in the involved free light chain 
levels, and remain statistically the same except that the ratio of kappa-to-lambda in the free 
light chain assay should also be normal in CR. 
 
In 1% of patients, no marker for the M protein exists. In those patien ts, the response criteria 
are: 
 
  Partial Response (PR) = A reduction of > 50% in ma rrow plasma cells with no 
progressive disease by skeletal su rvey or other imaging modality. 
 
  Very good partial response (VGPR) = A reduction of > 90% in marrow plasma cells 
with no progressive disease by skeletal  survey or other imaging modality. 
  Complete Response (CR) = Normalization of the bone ma rrow biopsy, including <5% 
total plasma cells and lack of clonal excess by  kappa/lambda staining, with no progressive 
disease by skeletal survey or other imaging modality. 
 
  Stable disease (SD) = An increase in marrow plasma cel ls by < 25% from baseline or a 
decrease in marrow plasma cel ls by < 50% from baseline wi th no progressive disease by 
skeletal survey or other imaging modality. 
 
  Progressive Disease (PD) = An increase in marrow plasma  cells of  > 25% from baseline 
after therapy, and/or the occurrence of new hy percalcemia or new lytic lesions by skeletal 
survey or new soft-tissue plasmacytomas. 
 
 
 
13.0 CRITERIA FOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
Treatment with study drugs is to be disc ontinued when any of the following occurs: 
  Progressive disease at any point  in time during the treatment after at least 1 cycle of Ld

14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The protocol has been amended to  change the endpoint to 2-year progression free survival (PFS) 
rather than the 2-year response rate. 
 
After initial therapy with 4 cycles of Ld, patien ts will have stem cells mobilized and collected 
and then will be stratified and randomized as  described in Section 15.2 to either SCT or 
continued Ld.  We propose declar ing treatment in either arm a su ccess if the 2-year PFS is at 
least 65%.  This 2-year PFS ra te was seen in patients recei ving induction lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone followed by transpla nt which is considered the sta ndard of care.  A single stage 
design that differentiates between 2-year PFS ra tes of 65% and 87%  will be used to assess the 
efficacy of the current regimen.  This design ha s type I and type II erro r rates both set to 10%. 
A total of 25 patients will be accru ed in each arm.  If 20 or more  patients are progression free at 
2 years in a treatment arm, then the arm will be c onsidered to have sufficie nt activity to be of 
interest for further study. In order to reach a number of 50 randomized pati ents, we estimate that 
approximately 62 patients will need to be en rolled, taking into account patients who do not 
respond or do not tolerate the induction treat ment, and who are ther efore not randomized. 
 
Results from the two treatment arms  will be compared directly to each other using a “pick-the- 
winner” approach.  If both arms are declared de sirable by demonstrating at least 20 patients 
progression free by 2 years in their 25 patient cohorts, then the choice of which arm will be 
suitable for further study will be based on the abso lute number of responses.  In such a case, if 
the treatment arm with a higher num ber of responses is also associ ated with more toxicity, then 
the investigators will weigh both the absolute nu mber of responses and toxicity in selecting 
which arm is suitable for further study.  If th e difference in the true response rates of the 
treatment arms is 10% then the chance that the regimen with th e higher response rate will be 
picked is over 73%.  If the difference in the true  response rates of the trea tment arms is 15% then 
the chance that the regimen with the higher  response rate will be picked is over 85%. 
 
Progression-free survival from date of randomi zation will be estimate d using the method of 
Kaplan-Meier. Secondary endpoint s include CR+VGPR and overall response rates at 2 and 3 
years.  Estimates of the CR+VGP R and overall response ra tes will be calculated along with 95% 
confidence intervals.

Source Documentation  
Source documentation refers to original reco rds of observations, cl inical findings and 
evaluations that are subsequently  recorded as data. Source docu mentation should be consistent 
with data entered into CRDB. Relevant source documentation to be maintained throughout the 
study includes: 
o Baseline measures to asse ss pre–protocol disease st atus (ex. CT, PSA, bone 
marrow) 
o Treatment records  
o Grade 3-5 toxicities/adverse events not previously submitted with SAE Reports  
o Response designation  
 
16.1 Quality Assurance  
 
Investigator responsibilities :  Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH 
guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in the US Code of Federal Regulations. 
 
The Investigator will permit study-related audits by Celgene or its representatives, 
IRB/EC review, and regulatory  inspection(s) (e.g., FDA, EM EA, TPP), providing direct 
access to the facilities where the study took pl ace, to source documen ts, and to all other 
study documents. 
 
 
The Investigator, or a designated  member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at 
some time during audits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access 
to the subject’s records (e.g., medical record s, office charts, hospital charts, and study 
related charts) for sour ce data verification.  The data co llection must be completed prior 
to each visit and be made available to the Celgene repr esentative so that the accuracy and 
completeness may be checked. 
 
 
Retention of Records :  All documentation pertaining to the conduct of the study and the 
distribution of the study drug, source docume nts (original documents, data, and records 
[e.g., hospital records; clinical  and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s 
diaries or evaluation ch ecklists; SAE reports, pharmacy disp ensing records; recorded data 
from automated instruments; copi es or transcriptions certifie d after verification as being 
accurate copies; microfiches; photographic nega tives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x- 
rays; subject files; and records kept at the pharmacy, at the labora tories, and at medico- 
technical departments involved in the clin ical study; documents regarding subject 
treatment and study drug accountab ility; original signed inform ed consents, etc.]), and all 
IRB correspondence will be retained for at least 2 years after the investigation is 
completed. 
 
16.1.1 Response Review  
 
Since therapeutic efficacy is a stated primary objective, patients’ responses are subject to 
review by MSKCC’s Therapeutic Respons e Review Committee (TRRC). Radiology,

additional lab reports and possibl y bone marrow biopsies and/or aspirates will need to be 
obtained for MSKCC TRRC review and co nfirmation of response assessment. 
 
 
16.2 Data and Safety Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) Plans at  Memorial Sloan-Kett ering Cancer Center 
were approved by the National Cancer Institute in  September 2001.  The plans address the 
new policies set forth by the NCI in the docume nt entitled “Policy of the National Cancer 
Institute for Data and Safety Monitoring of Clinical Trials” which can be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/conducting /dsm-guidelines/page1. The DSM Plans at 
MSKCC were established and ar e monitored by the Office of Clinical Research.  The 
MSKCC Data and Safety Monitoring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intranet at: 
http://smskpsps9/dept/ocr/OCR%20Website%2 0Documents/Clinical% 20Research%20Qualit  
y%20Assurance%20(CRQA)/MSKCC%20Data% 20and%20Safety%20Monitoring%20Plan.p 
df 
 
There are several different mechanisms at MSK CC by which clinical trials are monitored for 
data, safety and quality.  There are institutional processes in pl ace for quality assurance (e.g., 
protocol monitoring, compliance  and data verification audits, therapeutic response, and staff 
education on clinical research QA) and departmental procedures for quality control, plus there 
are two institutional committees that are responsible for monitoring the activities of our clinical trials programs.  The committees: Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) for 
Phase I and II clinical trials, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for Phase III 
clinical trials, report to the Center’s Research Council and Institutional Review Board. 
 
During the protocol development a nd review process, each protoc ol will be assessed for its 
level of risk and degree of m onitoring required.  Every type of  protocol (e.g., NIH sponsored, 
in-house sponsored, industrial sponsored, NCI cooperative group, etc.) will be addressed and 
the monitoring procedures will be establishe d at the time of pr otocol activation.

IRB Number: 08-121 A(24) 
Approval Date: 13-Feb-2018 
57 - 
  
 
 
 Important Medical Events (IME) that may not  result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be consid ered serious when, based upon medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition 
Note: Hospital admission for a planned proce dure/disease treatment is not considered an 
SAE. 
 
 
SAE reporting is required as  soon as the participant signs consent.  SAE reporting is 
required for 30-days after the pa rticipant’s last investigational treatment or intervention. 
Any events that occur after the 30-day peri od and that are at least possibly related to 
protocol treatment must be reported. 
 
If an SAE requires submission to the I RB office per IRB SOP RR-408 ‘Reporting of 
Serious Adverse Events’, the SAE report must be sent to the IRB within 5 calendar days 
of the event. The IRB requires a Clinical  Research Database (CRDB) SAE report be 
submitted electronically to the SAE Office as follows: For IND/IDE trials: Reports that incl ude a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other reports should be sent to  saemskind@mskcc.org . 
 
For all other trials: Reports that incl ude a Grade 5 SAE should be sent to 
saegrade5@mskcc.org .  All other reports should be sent to  sae@mskcc.org . 
 
The report should contain the following information: 
 
Fields populated from CRDB: 
 Subject’s initials 
 Medical record number 
 Disease/histology (if applicable) 
 Protocol number and title 
 
Data needing to be entered : 
 The date the adverse event occurred 
 The adverse event 
 The grade of the event 
 Relationship of the adverse event to the treatment (drug, device, or intervention) 
 If the AE was expected 
 The severity of the AE 
 The intervention 
 Detailed text that includes the following 
o A explanation of how the AE was handled 
o A description of the subject’s condition

 If the SAE is an Unanticipated Problem 
 
The PI’s signature and the date it was si gned are required on the completed report. 
 
 
For IND/IDE protocols: 
The CRDB SAE report should be co mpleted as per above instruct ions.  If appropriate, the 
report will be forwarded to the FDA by the SAE staff through the IND Office. 
 
17.3 Reporting of SAEs to Study Supporter (Celgene Corporation)  
 
Serious adverse events (SAE) ar e defined above. The investigator must inform Celgene in 
writing using a Celgene SAE form or MEDWATCH 3500A form  of any SAE within 24 hours 
of being aware of that event. The written repo rt must be completed a nd supplied to Celgene 
by facsimile within 24 hours/1 business day of  learning of the even t by MSKCC RSA. The 
initial report must be as complete as po ssible, including an assessment of the causal 
relationship between the event and the investigat ional product(s). Information not available at 
the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date fo r the adverse event or laboratory values 
received after the report) must be documented on a follow-up report. The Celgene tracking 
number (RV-MM-PI-0287) and the instituti onal product number should be included on the 
SAE reports (or on the fa x cover letter) sent to  Celgene. A copy of the fax transmission 
confirmation of the SAE report to Celgene should  be attached to the SAE and retained with 
the patient records. 
 
In addition to completing appropriate pa tient demographic and suspect medication 
information, the report should include the following information: 
 
 Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy) 
 Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
 Description of even t, severity, treatment, and outcome if known  
 Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics  
 Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to  each investigational  
product and suspect medication 
The investigator will determine which events are associated with the use of the study drugs. 
For reporting purposes, an AE should be rega rded as possibly related to the use of the 
investigational product if the investigator believes:  
 
 There is a clinically plausible time seque nce between onset of the AE and study drug 
administration; and/or 
 There is a biologically plausible mechanism for the study drug causing  or contributing to 
the AE; and 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
IRB Number: 08-121 A(24) 
Approval Date: 13-Feb-2018 
59 - 
  
 
 
 The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying  illness, other drugs, or 
procedures. 
 
 
 
Follow-up information may be added to a previo usly submitted report by any of the following 
methods: 
 
 Adding to the original report and submitting it as follow-up 
 Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the 
original form 
 Summarizing new information and faxing it  with a cover letter  including subject 
identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, subject num ber), protocol description and number, if 
assigned, suspect drug, brief adverse event description, and notation that additional or 
follow-up information is being submitted  (The  patient identifiers are important so that 
the new information is added to the correct initial report) 
 
17.4 Safety Reports  
 
Reporting SAE to the FDA  
Serious adverse events (SAEs) that are unlisted/ unexpected, and at least possibly associated to 
the drug, and that have not previously been repo rted in the Investigators brochure, or reference 
safety information document should be re ported promptly to the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) by telephone or by fax.  Fatal or life threatening SAEs that meet the criteria for reporting to the FDA must be report ed to the FDA within 7 calendar days after 
awareness of the event.  All other SAEs that meet the criteria for repor ting to the FDA must 
be reported to the FDA within 15 calendar days  after awareness of the event.  A clear 
description of the suspected re action should be provided along with an assessment as to 
whether the event is drug or disease related. 
 
Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Toxicity will be scored using CTCAE Version 3.0 for toxicity a nd adverse event reporting.  A 
copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be  downloaded from th e CTEP homepage 
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov).  All appropriate treatme nt areas should have access to a copy of the 
CTCAE Version 3.0.  All adverse clinical experi ences, whether observed by the investigator 
or reported by the patient, must  be recorded, with details abou t the duration and intensity of 
each episode, the action taken with respect to th e test drug, and the patient’s outcome.  The 
investigator must evaluate each  adverse experience for its relati onship to the test drug and for 
its seriousness. 
 
The investigator must appraise a ll abnormal laboratory results for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal laboratory result is considered cl inically significant, the investigator must 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test  drug and about the patient’s 
outcome. 
 
Pregnancies

Pregnancies and suspected pregna ncies (including a positive preg nancy test regardless of age 
or disease state) of a female subject occurring while the subjec t is on lenalidomi de, or within 
28 days of the subject’s last dose of lenali domide, are considered immediately reportable 
events. Lenalidomide is to be discontinued immed iately. The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, 
or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile or email using the Prenancy Initial Report Form. The female subject should  be referred to an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, preferable one expe rienced in reproductive toxicity for further 
evaluation and counseling. 
 
The Investigator will follow the female subject  until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Drug Safety immediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal 
or abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Foll ow-up Report Form. If the outcome of the 
pregnancy was abnormal (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion), the Investigator should 
report the abnormal outcome as an AE. If th e abnormal outcome meets any of the serious 
criteria, it must be reported as  an SAE to Celgene Drug Safety immediately by facsimile, or 
other appropriate method, within  24 hours of the Investigator’s  knowledge of the event using 
the SAE Report Form. 
 
All neonatal deaths that occur within 28 days of  birth should be reporte d, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 28 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celg ene Drug Safety 
immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate  method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event us ing the SAE Report Form. 
 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Drug Safety should be advised as soon as the 
information is available. 
 
Male Subjects  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking  investigational product  becomes pregnant, the 
male subject taking lenalidomide should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female 
partner should be advised to call their health care provider immediately.

APPENDIX B : Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth 
Control Methods 
 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
 
The use of lenalidomide in pregna nt females and nursing mothers ha s not been studied nor has the 
effect of the lenalidomide on human eggs and sper m. Lenalidomide is structurally related to 
thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human terato genic active substance that causes severe life- 
threatening birth defects.  An embryofetal development study in animals indicates that 
lenalidomide produced malformations in the offs pring of female monkeys who received the drug 
during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of  lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out. 
Therefore, a risk minimization plan to  prevent pregnancy must be observed. 
 
All study participants must be registered into  the mandatory Revlimid REMS® program, and be 
willing and able to comply with th e requirements of Revlimid REMS®. 
 
Criteria for females of chil dbearing potential (FCBP) 
 
This protocol defines a female of  childbearing potential as a sexual ly mature female who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months  (i.e., has had menses at any time in the 
preceding 24 consecutive months). 
 
The investigator mu st ensure that: 
 
 Females  of  childbearing  potential  comply  with  the  conditions  for  pregnancy  risk 
minimization, including confirmation that sh e has an adequate le vel of understanding 
 
 Females NOT of childbearing potential acknow ledge that she understa nds the hazards and 
necessary precautions associated  with the use of lenalidomide 
 
 A male patient taking lenalidomide acknowledg es that he understands  that traces of 
lenalidomide have been found in semen, that he  understands the potent ial teratogenic risk 
if engaged in sexual activity with a fema le of childbearing pot ential, and that he 
understands the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if engaged 
in sexual activity with a fema le of childbearing potential. 
 
Contraception 
 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) enrolled in  this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultane ously or to practice complete  abstinence from heterosexual 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
IRB Number: 08-121 A(24) 
Approval Date: 13-Feb-2018 
72 - 
  
 
 
intercourse during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before 
starting lenalidomide; 2) throughout the entire duration of lenalidomide treatment; 3) during dose 
interruptions; and 4) for at least 28 da ys after lenalidomide discontinuation. 
 
The two methods of reliable contraception must  include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must  be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following ar e examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception: 
 
o Highly effective methods: 
▪ Intrauterine device (IUD) 
▪ Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants)  
▪ Tubal ligation  
▪ Partner’s vasectomy  
 
o Additional effective methods: 
▪ Male condom 
▪ Diaphragm  
▪ Cervical Cap  
 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in pa tients with multiple myeloma 
taking lenalidomide and dexameth asone, combined oral contracepti ve pills are not recommended. 
If a patient is currently using co mbined oral contraception the pati ent should switch to one of the 
effective method listed above. The risk of  venous thromboembolism continues for 4 −6 weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral cont raception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced 
during co-treatment with dexamethasone. 
 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine sy stems are associated with  an increased risk of 
infection at the time of inserti on and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be 
considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
 
Pregnancy testing 
 
Medically  supervised  pregnancy  tests  with  a  minimum  sensitivity  of  25 mIU/mL  must  be 
performed for females of childb earing potential, including female s of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  Patients and physicians must follow pregnancy 
testing requirements as outlined in the Revlimid REMS® program material.

Before starting lenalidomide  
 
Female Patients:  
 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide.  The first pregnancy test  must be performed within 10-14 days prior to 
prescribing lenalidomide and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior 
to prescribing lenalidomide.  The patient may not  receive lenalidomide until the Investigator has 
verified that the results of th ese pregnancy tests are negative. 
 
Male Patients : 
 
Must agree to practice complete abstinence or agree to use a c ondom during sexual contact with 
pregnant females or fe males of childbearing potential throughout th e entire duration of 
lenalidomide treatment, during dose interruptions a nd for at least 28 days following lenalidomide 
discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
 
During study participation and for 28 days  following lenalidomide discontinuation  
 
Female Patients:  
 
 FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles mu st agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for 
the first 28 days of lenalidomide treatment, in cluding dose interruptions  and then every 28 
days throughout the remaining duration of  lenalidomide treatment, including dose 
interruptions, at lenalidomid e discontinuation, and at Da y 28 following lenalidomide 
discontinuation. If menstrual cycles are irregula r, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly 
for the first 28 days of lenalidomide treatment , including dose interruptions, and then every 
14 days throughout the remaining duration of lenalidomide treat ment, including dose 
interruptions, at lenalidomide disconti nuation, and at Day 14 and Day 28 following 
lenalidomide discontinuation. 
 
 At each visit, the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to use 
two reliable methods of birth control at each visit during the time that birth control is 
required. 
 
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test doe s occur in a study pati ent, lenalidomide must 
be immediately discontinued. 
 
 Pregnancy testing and counseling must be perf ormed if a patient misse s her period or if her 
pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Lenalidomide treatment must be 
temporarily discontinued during this evaluation. 
 
 Females must agree to abstai n from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 
28 days after lenalidom ide discontinuation.

Male Patients:  
 
 Must practice complete abstinence or use a condom during sexual c ontact with pregnant 
females or females of childbea ring potential throughout the en tire duration of lenalidomide 
treatment, during dose interruptions and fo r at least 28 days following lenalidomide 
discontinuation, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy. 
 
 If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does  occur in the partner of a male study patient 
during study participation, the investigator must be  notified immediately. 
 
Additional precautions 
 
 Patients should be instructed never to give lenalidomide to another person. 
 
 Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days following 
discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
 
 Male patients should not dona te blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 
days following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
 
 Only enough lenalidomide for one cycle of th erapy may be prescribed with each cycle of 
therapy.

APPENDIX E: NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION CLASSIFICATION OF 
CARDIAC DISEASE  
The following table presents the NYHA classification of cardiac disease:  
 
 
Class  Functional Capacity  Objective Assessment  
I Patients with cardiac disease but without resulting limitations of 
physical activity.  Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. No objective evidence 
of cardiovascular disease. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical 
activity.  They are comfortable at rest.  Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
minimal cardiovascular disease. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of 
physical activity. They are comfortable at rest.  Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea, or anginal pain. Objective evidence of 
moderately severe cardiovascular disease. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any 
physical activity without discomfort.  Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.  If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort is increased. Objective evidence of 
severe cardiovascular disease. 
 
  
 
  
 
 
APPENDIX F:   Ideal Body Weight Formulas  
 
Males IBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
Females IBW = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg/inch over 5 feet 
 
For patients less than 5 feet, subtract 2.3 kg/inch 
 
Adjusted Ideal Body Weight Formula: 
AIBW = IBW + [(0.40) x (Actual BW - IBW)]

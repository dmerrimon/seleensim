Title  A Multiple Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Microbiome 
Dynamics of SER -287 in Subject s with Mild- to-Moderate Ulcerative Colitis  
Sponsor Study No.  SERES -101 
Phase  1b 
Sponsor  Seres Therapeutics, Inc.  
Study Centers  Approximately 20 Study Centers in the United States ( US) 
Objective s Primary Objectives:  
•!To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER -287 vs. placebo in adult  subjects  
≥18 years of age with mild -to-moderate ulcerative colitis  
•!To compare the baseline composition of the intestinal microbiome to the post-
baseline composition a fter initiation of SER -287 or placebo  
•!To determine the engraftment of SER -287 bacteria into the intestinal microbial 
community  in each of the SER -287 arms compared to the  placebo arm 
Secondary  Objectives:  
•!To determine the proportion of subjects in each of the treatment  arms who, at 8 
weeks post initiation of treatment , achieve a clinical response, complete 
remission , and endoscopic improvement  
•!To assess changes in serum and fecal biomarkers from baseline throughout 
treatment  
Exploratory Objectives:  
•!To compare the changes in exploratory biomarkers from mucosal biopsies and 
stool samples in each of the treatment arms from baseline  throughout treatment.  
•!To determine the complement of metabolic pathways from stool in each of the 
treatment arms from baseline  throughout treatment.   
 
Design  This is a Phase 1b multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 
multiple dose study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER -287, and 
to evaluate the microbiome alterations and pharmacodynamics associated with 2 
dosing regimens of SER -287 in adult subjects with mild -to-moderate ulcerative 
colitis (UC).   Subjects will be randomized to one of 4 study arms:  
Arm A: Placebo pre-treatment, followed by once weekly dosing of SER -287 for 8 weeks  
Arm B: Placebo pre-treatment, followed by once daily  placebo for 8 weeks  
Arm C: Vancomycin1 pre-treatment, followed by once daily  dosing of SER- 287 for 8 weeks  
Arm D: Vancomycin pre-treatment,  followed by once weekly  dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks  
 
This study has 5 study periods:  Screening  (Day -17 to Day -1), Pre-treatment (Day  
1 to Day 7), 8 -Week Treatment  (Day 8 -63), 4 Week Short Term Safety Follow -up 
(Day 64 -92) and a Long Term Safety Follow -up (Day 93-246).   
 
Approximately 55 adult subjects with mild -to-moderate ulcerative colitis will be 
enrolled.   
Screening  includes 2 screening visits.  At the first Screening  visit, Visit 1, subjects 
will be checked for inclusion /exclusion criteria, and medical history and 
demographic data will be collected .  At the second Screening  visit,  Visit 2, eligible  
subjects will undergo a lower endoscopy  (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) 
and biopsy within 17 days from  the first Screening visit and prior to Study Day 1.  
For Baseline Mayo subscore measurement, the one closest to the randomization, 
Visit 2 should be used.  
Subjects will be on a clear liquid diet 1 day before the flexible lower endoscopy  
(flexible sigmoidoscopy or co lonoscopy).  On the day of the procedure, the subject 
                                                
1 Full name of Vancomycin is Over -encapsulated (OE) Vancomycin HCl 125 mg capsules

Amendment 3                                                                  5 of 75                                                  10 Oct  2016  will self-administer a bowel prep at the PI discretion (e.g.,  2 Fleets enemas ) and fast 
for 6 hours before the procedure .   
Endoscopy images will be obtained during each endoscopy and will be sent for 
independent central reading and determination of the modified Mayo endoscopic  
subscore.  A detailed image review  charter from the central reading laboratory will 
outline the endoscopic procedures, video  recordings, and equipment to be used for 
video capture and transmission of endoscopic  recordings.  For each subject, video 
recording of the entire endoscopic procedure will be  performed using a storage 
medium provided by the sponsor or designee.  The endoscopic  recordings will be 
read centrally in a blinded m anner by a qualified gastroenterologist according  to the 
image review charter.  The Total modified Mayo score used for clinical endpoints in 
the trial will use the  modified Mayo endoscop ic subscore determined by the central 
reader.  
The total modified Mayo score is a composite score, including the modified Mayo 
endoscopic subscore, the patient report outcome (stool frequency and rectal 
bleeding) as well as physician’s rating.  The modified Mayo endoscopic subscore is 
determined by the central reader and provided to the clinical site.  Subjects who 
meet the inclusion criteria ( Total modified Mayo score of 4 to 10, inclusive , and 
modified Mayo endoscopic subscore of > 1, with evidence of mucosal lesions), will 
be randomized using an interactive web /voice respon se system ( IxRS ) to 1 of 4 
treatment groups on Study Day 1 and initiate the pre -treatment regimen.  
 
During the Pre-Treatment  period  (Day 1 to Day 7) oral vancomycin 125 mg four 
times a day  (qid) or matching placebo  will be administered for 6 days.   
Following completion of the Pre -Treatment  period , subjects will return to the clinic 
to begin the 8 -Week Treatment Period (Day 8 -63).  On Day 8 , subjects will receive 
SER-287 or placebo according to the Treatment Group to which they have been 
assigned:  SE R-287 once daily, SER -287 once weekly with matching placebo on the 
other days, or placebo daily.  
 
During the 8 -Week Treatment Period,  all subjects will come to the clinic weekly 
for drug dispensing and asked about adverse events (AEs) , change in medications 
and the partial Mayo score  assessment  (scores should reflect the 24 -hour period 
prior to reporting).  All subject s will have a lower endoscopy (flexible 
sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) at Visit 12 /Early Termination +/- 3 days to evaluate 
endoscop ic disease activity.  Subjects will be on a clear liquid diet the day before the 
lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) . On the day of the 
procedure, the subject will self- administer a bowel prep at the PI discretion (e.g., 2 
Fleets enemas ) and fast for 6 hours before the procedure.   
All subjects will have an in -clinic visit at  Visit 12/Early Termination +/ - 3 days.  
 
Subjects will then enter the Short -Term  Safety Follow -up Period  in which 
subjects will be contacted by phone on Days 71, 78,  85 +/ - 2 days .  Subjects will be 
asked about adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications and will complete 
disease activity assessment which includes stool frequency and rectal bleeding .  All 
subjects will have an in -clinic safety visit at Visit 13  +/- 2 days .  
 
Subjects will then enter the Long -Term  Safety Follow -up Period  in which subjects 
will be contacted by phone on Days 246 +/ - 3 days . Following Visit 13 through Day  
246/ET only SAEs, and concomitant medications associated with SAEs will be 
collected.

Methods  All safety and tolerability, intestinal microbiome , clinical efficacy , and biomarker 
data will be listed and presented in descriptive summaries by study arm, visit and 
time point. At a minimum, continuous data will be summarized by study arm using 
descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation [SD], minimum, median and maximum).  Categorical data will be summarized by study arm using frequency 
tables (number and percentage).  
 
Analysis P opulations 
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who receive any amount of study 
drug.  Subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they actually received, rather than the treatment to which they were randomly assigned.  All safety an alyses 
will be conducted based on the Safety Population.  
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all subject s who were randomly 
assigned, including those who were not exposed to any study drug, and will be 
analyzed  based on the treatment to which they were randomized .   
 
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population will consist of all randomized 
patients with baseline and at least one post- baseline stool sample, including those 
who were not exposed to any study drug, and will be analy sed based on the 
treatment to which they were randomized .   
 All analyses on clinical response will be conducted in the ITT population and in the 
mITT population as sensitivity analyses.  
 
All microbiome alterations analyses will be con ducted in the mITT Population.  
 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
Adverse Events  
The percentage of subjects with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT) for each treatment group. The incidence of TEAEs 
based on the number of days the subjects in each treatment group were on study 
drug (per subject on therapy day) will also be presented by system organ class and 
preferred term for each treatment group, by severity, and by relationship to 
treatment. Tables of any TEAEs leading t o study drug discontinuation , AESIs  and 
SAEs will also be provided.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests  
All scheduled and unscheduled laboratory results will be presented for each subject , 
sorted by category, subject , test and sample time.  Flags will be attached to values 
outside of the laboratory’s reference limits along with the Investigator’s assessment.  
A separate listing of abnormal results will be presented, ordered by test, subject  and 
sample time.     
 
Quant itative chemistry and hematology tests (observed values and change from 
baseline) will be summarized descriptively in tabular format . A shift table will be 
presented for chemistry, hematology and urinalysis tests shift from baseline to each 
post-baseline v isit and also the shift from baseline to highest and to lowest post -
baseline assessment.  
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs data include measurements of weight (kg), height (cm), blood pressure 
(mmHg), respiratory rate (breaths/minute), heart rate (bpm), body temper ature 
(Celsius / Fahrenheit), and Body Mass Index (kg/m2). Descriptive statistics of the

were collected. The change from baseline to each post -baseline visit and to the 
overall worst post -baseline value will also be summarized by treatment group.  
 Physical Examination Findings   
Abnormal clinically significant physical examination (PE) finding will be reported 
as Medical History (MH) or as an AE.  
 
Gastrointestinal tract Micr obiome 
The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of subjects will be characterized by using at 
minimum recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) 16S V4 genomic data sets 
generated from stool collected for the various endpoints , and may include whole 
metagenome sequence (WMS)  characterization . Genomic data sets will define the 
microbial composition of the microbiome of a subject at a given time point. 
Genomic sequence read data sets will be analyzed to assign a taxonomic identity at the resolution of an operation al taxonomic unit (OTU) and phylogenetic clade 
(clade) and, further, to define the relative proportion of each OTU and clade to all other OTUs and clades in a given sample.  
Changes in the composition of the microbiome will be measured in terms of both  the 
total number of unique types of bacteria (i .e., α-diversity ) and  the microbial 
composition (i .e., β-diversity ). Engraftment is defined as the outgrowth of bacteria 
that comprise the SER -287 spore ecology in a subject ’s gastrointestinal tract post -
treatmen t. Significant differences between changes in the microbiome across the 
various treatment arms will be evaluated using both non -parametric tests for α-
diversity and multivariate analysis of variances of dissimilarity matrices for β-
diversity. Dissimilarity  will be defined by using the unweighted Unifrac 
dissimilarity metric, which evaluates changes in the overall phylogenetic composition between two samples; this method is widely used in the study of microbial communities and represents a balanced approach with minimal bias to the 
presence of low - and high -abundance bacteria. Additional measures of dissimilarity 
that are routinely used in the analysis of microbiome data sets  will be evaluated.  
 
Determination of Sample Size  
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  A sample size of approximately 
55 subject s with 15 subject s randomized to each of the active arms (Treatment 
Groups A, C and D) and 10 subject s in the placebo arm (Treatment Group B) is 
considered sufficien t to evaluate the safety, microbiome alterations, clinical response 
and exploratory objectives of the study.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing-remitting chronic inflammatory disorder affecting 
the mucosal surface of the colon, leading to episodes of bloody diarrhea, urgency and 
mucosal inflammation.(Danese and Fiocchi, 2011)  As the disease mostly affects young 
and middle-aged individuals, the disease leads to decreased quality of life in those 
affected by the condition, high morbidity and significant economic burden accounting for 
nearly four billion health care dollars annually.(Ghosh and Mitchell, 2007; Kappelman et 
al., 2008; Rubin et al., 2014; Theede et al., 2015)  Current medical therapies remain 
imperfect for the treatment of UC with the focus of drug development on suppressing the 
immune system rather than reducing the triggers of immune activation.  As 
immunosuppressive agents increase the risk of infectious and oncologic complications, 
alternative mechanisms of action to decrease immune activation, remain attractive 
therapeutic goals for UC.  
The prevailing model of disease pathogenesis for UC is that in the genetically 
predisposed host, environmental factors are sufficient to generate an abnormally 
perpetuated immune response and inflammation.(Xavier and Podolsky, 2007)  
Alterations in the intestinal microbiota parallel changes in environmental factors with 
evidence suggesting a role of the intestinal microbiota in immune modulation. 
(Biedermann et al., 2013, 2014; Leone et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013) Studies suggest that 
the intestinal microbiome of UC patients is characterized by a decrease in microbial 
diversity and richness, with a lower prevalence of organisms within the phylum, 
Firmicutes. (Frank et al., 2007; Lepage et al., 2011; Machiels et al., 2014; Michail et al., 
2012; Morgan et al., 2012; Ott et al., 2004; Papa et al., 2012; Rajilić -Stojanović et al., 
2013; Sartor, 2008; Varela et al., 2013; Walujkar et al., 2014; Willing et al., 2010)   
Given the dysbiosis seen in UC patients, studies have explored the use of fecal microbial 
transplantation (FMT) to treat UC.  Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
studies suggest a clinical response in mild-to-moderate UC patients by repopulating the 
intestinal microbial flora via FMT with that of a healthy donor (Moayyedi et al., 2015; 
Rossen et al., 2015). There was increased microbial diversity and greater similarity to 
donor microbiota profile noted in subjects with a clinical response to FMT in both 
studies suggesting that changes in the microbiome due to FMT were responsible for this 
clinical response.  This study will explore microbial therapeutic interventions and the 
impact on the disease course in UC.  The study hypothesis is that SER-287, enriched in 
spore-forming organisms that are diminished in active UC, can induce remission in mild-
to-moderate ulcerative colitis.   
SER-287 (Eubacterial Spores, Purified Suspension, Encapsulated) is an ecology of 
bacterial spores enriched from fecal donations obtained from healthy, screened donors. 
Bacterial spores are enriched by thorough killing of the vegetative microorganisms with 
ethanol, and then purifying and formulating the resulting spore population.  SER-287 is 
delivered as oral capsules for administration to patients.    
SER-287 for this Phase 1b clinical study was manufactured as SER-109 and then became 
SER-287 at the time of clinical labeling. SER-109 was administered in a Phase 1b/2

as early as 4 days after dosing in adults with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection 
(CDI). Currently there are no differences in the drug products, SER-109 and SER-287.  
Seres anticipates that, pending results from this Phase 1b clinical study, there may be 
future changes in SER-287, with respect to dose, formulation and/or regimen during 
development. !
The patient population targeted for inclusion in this study is adults !18 years of age who 
have mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis, as defined by a Total Modified Mayo score 
between 4 and 10, inclusive, with a Modified Mayo endoscopic subscore > 1.   
The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of SER-287 in patients with active mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.  In addition, the study will 
evaluate the microbiome dynamics throughout treatment and assess preliminary efficacy 
data.  
1.1! Background 
1.1.1! Brief Description of the Indication and Existing Practices  
The annual incidence rate of UC in Western countries is roughly 9.8/100,000 person-
years with increasing incidence observed in developing countries.(Grinspan and 
Kornbluth, 2015) Approximately 50% of patients experience proctosigmoiditis, 30% 
have left-sided disease, and 20% have pancolitis. (Kothari et al., 2015) Overall, 
approximately 50% develop more extensive disease over the first 5 years of disease. There is currently no cure for UC.  Therefore, the therapeutic goal is to alleviate and 
control symptoms (induction of remission) and to promote mucosal healing but also to 
prevent disease recurrence (maintenance of remission). 
Current medical therapies for UC include sulfasalazine, aminosalicylates (5-ASAs), 
steroids, immunomodulators (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine), anti-TNF agents 
(infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab), anti-integrin agents (vedolizumab), and 
calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus).(Grinspan and Kornbluth, 2015)  As 
the majority of these medications are immunosuppressant agents targeted for moderate-
to-severe disease, there remains an unmet need for safer agents with novel mechanisms 
of action, especially for patients with mild-to-moderate UC who experience frequent 
flares on aminosalicylates or as an alternative to aminosalicylate therapy in those 
intolerant to this class of medication.  As alterations in the intestinal microbiome have 
been identified in UC and preliminary evidence suggests that microbial interventions can 
affect clinical outcomes, the study will assess whether an ecology of bacterial spores 
devoid of vegetative organisms in SER-287 can correct the dysbiosis in UC, increase 
microbial diversity and lead to clinical response in UC patients with active mild-to-
moderate disease.

Investigational Product is Applicable for this Disease 
The intestinal microbiome is comprised of four principle bacterial phyla: Bacteroidetes, 
Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria.  In healthy subjects, the intestin al 
microbiome is mainly composed of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes.(Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012)  Studies have shown that subjects with inflammatory bowel 
disease, including UC, have a decrease in bacterial diversity and alterations in the 
intestinal microbiota compared to healthy subjects.(Baumgart et al., 2007; Frank et al., 
2007; Gevers et al., 2014; Lepage et al., 2011; Machiels et al., 2014; Michail et al., 2012; 
Morgan et al., 2012; Ott et al., 2004; Papa et al., 2012; Rajilić -Stojanović et al., 2013; 
Sartor, 2008; Sokol et al., 2008; Varela et al., 2013; Walujkar et al., 2014; Willing et al., 2010)   
The dysbiosis described in UC is characterized by lower microbial diversity and species 
richness, a greater prevalence of organisms within the phylum, Proteobacteria, and a 
lower prevalence of commensal bacteria within the phylum, Firmicutes.  (Frank et al., 
2007; Lepage et al., 2011; Machiels et al., 2014; Michail et al., 2012; Ott et al., 2004; 
Rajilić-Stojanović et al., 2013; Varela et al., 2013; Walujkar et al., 2014) In particular, 
Firmicutes within the Clostridiales order are poorly represented in active UC subjects 
than in age and sex-matched healthy controls with an inverse correlation between disease 
activity and presence of these organisms.(Michail et al., 2012)  This study will test the 
hypothesis that administering bacterial spores comprised of predominantly Clostridial 
commensals within SER-287 to UC patients can help correct the dysbiosis and improve 
clinical outcomes.      
1.1.3! Pharmacological Concept for the Treatment 
Given the dysbiosis seen in UC patients, studies have explored the use of fecal microbial 
transplantation to treat UC. (Angelberger et al., 2013; Colman and Rubin, 2014; Kump et 
al., 2013; Kunde et al., 2013; Moayyedi et al., 2015; Rossen et al., 2015)  Fecal microbial 
transplantation (FMT) is the transfer of stool from a healthy donor to a recipient.  FMT 
has already demonstrated efficacy in preventing recurrent Clostridium difficile infection 
(CDI) with response corresponding to shifts of the recipient’s flora towards that of the donor’s and increasing microbial diversity in the recipient’s microbiome. (van Nood et 
al., 2013; Youngster et al., 2014a, 2014b)  
Most recently, two randomized controlled trials have evaluated the role of FMT in UC.  
One study administered FMT via enema weekly over 6 weeks (treatment group) versus 
water enemas (control group) to 75 patients with mild-to-moderate UC with the primary 
endpoint of clinical remission achieved in 24% of patients in the treatment group and 5% 
in the control group (p=0.03).(Moayyedi et al., 2015) Clinical remission was defined as a 
Mayo score < 3 with an endoscopic subscore of 0 at week 7.  In a second study, donor 
FMT (treatment group) or autologous FMT (control group) was administered twice (3 
weeks apart) via nasoduodenal tube to 50 UC patients with mild-to-moderate ulcerative 
colitis. (Rossen et al., 2015) After 12 weeks, while there was no significant difference in 
clinical remission between groups, there was a trend towards response in the treatment 
group (30.4% versus 20% control group, p=0.51) and there was increased microbial

developing a similar microbiota profile to the donor.  Given these findings of treatment 
response to FMT in UC patients, this study will explore further if supplementing the 
microbiome of UC patients with select spore-forming organisms in SER-287, that are 
underrepresented in subjects with active ulcerative colitis, could alter the microbiome of 
the recipient and lead to improved clinical outcomes. 
1.1.4! Name and Description of Investigational Product 
SER-287 (Purified Eubacterial Spores, Encapsulated) is an ecology of bacterial spores 
enriched from fecal donations obtained from healthy, screened donors, representing 
approximately 50 commensal bacteria in spore form. The bacterial spores are enriched by 
thorough killing of the vegetative microorganisms, then fractionating the resulting spore 
population away from the inactive components and formulating and encapsulating the 
spores for oral delivery.  SER -287 for the proposed Phase 1b clinical study will be 
manufactured as SER-109. Currently, there are no differences between SER-109 and 
SER-287. Seres anticipates that, pending results from the Phase 1b clinical study, there 
may be future changes in SER-287, with respect to dose, formulation and/or regimen 
during development. 
1.1.5! Summary of Findings from Non-Clinical Studies with Potential Clinical 
Significance  
Recent evidence has identified dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiome as a contributing 
factor to the pathology in UC. Preclinical evidence in mice supports that, more 
specifically, the spore-forming fraction of both murine and human fecal microbiota is 
sufficient to drive protection against experimental colitis, in part via the induction of 
regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the colon (Atarashi et al., 2011, 2013).  
In light of these data, efficacy of a research preparation of SER-287, comprised 
predominantly of Clostridial spore-forming organisms, was evaluated in pilot studies 
using mouse models of colitis [2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) and dextran 
sodium sulfate (DSS)]. In these experimental models of colitis, antibiotic pre-treatment 
with SER-287 (Abx + SER-287) improved clinical outcomes in the DSS model (Further 
details can be found in the Investigator's Brochure). These data support the hypothesis 
that SER-287, in combination with antibiotic pre-treatment, may improve symptoms of 
ulcerative colitis in man. 
1.1.6! Summary of Findings from Previous Clinical Studies  
SERES-101 will be the first study investigating the use of SER-287 in ulcerative colitis.  
At this time, there are no differences between SER-109 and SER-287 but SERES 
anticipates future changes in the dose, frequency and formulation of SER-287 in UC.  
Data from a SER-109 clinical study (SERES-001) in prevention of recurrent Clostridium 
difficile infection (CDI) provides data on SER -109 safety and post-treatment microbiome 
dynamics. SERES-001 has been completed and two additional clinical studies are 
ongoing:

Further details can be found in the Investigator's Brochure. 
SERES-001 was an open-label, single arm, descending-dose study that evaluated the 
safety and efficacy of SER-109 in prevention of recurrent CDI in adult patients with a 
history of recurrent CDI episodes, a condition in which the microbiome is characterized 
as a low diversity state. Thirty patients were enrolled following a therapeutic response to 
standard of care CDI antibiotics. The primary endpoint of absence of diarrhea with a 
positive C. difficile test up to 8 weeks following dosing was achieved in 26 (87%) 
patients.  Furthermore, evaluation of the microbiome pre- and post-treatment showed 
SER-109 increased bacterial divers ity of the intestinal microbiota as early as 4 days after 
dosing. SER-109 in SERES-001 was safe and tolerable with no deaths . Seven SAEs were 
reported in 4 subjects, none considered related to SER -109.   
Similar to CDI, UC is characterized by a decrease in microbial diversity and richness, with a lower prevalence of spore-forming organisms within the phylum, Firmicutes. The 
results from the SERES-001 study in recurrent CDI support exploration of the efficacy of 
SER-287 in increasing bacterial diversity of the intestinal microbiota in UC patients.  The 
study population in SERES-001 was older (mean age of 62 years) with frequent co-morbid illnesses than what is anticipated for the UC population .  Therefore, we anticipate 
a high safety profile in the UC population.  However, as the population will be different for this Phase 1b study (SERES-101) than for SERES-001, SERES-101 will evaluate the 
safety, tolerability and microbiome dynamics  of SER-287 in UC patients.  
SERES-101 is a Phase 1b multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple dose study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER -287 and to 
evaluate the microbiome alterations and pharmacodynamics associated with two dosing regimens of SER-287 in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate UC. Subjects will be 
randomized to one of 4 study arms:  A) Pre-treatment of placebo, followed by weekly 
dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks, B) Pre-treatment of placebo, followed by daily dosing of 
placebo for 8 weeks. C) Pre-treatment of vancomycin, followed by daily dos ing of SER-
287 for 8 weeks, D) Pre-treatment of vancomycin, followed by weekly do sing of SER-
287 for 8 weeks. From screening to last follow-up, the study duration will be between 
35-37 weeks.

Amendment 3                                                                  22 of 75                                                  10 Oct  2016  1.2! Rationale 
SER-287 (Purified Eubacterial Spores, Encapsulated) is an ecology of bacterial spores 
enriched from fecal donations obtained from healthy, screened donors, representing 
approximately 50 commensal bacteria in spore form.  As UC is characterized by a 
decrease in microbial diversity and richness, with a lower prevalence of spore-forming 
organisms within the phylum, Firmicutes, and preliminary evidence suggests that 
microbial interventions can affect clinical outcomes in UC, the study will examine 
whether SER-287 can correct the dysbiosis in UC, increase microbial diversity and lead 
to clinical response in UC patients with mild-to-moderate disease.   
1.2.1! Rationale for Regimen  
The inflammatory milieu in UC impacts the microbial composition with animal and 
human studies showing a greater representation of Enterobacteriaceae wit h a relative 
depletion of Clostridial organisms. This dysbiosis is seen in patients with recurrent CDI and can be reversed after FMT. While the dysbiosis in Clostridium difficile is mainly 
induced by infection, toxin production and repeated antibiotic usage, the dysbiosis in UC is more complex with host factors and alterations in microbial-host interactions likely 
contributing to the witnessed microbial changes.  
This study will evaluate whether repeated dosing can alter the microbial community in 
UC, encourage engraftment and, ultimately, decrease mucosal inflammation.  This study 
will test the weekly dosing strategy that was evaluated in the study by Moayyedi et al. 
and will also evaluate a daily dosing strategy.(Moayyedi et al., 2015) Given that the aim 
of the study is to induce remission in patients with active mild-to-moderate 
inflammation, this study will evaluate a higher frequency of dosing from weekly to daily 
dosing of SER-287 to provide consistent and maximal exposure to SER-287 treatment 
during a period of active inflammation.  
1.2.2! Rationale for dose  
The dose selected in this study is supported by the safety and effectiveness of this dose, [1 x 10
8 Spore Equivalents (SporQs)], administered in the SER-109 Phase 1b/2 study for 
recurrent CDI. The trial explored a range of doses from 3.4"107 to 2.3"1010 SporQs.  The 
doses evaluated were safe with no deaths in the study and no concerning trends in 
laboratory values, vital signs or physical examination findings. The SAEs reported were deemed by the investigators to not be related to SER-109.  
The dose selected gives a 230-fold margin to the highest dose tested in SERES-001 and a 
3-fold margin to the lowest dose shown to be effective in SERES-001. Although the 
study population for SERES-001 is not the same study population targeted for the current 
study, the study population in SERES-001 is older (mean age of 62 years) with frequent 
co-morbid illnesses than the general UC population.  
1.2.3! Rationale for Antibiotic Pre-Treatment 
Disease states, such as CDI and UC, are characterized by intestinal dysbiosis and a 
decrease in microbial diversity. Antibiotic treatment prior to administration of a 
repopulating ecology of spores (SER -287) may allow for engraftment of the spores 
administered.  Data described in the DSS animal colitis models with SER-287

Amendment 3                                                                  23 of 75                                                  10 Oct  2016  demonstrate a trend toward improvement by the addition of antibiotics prior to SER-287 
administration (see Investigator’s Brochure).  
Data from the SERES-001 study in prevention of recurrent CDI showed engraftment of 
bacteria from SER-109 as early as 4 days following SER-109 dosing. All the subjects in 
this study were pre-treated with antibiotics prior to SER-109 dosing, supporting, 
although not proving, that antibiotic pre-treatment may enhance engraftment. This study 
will assess whether vancomycin improves engraftment and clinical outcomes through a 
comparison of outcomes in arms with and without vancomycin pre-treatment. 
1.2.4! Rationale for Endpoints  
Efficacy endpoints will be measured incorporating an accepted clinical and endoscopic 
disease activity index in UC, the Total modified Mayo score, with an 8-week treatment 
period to evaluate induction of remission for UC in keeping with FDA regulatory 
guidance. The study will also evaluate endoscopic disease activity before and after 
treatment via central reading.  Clinical disease activity throughout the study will be 
monitored via the partial Mayo score, which is the Mayo Score without the endoscopic 
subscore.   Definitions of disease activity are defined by prior studies for the mild-to-
moderate UC population.(Lichtenstein et al., 2015; Moayyedi et al., 2015; Sandborn et 
al., 2015)  
This study is designed to also evaluate microbiome changes in this Phase 1b study. 
Engraftment is defined as the outgrowth of bacteria that comprise the SER-287 ecology 
in a patient’s gastrointestinal tract post-treatment.  This study will evaluate the engraftment of SER-287 bacterial isolates in each treatment arm and determine the 
overall change in composition of the microbiome both by total number of unique types of 
bacteria (ie, α-diversity) and by microbial composition (ie, β-diversity).  The dysbiosis 
described in IBD is characterized by lower microbial diversity and species richness, a 
greater prevalence of pro-inflammatory pathobionts, mainly described within the 
phylum, Proteobacteria, and a lower prevalence of commensal bacteria within the 
phylum, Firmicutes, of which the Clostridial organisms within SER-287 belong.

3.1! Overview 
This is a Phase 1b multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple 
dose study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of SER -287 and to evaluate the 
microbiome alterations and pharmacodynamics associated with two dosing regimens of SER-287 in adult subjects with mild-to-moderate UC. Subjects will be randomized to 
one of 4 study arms: A) Pre-treatment of placebo, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks; B) Pre-treatment of placebo, followed by daily dosing of placebo for 8 
weeks; C) Pre-treatment of vancomycin, followed  by daily dosing of SER-287 for 8 
weeks; D) Pre-treatment of vancomycin, followed by weekly do sing of SER-287 for 8 
weeks.  
 
The study is broken down into 5 study periods:  Screening  (Day-17 to Day-1), Pre-
treatment, (Day 1 to Day 7), 8-Week Treatment Period (Day 8-63), a 4-Week Short 
Term Safety Follow-up Period (Day 64-92) and a Long Term Safety Follow-up Day 93 -
246).  Approximately 55 adult subjects with mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis will be 
enrolled.   
 
Screening includes 2 screening visits.  At the first Screening Visit, (Visit 1), subjects 
will be checked for inclusion/exclusion criteria, and medical history and demographic 
data will be collected.  At the second Screening Visit, (Visit 2) eligible subjects will 
undergo a lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy)
 and biopsy within 
17 days from the Screening visit and prior to Study Day 1.  Subjects will be on a clear 
liquid diet 1 day before the lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy). 
On the day of the procedure, the subject will administer a bowel prep at the PI discretion (e.g., 2 Fleets enemas) and fast for 6 hours before the procedure.   
  
Endoscopy images will be obtained during each endoscopy and will be sent for 
independent central reading and determina tion of the modified Mayo endoscopic 
subscore. A detailed image review  charter from the central reading laboratory will 
outline the endoscopic procedures, video  recordings, and equipment to be used for video 
capture and transmission of endoscopic recordings. For each subject, video recording of 
the entire endoscopic procedure will be performed using a storage medium provided by 
the sponsor or designee. The endoscopic recordings will be read centrally in a blinded 
manner by a qualified gastroenterologist acc ording to the image review charter. The 
modified Mayo score used for clinical endpoints in the trial will use the  modified Mayo 
endoscopy subscore determined by the central reader. 
! 
The Total modified Mayo score is a composite score.  Only the modified Mayo 
endoscopic subscore is determined by central reader  and provided to the clinical site.  If 
the partial Mayo score changes from Visit 1 to Visit 2, the Visit 2 score should be used in computing the Total modified Mayo score at Baseline and when assessing the subject for 
the safety stopping rules. Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria (Total modified Mayo 
score of 4 to 10, inclusive and modified Mayo endoscopic subscore of > 1, with evidence

(IxRS) to 1 of 4 treatment groups on Study Day 1 and initiate the pre-treatment regimen. 
 
During the Pre-Treatment period (Day 1 to Day 7) oral vancomycin 125 mg four times 
a day (qid) or matching placebo will be administered for  6 days.  
 
During the 8-Week Treatment Period, all subjects will come to the clinic weekly for 
drug dispensing and asked about adverse events (AEs), change in medications and the 
partial Mayo score assessment (scores should reflect the 24-hour period prior to 
reporting.  The endoscopy procedure day or preparation day should not be included ).  All 
subjects will have a lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy) at Visit 12/Early Termination +/- 3 days to evaluate endoscopic disease activity. Subj ects will be 
on a clear liquid diet the day before the lower endoscopy (flexible sigmoidoscopy or 
colonoscopy). On the day of the procedure, the subject will self -administer a bowel prep 
per the PI instructions (e.g., 2 Fleets enemas) and fast for 6 hours before the procedure.   All subjects will have an in-clinic visit at Visit 12/Early Termination +/- 3 days. 
 Subjects will then enter the Short Term Safety Follow-up Period in which subjects will 
be contacted by phone on Days 71, 78, 85 +/- 2 days. Subjects will be asked about 
adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications  and will complete disease activity 
assessment which includes stool frequency and rectal bleeding , two subscores from the 
total modified Mayo score.  All subjects will have an in-clinic safety visit at Visit 13 +/- 
2 days.  
 
Subjects will then enter the Long Term Safety Follow-up Period in which subjects will 
be contacted by phone on Days 246 +/- 3 days. Following Visit 13 through Day 246/ET 
only SAEs and concomitant medications associated with SAEs will be collected. 
 
To ensure safe study conduct during the Phase 1b study, an independent, unblinded, 
external Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be established to perform safety evaluations on an ongoing basis. A DSMC charter will be developed and will 
detail the review of the safety data.   
3.2! Criteria for Evaluation of the Study 
The evaluation of the safety data will be performed by comparison of the safety 
endpoints across the treatment arms.  The following safety endpoints will be assessed for 
the comparison: 
•!Incidence of adverse events  
•!Incidence of adverse events of special interest  
•!Laboratory evaluation results  
•!Vital sign measurements 
•!Physical examination findings

before Visit 12, the Investigator must make every effort to perform the evaluations described for Follow Up Visit 12. 
If a subject withdraws consent and still agrees to undergo a final examination, this will 
be documented on the EDC system and the Investigator’s copy of the ICF, which will be 
countersigned and dated by the subject.  
A subject may also be withdrawn from study by the Sponsor, Regulatory Authorities, or 
Independent Ethics Committees (IECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). 
Subjects will also be withdrawn if the entire study is terminated prematurely. If a subject fails to appear for a follow-up assessment, all attempts to contact the subject 
and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s 
medical record. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject 
outcome, if possible (i.e, 3 documented contact attempts via phone calls, e-mail, etc., on 
separate occasions will be made to locate or contact them, or at least to determine their 
health status). 
Subjects who discontinue from the study after randomization may be replaced.  
4.4! Planned Sample Size and Number of Study Centers 
Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 20 sites in the United States 
(US).

4.5.1! Subject Identification 
All screened subjects will be assigned a unique subject identification (SID) number that 
will be used through screening, pre-treatment and treatment periods , and safety follow-up 
period.  
4.5.2! Methods of Assigning Patients to Study Treatment 
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to double-blind 
treatment (SER-287 or placebo) and to increase the likelihood that known and unknown 
subject characteristics will be evenly distrib uted between the treatment groups.  
Eligible subjects are to be randomized at  Visit 3 (Day 1) after all screening procedures 
have been performed and eligibility for the study confirmed . Subjects will be randomized 
via interactive voice/web response system (IxRS) to one of 4 study arms: A) Pre-
treatment of placebo, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks; B) Pre-
treatment of placebo, followed by daily dosing of placebo for 8 weeks; C) Pre-treatment 
of vancomycin, followed by daily dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks; D) Pre-treatment of 
vancomycin, followed by weekly dosing of SER-287 for 8 weeks.  
 
Once a randomization number has been assigned to a subject, the number cannot be 
reused even if the subject discontinues from the study early or withdraws before 
receiving any study drug. Subjects who discontinue from the study or who have been 
previously randomized in the study will not be permitted to re -enter. Similarly, study 
drug assigned to a subject may not be re-used, even if the bottle is returned unopened.  
During the double-blind period, subjects, the investigators and other study site personnel, 
and clinical staff will remain blinded to the treatment assignment. The medical monitor, 
study site monitors, and other sponsor representatives involved in th e clinical aspects of 
study conduct also will remain blinded to the treatment assignment.  
4.5.3! Maintaining the Randomization Codes and Breaking the Study Blind 
A designated randomization administrator from an external, independent vendor will 
maintain the randomization codes in accordance with standard operating procedures to ensure that the blind is properly maintained and that only sponsor personnel who require 
knowledge of treatment assignments will be unblinded [e.g., staff involved in serious 
adverse event (SAE) reporting].  
Investigators are not to break the study treatment blind except when information 
concerning the study drug is necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. If a 
medical emergency requiring unblinding occurs, the investigator (or d esignated 
physician) is strongly encouraged to contact the medical or safety monitor to assess the 
necessity of breaking the study drug blind. If unblinding is warranted, the investigator 
will obtain the treatment assignment information from the I xRS. Every effort is to be 
made to limit study site personnel unblinding only to those individuals providing direct care to that subject. Any intentional or unintentional breaking of the blind is to be 
reported immediately to the sponsor. The other circumstances in  which unblinding may 
be necessary are at the request of a subject who becomes pregnant during the study or for

If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be recorded in the patient’s EDC 
system, and any associated AE report.  
 If a subject is unblinded, they will not receive any additional study medications.  
After the statistical analysis plan (SAP) is final and the primary study period (Visit 1 
through Visit 13) data is declared complete and final , the study blind codes will be 
broken.

5.1! SER-287 
5.1.1! Donor Screening 
Donors undergo a general health examination including GI medical history, familial GI 
medical history, clinical chemistry, hematology with complete blood count, urinalysis, 
and blood and fecal viral and bacterial pathogen testing before donating stool. The donor 
must successfully complete the physical screening and laboratory tests after the donation 
period before the material can be released for manufacturing. A description of don or 
screening procedures is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
5.1.2! SER-287 Manufacturing 
SER-287 is manufactured as SER-109 using current Good Manufacturing Practice -
compliant processing steps, and is subsequently released using assays for purity, potency, and identity. The manufacturing process inactivates non -spore forms of bacteria, fungi, 
and other potential components (parasites and some viruses), substantially r educes the 
amount of undigested food and inactivated vegetative biomass via successive filtration 
steps, and formulates the drug substance in 92% glycerol and approximately 8% saline 
solution (0.9% of sodium chloride), containing less than about 30 mg of non-spore 
solids.  The drug substance is filled into capsules, and then over -encapsulated. For each 
unit-dose bottle, four capsules (1×10
8 SporQs) are packaged in an HDPE container, 
induction sealed with foil and closed with child resistant closures. At the time of labeling 
for investigational use the drug product becomes SER -287. SER -287 is odorless and 
tasteless as prescribed. If chewed or if capsule integrity is compromised, SER -287 has a 
sweet taste. 
Study drug will be packaged by Catalent Pharma Solutions according to all local legal 
requirements. Study drug will be labeled in accordance with applicable  regulatory 
requirements. 
5.2! Over-encapsulated (OE) Vancomycin HCl 125 mg Capsules, Hard Gelatin 
Capsules (“Vancomycin”) 
5.2.1! Vancomycin HCl Procurement, Over-encapsulation, Packaging and Storage 
Commercially available Vancomycin HCl 125 mg  Capsules, USP, in 20-capsule blister 
packs are de-blistered and over encapsulated in size 00 Swedish Orange Capsules with 
microcrystalline cellulose backfill.  Capsules are fill ed into 40 mL white high density 
polyethylene (HDPE ) bottles, induction sealed with a foil seal and closed with child 
resistant closures.  Each bottle is filled with 24 capsules.  Bottles are stored at ambient 
temperature.

5.3.1! SER-287 Placebo Manufacturing 
Placebo will be identical to the Investigational Product SER-287 but will not contain 
product spores or non-spore solids. Placebo will consist of 92% glycerol and 
approximately 8% saline solution (0.9% of sodium chloride).  The SER -287 Placebo will 
be provided in a single-dose container of 4 white, size 00 capsules in a foil-sealed, opaque, 40 mL HDPE  bottle with child resistant closures. At the time of labeling for 
investigational use the placebo becomes SER-287 placebo.  The SER -287 placebo is 
odorless and tasteless as prescribed. If chewed or if capsule integrity is compromised, SER-287 placebo has a sweet taste. 
5.4! Vancomycin HCl Placebo Capsules (“Vancomycin Placebo”) 
5.4.1! Vancomycin HCl Placebo Manufacturing and Storage 
Vancomycin HCl placebo is manufactured in size 00 Swedish Orange Capsules.  Capsules are filled with microcrystalline cellulose and filled into 40 mL white HDPE 
bottles.  Bottles are induction sealed with a foil seal and closed with child resistant 
closures.  Each bottle is filled with 24 capsules.  Bottles are stored at ambient temperature. 
5.5! Storage 
5.5.1! SER-287 and SER-287 Placebo Storage 
SER-287 or placebo bottles are assembled into weekly kits and stored at or below -15°C 
at the distribution depot. Kits are shipped to the clinical site on dry ice.  Kits are stored at 
or below -15°C at the clinical site until dispensed to the subject.  Subjects are instructed 
to store kits at home in the refrigerator (2°C-8°C).  For more information on storage, refer to the Study Manual.

After the primary study period (Visit 1 to Visit 13) data is declared complete and final, the 
overall randomization code will be broken only for reporting purposes. The record of  
randomization will include study arm assignment and also the association of treatment kit 
number with donor group.  
5.6! Drug Accountability 
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate study drug accountability 
records throughout the study. 
 Vancomycin or Vancomycin placebo are provided in sealed bottles containing 24 
capsules.  The seal on a given bottle should be punctured at the time of subject 
randomization to perform drug accountability at the capsule level. Each bottle should be 
stored unopened and intact until dispensed to the subject.  
 
SER-287 or SER-287 placebo are provided in sealed bottles  containing four capsules. 
The seal on a given bottle should only be removed at the time of administration . Each 
bottle should be stored unopened and intact until time -of-use. Drug accountability at the

level.  
5.7! Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Any medication the subject takes through Visit 13 other than the study drug (vancomycin 
and SER-287), including herbal and other non-traditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication.  Following Visit 13 through Day 246/ET only concomitant 
medications associated with SAEs will be collected.  All concomitant medications must 
be recorded in the EDC system. The following information must be recorded in the EDC system for each concomitant medication: generic name  (or trade name if generic is not 
known), route of administration, start date, stop date, dosage, and indication. Any changes in the dosage or regimen of a concomitant medication must be recorded in the 
EDC system. 
 
At Screening, subjects will be asked about all current and prior IBD medications they 
have taken and in addition all medications taken during the last 6 months (non-IBD 
related)  At each subsequent study visit, subjects will be asked what concomitant 
medications they are currently taking.  
 
Permitted concomitant medications include: 
•!Oral aminosalicylates (Aminosalicylates taken for at least 6 weeks, with a stable 
dose for > 2 weeks prior to screening)  
•!Immunomodulator: 6-Mercaptopurine, Azathioprine, Methotrexate (Stable dose 
for > 12 weeks prior to screening) 
•!Prednisone < 15 mg (Stable dose for > 2 weeks prior to screening) 
•!Budesonide < 6 mg (Stable dose for > 2 weeks prior to screening 
•!Budesonide MMX# < 9 mg (Stable dose for > 2 weeks prior to screening) 
•!Opiate treatment (stable dose)  
•!Short term opiate use is permitted 
•!Short term use of non-steroidals/NSAIDS, is permitted 
•!Low dose aspirin (81mg) is permitted for long-term use 
 
Subjects who are receiving any of the above permitted concomitant medications at the 
time of study entry must keep their dosage stable throughout the study, unless 
investigator judgment requires it to be increased, reduced or discontinued for safety concerns or medical necessity.  If there is a change in dosage, the subject would then be discontinued from the study.

6.1! Microbiome Alterations and Engraftment Primary Endpoints 
6.1.1! Microbiome Alterations 
Stool samples will be analyzed to characterize changes in the microbiome and associated 
functional metabolic changes in the gastrointestinal tract at various time points between 
Visit 1 and Visit 13.  
 Composition of the intestinal microbiome 
Composition of the intestinal microbiome will be assessed at time points between Visit 1 
and Visit 13. 
 Engraftment of SER-287 bacteria 
Engraftment is defined as the outgrowth of bacteria that comprise the SER -287 spore 
ecology in a subject’s gastrointestinal tract post-treatment. Engraftment of SER-287 
bacteria will be assessed at time points between Visit 4 and 13. 
  Secondary Endpoints 
6.1.2! Clinical Response, Complete Remission, and Endoscopic Improvement 
Partial Mayo score, which is the Mayo Score without the endoscopic subscore, will be 
assessed at each visit and the Total modified Mayo score (TMMS) will be assessed at baseline and at Visit 12 (or early termination) 
Clinical response is defined as:  
$!A decrease of ≥3 points in TMMS from baseline, along with EITHER a decrease 
of >1 point in rectal bleeding subscore OR absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 
or 1 
Complete remission is defined as: 
$!A TMMS <2 and an endoscopic subscore of 0 with no erythema, no blood and no 
evidence of inflammation

assessments for times collected.  
•!Stool and blood metabolic pathways  
•!Serum cytokine profile 
•!Mucosal transcriptomic profile  
•!Mucosal microbiome  
•!Mucosal Histopathology, including CMV Immunohistology stains  
•!Microbial Culture Endpoints:

6.2! Safety Variables 
Safety evaluations include medical history, assessment of AEs, clinical laboratory tests 
(chemistry, hematology and urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).  
6.2.1! The Safety Endpoints 
•!Incidence of adverse events  
•!Incidence of adverse events of special interest 
•!Laboratory evaluation results  
•!Vital sign measurements 
•!Physical examination findings  
6.2.2! Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who 
was administered study drug, regardless of its causal relationship to the study drug. An 
AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not it is considered to be related to the study drug.  
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose and regardless of 
causality that: 
•!Results in death. 
•!Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that 
hypothetically might have caused death had it  occurred in a more severe form. 
•!Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
hospital admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the study 
period, but planned before study entry are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the subject was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not worsen in 
any unexpected manner during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than 
planned).

substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
•!Is associated with a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
•!Is an important medical event. An important medical event is an event that may not 
result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization but may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the 
subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed in the definitions for SAEs. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in in-patient hospitalization, and the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) (serious or non-serious) is one of scientific 
and medical concern specific to the product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor is appropriate. 
 
In this protocol, a UC flare, as defined in Section 6.2.2.1 below, has been designated as 
an AESI and as such will be reported and followed in the same manner as a SAE during the course of the study.    
 
All AEs, including SAEs, will be graded for severity by using the following grading 
system: 
•!Mild: Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s 
daily activities 
•!Moderate: Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern and may require treatment; moderate events may cause some interference with functioning 
•!Severe: Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; severe events are usually incapacitating 
 
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented, and documentation will include 
assessment of the duration of the event at each level of intensity. Adverse events 
characterized as intermittent will be documented based on the severity, onset, and duration of each episode. 
An abnormal laboratory test finding that meets any of the criteria below will be 
considered an AE: 
•!Is associated with accompanying symptoms 
•!Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention 
•!Leads to a concomitant drug treatment or any change in a concomitant medication or 
therapy 
•!Is considered an AE by the Investigator 
Laboratory results that fall outside the reference range and do not meet 1 of the criteria 
above will not be reported as AEs. Repeating a test because of an abnormal result, in the

is determined to be an error will not be reported as an AE. 
For all AEs, including SAEs, the Investigator will report on the relationship of the AE to 
the study drug by using the following definitions: 
•!Unrelated: There is little or no chance that the study drug caused the AE; other 
conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the disease state, or a reaction to a concomitant medication best explain the event  
•!Related or Possibly Related: The association of the AE with the study drug is unknown; however, the AE is not clearly due to another condition, or a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE and treatment administration and, based 
on the Investigator’s clinical experience, the association of the AE with the study 
drug seems likely 
Adverse events, including local and systemic reactions not considered medically serious, 
will be recorded. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, 
Investigator assessment of severity, relationship to study drug, date of resolution of the event, seriousness, and outcome. 
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject is screened will be 
considered as a baseline condition and not be reported as an AE. However, if it worsens 
at any time during the study, it should be recorded as an AE.  
 
All AEs, SAEs and AESIs will be collected from Informed Consent up to  Visit  13.  
Following Visit 13 through Day 246, only SAEs will be collected.  All AEs, including 
SAEs  and AESIs, will be monitored until resolution or determined by the Investigator to 
be due to a subject’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent illness. 
The Investigator is responsible for: 
•!Informing the sponsor in the event that a patient or a subject’s partner becomes 
pregnant during the study. A “Pregnancy Report Form” will be generated and the 
pregnancy will be captured in the safety database and will be followed through to the 
outcome. 
•!Evaluating subject safety including assessment of AEs for seriousness, severity, and causality. 
Informing the Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of 
AEs as required and SAEs as per IRB/IEC guidelines. 
6.2.2.1! Safety Halting Rules 
 
To ensure subject safety, individual (as listed below) and study -wide (as detailed in the 
DSMC charter) halting rules will be implemented. 
 
Individual halting rules include: 
•!UC flare, defined by: 1) an increase by 2 points from screening of partial Mayo score 
at two contiguous visits after SER-287/placebo initiation (if the partial Mayo score 
changes from Visit 1 to Visit 2, the Visit 2 score should be used in computing the

to the DSMC the recommendation is to withdraw the subject from the study. 
If a subject meets the criteria above for at least one of the individ ual halting rules, he/ she 
will be discontinued from the study. 
6.2.2.2! Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report any SAEs and AESIs to the PAREXEL Medical Services 
Safety Contact within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event by completing and 
transmitting the Serious Adverse Event report form by fax or email to the PAREXEL 
Safety Contact noted below . If questions arise regarding the reporting procedures or the 
specifics of the reporting event or the site needs to report the event by phone, the  
investigator may call the Safety Contact listed below. A phone report will need to be 
followed by faxing or emailing the written SAE report form within the next 24 hours.  
 
The Sponsor (or Sponsor’s designated agent) will review each SAE report in detail and 
will evaluate the expectedness according to the reference document (Investigator 
Brochure or Summary of Product Characteristics). Based on the Investigator and 
Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a decision will be made concerning the need for

Amendment 3                                                                  43 of 75                                                  10 Oct  2016  When additional relevant information is available, the SAE /AESI  report form will be 
updated with the new information and submitted within 24 hours of site awareness of this 
new information. The event must be documented in the eCRF. 
6.2.2.3! Follow-up of Adverse Events 
All AEs experienced by a subject, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be 
monitored until the AE has resolved, any abnormal laboratory values have returned to 
baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the Investigator and Medical Monitor, until 
there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed, until the subject is lost to 
follow-up, until it is unlikely that any additional information can be obtained, or until the 
subject has died. 
6.2.2.4! Pregnancy 
The Sponsor has a responsibility to monitor the outcome of pregnancies where there has 
been maternal exposure to the study drug.  
Pregnancy alone is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  
Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs, unless they were 
therapeutic abortions  (see below). Hospitalization for normal delivery of a healthy 
newborn should not be considered a SAE. 
All pregnancies must be reported by the Investigator to PAREXEL/Sponsor on the initial 
pregnancy report form within 24 hours after becoming aware of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator must follow up and document the course and the outcome of all pregnancies 
even if the subject was discontinued from the study or if the study has finished. 
All outcomes of pregnancy must be reported by the Investigator to PAREXEL/Sponsor 
on the pregnancy outcome report form within 24 hours after he or she has gained 
knowledge of the normal delivery or elective abortion.  
Any SAE that occurs during pregnancy (including SAEs occurring after last 
administration of study drug) must be recorded on the SAE report form (e.g., maternal serious complications, spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirth, 
neonatal death, congenital anomaly, or birth defect) and reported within 24 hours in 
accordance with the procedure for reporting SAEs  
If a female partner of a male study subject who has been exposed to the study drug 
becomes pregnant, the pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy should be monitored. 
In the event of pregnancy, the pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is determined. 
6.2.3! Laboratory Variables 
Laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory, as identified in the 
List of Study Personnel. 
Blood samples will  be taken using standard venipuncture techniques. A laboratory 
manual will  be provided by the central laboratory . This laboratory manual will contain 
detailed instructions for collection, storage, and shipment of samples (e.g., what kind of 
tubes, what kind of sample preparation, mailing addresses, etc.).

1 Urinalysis will be performed by dipstick.  If nitrates or leukocytes are positive, a microscopic 
examination will be performed by the central laboratory.  
2 A serum pregnancy test will be done  at Screening.  Urine pregnancy tests will be done at Visit 3 (Day 1) , 
Visit 12 (Day 64 ± 3) and at Visit 13 (Day 92 ± 1).   
 
Any value outside the normal range will be flagged for the attention of the Investigator or 
designee at the site.  The Investigator or designee will indicate whether or not the value is of clinical significance and should be recorded as an AE.  Actual laboratory results will 
not be captured on the EDC system. However, if any laboratory results meeting the 
reporting requirements for an AE, the event term (e.g., elevated transaminase) will be 
recorded on the EDC system as an AE or SAE, as applicable.

This study has a primary study period (from Visit 1 through Visit 13) followed by a long 
term safety follow-up period to Day 246.  The primary study period will be conducted as 
a double-blind study.  The final database for the primary study period will  remain 
blinded until all data collected through Visit 13 has been entered, cleaned and declared 
complete and final.  The CSR will be finalized after results from the primary study period 
are complete; all available data post -Visit 13 pertaining to mortality will be provided.  
Results of the long term safety period (through Day 246) will be presented in a separate 
report. 
 
Before the primary study period data is declared complete and final , a statistical analysis 
plan (SAP) will be issued as a separate document, providing detailed methods for the 
analyses outlined below.  Any deviations from the planned analyses will be described 
and justified in the final integrated clinical study report.  
8.1! Study Subjects 
8.1.1! Disposition of Subjects 
The number and percentage of subjects entering and completing the clinical study will be 
presented, by treatment group. 
8.1.2! Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations will be listed by subject. 8.1.3! Analysis Sets  
Safety Population: The Safety Population will consist of all subjects 
who receive any amount of study drug.  Subjects 
will be analyzed according to the treatment they 
actually received, rather than the treatment to which 
they were randomly assigned.  All safety analyses 
will be conducted based on the Safety Population.  
Intent-to-Treat Analysis Population: The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of 
all subjects who were randomly assigned, including 
those who were not exposed to any study drug, and 
will be analyzed based on the treatment to which 
they were randomly assigned.   
Modified Intent-to-Treat Population: The modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) Population 
will consist of all randomized patients with baseline 
and at least one post-baseline stool sample, 
including those who were not exposed to any study 
drug, and will be analyzed based on the treatment to 
which they were randomized.   
All clinical response analyses will be conducted in the ITT population and in the mITT 
population as sensitivity analyses.

8.2! Endpoints for Analysis 
8.2.1! Endpoints and Analysis for Primary Objectives 
The primary endpoint for assessment of safety and tolerability will be AEs, classified to 
body system and preferred term as well as severity and causality. Other safety and 
tolerability endpoints are AESIs, laboratory evaluation results, vital sign measurements 
and physical examination findings. Safety endpoint will be summarized by treatment 
group and also for the pooled SER-287 treatments (A, C and D). The assessment of 
safety will be based on descriptive summaries of SER -287 treatment groups and the 
placebo treatment group. 
 
Composition of the microbiome at Visit  1, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 12, Visit 13, or 
at early termination will be measured in terms of both  the total number of unique types of 
bacteria (i.e., α-diversity) and the microbial composition (i.e., β-diversity). Engraftment 
is defined as the germination and outgrowth of bacteria that comprise the SER -287 spore 
ecology in a subject’s gastrointestinal tract post-treatment. Engraftment will be assessed 
at time points between Visit 4 and Visit 13. 
 
Differences between changes in the microbiome across the various treatment arms will 
be evaluated using both non-parametric tests for α-diversity and multivariate analysis of 
variances of dissimilarity matrices for β-diversity. Dissimilarity will be defined by using 
the unweighted Unifrac dissimilarity metric, which evaluates changes in the overall 
phylogenetic composition between two samples; this method is widely used in the study 
of microbial communities and represents a bala nced approach with minimal bias to the 
presence of low- and high-abundance bacteria.  
 
Additional measures of dissimilarity that are routinely used in the analysis of microbiome 
data sets will be further evaluated.  
8.2.2! Endpoints and Analysis for Secondary Objectives 
Efficacy response endpoints comprise clinical response, complete remission and 
endoscopic improvement. The primary time point for analysis is Visit 12. Estimates of 
the risk difference and confidence interval will be reported for treatment groups A,  C and 
D separately compared to placebo.  
Serum biomarkers (CRP) and fecal biomarkers (fecal calprotectin) at Visit 1, Visit 4, Visit 6, Visit 12 and Visit 13 will be assessed using descriptive summary tables and treatment mean [+/- standard deviation (SD)] profile plots (response versus timepoint). 
8.2.3! Exploratory Endpoints 
All time points of exploratory endpoint will be listed and presented in descriptive 
summary tables.

8.3! General Considerations 
8.3.1! Statistical Methods 
All safety and tolerability, intestinal microbiome, clinical efficacy, and biomarker data 
will be listed and presented in descriptive summaries by study arm, visit and time point. 
At a minimum, continuous data will be summarized by study arm using descriptive 
statistics (number, mean, SD minimum, median and maxi mum).  Categorical data will be 
summarized by study arm using frequency tables (number and percentage).  
Selected clinical response and biomarker data will be presented in treatment mean (+/ -
SD) profile plots.   
8.3.2! Statistical Significance 
Statistical significance tests, if reported, will be two -sided and will be presented as 
relative measures of the strength of association to study arm for comparison among study 
endpoints.  All reported confidence intervals will be 95%, two-sided.  P-values and/or 
confidence intervals generated for this study are not intended to be conclusive, but 
provided for guidance only.  
In general, inferential analysis will be based on pairwise comparisons, A, C and D 
separately compared to placebo  (B) and also the comparisons A versus D and C versus 
D. For continuous data these comparisons will be assessed using confidence intervals 
estimated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) models fit to the separate results 
of each visit. For binary data these comparison s will be assessed by analysis of two-by-
two tables and calculation the risk difference and confidence interval. Additional details of the statistical analysis will be addressed in a statistical analysis plan, finalized prior to  
the time the primary study period (Visit 1 to Visit 13) data is declared complete and final 
and study unblinding. 
8.3.3! Missing or Spurious Data 
Any AE with incomplete date or time will be evaluated conservatively in the 
classification of treatment emergent AE.  Any apparently spurious data will be verified.  No verified data will be excluded from summaries or analysis.  
 
Several missing imputation methods, such as worst case analyses, observed case analyses 
and last observation carried forward, will be applied to analyze the clinical efficacy  
endpoints.

8.4.1! Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded by using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA). Summary tables of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs ) by 
treatment group will be provided. A TEAE is any AE th at newly appeared, increased in 
frequency, or worsened in severity after initiation of study drug. A listing of all AEs, 
including those occurring before the start of study drug, will be provided. The  percentage 
of subjects with TEAEs will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred 
term (PT) for each treatment group. The incidence of TEAEs based on the number of 
days the subjects in each treatment group were on study drug (per subject on therapy 
day) will also be presented by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group by severity, and by relationship to treatment. Tables of any TEAEs leading to 
study drug discontinuation, AESIs and SAEs will also be provided.  
8.4.2! Clinical Laboratory Tests 
All scheduled and unscheduled laboratory results will be presented for each subject, 
sorted by category, subject, test and sample time.  Flags will be attached to values outside 
of the laboratory’s reference limits along with the Investigator’s assessment.  A sep arate 
listing of abnormal results will be presented, ordered by test, subject and sample time.     
Quantitative chemistry and hematology tests (observed values and change from baseline) will be summarized descriptively in tabular format . A shift table will be presented for 
chemistry, hematology and urinalysis tests shift from baseline to each post -baseline visit 
and also the shift from baseline to highest and to lowest post-baseline assessment. 
8.4.3! Vital Signs 
Individual data listings of vital signs (observed and change from baseline) will be 
presented for each subject. Descriptive statistics of the vital signs will be presented by 
treatment group for all study visits at which they were collected. The change from baseline to each post-baseline visit will also be summarized by treatment group. 
8.4.4! Physical Examination Findings 
Abnormal clinically significant physical examination (PE) finding will be reported as 
medical history (MH) or as an AE.   
8.4.5! Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Not applicable 
8.5! Gastrointestinal Tract Microbiome 
The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome of subjects will be characterized by using at 
minimum recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid ( rDNA) 16S V4 genomic data sets 
generated from stool collected at the time points defined above for the various endpoints.  Genomic data sets will define the microbial composition of the microbiome of a subject 
at a given time point. Genomic sequence read data sets will be analyzed to assign a taxonomic identity at the resolution of an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) and

8.6! Interim Analyses 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 8.7! Determination of Sample Size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed.  A sample size of approximately 55 
subjects, with 15 subjects randomized to each of the active arms (Treatment Groups A, C 
and D) and 10 subjects in the placebo arm (Treatment Group B) is considered sufficient 
to evaluate the safety, microbiome alterations, clinical response and exploratory 
objectives of the study.  All comparisons performed in this study will be descriptive in 
nature. P-values and/or confidence intervals generated for this study are not intended to be conclusive, but are provided for guidance only.

pertinent to, and should be available for, monitoring by the sponsor or inspection by the regulatory authorities as defined in the monitoring plan.  
The sponsor or an authorized sponsor representative will conduct regular si te monitoring 
visits to review and validate study data as defined in the monitoring plan by reviewing 
subjects’ medical records and eCRFs in accordance with written standard operating 
procedures, ICH guidelines, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelin es. The 
Investigator will allow representatives of the sponsor or regulatory authorities to inspect 
facilities and records relevant to this study.  
9.8! Data and Safety Monitoring Committee 
To supplement the routine study monitoring outlined in this protocol, an  external DSMC 
will monitor the safety data from this study. The members of the DSMC will not be 
involved with the study (i.e., they are not study investigators) and must have no 
competing interests that could affect their roles with respect to the study. The DSMC will 
include 2 clinicians experienced in Gastroenterology and a statistician. The DSMC will make recommendations to ensure both patient safety and the continued ethical integrity 
of the study. Specific details regarding the responsibilities and re quirements for 
documentation will be described in a separate charter that is reviewed and approved by 
the DSMC.  
9.9! Case Report Forms and Study Records 
Data will be collected for this study by using an eCRF. The Investigator and study site 
staff will receive training and support on the use of the eCRF. All eCRF data are to be 
completed by the study coordinator or other designated site personnel. All data entry, 
modification, or deletion will be recorded automatically in the electronic audit trail. All 
data changes will be clearly indicated with a means to locate prior values. A unique user 
identification and password will be assigned to all personnel approved to enter or change 
data to prevent unauthorized access to the data.  
 
All electronic data entered by th e site (including the electronic audit trail) will be 
maintained or made available at the site in compliance with Title  21 Part 11 of the Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) and other applicable retention regulations. The 
computerized system is able to gener ate accurate and complete copies of records in paper 
or electronic form for inspection and review by applicable regulatory authorities, the 
IRB/IEC/Research Ethics Board, and auditors or other designees authorized by the sponsor.

the eCRF allows for application of electronic signatures. The Investigator or designated 
subInvestigator, after review of the data in the eCRF, will confirm the validity of each 
subject’s data by electronic signature. This electronic signature will be certified as outlined in 21 CFR Part 11. 
 
The sponsor will retain the original eCRF data and audit trail. An electronic or certified 
paper copy of all completed eCRF data, including query resolution correspondence, will be provided to the Investigator at the end of the study. 
9.10! Study Completion  
The sponsor requires the following data and materials to be submitted before a study can 
be considered complete or terminated:    
•!Laboratory findings, clinical data, and all special test results from informed consent 
through the End-of-Study Visit at Week 13 and the final phone call on Day 246 
•!Electronic CRFs properly completed by appropriate study personnel and signed and dated by the Investigator 
•!Complete study drug accountability records  
•!Copies of IRB/IEC approval and notification of the original protocol and of any protocol amendments, if appropriate 
•!A summary of the study prepared by the Investigator (an IRB/IEC summary letter is acceptable)

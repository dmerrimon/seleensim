Sage)  
Name of Investigational Product: SAGE -217 Capsules  
Name of Active Ingredient:  SAGE -217 
Title of Study: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind Study Comparing the Efficacy and Safety of 
SAGE -217 plus an Antidepressant  Versus Placebo plus an Antidepressant in Adults with Major 
Depressive Disorder  
Number of Sites and Study Location: This study will take place at approximately 55 sites in United 
States . 
Phase of Development:  3 
Planned Duration for each Study Participant:  Up to 70 days (up to 28- day Screening Period, 14- day 
Double -blind Treatment Period, and a 28 -day Antidepressant Therapy (ADT)  Continuation Period) 
Objectives:  
Primary: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of SAGE -217 plus an antidepressant in the treatment of major 
depressive disorder (MDD) compared to placebo plus  an antidepressant 
Secondary:  
• To assess patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures as they relate to depressive symptoms  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SAGE -217 plus an antidepressant  
 
  
  
Endpoints: 
Primary: 
• Change from baseline in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM -D) total 
score at Day 3 
Key Secondary:  
• Change from baseline in HAM -D total score over the blinded treatment period (using equal 
weights for the scheduled visits – Day 3, Day 8, Day 12, Day 15 ) 
Other Secondary: 
• Change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15 and Day 42  
• Change from baseline in HAM -D total score around end of blinded treatment  (using equal 
weights for the scheduled visits –Day 12, Day 15, Day 18 ) 
• HAM -D response at Day 15 and Day 42  
• HAM -D remission at Day 15 and Day 42  
• Change from baseline in Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI-S) at Day 15  
• CGI-I response, defined as “much improved” or “very much improved”, at Day 3 and Day 15  
• Change from baseline in MADRS total score at Day 15  
• MADRS response at Day 15

7 administer ADT in the morning (for twice -daily dosing ) as part of a divided dose for the first 7  days. 
Participants will return to the study center as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
During the Treatment Period, participants will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as there 
are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants who cannot tolerate SAGE -217/placebo 
50 mg will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the Treatment Period. Participants who , in the opinion 
of the investigator,  cannot tolerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40-mg dose may be disconti nued from 
SAGE -217/placebo at the discretion of the investigator . If blinded IP is discontinued, the ADT  may be 
continued at the discretion of the investigator . 
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participant s will have the opportunity to enter a long-
term open-label study of SAGE -217.  
Number of Participants (planned): It is estimated that approximately 424 participants will be 
randomized and treated to obtain 382 evaluable participants at Day 3 (assuming a 10% drop out rate). 
Additional participants may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 10%.

 23  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical  Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United States, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs, 
and suicide- related costs, w as estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015 ). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt ha s 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5, American 
Psychiatric Association 2013) provides diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). These include at least 5 of 9 depressive symptoms (depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy 
level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability, and suicidality) during the same 2 -week period that 
represents a change from previous functioning (DSM -5). 
Antidepress ants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitors (SNRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), 
tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), and other compounds that affect monoaminergic neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the 
major classes of antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have 
demonstrated their limited efficacy, including low remission rates and untreated symptoms 
(Trivedi 2006; Conradi 2011; Romera 2013). Furthermore, these agents can take 4 to 8 weeks to 
demonstrate full clinical efficacy (Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006), and in the case of the most commonly prescribed classes—SSRIs and SNRIs —common side effects including weight gain, 
GI symptoms, and sexual dysfunction can prevent titration into an adequate therapeutic range 
(Sadock and Sadock 2007). 
In the largest study to assess the effectiveness of depression treatments in patients with MD D, 
time to patient remission after treatment was 5.4 to 7.4 weeks; approximately one- half of the 
patients who ultimately remitted did so after 6 weeks, and 40% of those who achieved remission 
required 8 or more weeks to do so ( Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006 ). Eve n following remission, many 
patients report the presence of residual symptoms, often related to decreased positive affect, such 
as loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable, fatigue, loss of energy, as well as sleep 
and appetite/weight disturbances ( Nierenberg 2009; Nierenberg 2015). Thus, patients may 
remain symptomatic for up to 2 months while waiting for current standard -of-care 
pharmacotherapy to take full effect. They may also have to contend with undesirable side effects and residual sy mptoms. These aspects underscore the need for newer, rapid- acting therapies.  
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA
A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was highly selective 
for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo.  
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with SAGE -217 (overall) were sedation, 
somnolence, and dizziness; most adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity. Refer to the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of the 
chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of SAGE-217. 
This study was designed to target the unmet need of symptom improvement during the latency to 
SSRI and SNRI efficacy in the acute phase of a major depressive episode. This study will assess 
the safety and efficacy of SAGE -217 50 mg plus an antidepres sant, examining if SAGE-217 plus 
an antidepressant  produces more rapid or more profound reduction in depressive symptoms than 
an antidepressant  alone. 
5.2. Potential Risks and Benefits 
The apparent risks of SAGE -217 are based on clinical data reports of AE s in completed and 
ongoing studies and the known pharmacology of the drug. Sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were identified as adverse drug reactions. Most AEs were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible.  
SAGE -217 may present a treatment option for MDD that has more rapid onset of action (days 
instead of weeks/months), when compared to available pharmacotherapies. 
Based on nonclinical findings, embryo- fetal toxicity and withdrawal effects are considered 
important potential risk for SAGE -217. Risk mitigation measures in this study include 
monitoring for adverse effects, monitoring for potential withdrawal effects, requiring highly 
effective contraceptive measures for study participants, and inclusion of dose adjustment criteria 
and guidance for blinded IP discontinuation (Section 8.4). Finally, due to the sedation/somnolence observed, SAGE-217 is administered in the evening in this study. 
Given the outcome of the completed studies of SAGE -217 in participant s with MDD and PDD, 
the current significant unmet need for well- tolerated and rapid -acting depression treatments, and 
a favorable benefit -risk profile, further investigation of SAGE -217 as a novel rapid response 
treatment in adults with MDD is justified.  
5.3. Dose Justification  
Results from a large, multicenter study of SAGE -217 20 and 30 mg in MDD (217- MDD-301) 
support the need for higher steady- state concentrations of SAGE -217 to allow participants to 
experience maximum anti depressant  and anti- anxiety benefits. SAGE -217 will be administered 
as a 14 -day regimen of an evening dose of 50 mg with reduction to 40 mg as needed based on 
tolerability. The 50-mg dose of SAGE-217 is expected to exhibit a favorable benefit -risk profile 
in the context of results from previous SAGE -217 studies utilizing a 30-mg dose, now identified 
as a minimally effective dose. SAGE -217 is expected to maintain an acceptable tolerability 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 25  profile, based on a current safety database of over 2000 participants exposed across different 
doses/concentrations. 
Sertraline is a commercially available SSRI indicated for the treatment of MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders. Dosage and administration of sertraline as described in the approved US Prescribing Information (PI) recommends a starting dose of 50 mg per day in patients with 
MDD, with an incremental weekly increase in dose of 25 -50 mg per day, if there is an 
inadequate response to the starting dose, to a maximum dose of 200 mg per day. . In this study, a 
starting dose of 50 mg per day is recommended for 7 days, with a subsequent increase to 100 mg  
per day. 
Citalopram and escitalopram are  commercially available SSRIs that are both  indicated for acute 
and maintenance treatment  of MDD. E scitalopram is also indicated for treatment of generalized 
anxiety disorder. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI for citalopram is 20 mg/day and for 
escitalopram is 10 mg/ day, with maxima of 40 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively . In this 
study, a starting dose of 20 mg/day is recommended for citalopram and of 10 mg /day is 
recommended  for escitalopram for the first 14 days; subsequent dose increases may be  
considered, except for participants >60 years old taking citalopram. 
Duloxetine is a commercially available SNRI indicated for the treatment of MDD, generalized 
anxiety disorder, and pain disorders. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI is 40 to 
60 mg/day. The maximum dosage is 120 mg/day, although there is no evidence t hat dosages 
greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. In this study, a starting dose of 40 or 60 
mg/day is recommended  (divided as 20 or 30 mg, respectively,  twice daily for the first 7 days).  
Desvenlafaxine is a commercially available SNRI i ndicated for the treatment of MDD. The 
recommended dosage in the US PI is 50 mg/day. In this study, a dose of 5 0 mg/day is 
recommended . There has been no evidence that doses greater than 50 mg/day confer any 
additional benefit.

 28  7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo-controlled study in adults with 
MDD. The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial 
Version (SCID 5 -CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional.   
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14-day double- blind Treatment 
Period, and a 28-day ADT  Continuation Period. The Screening Period begins with the signing of 
the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. Preliminary screening procedures to 
determine eligibility includ e completion of the MGH -ATRQ and HAM -D. 
Participants will be randomized to receive blinded SAGE -217 or placebo for administration each 
evening from Day  1 through 14. In addition, all participants will receive 1 of 2 classes of ADTs: 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram) or a serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) in an open- label 
manner from Day 1 through the end of the study. The investigator will assign 1  of the 5 ADTs  
based on clinical standard of care; the participant must not have been previously treated with the assigned ADT  within the current depressive episode (and must not have been treated with 
citalopram if escitalopram is assigned, and vice versa) and must not haven taken any ADT within 
30 days prior to Day 1  (or taken fluoxetine within 60 days prior to Day 1). Randomization will 
be stratified by antidepressant  class (SSRI  or SNRI).  
The o pen-label ADT  will be administered as per label ed prescribing information.  
After the Double -blind Treatment Period, the ADT  will be continued each evening for the 
remainder of the study ( ADT  Continuation Period). During this period (Week 3 to 6), ADT  
dosing may be modified as appropriate per the label ed prescribing information an d based on 
individual response. 
Initiation of other antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact 
on efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of 
assessments at Day 42/end -of-study visi t. 
Participants will self -administer blinded investigational product (IP) once daily at approximately 
8 PM with fat-containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-containing snack), on an outpatient basis, for 14 days. The ADT  and SAGE -217 or placebo 
will be administered at the same time  during the Treatment Period ; participants assigned 
duloxetine will also administer ADT in the morning (for twice -daily dosing) as part of a divided 
dose for the first 7 days . Participants will return to the study center as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  
During the T reatment Period, participants will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability con cerns. Participants who cannot tolerate 
SAGE -217 or placebo 50 mg will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the Treatment Period. 
Participants who cannot tolerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40-mg dose may be discontinued from 
SAGE -217 or placebo at the discretion of the investigator. If blinded IP is discontinued, the ADT  
may be continued at the discretion of the investigator. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 29  Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter a 
long- term open -label  study of SAGE-217. Participants that do not enter the open- label study or 
that terminate the current study early may , per the investigator, receive a supply of the ADT  with 
instructions on how to taper the drug, if needed,  or, if they wish to continue the ADT , a bridge 
supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
It is estimated that approximately 424 participants will be randomized and treated to obta in 
382 evaluable participants at Day 3 (assuming 10% dropout rate). Additional participants may be 
randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 10%.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Participants will be assigned to blinded IP ( SAGE -217 or placebo) in accordance with the 
randomization schedule on Day 1. The investigator will assign 1 of the 5 ADTs  based on clinical 
standard of care. The assigned ADT for a participant cannot have been taken  previously by the 
participant  during the current depressive episode . Further, c italopram cannot be assigned if 
escitalopram has been taken during the current depressive episode, and vice versa.   
Randomization will be stratified by antidepressant class (SSRI  or SNRI). Additional details on 
randomization and blinding are provided in Section 9.5. 
Sage will monitor the ratio of SSRIs:SNRIs on an ongoing basis and may restrict assignment of 
any ADT(s) to reflect the ratio ex pected with standard of care (approximately 3:1; Luo 2020).  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
During the treatment period, participan ts will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participant s who cannot tolerate 50  mg (as 
determined by the investigator) will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the treatment period.  
At the discretion of the investigator, participant s who cannot tolerate the 40-mg dose at any time 
may be discontinued from dosing. These participants should be followed and complete assessments as per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
During Weeks 3 to 6, the ADT  dosing may be modified , based on individual response, per 
investigator discretion and per the label ed prescribing information. 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons, including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to participants, or for administrative reasons. In the event o f study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify their IRB, where required, and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating participants.

 33  8.3. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomized to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure information 
will be collected, including demography, screen failure deta ils, eligibility criteria, and any 
AE/serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened  once . 
8.4. Investigational Product Discontinuation and Early Termination from 
the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, 
behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
Based on known wi thdrawal symptoms with other GABAergic drugs and nonclinical findings in 
a 9-month study of SAGE- 217 in dogs (Investigator’s Brochure), there is a potential for 
withdrawal -related events, including seizure. The following guidelines for blinded IP 
discontinuation or dose reduction are presented to support participant safety: 
1. Any participant reporting a confirmed or suspected seizure at any time will be 
discontinued from blinded IP but will continue to be followed in the study. 
2. The investigator should monitor the course of CNS-based signs and symptoms suggestive 
of a seizure which are not accounted for by comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. 
Examples of reported serious or severe events which may reflect an oncoming and/or 
increased risk for seizure may  include temporary confusion, tremors, involuntary muscle 
fasciculations or jerking movements of arms or legs, or paresthesia. Should such 
symptoms occur, the investigator should consider decreasing the dose of SAGE-217 or 
placebo to 40 mg, stopping treatm ent to assess the effect on the symptom(s) 
(eg, resolution, improvement), or discontinuing the participant from treatment. A 
participant who discontinues treatment should remain in the study and continue protocol-
required assessments until the end of the study. 
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor  when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason. 
8.4.1.  Investigational Product Discontinuation  
The primary  reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study record 
and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Participants who discontinue treatment early should complete remaining study visits as scheduled through Day 42 (ie, relative to Day 1), unless the participant withd raws consent.   
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
If a participant decides to terminate the study, the participant should return for an early termination (ET) visit, if possible. The primary reason for early termination from the study  must 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 34  be documented in the participant’s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
Participants who terminate from the study early may, per the investigator, receive a supply of the 
ADT  with instructions on how to taper the drug , if needed, or, if they wish to continue the ADT , 
a bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider. 
8.4.3. Loss to Follow- up 
A participant will be deemed lost to follow- up after 3 attempts at contacting the participant have 
been unsuccessful.  
8.4.4. Replacement of Participants  
Participants will not be replaced.

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter an 
open-label, long- term s tudy of SAGE-217 in which additional treatment with SAGE -217 will be 
offered . Participants that do not enter the open- label study  or that terminate the current study 
early  may continue to receive ADT  as prescribed by the investigator either to taper the drug 
appropriately or—if the participan t wishes to continue ADT —to bridge the participant until he or 
she receives a new prescription.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
Investigational products will be self -administered by participants  (see Section  10.5 ). 
Administration of blinded and open- label IP will be monitored by a medication adherence 
monitoring platform used on smartphones to confirm IP  ingestion. Participants will receive a 
reminder within a predefined time window to take IP  while using the application and will follow 
a series of prescribed  steps to confirm their ingestion of the medication. For visually confirmed 
IP ingestion, t he application will record the date and time of IP administration by dose level, as 
well as missed doses.  
In addition, participants will be instructed to bring their SAGE -217 or placebo dosing kit and 
ADT  to the site as outlined in Table  2, at which time the investigator or designee will be 
responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period. 
All participants should be reinstructed about the dosing requirements during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the reeducation must document the pr ocess in the 
participant source records.  

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 38  The investigator(s) will record any reasons for nonadherence in the source documents. 
9.5. Randomization and Blinding 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or matched placebo. 
Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation.  All participants 
will also receive an open- label ADT . Randomization will be performed centrally via an 
interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician. The allocation to blinded treatment (SAGE -217or placebo) will be 
based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly 
confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of 
the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the investigator via the IRT system only when the safety of a participant is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment 
received. Unless a participant is at immediate risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts 
to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study tr eatment administered to a participant. The 
responsibility to break the treatment code resides solely with the investigator. If the unblinding 
occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in 
the source records. 
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the partic ipant’s records and on the 
eCRF.

10.1.1. Blinded Investigational Products  
SAGE -217 is available as hard gelatin capsules containing a white to off-white powder. In 
addition to the specified amount of SAGE-217 Drug Substance, active SAGE-217 Capsules 
contain croscarmellose sodium, mannitol, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, colloidal silicon 
dioxide, and sodium stearyl fumarate as excipients. Capsules will be available in 20 -mg and 
30-mg dose strengths.  
Blinded placebo will be provided as hard gelatin capsules matched in appearance to SAGE-217. 
10.1.2. Open- label Investigational Product  
Sertraline , escitalopram, citalopram, duloxetine, and desvenlafaxine, packaged and labeled by 
the comm ercial manufacturer, will be supplied by a third-party vendor. Open -label IP  is to be 
stored and administered according to the package insert.  Open -label IP  during this study is for 
use only as directed in this protocol. 
10.2. Blinded Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling 
SAGE -217 and placebo will be provided to the clinic pharmacist and/or designated site staff 
responsible for dispensing the blinded IP  in appropriately labeled, participant- specific kits 
containing sealed unit doses. Each unit dose for 40-mg and 50-mg dose levels consists of 
2 capsules. Additional information regarding the packaging and labeling is provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Labels with all required information and conforming to all applicable FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices/Good Clinical Practices guidelines will be prepared by the sponsor for SAGE -217 and placebo. 
10.3. Blinded Investigational Product Storage  
SAGE -217 and placebo is to be stored at room temperature (59 to 86°F; 15 to 30°C), safely and 
separately from other drugs. 
10.4. Blinded Investigational Product Preparation  
Not applicable. 
10.5. Blinded and Open- label Investigational Product Administration  
Blinded IP and open- label ADT  are to be adm inistered orally at approximately 8  PM with fat-
containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-
containing snack). Examples of fat-containing snacks include nuts, peanut butter, avocado, eggs, 
and cheese.  Participant s assigned duloxetine will  also administer duloxetine in the morning (for 
twice -daily divided dosing) for the first 7 days (see Section 9.1).  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  If a participant misses a dose of blinded IP or open- label IP, the participant should skip that dose 
(ie, they should not take the dose in the morning) and take the next scheduled dose. 
10.6. Blinded Investigational Product Accountability, Handling, and 
Disposal  
Upon receipt of blinded IP  dosing kits, the investigator(s), or the responsible pharmacist or 
designee, will i nspect the  kits and complete and follow the instructions regarding receipt and 
storage in the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure and (where applicable) in the Pharmacy 
Manual. A copy of the shipping documentation will be kept in the study files. 
The designat ed site staff will dispense the participant- specific kits to participants at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table  2. Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening 
Visit to obtain a participant identification  (ID) number for each participant that has signed an 
informed consent form. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary 
participant -identifying information, including the participant ID number assigned at Screening, 
to randomize  the eligible participant into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the 
blinded IP to be dispensed to that participant. The medication ID number and the number of 
blinded capsules dispensed must be recorded.  
At the subsequent blinded IP -dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same participant ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID number for the blinded IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the participant at this visit must be 
recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The blinded IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee 
must keep a record of all blinded IP received, used and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutic s will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation. 
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
At the end of the study, a ny unused blinded IP will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of blinded IP will be 
documented. 
10.7. Blinded Investigational  Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfa ction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness or performance (applicable 
for approved marketed products) of a drug product after it is released for distribution.  
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall notify Sage within 24 hours by 
forwarding the product complaint information via the contact information provided in Table 1 . 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.

 42  11. EFFICACY AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at 
Day 3. Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform all HAM -D assessments for an 
individual participant. An assessment timeframe of past 7 days (1 week) will be used at 
Screening, and ‘Since Last Visit’ will be used for all other visits.  
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to r ate the severity of depression in participants who are 
already diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013 a ; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D 
comprises individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, 
hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased 
motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms  (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. 
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in H AM-D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response wi ll be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
11.1.2. Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  
The MADRS is a 10 -item diag nostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in participant s with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that is 
more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than 
the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008).  
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.  
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety (Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychol ogical distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM- A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores.

12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). 
12.1.1. Demographic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status, highest education 
level, marital/civil status) and a full medical history, including: family psychiatric history, 
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, persistent 
depressive disorder, postpartum depression, substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, MDD with seasonal pattern, MDD with psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, MDD 
with atypical features, schizophrenia; or schizoaffective disorder will be documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, the disease code 
associated with the diagnosis of  MDD based on the tenth  revision of the International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded. 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH ATRQ) will be used  to determine whether the participant  has treatment -resistant 
depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from 2 different classes for at least 4  
weeks of treatment.  
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Height (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), a s well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Thereafter, abbreviated physical examinations will include brief assessments of general appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems, followed by a targeted physical examination as 
needed. Unscheduled, symptom-directed physical examinations may also be conducted at the 
investigator’s discretion.  Whenever possible, the same individual is to perform all phys ical 
examinations for a given participant . Unscheduled brief, symptom -driven physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the investigator ’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the investigator as abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as 
AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1. 
12.1.4. COVID-19 Questions  
Information regarding diagnosis, isolation, and/or hospitalization due to COVID-19 will be 
documented as part of Medical History, AE collection , and prior/ concomitant 
medication/procedure collection  at Screening and throughout  the study.

 51  12.2.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE i s any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires in patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics. Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes their final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up.  
A pre scheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment wa s 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not wors en or progress, in the opinion of an 
investigator, between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP. 
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 52  Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spo ntaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may b e needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious. 
12.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to S age or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee within 24 hours of receipt on a follow- up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 53  SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by local law.  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.3. Pregnancy 
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which conception was likely to have occurred after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half- lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any pregnancy occur ring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants.  
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with  the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre-eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose 
Overdoses, regardless of presence of associated clinical manifestation(s) (eg, headache, abnormal laboratory value) will be considered an AE and recorded as such on the eCRF. Any 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 4 CONFIDENTIAL  
 54  clinical manifestation(s) of overdose must also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. In addition, 
all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage or designee within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose.

 56  13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the s afety sets. 
Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not 
summarize d as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical history will be listed by participant.  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data presentation methods where applicab le; participant listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Participants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary  and key secondary efficacy analysis is defined as follows:  
1) The treatment regimens for participants are: SAGE -217 + ADT and placebo + ADT 
for 14 days. 
2) The target population is adult participant s with a diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder and within a current depressive episode of severity HAM- D total score ≥24. 
3) The variable of interest is the change from baseline in HAM- D total score . 
4) The intercurrent events could be: 
a) The premature discontinuation of treatment for any reason . 
b) Certain medications including, but not limited to, new antidepressants (except for 
assigned ADT) or benzodiazepines are prohibited, or ADT discontinuation may occur during the study; however, the treatment policy strategy  dictates that the 
results following these prohibited medication use will not be manipulated but will rather be used ‘as is’ in analysis. Please note that the protocol does not specify any rescue process, hence there is no rescue medication.  
5) The population summary level is the model -based estimate of the difference between 
SAGE -217 + ADT and placebo + ADT  in change from baseline in HAM- D total 
score. 
a) The population summary level for the primary endpoint is the model- based 
estimate of the difference between SAGE -217 + ADT and placebo + ADT in 
change from baseline in HAM- D total score at Day 3.  
b) The population summary level for the key secondary endpoint is the model- based 
estimate of the difference between SAGE -217 + ADT and placebo + ADT in 
change from baseli ne in HAM -D total score over the blinded treatment period 
using equal weight to Days 3, 8, 12 and 15. 
Using the FAS, t his will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, assessment time point, 
and time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline time points will be included in the model. The main comparison

14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site per Sage SOPs to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilitie s of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case r eport forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relev ant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or independent ethics committee. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an Independent Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform 
an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data verification. The purpose of a Sage 
Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelines, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency or IRB/ IEC about an 
inspection.

 23  5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease 
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United States, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs, 
and suicide- related costs, w as estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015).  As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second 
leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt ha s 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder (26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
The Diagnostic and Statistic al Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5, American 
Psychiatric Association 2013)  provides diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). 
These include at least 5 of 9 depressive symptoms (depressed mood and/or loss of interest or 
pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy 
level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability, and suicidality) during the same 2- week period that 
represents a change from previous functioning (DSM- 5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SNRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), and other compounds that 
affect monoaminergic neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the 
major classes of antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have demonstrated their limited efficacy, including low remis sion rates and untreated symptoms 
(Trivedi 2006; Conradi 2011; Romera 2013) . Furthermore, these agents can take 4 to 8 weeks to 
demonstrate full clinical efficacy (Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006), and in the case of the most commonly prescribed classes—SSRIs and SNRIs —common side effects including weight gain, 
GI symptoms, and sexual dysfunction can prevent titration into an adequate therapeutic range (Sadock and Sadock 2007). 
In the largest study to assess the effectiveness of depression treatments in patients wi th MDD, 
time to patient remission after treatment was 5.4 to 7.4 weeks; approximately one- half of the 
patients who ultimately remitted did so after 6 weeks, and 40% of those who achieved remission 
required 8 or more weeks to do so ( Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006) . Even following remission, many 
patients report the presence of residual symptoms, often related to decreased positive affect, such as loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable, fatigue, loss of energy, as well as sleep and appetite/weight disturbances ( Nierenberg 2009; Nierenberg 2015) . Thus, patients may 
remain symptomatic for up to 2 months while waiting for current standard-of- care 
pharmacotherapy to take full effect. They may also have to contend with undesirable side effects and residual symptoms. These aspects underscore the need for newer, rapid- acting therapies.  
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA
A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studi es in mice and 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was highly selective for GABA
A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo. 
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with SAGE -217 (overall) were sedation, 
somnolence, and dizziness; most adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity. Refer to the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of the 
chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of SAGE-217. 
This study was designed to target the unmet need of symptom improvement during the latency to 
SSRI and SNR I efficacy in the acute phase of a major depressive episode. This study will assess 
the safety and efficacy of SAGE -217 50 mg plus an antidepressant , examining if SAGE-217 plus 
an antidepressant  produces more rapid or more profound reduction in depressive symptoms than 
an antidepressant  alone.  
5.2. Potential Risks and Benefits 
The apparent risks of SAGE-217 are based on clinical data reports of AE s in completed and 
ongoing studies and the known pharmacology of the drug. Sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were i dentified as adverse drug reactions. Most AEs were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible. 
SAGE -217 may present a treatment option for MDD that has more rapid onset of action (days 
instead of weeks/months), when compared to available phar macotherapies.  
Based on nonclinical findings, embryo-fetal toxicity and withdrawal effects are considered 
important potential risk for SAGE -217. Risk mitigation measures in this study include 
monitoring for adverse effects, monitoring for potential withdrawal effects, requiring highly 
effective contraceptive measures for study participants, and inclusion of dose adjustment criteria 
and guidance for blinded IP discontinuation (Section 8.4) . Finally, due to the 
sedation/somnolence observed, SAGE-217 is administered in the evening in this study. 
Given the outcome of the completed studies of SAGE-217 in participant s with MDD and PDD, 
the current significant unmet need for well- tolerated and rapid -acting depression treatments, and 
a favorable benefit -risk profile, further investigation of SAGE-217 as a novel rapid response 
treatment in adults with MDD is justified.  
5.3. Dose Justification  
Results from a large, multicenter study of SAGE-217 20 and 30 mg in MDD (217- MDD -301) 
support the need for higher steady- state concentrations of SAGE -217 to allow participants to 
experience maximum antidepressant  and anti -anxiety benefits. SAGE-217 will be administered 
as a 14 -day regimen of an evening dose of 50 mg with reduction to 40 mg as needed based on 
tolerability. The 50-mg dose of SAGE-217 is expected to exhibit a favorable benefit -risk profile 
in the context of results from previous SAGE-217 studies utilizing a 30-mg dose, now identified 
as a minimally effective dose. SAGE -217 is expected to maintain an acceptable tolerability

 25  profile, based on a current safety database of over 2000 participants exposed across different 
doses/concentrations. 
Sertraline is a commercially available SSRI indicated for the treatment of MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders. Dosage and administration of sertraline as described in the approved US 
Prescribing Information (PI) recommends a starting dose of 50 mg per day in patients with 
MDD, with an incremental weekly increase in dose of 25-50 mg per day, if there is an inadequate response to the starting dose, to a maximum dose of 200 mg per day. . In this study, a 
starting dose of 50 mg per day is recommended for 7 days, with a subsequent increase to 100  mg 
per day . 
Citalopram and escitalopram are commercially available SSRIs that are both  indicated for acute 
and maintenance treatment of MDD. E scitalopram is also indicated for treatment of generalized 
anxiety disorder. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI for citalopram is 20 mg/day and for 
escitalopram is 10 mg/day, with maxima of 40 mg/day and 20 mg/ day, respectively . In this 
study, a starting dose of 20 mg/day is recommended for citalopram and of 10 mg /day is 
recommended  for escitalopram for the first 14 days; subsequent dose increases may be 
considered, except for participants >60 years old taking citalopram. 
Duloxeti ne is a commercially available SNRI indicated for the treatment of MDD, generalized 
anxiety disorder, and pain disorders. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI is 40 to 
60 mg/day. The maximum dosage is 120 mg/day, although there is no evidence that dosa ges 
greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. In this study, a starting dose of 40 or 60 mg/day is recommended (divided as 20 or 30 mg, respectively,  twice daily for the first 7 days).  
Desvenlafaxine is a commercially available SNRI indicated  for the treatment of MDD. The 
recommended dosage in the US PI is 50 mg/day. In this study, a dose of 50 mg/day is recommended . There has been no evidence that doses greater than 50 mg/day confer any 
additional benefit.

7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- controlled study in adults with 
MDD. The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial 
Version (SCID 5 -CT) performed by a qualified hea lthcare professional.   
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14-day double- blind Treatment 
Period, and a 28- day ADT  Continuation Period. The Screening Period begins with the signing of 
the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. Preliminary screening procedures to 
determine eligibility includ e completion of the MGH- ATRQ and HAM -D. 
Participants will be randomized to receive blinded SAGE -217 or placebo for administration each 
evening from Day  1 through 14. In addition, all participants will receive 1 of 2 classes of ADTs: 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline, escitalopram , citalopram ) or a  
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) in an open- label 
manner from Day 1 through the end of the study. The investigator will assign 1  of the 5 ADTs  
based on clinical standard of care; the participant must not have been previously treated with the 
assigned ADT  within the current depressive episode (and must not have been treated with 
citalopram if escitalopram is assigned , and vice versa) and must not haven taken any ADT within 
30 days prior to Day 1 (or taken fluoxetine within 60 days prior to Day 1). Randomization will 
be stratified by antidepressant class  (SSRI  or SNRI).  
The open -label ADT  will be administered as per labeled  prescribing information. 
After the Double-blind Treatment Period, the ADT  will be continued each evening for the 
remainder of the study ( ADT  Continuation Period). During this period (Week 3 to 6), ADT  
dosing may be modified as appropriate per the labeled  prescribing information and  based on 
individual response. 
Initiation of other antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact 
on efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of 
assessments at Day 42/end -of-study visit. 
Participants will self -administer blinded investigational product (IP) once daily at approximately 
8 PM with fat-containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-containing snack), on an outpatient basis, for 14 days. The ADT  and SAGE -217 or placebo  
will be administered at the same time  during the Treatment Period; participants assigned 
duloxetine will also administer ADT in the morning (for twice -daily dosing) as part of a divided 
dose for the first 7 days . Particip ants will return to the study center as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  
During the T reatment Period, participants will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose- limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants who cannot tolerate 
SAGE -217 or placebo 50 mg will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the T reatment Period. 
Participants who cannot tolerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40-mg dose may be discontinued from 
SAGE -217 or placebo  at the discretion of the investigator. If blinded IP is discontinued, the ADT  
may be continued at the discretion of the investigator . 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 29  Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter a 
long- term open- label  study of SAGE-217. Participants that do not enter the open-label study or 
that terminate the current study early may, per the investigator, receive a supply of the ADT  with 
instructions on how to taper the drug, if needed,  or, if they wish to continue the ADT , a bridge 
supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider. 
7.2. Number of Participants  
It is estimated that approximately 424 participants will be randomized and treated to obtain 
382 evaluable participants at Day 15 (assuming 10% dropout rate). Additional participants may be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 10%. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be assigned to blinded IP ( SAGE -217 or placebo) in accordance with the 
randomization schedule on Day 1. The investigator will assign 1 of the 5 ADTs  based on clinical 
standard of care. The assigned ADT for a participant cannot have been taken  previously by the 
participant  during the current depressive episode . Further, citalopram cannot be assigned if 
escitalopram has been tak en during the current depressive episode, and vice versa.  
Randomization will be stratified by antidepressant class (SSRI  or SNRI). Additional details on 
randomization and blinding are provided in Section 9.5. 
Sage will monitor the ratio of SSRIs:SNRIs on an ongoing basis and may restrict assignment of 
any ADT(s) to reflect the ratio expected with standard of care (approximately 3:1; Luo 2020).  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
During the treatment period, participan ts will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose- limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participant s who cannot tolerate 50 mg (as 
determined by the investigator) will receive 40 mg for the remainder of the treatment period.  
At the discretion of the investigator, participant s who cannot tolerate the 40-mg dose at any time 
may be discontinued from dosing. These participant s should be followed and complete 
assessments as per th e Schedule of Assessments (Table 2).  
During Weeks 3 to 6, the ADT  dosing may be modified , based on individual response, per 
investigator discretion and  per the labeled  prescribing information. 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons , including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participants, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics will provide written notification to the investigator . Investigational site s must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required, and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating participants.

 33  8.3. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomized to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure information 
will be collected, including demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any AE/serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may  be 
rescreened  once. 
8.4. Investigational Product Discontinuation and Early Termination from 
the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
Based on known withdrawal symptoms with other GABAergic drugs and nonclinical findings in 
a 9-month study of SAGE-217 in dogs (Investigator’s Brochure), there is a potential for 
withdrawal -related events, including seizure. The following guidelines for blinded IP 
discontinuation or dose reduction are presented to support participant safety: 
1. Any participant reporting a confirmed or suspected seizure at any time will be discontinued from blinded IP but will continue to be followed in the study. 
2. The investigator should monitor the course of CNS-based signs and symptoms suggestive of a seizure wh ich are not accounted for by comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. 
Examples of reported serious or severe events which may reflect an oncoming and/or increased risk for seizure may include temporary confusion, tremors, involuntary muscle fasciculatio ns or jerking movements of arms or legs, or paresthesia. Should such 
symptoms occur, the investigator should consider decreasing the dose of SAGE-217 or placebo to 40 mg, stopping treatment to assess the effect on the symptom(s) (eg, resolution, improvement), or discontinuing the participant from treatment. A 
participant who discontinues treatment should remain in the study and continue protocol-required assessments until the end of the study. 
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor  when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason. 
8.4.1.  Investigational Product Discontinuation  
The primary  reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study record 
and recorded in the participant’s elect ronic case report form (eCRF).  
Participants who discontinue treatment early should complete remaining study visits as scheduled through Day 42 (ie, relative to Day 1), unless the participant withdraws consent.  
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
If a partici pant decides to terminate the study, the participant should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit, if possible. The primary reason for early termination from the study  must 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 34  be documented in the participant’s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the stud y, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator  must document this in the site study records. 
Participants who terminate from the study early may, per the investigator, receive a supply of the 
ADT  with instructio ns on how to taper the drug, if needed, or, if they wish to continue the ADT , 
a bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider. 
8.4.3. Loss to Follow- up 
A participant will be deemed lost to follow -up after 3 attempts at contacting the participant have 
been unsuccessful.  
8.4.4. Replacement of Participants  
Participants will not be replaced.

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter an 
open-label, long-term study of SAGE-217 in which additional treatment with SAGE -217 will be 
offered . Participants that do not enter the open- label study  or that terminate the current study 
early  may continue to receive ADT  as prescribed by the investigator either to taper the drug 
appropriately or—if the participan t wishes to continue ADT —to bridge the participant until he or 
she receives a new prescription.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
Investigational products will be self -administered by participants (see Section  10.5) . 
Administration of blinded and open- label IP will be monitored by a medication adherence 
monitoring platform used on smartphones to confirm IP  ingestion. Participants will receive a 
reminder within a predefined time window to take IP while using the application and  will follow 
a series of prescribed steps to confirm their ingestion of the medication. For visually confirmed 
IP ingestion, the application will record the d ate and time of IP administration by dose level, as 
well as missed doses.  
In addition, participants will be instructed to bring their SAGE -217 or placebo dosing kit and 
ADT  to the site as outlined in  Table 2,  at which time the investigator or designee will be 
responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period. 
All participants should be reinstructed about the dosing requirements during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the reeducation must document the process in the 
participant source records.  

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 38  The investigator(s) will record any reasons for nonadherence in the source documents. 
9.5. Randomi zation and Blinding  
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or matched placebo. 
Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation.  All participants 
will also receive an open- label ADT . Randomization will be performed centrally via an 
interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician. The allocation to blinded treatm ent (SAGE -217or placebo) will be 
based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly 
confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of 
the study will be broken after the d atabase has been locked.  
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken by the investigator via the IRT system only when the 
safety of a participant is at risk and the treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment 
received. Unless a participant is at immediate risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts 
to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study treatment administered to a participant. The 
responsibility to break the treatment code resides solely with the investigator. If the unblinding 
occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours of breaking 
the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the eCRF.

Blinded IP and open- label ADT  are to be administered orally at approximately 8 PM with fat-
containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-containing snack). Examples of fat-containing snacks include nuts, peanut butter, avocado, eggs, and cheese.  Participants assigned duloxetine will also administer duloxetine in the morning (for 
twice -daily divided dosing) for the first 7 days (see Section 9.1).  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  If a participant misses a dose  of blinded IP or open- label IP, the participant should skip that dose 
(ie, they should not take the dose in the morning) and take the next scheduled dose. 
10.6. Blinded Investigational Product Accountability, Handling, and 
Disposal  
Upon receipt of blinded IP  dosing kits, the investigator (s), or the responsible pharmacist or 
designee, will inspect the kits  and complete and follow the instructions regarding receipt and 
storage in the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure and (where applicable) in the Pharmacy 
Manual. A copy of the shipping documenta tion will be kept in the study files.  
The designated site staff will dispense the participant -specific kits to participants  at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table 2. Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening 
Visit to obtain a participant  identification  (ID) number for each participant that has signed an 
informed consent form. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary 
participant -identifying information, including the participant ID number assigned at Screening, 
to randomize the eligible participant into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the 
blinded IP  to be dispensed to that participant . The medication ID number and the number of 
blinded capsules dispensed must be recorded. 
At the subsequent blinded IP -dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same participant ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID 
number for the blinded IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of 
capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the participant at this visit must be 
recorded. 
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The blinded IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee 
must keep a record  of all blinded IP received, used and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation. 
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
At the end of the study, any unused blinded IP will be returned t o Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of blinded IP will be 
documented. 
10.7. Blinded I nvestigational Product Complaints

 42  11. EFFICACY AND  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments 
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 
The primary outcome me asure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individual participant. An assessment timeframe of past 7 day s 
(1 week) will be used at Screening, and ‘Since Last Visit’ will be used for all other visits.  
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in participants who are 
already diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013  a; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D 
comprises individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, 
hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and 
activities, retardation (slowness of thought and spe ech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased 
motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. 
The HAM -D total score will be calcul ated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores. 
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM- D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale s cores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission  
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
11.1.2. Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale 
The MADRS is a 10 -item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in participant s with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that is  
more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and other forms of treatment than 
the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ran ges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.  
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale 
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d) . Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM-A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM- A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores.

level, marital/civil status) and a full medical history, including: family psychiatric his tory, 
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, persistent 
depressive disorder, postpartum depression, substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, MDD 
with seasonal pattern, MDD with psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, MDD 
with atypical features, schizophrenia; or schizoaffective disorder will be documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID-5- CT. If available, the disease code 
associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the tenth  revision of the Inte rnational Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded. 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH  ATRQ) will be used to determine whether the participant  has treatment -resistant 
depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major 
depressive episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from 2 different classes for at least 4 weeks of treatment.  
12.1.2. Weight and Height 
Heigh t (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination 
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examinations and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Thereafter, abbreviated physical examinations will include brief assessments of general appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems, followed by a targeted physical examination as 
needed. Unscheduled, symptom-directed physical examinations may also be conducted at the investigator’s discretion. Whenever possible, the same individual is to perform all physical 
examinations for a given participant . Unscheduled brief, symptom-driven physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the investigator’s discretion. 
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the investigator  as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, clinically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1. 
12.1.4. COVID-19 Questions  
Information regarding diagnosis, isolation, and/or hospitalization due to COVID-19 will be documented as part of Medical History, AE collection , and prior/ concomitant 
medication/procedure collection  at Screening and throughout the study.

 51  12.2.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE i s any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the participant or may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics. Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes their final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up. 
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s consent to participate in the study. 
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an investigator, between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the time of the procedure or treat ment.  
12.2.3. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE  (not related, 
related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs and SAEs to the IP. 
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the ev ent has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely alternative explanation for the AE  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 52  Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE 
12.2.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spontaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and rep ort the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early from the study. 
Intensity will be a ssessed according to the following scale: 
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s) 
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may be needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms caus e incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Seve rity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section 12.2.2. A n AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious. 
12.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to Sage or designee. 
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow-up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file. 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 53  SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)  that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by local law. 
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion. 
12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which conception was likely to have occurred after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any pregnancy occurring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the pregnancy. The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified for pregnant participants. 
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, rega rdless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre-eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the inves tigator  should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE. 
12.4. Overdose  
Overdoses, regardless of presence of associated clinical manifestation(s) (eg, headache, 
abnormal laboratory value) will be considered an AE and recorded as such on the eCRF. Any 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 54  clinical manifestation(s) of overdose must also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. In addition, 
all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage or designee within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose.

217-MDD-305 Version 3 CONFIDENTIAL  
 56  13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline characteristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the s afety sets. 
Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Medical history will be listed by participant.  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; participant  listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Participants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment. 
The estimand for the primary  efficacy analysis is defined as follows:  
1) The treatment regimens for participants are: SA GE-217 + assigned ADT and placebo 
+ assigned ADT for 14 days. 
2) The target population is adult participant s with a diagnosis of major depressive 
disorder and within a current depressive episode of severity (HAM- D total score 
>=24).  
3) The variable of interest is the change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day  15. 
4) The intercurrent events could be: 
a. The premature discontinuation of treatment for any reason, thus not having a Day 15 HAM -D total score available. This will be dealt with by a sensitivity analysis using 
multiple imputation technique s as described below.  
b. Certain medications including, but not limited to, new antidepressants (except for assigned ADT) or benzodiazepines are prohibited during the study; however, the treatment policy strategy dictates th at the results following these prohibited 
medication use will not be manipulated but will rather be used ‘as is’ in analysis. Please note that the protocol does not specify any rescue process, hence there is no rescue medication.  
5) The population summary level deals with the difference between SAGE -217 + 
assigned  ADT and placebo + assigned ADT  treatments in mean change from baseline 
in HAM -D total score at Day 15.  
Using the FAS, this will be analyzed using a mixed- effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); t he model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, assessment time point, 
and time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline time points will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between SAGE -217 + assigned ADT and placebo  + assigned ADT at the Day 15 time 
point. Model-based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence intervals, and 
p values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -participant  errors. The Toeplitz compound symmetry, Autoregressive (1) 
[AR(1)] covariance structure will be used in that sequence if there is a convergence issue with

 60  14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS 
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investig ational study site per Sage SOPs to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives. 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator. 
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following: 
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s) 
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct a ccess to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded  to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or independent ethics committee . 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs information or advice. 
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a regulatory authority, or an Independent Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform 
an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data verification. The purpose of a Sage 
Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were record ed, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, 
GCP/ICH GCP guidelines, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact Sage Therapeutics immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency or IRB/ IEC about an 
inspection.

 23  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical  Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people. 
In the United States, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs, 
and suicide- related costs, w as estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015 ). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 people die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15- to 29- year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt ha s 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017).  
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5, American 
Psychiatric Association 2013) provides diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). These include at least 5 of 9 depressive symptoms (depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy 
level, feelings of guilt, concentration ability, and suicidality) during the same 2 -week period that 
represents a change from previous functioning (DSM -5). 
Antidepress ants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin uptake inhibitors (SNRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), 
tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), and other compounds that affect monoaminergic neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the 
major classes of antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have 
demonstrated their limited efficacy, including low remission rates and untreated symptoms 
(Trivedi 2006; Conradi 2011; Romera 2013). Furthermore, these agents can take 4 to 8 weeks to 
demonstrate full clinical efficacy (Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006), and in the case of the most commonly prescribed classes—SSRIs and SNRIs —common side effects including weight gain, 
GI symptoms, and sexual dysfunction can prevent titration into an adequate therapeutic range 
(Sadock and Sadock 2007). 
In the largest study to assess the effectiveness of depression treatments in patients with MD D, 
time to patient remission after treatment was 5.4 to 7.4 weeks; approximately one- half of the 
patients who ultimately remitted did so after 6 weeks, and 40% of those who achieved remission 
required 8 or more weeks to do so ( Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006 ). Eve n following remission, many 
patients report the presence of residual symptoms, often related to decreased positive affect, such 
as loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable, fatigue, loss of energy, as well as sleep 
and appetite/weight disturbances ( Nierenberg 2009; Nierenberg 2015). Thus, patients may 
remain symptomatic for up to 2 months while waiting for current standard -of-care 
pharmacotherapy to take full effect. They may also have to contend with undesirable side effects and residual sy mptoms. These aspects underscore the need for newer, rapid- acting therapies.  
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA
A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood brain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE-217 was highly selective 
for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo.  
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) associated with SAGE -217 (overall) were sedation, 
somnolence, and dizziness; most adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity. Refer to the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of the 
chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of SAGE-217. 
This study was designed to target the unmet need of symptom improvement during the latency to 
SSRI and SNRI efficacy in the acute phase of a major depressive episode. This study will assess 
the safety and efficacy of SAGE -217 50 mg plus an antidepres sant, examining if SAGE-217 plus 
an antidepressant  produces more rapid or more profound reduction in depressive symptoms than 
an antidepressant  alone. 
5.2. Potential Risks and Benefits 
The apparent risks of SAGE -217 are based on clinical data reports of AE s in completed and 
ongoing studies and the known pharmacology of the drug. Sedation, somnolence, and dizziness were identified as adverse drug reactions. Most AEs were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible.  
SAGE -217 may present a treatment option for MDD that has more rapid onset of action (days 
instead of weeks/months), when compared to available pharmacotherapies. 
Based on nonclinical findings, embryo- fetal toxicity and withdrawal effects are considered 
important potential risk for SAGE -217. Risk mitigation measures in this study include 
monitoring for adverse effects, monitoring for potential withdrawal effects, requiring highly 
effective contraceptive measures for study participants, and inclusion of dose adjustment criteria 
and guidance for blinded IP discontinuation (Section 8.4). Finally, due to the sedation/somnolence observed, SAGE-217 is administered in the evening in this study. 
Given the outcome of the completed studies of SAGE -217 in participant s with MDD and PDD, 
the current significant unmet need for well- tolerated and rapid -acting depression treatments, and 
a favorable benefit -risk profile, further investigation of SAGE -217 as a novel rapid response 
treatment in adults with MDD is justified.  
5.3. Dose Justification  
Results from a large, multicenter study of SAGE -217 20 and 30 mg in MDD (217- MDD-301) 
support the need for higher steady- state concentrations of SAGE -217 to allow participants to 
experience maximum anti depressant  and anti- anxiety benefits. SAGE -217 will be administered 
as a 14 -day regimen of an evening dose of 50 mg with reduction to 40 mg as needed based on 
tolerability. The 50-mg dose of SAGE-217 is expected to exhibit a favorable benefit -risk profile 
in the context of results from previous SAGE -217 studies utilizing a 30-mg dose, now identified 
as a minimally effective dose. SAGE -217 is expected to maintain an acceptable tolerability

 25  profile, based on a current safety database of over 2000 participants exposed across different 
doses/concentrations. 
Sertraline is a commercially available SSRI indicated for the treatment of MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders. Dosage and administration of sertraline as described in the approved US Prescribing Information (PI) recommends a starting dose of 50 mg per day in patients with 
MDD, with an incremental weekly increase in dose of 25 -50 mg per day, if there is an 
inadequate response to the starting dose, to a maximum dose of 200 mg per day. . In this study, a 
starting dose of 50 mg per day is recommended for 7 days, with a subsequent increase to 100 mg  
per day. 
Citalopram and escitalopram are  commercially available SSRIs that are both  indicated for acute 
and maintenance treatment  of MDD. E scitalopram is also indicated for treatment of generalized 
anxiety disorder. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI for citalopram is 20 mg/day and for 
escitalopram is 10 mg/ day, with maxima of 40 mg/day and 20 mg/day, respectively . In this 
study, a starting dose of 20 mg/day is recommended for citalopram and of 10 mg /day is 
recommended  for escitalopram for the first 14 days; subsequent dose increases may be  
considered, except for participants >60 years old taking citalopram. 
Duloxetine is a commercially available SNRI indicated for the treatment of MDD, generalized 
anxiety disorder, and pain disorders. The starting dosage for MDD in the US PI is 40 to 
60 mg/day. The maximum dosage is 120 mg/day, although there is no evidence t hat dosages 
greater than 60 mg/day confer any additional benefits. In this study, a starting dose of 60 mg/day 
is recommended  (divided as 30 mg twice daily for the first 7 days).  
Desvenlafaxine is a commercially available SNRI indicated for the treatment of MDD. The 
recommended dosage in the US PI is 50 mg/day. In this study, a dose of 5 0 mg/day is 
recommended . There has been no evidence that doses greater than 50 mg/day confer any 
additional benefit.

 28  7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a randomized, double- blind, parallel -group, placebo-controlled study in adults with 
MDD. The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial 
Version (SCID 5 -CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional.   
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14-day double- blind Treatment 
Period, and a 28-day ADT  Continuation Period. The Screening Period begins with the signing of 
the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. Preliminary screening procedures to 
determine eligibility includ e completion of the MGH -ATRQ and HAM -D. 
Participants will be randomized to receive blinded SAGE -217 or placebo for administration each 
evening from Day  1 through 14. In addition, all participants will receive 1 of 2 classes of ADTs: 
a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; sertraline, escitalopram, citalopram) or a serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI; duloxetine, desvenlafaxine) in an open- label 
manner from Day  1 through the end of the study. The investigator will assign 1  of the 5 ADTs  
based on clinical standard of care; the participant must not have been previously treated with the assigned ADT  within the current depressive episode (and must not have been treated with 
citalopram if escitalopram is assigned, and vice versa) and must not haven taken any ADT within 
30 days prior to Day 1  (or taken fluoxetine within 60 days prior to Day 1). Randomization will 
be stratified by antidepressant  class (SSRI  or SNRI).  
The o pen-label ADT  will be administered as per label ed prescribing information.  
After the Double -blind Treatment Period, the ADT  will be continued each evening for the 
remainder of the study ( ADT  Continuation Period). During this period (Week 3 to 6), ADT  
dosing may be modified as appropriate per the label ed prescribing information and based on 
individual response,. 
Initiation of other antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact 
on efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of 
assessments at Day 42/end -of-study visit.  
Participants will self -administer blinded investigational product (IP) once daily at approximately 
8 PM with fat-containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with 
a fat-containing snack), on an outpatient basis, for 14 days. The ADT  and SAGE -217 or placebo 
will be administered at the same time  during the Treatment Period ; participants assigned 
duloxetine will also administer ADT in the morning (for twice -daily dosing) as part of a divided 
dose for the first 7 days . Participants will return to the study center as outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments.  
During the T reatment Period, participants will be able to receive SAG E-217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants who cannot tolerate 
SAGE -217 or placebo 50 mg will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the Treatment Period. 
Participants who cannot tolerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40-mg dose may be discontinued from 
SAGE -217 or placebo at the discretion of the investigator. If blinded IP is discontinued, the ADT  
may be continued at the discretion of the investigator.

217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 29  Upon completion of the current study, eligible pa rticipants  will have the opportunity to enter a 
long- term open -label  study of SAGE-217. Participants that do not enter the open- label study or 
that terminate the current study early may , per the investigator, receive a supply of the ADT  with 
instructions o n how to taper the drug, if needed,  or, if they wish to continue the ADT , a bridge 
supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
It is estimated that approximately 424 participants will be randomized and treated to obtain 
382 evaluable participants at Day 15 (assuming 10% dropout rate). Additional participants may 
be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 10%. 
7.3. Treatment Assignment 
Participants will be assigned to blinded IP ( SAGE -217 or placebo) in accordance with the 
randomization schedule on Day 1. The investigator will assign 1 of the 5 ADTs  based on clinical 
standard of care. The assigned ADT for a participant cannot have been taken  previously by the 
participant  during the current depressive episode. F urther, citalopram cannot be assigned if 
escitalopram has been taken during the current depressive episode, and vice versa.   
Randomization will be stratified by antidepressant class (SSRI  or SNRI). Additional details on 
randomization and blinding are provided in Section 9.5. 
Sage will monitor the ratio of SSRIs:SNRIs on an ongoing basis and may restrict assignment of 
any ADT(s) to reflect the ratio expected with standard of care (approximately 3:1; Luo 2020).  
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
During the treatment period, participan ts will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participant s who cannot tolerate 50 mg (as 
determined by the investigator) will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the treatment period.  
At the discretion of the investigator, participant s who cannot tolerate the 40-mg dose at any time 
may be discontinued from dosing upon completion of an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible. These participant s should be followed and complete assessments as per the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). 
During Weeks 3 to 6, the ADT  dosing may be modified , based on individual response, per 
investigator discretion and per the label ed prescribing information. 
7.5. Criteria for Study Ter mination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety reasons, including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting unacceptable risk to 
participants, or for administrative reasons. In the event of s tudy termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator. Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required, and initiate withdrawal procedures for participating participants.

 33  8.3. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomized to study intervention. A minimal set of screen failure information 
will be collected, including demography, screen failure deta ils, eligibility criteria, and any 
AE/serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened  once . 
8.4. Investigational Product Discontinuation and Early Termination from 
the Study 
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, 
behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. 
Based on known withdr awal symptoms with other GABAergic drugs and nonclinical findings in 
a 9-month study of SAGE- 217 in dogs (Investigator’s Brochure), there is a potential for 
withdrawal -related events, including seizure. The following guidelines for blinded IP 
discontinuation or dose reduction are presented to support participant safety: 
1. Any participant reporting a confirmed or suspected seizure at any time will be 
discontinued from blinded IP but will continue to be followed in the study. 
2. The investigator should monitor the course of CNS-based signs and symptoms suggestive 
of a seizure wh ich are not accounted for by comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. 
Examples of reported serious or severe events which may reflect an oncoming and/or increased risk for seizure may include temporary confusion, tremors, involuntary muscle fasciculatio ns or jerking movements of arms or legs, or paresthesia. Should such 
symptoms occur, the investigator should consider decreasing the dose of SAGE-217 or placebo to 40 mg, stopping treatment to assess the effect on the symptom(s) (eg, resolution, improvement), or discontinuing the participant from treatment. A 
participant who discontinues treatment should remain in the study and continue protocol-
required assessments until the end of the study.  
The investigator must notify the sponsor and/or the medical moni tor when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason. 
8.4.1.  Investigational Product Discontinuation  
The primary  reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study record 
and recorded in the participant’s electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Participants who discontinue treatment early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up 
visits should take place as scheduled relativ e to the last dose of treatment (eg, if a participant’s 
last dose is on Day 13, their first follow -up visit, Visit 7, should occur 4 days later), and will 
continue safety and efficacy assessments as scheduled for 6 weeks following the final dose.  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 34  Participa nts that discontinue blinded IP early may, per the investigator, receive a supply of the 
ADT  with instructions on how to taper the drug , if needed, or, if they wish to continue the ADT , 
a bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider. 
8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
If a participant decides to terminate the study, the participant should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit, if possible. The primary reason for early termination from the study  must 
be documented in the participant’s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF). If a participant discontinues IP and terminates the study on the same day 
during a clinic visit, the EOT and ET visits can be on the same day; in this ca se, all EOT visit 
assessments should be conducted in addition to an abbreviated physical exam ination  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 
Participants who terminate from the study early may, per the investigator, receive a supply of the 
ADT  with instructions on how to taper the drug , if needed, or, if they wish to continue the ADT , 
a bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider. 
8.4.3. Loss to Follow- up 
A participant will be  deemed lost to follow- up after 3 attempts at contacting the participant have 
been unsuccessful.  
8.4.4. Replacement of Participants  
Participants will not be replaced.

Administration of blinded and open- label IP will be monitored by a medication adherence 
monitoring platform used on smartphones to confirm medication ingestion. Participants will 
receive a reminder within a predefined time window to take IP  while using the application and 
will follow a series of prescribed steps to confirm their ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time of IP  administration by dose level, as well as missed 
doses.  
In addition, participants will be instructed to bring their SAGE -217 or placebo dosing kit and 
ADT  to the site as outlined in Table  2, at which time the investigator or designee will be 
responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the duration of the treatment period. 
All participants should be reinstructed about the dosing requirements during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the reeducation must document the process in the 
participant source records.  
The investigator(s) will record any reasons for nonadherence in the source documents.

 38  9.5. Randomization and Blinding 
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or matched placebo. 
Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will be blinded to treatment allocation. All participants 
will also receive an open- label ADT . Randomization will be performed centrally via an 
interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician. The allocation to blinded treatment (SAGE -217or placebo) will be 
based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly 
confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of 
the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1. Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a partici pant is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant. Requests from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participants should be discussed with the Sage medical monitor. If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented in the sou rce records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information (including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the eCRF.

the commercial manufacturer, will be supplied by a third-party vendor. Open -label IP  is to be 
stored and administered according to the package insert.  Open -label IP  during this study is for 
use only as directed in this protocol. 
10.2. Blinded Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling 
SAGE -217 and placebo will be provided to the clinic pharmacist and/or designated site staff 
responsible for dispensing the blinded IP  in appropriately labeled, participant- specific kits 
containing sealed unit doses. Each unit dose for 40-mg and 50-mg dose levels consists of 2 capsules. Additional i nformation regarding the packaging and labeling is provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
Labels with all required information and conforming to all applicable FDA Code of Federal 
Regulations and Good Manufacturing Practices/Good Clinical Practices guidelines will be 
prepared by the sponsor for SAGE -217 and placebo. 
10.3. Blinded Investigational Product Storage  
SAGE -217 and placebo is to be stored at room temperature (59 to 86°F; 15 to 30°C), safely and 
separately from other drugs. 
10.4. Blinded Investigational Product Preparation  
Not applicable. 
10.5. Blinded and Open- label Investigational Product Administration  
Blinded IP and open- label sertraline are to be administered orally at approximately 8  PM with 
fat-containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat-
containing snack). Examples of fat-containing snacks include nuts, peanut butter, avocado, eggs, and cheese.  Participants assigned duloxetine will also administer duloxetine in the morning (for 
twice -daily divided dosing) for the first 7 days (see Section 9.1).  
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  If a participant misses a dose of blinded IP or open- label IP, the participant should skip that dose 
(ie, they should not take the dose in the morning) and take the next scheduled dose. 
10.6. Blinded Investigational Product Accountability, Handling, and 
Disposal  
Upon receipt of blinded IP  dosing kits, the investigator (s), or the responsible pharmacist or 
designee, will inspect the  kits and complete and follow the instructions regarding receipt and 
storage in the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure and (where applicable) in the Pharmacy 
Manual. A copy of the shipping documenta tion will be kept in the study files.  
The designated site staff will dispense the participant- specific kits to participants at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in Table  2. Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening 
Visit to obtain a participant identification  (ID) number for each participant that has signed an 
informed consent form. On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary 
participant -identifying information, including the participant ID number assigned at Screening, 
to randomize  the eligible participant into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the 
blinded IP to be dispensed to that participant. The medication ID number and the number of 
blinded capsules dispensed must be recorded.  
At the subsequent blinded IP -dispensing visit, the investigator or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same participant ID  number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID 
number for the blinded IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the participant at this visit must be 
recorded. 
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be notified immediately.  
The blinded IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee 
must keep a record  of all blinded IP received, used and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study supplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation. 
The investigator, pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
At the end of the study, a ny unused blinded IP will be returned t o Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of blinded IP will be 
documented. 
10.7. Blinded Investigational  Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfaction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness or performance (applicable 
for approved marketed products) of a drug product after it is released for distribution.  
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall notify Sage within 24 hours by 
forwarding the product complaint information via the contact information provided in Table 1.

 42  11. EFFICACY AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression  
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individual participant. An assessment timeframe of past 7 days 
(1 week) will be used at Screening, and ‘Since Last Visit’ will be used for al l other visits.  
The 17- item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in participants who are 
already diagnosed as depressed ( Williams 2013 a ; Williams 2013b ). The 17- item HAM -D 
comprises individual ratings related to the following symptoms: de pressed mood (sadness, 
hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work and activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased 
motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. 
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM- D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM- D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamil ton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM- D total score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM-D total score of ≤7. 
11.1.2. Montgomery- Åsberg Depressi on Rating Scale 
The MADRS is a 10 -item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in participant s with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM- D that is 
more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepr essants and other forms of treatment than 
the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008).  
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.  
11.1.3. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale  
The 14- item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety (Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (mental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mild severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM- A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores.

 46  12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). 
12.1.1. Demo graphic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status, highest education 
level, marital/civil status) and a full medical history, including: family psychiatric history, 
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, persistent 
depressive disorder, postpartum depression, substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, MDD with seasonal pattern, MDD with psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, MDD 
with atypical features, schizophrenia; or schizoaffective disorder will be documented. The diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, the disease code 
associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the tenth  revision of the Inte rnational Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded. 
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (MGH ATRQ) will be used to determine whether the participant  has tr eatment -resistant 
depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major depressive episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from 2 different classes for at least 4 
weeks of treatment.  
12.1.2. Weight and Height  
Heigh t (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented. 
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examina tions and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Thereafter, abbreviated physical examinations will include brief assessments of general appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems, followed by a targeted physical examination as 
needed. Unscheduled, symptom-directed physical examinations may also be conducted at the 
investigator’s discretion.  Whenever possible, the same individual is to perform all physical 
examinations for a given participant . Unscheduled brief, symptom -driven physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the investigator ’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the investigator as abnormal, not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, cli nically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1. 
12.1.4. COVID-19 Questions  
Information regarding diagnosis, isolation, and/or hospitalization due to COVID-19 will be 
documented as part of Medical History, AE collection , and prior/ concomitant 
medication/procedure collection  at Screening and throughout  the study.

 51  12.2.2. Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE i s any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death  
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires in patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Resul ts in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator may jeopardize the participant or may require medic al intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospitalization).  
All SAEs  that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form provided by Sage Therapeutics. Any SAE that is ongoing when the participant completes their final study visit, will be followed by the investigator until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely schedul ed treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following: 
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of an investigator , between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3. Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP. 
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 52  Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.4. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spo ntaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discontinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescription drug not ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; treatment for symptom(s) may b e needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2. An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious. 
12.2.5. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hours of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to S age or designee.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee within 24 hours of receipt on a follow- up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section of the eCRF and/or study file.  

Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 53  SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by local law.  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or de signee will 
unblind SUSARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs (in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fas hion. 
12.3. Pregnancy 
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collected for all pregnancies for which conception was likely to have occurred after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half- lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any pregnancy oc curring in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy. The investigator will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
administration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant partner directly, the investigator will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants.  
The participant or participant’s partner will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigat or will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow-up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delive ry date. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered w ith the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre-eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose 
Overdoses, regardless of presence of associated clinical manifestation(s) (eg, headache, abnormal laboratory value) will be considered an AE and recorded as such on the eCRF. Any 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 54  clinical manifestation(s) of overdose must also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. In addition, 
all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage or designee within 
24 hours of the site becoming aware of the overdose. 
Clinical Protocol Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD- 305 Version 2 CONFIDENTIAL  
 56  Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening r esults will be listed, but not 
summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medical history will be listed by participant.  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; participant listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Participants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM- D total 
score at Day 15. The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is defined as follows:  
• The target population is adult s with a diagnosis of MDD and within a current 
depressive episode of severity (HAM- D total score  ≥24). 
• The variable of interest is the change from baseline in HAM-D total score at Day 15. 
• The population summary level deals with the difference between  the treatments 
(SAGE -217 + an antidepressant  and pl acebo + an antidepressant ) in mean change 
from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 15. 
The intercurrent events could be: 
• The premature discontinuation of treatment for any reason, thus not having a Day 15 HAM -D total score available. This will be dealt wi th by a sensitivity analysis using 
multiple imputation techniques as described below. 
• Certain medications including, but not limited to new antidepressants (except as 
described in the protocol) or benzodiazepines are prohibited during the study; 
however, the treatment policy strategy dictates that if any of these prohibited 
medication s are used, the results will not be manipulated but will rather be used ‘as 
is’ in analysis. Please note that th e protocol does not specify any rescue process, 
hence there is no rescue medication.  
Using the FAS, t his will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures 
(MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, assessment tim e point, 
and time point-by- treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as 
fixed effects. All postbaseline time points will be included in the model. The main comparison 
will be between SAGE -217 + an antidepressant  and placebo + an antidepressant  at the Day 15 
time point. Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence intervals, and 
p values) will be reported where applicable. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -partici pant errors. The Toeplitz compound symmetry, Autoregressive (1) 
[AR(1)] covariance structure will be used in that sequence if there is a convergence issue with the unstructured covariance model. If convergence is still not achieved, no results will be reported . 
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score,  PHQ -9 total score, an d selected individual items 
and/or subscale scores in HAM- D.

 60  14. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
14.1. Study Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a participant into the study, a representative of Sage 
Therapeutics will visit the investigational study site per Sage SOPs to: 
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics an d 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acce ptable 
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison o f the data in the case report 
forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study. This will require direct access to all original records for each participant (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and re port any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics. 
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB or independent ethics committee. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice.  
14.2. Audits and Inspections  
Sage Therapeutics or authorized representatives of Sage Therapeutics, a r egulatory authority, or 
an Independent Ethics Committee or an Institutional Review Board may visit the site to perform 
an audit(s) or inspection(s), including source data verification. The purpose of a Sage 
Therapeutics audit or a regulatory authority inspection is to systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were 
conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP/ICH GCP guidelin es, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should 
contact Sage Therapeutics immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency or IRB/ IEC about an 
inspection.

Study Description:  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in adults with MDD. The 
diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial Version (SCID 5 -CT) 
performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  Participant s cannot have been  treated with sert raline 
in the current depressive episode . 
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14 -day double -blind Treatment Period, 
and a 28 -day sertraline Continuation Period. The Screening Period begins with the signing of the 
informed conse nt form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. Preliminary screening procedures to determine 
eligibility includ e completion of the  MGH -ATRQ and  HAM -D. 
Participants will be randomized to receive blinded SAGE -217 50 mg or placebo for administration 
each evening from  Days 1 through  14. In addition , all participants will receive open -label sertraline 
from Day 1 through the end of the study. Sertraline will be administered per label ed prescribing 
information, starting with 50  mg each evening during Week 1 and 100  mg each evening during 
Week  2. 
After the double -blind Treatment Period, sertraline will be continued each evening for the remainder of 
the study ( sertraline Continuation Period). During this period (Week s 3 to 6), sertra line dosing may be 
increased  based on individual response, at the discretion of the investigator  and per the label ed 
prescribing information in 50 -mg increments (up to 200  mg per day ). 
Initiation of other  antidepressants or any other medications that may p otentially have an impact on 
efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of assessments at 
Day 42/end -of-study visit.  
Participants will self -administer investigational product (IP) once daily at approximately 8 PM with 
fat-containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat -containing 
snack), on an outpatient basis, for 14 days. Sertral ine and SAGE -217/placebo  will be administered at 
the same time  during the Treatment Period . Participants will return to the study center as outlined in 
the Schedule of Assessments  (Table  2). 
During the Treatment Period, participants will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as there 
are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants who cannot tolerate SAGE -217/placebo 
50 mg will receiv e 40 mg for the remainder of the Treatment Period. Participants who , in the opinion 
of the investigator,  cannot tolerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40 -mg dose may be discontinued  from 
SAGE -217/placebo  at the discretion of the investigator . If blinded IP is discontinued, sertraline may be 
continued at the discretion of the investigator . 
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participant s will have the opportunity to enter a long -
term open -label study of SAGE -217.

prescribing information  and based on indivi dual response.  
Duration of Treatment: Blinded SAGE -217 or placebo will be administered once daily for 14 days; 
open -label sertraline will be administered according to labeled prescribing information for 42 days.  
Statistical Methods : 
Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock and treatment 
unblinding. Any deviations from or changes to the SAP following database lock will be detailed in the 
Clinical Study Report.  
General Considerations  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where applicable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be calculated at each 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries 
will include c ounts and percentages.  
Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of IP 
and who have a valid baseline as well as at least 1 postbaseline  HAM -D evaluation.  
The Safety Set is defined as all participants who receive at least 1 dose of IP.  
The Randomized Set, defined as all participants who are randomized.

Determination of Sample Size  
Using a two -sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 382 total evaluable participants would provide 
90% power to detect a treatment difference (between SAGE -217 + sertraline and placebo  + sertraline)  
of approximately 3  points in the primary endpoint, change from baseline in HAM -D total score at 
Day 15, assuming standard deviation of 9 points. Assuming a 10% drop out rate and a 1:1 
randomization ratio within each treatment group, approximately 424 total  randomized participants will 
be required to obtain a total of 382 evaluable participants. Evaluable participants are defined as those 
randomized participants who receive IP and have valid baseline and at least 1 post baseline  HAM -D 
assessment.  
Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The estimand for the primary analysis is the mean  change from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 
15. Using FAS, this will be analyzed using a mixed -effects  model for repeated measures (MMRM); the 
model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, assessment time point, and time point -by-
treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will be treated as fixed effects. All 
postbaseline tim e points will be included in the model. The main comparison will be between 
SAGE -217 + sertraline and placebo  + sertraline at the 15 -day time point. Model -based point estimates 
(ie, least squares means, 95% confidence intervals, and p  value s) will be repor ted where applicable. An 
unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -participant errors. The Toeplitz 
compound symmetry, Autoregressive (1) [AR(1)] covariance structure will be used in that sequence if 
there is a convergence issue wi th the unstructured covariance model. If convergence is still not 
achieved, no results will be reported.  
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for the 
analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM -D total score, MADRS total score, 
HAM -A total score, CGI -S score, and PHQ -9 total score.  
Generalized estimating equation methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D response (defined as 
≥50% reduction from basel ine in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D remission (defined as HAM -D total 
score of ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for center, treatment, baseline score, assessment time 
point, and time point -by-treatment as explanatory variables. The comparison of intere st will be the 
difference between SAGE -217 + sertraline and placebo  + sertraline at the 15 -day time point. Model -
based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% confidence intervals, and p  value s will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for the analys is of CGI -I response including terms for center, 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as explanatory 
variables.  
Safety Analysis  
Safety and tolerability of IP will be evaluated by adverse events  (AEs) /serious a dverse event  (SAE s), 
. 
 
 Safety data will be listed b y participant and summarized by treatment group. All safety 
summaries will be performed on the Safety Set.

a Participants wh o discontinue treatment early should return to the site for an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably t he day after treatment is discontinued. If 
necessary, the EOT and ET visits can be on the same day if a participant discontinues IP  and terminates the study on the same day during a clinic visit; in this case,  all EOT visit 
assessments should be conducted.  
b Participants will be asked to authorize that their unique participant identifiers be entered into a registry (www.subjectregi stry.com) with the intent of identifying participants who 
may meet exclusion criteria for participation in another clinical study.  
c A serum FSH test will be conducted at Screening for female participants that are not surgically sterile to confirm whether a female parti cipant with ≥12  months of spontaneous 
amenorrhea meets the protocol -defined criteria for being postmenopausal.  
d Participants will  be trained on use of software applications and devices necessary for the conduct of the study by site personnel.

 22  5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background of Major Depressive Disorder and Unmet Medical Need  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified depression as the leading cause of 
disability worldwide, and as a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease 
(http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/). Globally, depression has been estimated 
to affect over 300 million people.  
In the United States, the economic burden of depression, including workplace costs, direct costs, 
and suicide -related costs, was estimated to be $210.5 billion in 2010 ( Greenberg 2015 ). As per 
WHO statistics, over 800,000 pe ople die due to suicide every year, and suicide is the second 
leading cause of death in 15 - to 29 -year-olds. The rate of US adults making a suicide attempt has 
increased (0.62% from 2004 to 2005 to 0.79% from 2012 to 2013), with a shift to more attempts 
among younger adults (42% to 50%, respectively) and among those with a depressive disorder 
(26% to 54%, respectively; Olfson 2017 ). 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5, American 
Psychiatric Association 2013 ) provid es diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). 
These include at least 5 of 9 depressive symptoms (depressed mood and/or loss of interest or 
pleasure, and other changes affecting appetite or weight, sleep, psychomotor activity, energy 
level, fe elings of guilt, concentration ability, and suicidality) during the same 2 -week period that 
represents a change from previous functioning (DSM -5). 
Antidepressants are a mainstay of pharmacological treatment for depressive disorders. Selective 
serotonin upt ake inhibitors (SNRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), 
tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), and other compounds that 
affect monoaminergic neurotransmission, such as mirtrazapine and bupropion, represent the 
major classes of antidepressants. While antidepressants are widely used, large scale studies have 
demonstrated their limited efficacy, including low remission rates and untreated symptoms 
(Trivedi 2006; Conradi 2011 ; Romera 2013 ). Furthermore, these agents can take 4 to 8 weeks to 
demonstrate full clinical efficacy (Rush 2006; Trivedi 2006), and in the case of the most 
commonly prescribed classes —SSRIs and SNRIs —common side effects including weight gain, 
GI symptoms, and sexual dysfunction can prevent titrat ion into an adequate therapeutic range 
(Sadock and Sadock 2007).  
In the largest study to assess the effectiveness of depression treatments in patients with MDD, 
time to patient remission after treatment was 5.4 to 7.4 weeks; approximately one -half of the 
patients who ultimately remitted did so after 6 weeks, and 40% of those who achieved remission 
required 8 or more weeks to do so ( Rush 2006 ; Trivedi 2006 ). Even following remission, many 
patients report the presence of residual symptoms, often related to de creased positive affect, such 
as loss of interest in activities once considered enjoyable, fatigue, loss of energy, as well as sleep 
and appetite/weight disturbances ( Nierenberg 2009 ; Nierenberg 2015 ). Thus, patients may 
remain symptomatic for up to 2 mont hs while waiting for current standard -of-care 
pharmacotherapy to take full effect. They may also have to contend with undesirable side effects 
and residual symptoms. These aspects underscore the need for newer, rapid -acting therapies.  
SAGE -217 is a synthetic positive allosteric modulator of GABA A receptors, the major class of 
inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain. In pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in mice and 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 23  rats, SAGE -217 demonstrated rapid penetration and equilibrium across the blood br ain barrier 
and is generally expected to have good extravascular exposure. In exploratory in vitro receptor 
and ion channel assays and in vivo safety pharmacology studies, SAGE -217 was highly selective 
for GABA A receptors, and, consistent with the actions of other GABA A receptor potentiators 
(Rudolph 2011 ), exhibits potent anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and sedative activity when 
administered in vivo.  
SAGE -217 has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date. The most common 
treatment -emergent adv erse events (TEAEs) associated with SAGE -217 (overall) were sedation, 
somnolence, and dizziness; most adverse events (AEs) were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity. Refer to the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure for a detailed description of the 
chemi stry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of SAGE -217. 
This study was designed to target the unmet need of symptom improvement during the latency to 
SSRI efficacy in the acute phase of a major depressive episode. This study will assess the safety 
and effica cy of SAGE -217 50  mg plus sertraline, examining if SAGE -217 plus sertraline 
produces more rapid or more profound reduction in depressive symptoms than sertraline alone.  
5.2. Potential Risks and Benefits  
The apparent risks of SAGE -217 are based on clinical data reports of AEs in completed and 
ongoing studies and the known pharmacology of the drug. Sedation, somnolence, and dizziness 
were identified as adverse drug reactions. Most AEs were reported as mild or moderate in 
intensity and reversible.  
SAGE -217 may pres ent a treatment option for MDD that has more rapid onset of action (days 
instead of weeks/months), when compared to available pharmacotherapies.  
Based on nonclinical findings, embryo -fetal toxicity and withdrawal effects are considered 
important potential risk for SAGE -217. Risk mitigation measures in this study include 
monitoring for adverse effects, monitoring for potential withdrawal effects, requiring highly 
effective contraceptive measures for study participants, and inclusion of dose adjustment criter ia 
and guidance for blinded IP discontinuation (Section  8.4). Finally, due to the 
sedation/somnolence observed, SAGE -217 is administered in the evenin g in this study.  
Given the outcome of the completed studies of SAGE -217 in participant s with MDD and PDD, 
the current significant unmet need for well -tolerated and rapid -acting depression treatments, and 
a favorable benefit -risk profile, further investigat ion of SAGE -217 as a novel rapid response 
treatment in adults with MDD is justified.  
5.3. Dose Justification  
Results from a large, multicenter study of SAGE -217 20 and 30  mg in MDD (217 -MDD -301) 
support the need for higher steady -state concentrations of SAGE -217 to allow participants to 
experience maximum anti depressant  and anti -anxiety benefits. SAGE -217 will be administered 
as a 14 -day regimen of an evening dose of 50  mg with reduction to 40  mg as needed based on 
tolerability. The 50 -mg dose of SAGE -217 is exp ected to exhibit a favorable benefit -risk profile 
in the context of results from previous SAGE -217 studies utilizing a 30 -mg dose, now identified 
as a minimally effective dose. SAGE -217 is expected to maintain an acceptable tolerability

217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 24  profile, based on a  current safety database of over 2000 participants exposed across different 
doses/concentrations.  
Sertraline is a commercially available SSRI indicated for the treatment of MDD and other 
psychiatric disorders. Dosage and administration of sertraline as des cribed in the approved U S 
Prescribing Information (PI) recommends a starting dose of 50  mg per day in patients with 
MDD, with an incremental weekly increase in dose of 25 -50 mg per day, if there is an 
inadequate response to the starting dose, to a maximum dose of 200  mg per day. The dose of 
sertraline used in this study aligns with the recommended dosing as defined in the PI.

 27  7. INVESTIGATIONAL P LAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in adults with 
MDD. The diagnosis of MDD must be made according to Structured Clinical Interview for 
Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM -5) Clinical Trial 
Version (SCID 5 -CT) performed by a qualified healthcare professional.  Participants cannot have 
been treated with sertraline in the current depressive episode.  
The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 28 days, a 14 -day double -blind Treatment 
Period, and a 28 -day sertraline Continuation Period. The Screening Period begins with the 
signing of the informed consent form (ICF) at the Screening Visit. Preliminary screening 
procedures to determine eligibility includ e completion of the MGH -ATRQ and HAM -D. 
Participants will be randomized to receive blinded SAGE -217 or placebo for administration each 
evening from Day  1 through  14. In addition, all participants will receive open -label sertraline 
from Day 1 through the end of the study.  
The study design is diagrammed in Figure  1. 
Figure  1: Study Schematic  
 
Doses are presented as daily doses. All participants will receive open -label sertraline in addition to blinded IP  
(SAGE -217/placebo) from Week 1 to Week 2 then continue to receive sertraline alone from Weeks 3 to 6. During 
Weeks 1 and 2, the blinded IP dose may be reduced to 40  mg, as needed. During Weeks 3 to 6 , the sertraline dose 
may be increased in 50 -mg increments each week , as nee ded, up to a total daily dose of sertraline 200  mg. 
Open-label sertraline will be administered as per label ed prescribing information, starting with 
50 mg each evening during Week 1 and 100  mg each evening during Week  2. 
After the Double -blind Treatment Pe riod, sertraline will be continued each evening for the 
remainder of the study ( sertraline Continuation Period). During this period (Week 3 to 6), 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 28  sertraline dosing may be increased in 50 -mg increments (up to 200  mg)as appropriate per the 
label ed prescribing information  and based on individual response,.  
Initiation of other antidepressants or any other medications that may potentially have an impact 
on efficacy or safety endpoints will not be allowed between screening and completion of 
assessments  at Day 42/end -of-study visit.  
Participants will self -administer investigational product (IP) once daily at approximately 8 PM 
with fat -containing food (eg, within 1 hour of an evening meal which contains fat, or with a fat -
containing snack), on an outpati ent basis, for 14 days. Sertraline and SAGE -217 or placebo  will 
be administered at the same time  during the Treatment Period . Participants will return to the 
study center as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments.  
During the Treatment Period, participants  will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo as long as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participants who cannot tolerate 
SAGE -217 or placebo 50  mg will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the Treatment Period. 
Participants who cannot t olerate the SAGE -217/placebo 40 -mg dose may be discontinued  from 
SAGE -217 or placebo  at the discretion of the investigator . If blinded IP is discontinued, 
sertraline may be continued at the discretion of the investigator . 
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter a 
long-term open -label  study of SAGE -217. Participants that do not enter the open -label study or 
that terminate the current study early may , per the investigator , receive a supply of sertraline 
with instructions on how to taper the drug or, if they wish to continue sertraline, a bridge supply 
to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider.  
7.2. Number of Participants  
It is estimated that approximately 42 4 participants will be randomized and treated to obtain 
382 evaluable participants at Day 15 (assuming 10% drop out rate). Additional participants may 
be randomized if the dropout rate is greater than 10%.  
7.3. Treatment Assignment  
Participants will be assigned to blinded IP (SAGE -217 or placebo) in accordance with the 
randomization schedule on Day 1. All participants will also receive open -label sertraline for the 
study duration; as detailed in  Section  9.1 and as per the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
Additional details on randomization and blinding are provided in Section  9.5. 
7.4. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
During the treatment period, participan ts will be able to receive SAGE -217/placebo  as lon g as 
there are no dose -limiting safety/tolerability concerns. Participant s who cannot tolerate 50  mg (as 
determined by the investigator) will receive 40  mg for the remainder of the treatment period.  
At the discretion of the investigator, participant s who c annot tolerate the 40 -mg dose at any time 
may be discontinued from dosing upon completion of an end of treatment (EOT) visit as soon as 
possible. These participant s should be followed and complete assessments as per the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 29  During Weeks 3 to 6, sertraline dosing may be increased , based on individual response, per 
investigator  discretion and  per the label ed prescribing information , in 50 -mg increments (up to 
200 mg). 
7.5. Criteria for Study Termination  
Sage Therapeutics may terminate this study or any portion of the study at any time for safety 
reasons , including the occurrence of AEs or other findings suggesting  unacceptable risk to 
participants, or for administrative reasons. In the event of study termination, Sage Therapeutics 
will provide written notification to the investigator . Investigational sites must promptly notify 
their IRB, where required, and initiat e withdrawal procedures for participating participants.

not subsequently randomized to study intervention . A minimal set of screen failure i nformation 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 33  will be collected, including demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any 
AE/serious adverse event (SAE).  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) may be 
rescreened  once . 
8.4. Inve stigational Product Discontinuation and Early Termination from 
the Study  
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any reason. 
The investigator may discontinue a participant from the study and/or from IP for safety, 
behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons.  
Based on known withdrawal symptoms with other GABAergic drugs and nonclinical findings in 
a 9-month study of SAGE -217 in dogs (Investigator’s Brochure), there is a potential for 
withdrawal -related events, i ncluding seizure. The following guidelines for blinded IP 
discontinuation or dose reduction are presented to support participant safety:  
1. Any participant reporting a confirmed or suspected seizure at any time will be 
discontinued from blinded IP  but will co ntinue to be followed in the study.  
2. The investigator should monitor the course of CNS -based signs and symptoms suggestive 
of a seizure which are not accounted for by comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions. 
Examples of reported serious or severe events which may reflect an oncoming and/or 
increased risk for seizure may include temporary confusion, tremors, involuntary muscle 
fasciculations or jerking movements of arms or legs, or paresthesia. Should such 
symptoms occur, the investigator should consider d ecreasing the dose of SAGE -217 or 
placebo to 40  mg, stopping treatment to assess the effect on the symptom(s) 
(eg, resolution, improvement), or discontinuing the participant from treatment. A 
participant who discontinues treatment should remain in the study and continue protocol -
required assessments until the end of the study.  
The investigator  must notify the sponsor and/or the medical monitor  when a participant stops 
participation in the study for any reason.  
8.4.1.  Investigational Product Discontinuation  
The primary  reason for IP discontinuation must be documented in the participant’s study record 
and recorded in the participant’s electronic case re port form (eCRF).  
Participants who discontinue treatment early should return to the site for an end of treatment 
(EOT) visit as soon as possible, preferably the day after treatment is discontinued. Follow -up 
visits should take place as scheduled relative t o the last dose of treatment (eg, if a participant’s 
last dose is on Day 13, their first follow -up visit, Visit 7, should occur 4 days later), and will 
continue safety and efficacy assessments as scheduled for 6 weeks following the final dose.  
Participants  that discontinue blinded IP early may, per the investigator , receive a supply of 
sertraline with instructions on how to taper the drug or, if they wish to continue sertraline, a 
bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider . 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 34  8.4.2.  Early Termination from the Study  
If a participant decides to terminate the study, the participant should return for an early 
termination (ET) visit, if possible. The primary reason for early termination from the study  must 
be documented in the participant’ s study record and recorded in the participant’s electronic case 
report form (eCRF). If a participant discontinues IP and terminates the study on the same day 
during a clinic visit, the EOT and ET visits can be on the same day; in this case, all EOT visit 
assessments should be conducted in addition to an abbreviated physical exam ination  
If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor will retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent . 
If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator  must document this in the site study records.  
Participants who terminate from the study early may, per the investigator , receive a supply of 
sertraline with instructions on how to taper the drug or, if they wish to continue sertraline, a 
bridge supply to permit them to obtain a prescription from another provider . 
8.4.3.  Loss to Follow -up 
A participant will be deemed lost to follow -up after 3 attempts at contacting the participant have 
been unsuccessful.  
8.4.4.  Replacement of Participants  
Participants will not be replaced.

9.2.3.  Other Restrictions  
The consumption of grapefruit juice, grapefruit, or Seville oranges, or produc ts containing these 
is prohibited  throughout the treatment period.  
The concomitant use of sertraline with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the 
CYP2D6 substrate; therefore, decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed.  
Consumption of a lcohol or use of drugs of abuse is discouraged throughout the duration of the 
study.  
Female participants  who are lactating or actively breastfeeding must stop giving breast milk to 
the baby(ies) starting on Day 1 until 7 days after the last dose of SAGE -217/placebo . 
Elective surgeries or procedures are prohibited through the Day 42 visit.

9.3. Intervention after the End of the Study  
Upon completion of the current study, eligible participants  will have the opportunity to enter an 
open -label, lo ng-term study of SAGE -217 in which additional treatment with SAGE -217 will be 
offered . Participants that do not enter the open -label study  or that terminate the current study 
early  may continue to receive sertraline as prescribed by the investigator either  to taper the drug 
appropriately or —if the participan t wishes to continue sertraline —to bridge the participant until 
he or she  receives a new prescription.  
9.4. Treatment Adherence  
Investigational products will be self -administered by participants  (see Section  10.5). 
Administration of blinded and open -label IP will be monitored by a medication adherence 
monitoring platform used on smartphones to  visually confirm medication ingestion. Participants 
will receive a reminder within a predefined time window to take IP while using the application. 
Participants will follow a series of prescribed steps in front of the front -facing webcam to 
visually confi rm their ingestion of the medication. The application will record the date and time 
of IP administration by dose level, as well as missed doses.  
In addition, participants will be instructed to bring their SAGE -217 or placebo  dosing kit and 
sertraline to the site as outlined in Table  2, at which time the investigator or designee will be 
responsible for ensuring the kit contains sufficient doses for the  duration of the treatment period.  
All participants should be reinstructed about the dosing requirement s during study contacts. The 
authorized study personnel conducting the reeducation must document the process in the 
participant source records.  
The inves tigator (s) will record any reasons for non adherence  in the source documents.  
9.5. Randomization and Blinding  
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SAGE -217 or matched placebo. 
Participants, site staff, and the sponsor will be blinded to trea tment allocation.  All participants 
will also receive open -label sertraline.  Randomization will be performed centrally via an 
interactive response technology (IRT) system. Randomization schedules will be generated by an 
independent statistician. The allocat ion to blinded treatment (SAGE -217or placebo) will be 
based on the randomization schedule. The randomization schedules will be kept strictly 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 38  confidential, accessible only to authorized personnel until the time of unblinding. The blinding of 
the study will be broken after the database has been locked.  
9.5.1.  Emergency Unblinding  
During the study, the blind is to be broken only when the safety of a participant is at risk and the 
treatment plan is dependent on the study treatment received. Unless a participant is at immediate 
risk, the investigator should make diligent attempts to contact Sage prior to unblinding the study 
treatment administered to a participant. Requests from the investigator about the treatment 
administered to study participants should be discussed with the Sage medical monitor . If the 
unblinding occurs without Sage’s knowledge, the investigator must notify Sage within 24 hours 
of breaking the blind. All circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly 
documented in the source records.  
In all cases where the IP allocation for a participant is unblinded, pertinent information 
(including the reason for unblinding) must be documented in the participant’s records and on the 
eCRF.

217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 40  If a participant  misses a dose  of blinded IP or open -label sertraline , the participant should skip 
that dose (ie, they should not take the dose in the morning) and take the next scheduled dose the 
next evening.  
10.6. Blinded Investigational Product Accountability, Handling, and 
Disposal  
Upon receipt of blinded IP  dosing kits , the investigator (s), or the responsible pharmacist or 
designee, will inspect the  kits and complete and follow th e instructions regarding receipt and 
storage in the SAGE -217 Investigator’s Brochure and (where applicable) in the Pharmacy 
Manual. A copy of the shipping documentation will be kept in the study files.  
The designated site staff will dispense the participan t-specific kits to participants  at the planned 
dispensation visit intervals outlined in  Table  2. Site staff will access the IRT at the Screening 
Visit to obtain a participant  identification  (ID) number for each participant that has signed an 
informed consent form . On Day 1, site staff will access the IRT and provide the necessary 
participant -identifying information, including the participant ID number assigned at Screening, 
to randomize  the eligible participant into the study and obtain the medication ID number for the 
blinded IP to be dispensed to that participant . The medication ID number and the number of 
blinded capsules dispensed must be recorded.  
At the subsequent blinded IP-dispensing visit, the investigator  or designee will access the IRT, 
providing the same participant ID number assigned at Screening, to obtain the medication ID 
number for the blinded IP to be dispensed at that visit. The medication ID number, the number of 
capsules dispensed, and the number of capsules returned by the participant at this visit must be 
recorded.  
If dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered by site staff or sponsor’s designee, the 
sponsor must be  notified immediately.  
The blinded IP provided is for use only as directed in this protocol. The investigator or designee 
must keep a record of all blinded IP received, used and returned/discarded.  
Sage Therapeutics will be permitted access to the study su pplies at any time and with appropriate 
notice during or after completion of the study to perform drug accountability and reconciliation.  
The investigator , pharmacist, or qualified designee is responsible for drug accountability, 
reconciliation, and record  maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
At the end of the study, a ny unused blinded IP will be returned to Sage Therapeutics for 
destruction or destroyed locally per the site’s procedures; disposition of blinded IP will b e 
documented.  
10.7. Blinded I nvestigational  Product Complaints  
A product complaint is any written, electronic, or verbal expression of dissatisfaction regarding 
the identity, quality, reliability, safety, purity, potency, effectiveness or performance (applicable 
for approved marketed products) of a drug product after it is released for distribution.  
In the course of conduct of the study, study personnel may become aware of a product complaint 
associated with the use of a Sage product. Personnel shall n otify Sage within 24 hours by 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 41  forwarding the product complaint information via the contact information  provided in Table 1. 
Where possible, personnel sho uld segregate and retain any product, materials, or packaging 
associated with the product complaint until further instruction is provided by Sage or its 
designated representative(s).

 42  11. EFFICACY AND  CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y ASSESSMENTS  
11.1. Efficacy Assessments  
11.1.1.  Hamil ton Rating Scale for Depression  
The primary outcome measure is the change from baseline in 17 -item HAM -D total score at the 
end of the Treatment Period (Day 15). Every effort should be made for the same rater to perform 
all HAM -D assessments for an individ ual participant . An assessment timeframe of past 7 days 
(1 week) will be used at Screening, and ‘Since Last Visit’ will be used for all other visits.  
The 17 -item HAM -D will be used to rate the severity of depression in participants who are 
already diagnose d as depressed ( Williams 2013  a; Williams 2013b ). The 17 -item HAM -D 
comprises individual ratings related to the following symptoms: depressed mood (sadness, 
hopeless, helpless, worthless), feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia (early, middle, late), work an d 
activities, retardation (slowness of thought and speech; impaired ability to concentrate; decreased 
motor activity), agitation, anxiety (psychic and somatic), somatic symptoms (gastrointestinal and 
general), genital symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of wei ght, and insight.  
The HAM -D total score will be calculated as the sum of the 17 individual item scores.  
In addition to the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in HAM -D total score, 
several secondary efficacy endpoints will be derived for the HAM -D. Hamilton Rating Scale for 
Depression subscale scores will be calculated as the sum of the items comprising each subscale. 
Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression response will be defined as having a 50% or greater 
reduction from baseline in HAM -D total  score. Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression remission 
will be defined as having a HAM -D total score of ≤7.  
11.1.2.  Montgomery -Åsberg Depression Rating Scale  
The MADRS is a 10 -item diagnostic questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive 
episodes in participant s with mood disorders. It was designed as an adjunct to the HAM -D that is 
more sensitive to the changes brought on by antidepressants and othe r forms of treatment than 
the Hamilton Scale.  
Higher MADRS scores indicate more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. 
The overall score ranges from 0 to 60 ( Williams 2008 ). 
The MADRS total score will be calculated as the sum of the 10 individual item scores.  
11.1.3.  Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale  
The 14 -item HAM -A will be used to rate the severity of symptoms of anxiety ( Williams  2013c; 
Williams  2013d ). Each of the 14 items is defined by a series of symptoms, and measures both 
psychic anxiety (m ental agitation and psychological distress) and somatic anxiety (physical 
complaints related to anxiety). Scoring for HAM -A is calculated by assigning scores of 0 (not 
present) to 4 (very severe), with a total score range of 0 to 56, where <17 indicates mi ld severity, 
18 to 24, mild to moderate severity, and 25 to 30, moderate to severe severity. The HAM -A total 
score will be calculated as the sum of the 14 individual item scores.

217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 43  11.1.4.  Clinical Global Impression s 
The CGI is a validated measure often utilized in clinical studies to allow clinicians to integrate 
several sources of information into a single rating of the participant ’s condition. The CGI scale 
consists of 3 items. Only the first 2 items are being used in this study.  
The CGI -S uses a 7 -point Likert sc ale to rate the severity of the participant ’s illness at the time of 
assessment, relative to the clinician’s past experience with participants who have the same 
diagnosis. Considering total clinical experience, a participant is assessed on severity of mental 
illness at the time of rating as 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 
4 = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; and 7  = extremely ill ( Busner  2007a ). 
The CGI -I employs a 7 -point Likert scale to measu re the overall improvement in the 
participant ’s condition posttreatment. The investigator will rate the participant ’s total 
improvement whether or not it is due entirely to drug treatment. Response choices include: 
0 = not assessed, 1  = very much improved,  2 = much improved, 3  = minimally improved, 4  = no 
change, 5  = minimally worse, 6  = much worse, and 7  = very much worse ( Busner  2007b ). The 
CGI-I is only rated at posttreatment assessments. By definition, all CGI -I assessments are 
evaluated against baselin e conditions. CGI -I response will be defined as having a CGI -I score of 
“very much improved” or “much improved.”  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
11.1.6.  Patient Health Questionnaire  
The PHQ -9 is a participant -rated depressive symptom severity scale. To monitor severity over 
time for newly diagnosed participants or participants in current treatment for depression, 
participant s may complete questionnaires at baseline and at regular intervals thereafter. Scoring 
is based on responses to specific questions, as follows: 0  = not at all; 1  = several days; 2  = more 
than half the days; and 3  = nearly every day.  
The PHQ -9 total score will be calculated as the sum of the 9 individual item scores. The PHQ -9 
total score will be categorized as follows: 1 to 4  = minimal depression, 5 to 9  = mild depression, 
10 to 14  = moderate depression, 15 to 19  = moderately severe depression; and 20 to 27  = severe 
depression.

 46  12. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
All assessments will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). 
12.1.1.  Demo graphic/Medical History  
Demographic characteristics (age, race, gender, ethnicity, employment status, highest education 
level, marital/civil status) and a full medical history, including: family psychiatric history, 
generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder, panic disorder, persistent 
depressive disorder, postpartum depression, substance use disorder, alcohol use disorder, MDD  
with seasonal pattern, MDD  with psychotic features, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, MDD  
with atypical features, schizophrenia; or schizoaffective disorder will be documented. The 
diagnosis of MDD will be determined using the SCID -5-CT. If available, the disease code 
associated with the diagnosis of MDD based on the tenth  revision of the Inte rnational Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD -10) should be recorded.  
The Massachusetts General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire 
(MGH  ATRQ) will be used to determine whether the participant  has tr eatment -resistant 
depression, defined as persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment during the current major 
depressive episode with adequate doses of antidepressants from 2 different classes for at least 4 
weeks of treatment.  
12.1.2.  Weight and Height  
Heigh t (Screening only) and weight will be measured and documented.  
12.1.3.  Physical Examination  
Physical examinations assessing body systems (eg, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; heart; 
lungs; abdomen; and extremities), as well as cognitive and neurological examina tions and mental 
status examinations will be conducted and documented. Thereafter, abbreviated physical 
examinations will include brief assessments of general appearance, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems, followed by a targeted physical examination as 
needed. Unscheduled, symptom -directed physical examinations may also be conducted at the 
investigator’s discretion.  Whenever possible, the same individual is to perform all physical 
examinations for a given participant . Unscheduled brief, symptom -driven physical examinations 
may also be conducted per the investigator ’s discretion.  
Any abnormality in physical examinations will be interpreted by the investigator  as abnormal, 
not clinically significant (NCS); or abnormal, cli nically significant (CS) in source documents. 
New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as 
AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1 . 
12.1.4.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs comprise both supine and standing for systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart 
rate measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure are to be collected in supine position after the 
participant  has been resting for 5 minutes and then after approximately 3 minutes in the standing 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 47  position. Respiratory rate and temperature are collected once, in either position. Vital signs will 
be documented. When vital signs are scheduled at the same time as blood  draws, vital signs will 
be obtained first.  
Any abnormality in vital signs will be interpreted by the investigator  as abnormal, NCS or 
abnormal, CS in source documents. New or worsening abnormalities that are judged to be 
clinically significant will be rec orded as AEs, assessed according to Section  12.2.1 . 
12.1.5.  Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Supine 12 -lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate at all scheduled time p oints. The standard 
intervals (heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF) as well as any rhythm abnormalities will be 
recorded.  
 
12.1.6.  Laboratory Assessments  
Samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures detailed in the 
laboratory manual.  
The central laboratory will perform laboratory tests for hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis, 
and coagulation. The results of laboratory tests will be retu rned to the investigator , who is 
responsible for reviewing and filing these results. All laboratory safety data will be transferred 
electronically to Sage Therapeutics or designee in the format requested by Sage Therapeutics.  
Laboratory reports must be sig ned and dated by the investigator  or subinvestigator indicating that 
the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical significance. 
Any abnormalities identified prior to first dose will require clear and complete documenta tion in 
the source documents as to the investigator’s assessment of not clinically significant before 
proceeding with randomization.  
All clinical laboratory test results outside the central laboratory’s reference range will be 
interpreted by the investigat or as abnormal, NCS; or abnormal, CS in source documents. New or 
worsening abnormalities that are judged to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs, 
assessed according to Section  12.2.1 . A clinically significant laboratory abnormality following 
participant  randomization will be followed until the abnormality returns to an acceptable level or 
a satisfactory explanation has bee n obtained.  
The clinical laboratory tests to be performed are listed in Table  3.

 50  12.2. Adverse and Serious Adverse Events  
12.2.1.  Adverse Eve nt Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavor able and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product. In clinical studies, an A E can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any 
time, including baseline or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.  
A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the start of IP, or any worsening of a pre -existing 
medical condition/ AE with onset after the start of IP and throughout the study. The term IP 
includes any Sage IP, a comparator, or a placebo administered in a clinical study . 
 are co nsidered AEs 
if they result in discontinuation or interruption of study treatment, require therapeutic medical 
intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (if applicable) or if the investigator  considers them to 
be clinically significant. Any abnormaliti es that meet the criteria for a n SAE should be reported 
in an expedited manner.  
 that are clearly attributable to another AE do not require discrete reporting (eg,  electrolyte 
distur bances in the context of dehydration, chemistry and hematologic disturbances in the 
context of sepsis).  
All AEs that occur after any participant has signed the informed consent and throughout the 
duration of the study, whether or not they are related to th e study, must be reported to Sage 
Therapeutics.  
Participant s who discontinue the IP due to an AE, regardless of investigator -determined 
causality, should be followed until the event is resolved, considered stable, or the investigator  
determines the event i s no longer clinically significant. Any AEs that are unresolved at the 
participant’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by the investigator  for as long as 
medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. The sponsor or its repre sentative 
retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at 
the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
12.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event Definition  
An SAE i s any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in de ath 
• Places the participant  at immediate risk of death (a life -threatening event); however, 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death  
• Requires in patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing ho spitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital abnormality or birth defect  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 51  An SAE may also be any other medically important event that, in the opinion of the investigator  
may jeopardize the participant o r may require medical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes 
listed above (examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or convulsions occurring at home that do not require an 
inpatient hospita lization).  
All SAEs that occur after any participant has signed the ICF and throughout the duration of the 
study, whether or not they are related to the study, must be recorded on the SAE report form 
provided by Sage Therapeutics. Any SAE that is ongoing w hen the participant completes their 
final study visit, will be followed by the investigator  until the event has resolved, stabilized, 
returned to baseline status, or until the participant dies or is lost to follow up.  
A prescheduled or elective procedure o r routinely scheduled treatment will not be considered an 
SAE, even if the participant is hospitalized. The site must document all of the following:  
• The prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled treatment was 
scheduled (or on a waiting list  to be scheduled) prior to obtaining the participant’s 
consent to participate in the study.  
• The condition requiring the prescheduled or elective procedure or routinely scheduled 
treatment was present before and did not worsen or progress, in the opinion of  an 
investigator , between the participant’s consent to participate in the study and at the 
time of the procedure or treatment.  
12.2.3.  Relationship to Investigational Product  
The investigator  must make the determination of relationship to the IP for each AE (not related, 
related). The following definitions should be considered when evaluating the relationship of AEs 
and SAEs to the IP.  
Not Related  An AE will be considered “not related” to the use of the IP if there is not a reasonable 
possibility that the event has been caused by the IP. Factors pointing towards this 
assessment include but are not limited to: the lack of temporal relationship between 
administration of the IP and the event, the presence of biologically implausible 
relationship between the product and the AE, or the presence of a more likely 
alternative explanation for the AE  
Related  An AE will be considered “related” to the use of the IP if there is a reasonable 
possibility that  the event may have been caused by the product under investigation. 
Factors that point towards this assessment include but are not limited to: a positive 
rechallenge, a reasonable temporal sequence between administration of the drug and 
the event, a known response pattern of the suspected drug, improvement following 
discontinuation or dose reduction, a biologically plausible relationship between the 
drug and the AE, or a lack of alternative explanation for the AE  
12.2.4.  Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events spo ntaneously reported by the participant and/or in response to an open question 
from the study personnel or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study at the 
Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 52  investigational site. The AE term should be reported in standard medical terminology when 
possible. For each AE, the investigator  will evaluate and report the onset (date and time), 
resolution (date and time), intensity, causality, action taken, outcome and seriousness (if 
applicable), and whether or not it caused the participant to discon tinue the IP or withdraw early 
from the study . 
Intensity will be assessed according to the following scale:  
• Mild: symptom(s) barely noticeable to participant or does not make participant 
uncomfortable; does not influence performance or functioning; prescri ption drug not 
ordinarily needed for relief of symptom(s)  
• Moderate: symptom(s) of a sufficient severity to make participant uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activity is influenced; participant is able to continue in study; 
treatment for symptom(s) may b e needed  
• Severe: symptom(s) cause severe discomfort; symptoms cause incapacitation or 
significant impact on participant’s daily life; severity may cause cessation of 
treatment with IP; treatment for symptom(s) may be given and/or participant 
hospitalized  
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria under Section  12.2.2 . An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious.  
12.2.5.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In order to adhere to all applicable laws and regulations for reporting an SAE(s), the study site 
must notify Sage or designee within 24 hou rs of the study site staff becoming aware of the 
SAE(s). The investigator  must complete, sign and date the SAE report form, verify the accuracy 
of the information recorded on the SAE report form with the corresponding source documents, 
and send a copy to S age or designee.  
Additional follow -up information, if required or available, should all be sent to Sage or designee 
within 24 hours of receipt on a follow -up SAE report form and placed with the original SAE 
information and kept with the appropriate section  of the eCRF and/or study file.  
SAEs occurring after the designated follow up time for the study, should be reported to Sage or 
designee according to the timelines noted above only if the investigator considers the SAE 
related to IP.  
Sage, or designee, is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certain 
events. It is the principal investigator’s responsibility to notify the IRB/IEC of all SAEs that 
occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all suspected unexpec ted serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) that occur during the clinical study. IRBs/IECs  will be notified of 
SAEs and/or SUSARs as required by local law.  
In addition, appropriate personnel in Sage Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance or designee will 
unblind SU SARs for the purpose of regulatory reporting. Sage or designee will submit SUSARs 
(in blinded or unblinded fashion) to regulatory agencies according to local law. Sage, or 
designee, will submit SUSARs to investigators in a blinded fashion.

 53  12.3. Pregnancy  
If a participant becomes pregnant after the first administration of IP, pregnancy information must 
be collected and recorded on the Pregnancy form and submitted to the sponsor within 24  hours of 
learning of the pregnancy. Details will be collecte d for all pregnancies for which conception was 
likely to have occurred after the start of IP administration until 5 terminal half -lives following 
the last administration of IP or until the completion of the study whichever is longer. Any 
pregnancy occurrin g in that time frame will be followed until delivery or termination of the 
pregnancy. The investigator  will also attempt to collect pregnancy information on any 
participant’s partner who becomes pregnant after the participant has received the first 
adminis tration of IP. After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant 
partner directly, the investigator  will follow the same pregnancy reporting procedures specified 
for pregnant participants.  
The participant or participant’s partner will  be followed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The outcome of all pregnancies (eg, spontaneous abortion, elective abortion, normal 
birth) must be followed and documented even if the participant was discontinued from the study. 
The investigator  will collect follow -up information on the participant or participant’s partner and 
the neonate, and the information will be forwarded to Sage or designee. Generally, follow -up 
will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery dat e. Any 
termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of 
anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that an IP may have 
interfered with th e effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Any complication during 
pregnancy (eg, anemia, infections, pre -eclampsia) should be reported as an AE/SAE. If the 
outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as an SAE (ie, 
spontan eous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death,), the investigator  should follow the procedures 
for reporting an SAE.  
12.4. Overdose  
Overdoses, regardless of presence of associated clinical manifestation(s) (eg, headache, 
abnormal laboratory value) will be considered  an AE and recorded as such on the eCRF. Any 
clinical manifestation(s) of overdose must also be recorded as an AE on the eCRF. In addition, 
all overdoses must be recorded on an Overdose form and sent to Sage or designee within 
24 hours of the site becoming  aware of the overdose.

Detailed description of the analyses to be performed in the study will be provided in the 
statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized and approved prior to database lock. 
Any changes/additions to the SAP fo llowing database lock will be described in detail in the 
clinical study report.  
13.1. Data Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) is defined as all randomized participants in the Safety Set who have 
a valid baseline as well as at least 1 postbaseline HAM -D evaluation.  
The Randomized Set  is defined as all participants who are randomized.  
The Safety Set is defined as all participants who receive at least 1 dose of IP.  
 
 
13.2. Handling of Missing Data  
Every attempt will be made to avoid missing data. All participants will be used in the analyses, 
as per the analysis populations, using all nonmissing data available. No imput ation process will 
be used to estimate missing data. A sensitivity analysis will be used to investigate the impact of 
missing data if ≥5% of participant s in any treatment group have missing data.  
13.3. General Considerations  
All participant data, including those  that are derived, that support the tables and figures will be 
presented in the participant data listings. Some data may be presented only in a participant data 
listing, some may be presented with a corresponding table or figure; these will be indicated in  
relevant sections below. All summaries will be provided by treatment – either by randomized 
treatment or actual treatment received. Actual treatment is defined as SAGE -217 if the 
participant received any SAGE -217 (50 mg or 40 mg) at any time; otherwise, i t is placebo.  
If a participant takes any dose of SAGE -217, the participant’s actual treatment is considered as 
SAGE -217 regardless of the treatment to which the participant has been randomized.  
For the purpose of all primary and secondary analyses where ap plicable, baseline is defined as 
the last measurement prior to start of IP administration.  
Continuous endpoints will be summarized with number (n), mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum, and maximum. In addition, change from baseline values will be cal culated at each 
time point and summarized descriptively. For categorical endpoints, descriptive summaries will 
include counts and percentages.  
13.4. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data, such as age, race, and ethnicity, and baseline charac teristics, such as height, 
weight, and BMI, will be summarized using the Safety Set. 

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 55  Hepatitis, HIV, drug and alcohol, and pregnancy screening results will be listed, but not 
summarized as they are considered part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
Medic al history will be listed by participant.  
13.5. Efficacy Analysis  
Efficacy data will be summarized using appropriate descriptive statistics and other data 
presentation methods where applicable; participant  listings will be provided for all efficacy data. 
Partici pants will be analyzed according to randomized treatment.  
The estimand for the primary efficacy analysis is the mean change from baseline in HAM -D total 
score at Day 15. Using the FAS, t his will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated 
measures (MMRM); the model will include treatment, baseline HAM -D total score, assessment 
time point, and time point -by-treatment as explanatory variables. All explanatory variables will 
be treated as fixed effects. All postbaseline time points will be inc luded in the model. The main 
comparison will be between SAGE -217 + sertraline  and placebo  + sertraline  at the Day 15  time 
point. Model -based point estimates (ie, least squares means, 95% confidence intervals, and 
p values) will be reported where applicable . An unstructured covariance structure will be used to 
model the within -participant  errors. The Toeplitz compound symmetry, Autoregressive (1) 
[AR(1)] covariance structure will be used in that sequence if there is a convergence issue with 
the unstructured covariance model. If convergence is still not achieved, no results will be 
reported . 
Similar to those methods described above for the primary endpoint, an MMRM will be used for 
the analysis of the change from baseline in other time points in HAM -D total sc ore, MADRS 
total score, HAM -A total score,  PHQ -9 total score, and selected individual items 
and/or subscale scores in HAM -D. 
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will be used for the analysis of HAM -D 
response (defined as ≥50% reduction from baseline in HAM -D total score) and HAM -D 
remission (defined as HAM -D total score ≤7.0). GEE models will include terms for treatment, 
baseline score, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as explanatory variables. The 
comparison of interest will be the difference between SAGE -217 + sertraline  and 
placebo  + sertraline  at the Day 15  time point. Model -based point estimates (ie, odds ratios), 95% 
confidence intervals, and p  values will be reported.  
A GEE method will also be used for t he analysis of CGI -I response , including terms for 
treatment, baseline CGI -S score, assessment time point, and time point -by-treatment as 
explanatory variables.  
13.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety and tolerability of SAGE -217 will be evaluated by  TEAE s, changes from baseline in  
. 
 
 Safety data will be l isted by participant and summarized by treatment group. All 
safety summaries will be presented for the Safety Set using actual treatment received. Where 
applicable, ranges of potentially clinically significant values will be provided in the SAP.

 56  13.6.1.  Adverse Ev ents 
Adverse events will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
Version  18.1 or higher. A TEAE is defined as an AE with onset after the first dose of IP. The 
analysis of AEs will be based on the concept of TEAEs. The incidence  of TEAEs will be 
summarized by System Organ Class and preferred term. In addition, summaries will be provided 
by intensity (mild, moderate, severe) and by causality (related, not related) to IP.  
Any TEAEs leading to discontinuation of treatment or withdra wal from the study and any 
treatment -emergent SAEs will be summarized.  
All AEs and SAEs (including those with onset or worsening before the start of IP) through the 
end of the study will be listed.  
  
 
 
 
 
 
13.6.3.  Physical Examinations  
The occurrence of a physical examination (yes/no) and the date per formed will be listed by 
participant.  
  
 
 
 
13.6.5.  12-Lead Electrocardiogram  
The following ECG parameters will be listed for each of the triplicate ECGs for each participant: 
heart rate, PR, QRS, QT, and QTcF. The derived mean of each parameter will also be li sted. 
Mean ECG data will be summarized by visit. Potentially clinically significant values of QTcF 
will be summarized by treatment. Electrocardiogram findings will be listed by participant and 
visit.  
13.6.6.  Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be re corded at each study visit during the study and will be coded using World 
Health Organization -Drug dictionary (WHO -DD) September 2015, or later.  
All medications taken within 30 days prior to informed consent through the duration of the study 
will be record ed. In addition, all psychotropic medications taken in the 6 months prior to 
Screening will be recorded on the eCRF. Those medications taken prior to the initiation of the 
start of IP will be denoted “Prior”. Those medications taken prior to the initiation  of the IP and 
continuing beyond the initiation of the IP or those medications started at the same time or after 
the initiation of the IP will be denoted “Concomitant”.  

Clinical Protocol  Sage Therapeutics, Inc.  
217-MDD -305 Version 1  CONFIDENTIAL  
 57  Medications will be presented according to whether they are “Prior” or “Concomitant” as  
defined above. If medication dates are incomplete and it is not clear whether the medication was 
concomitant, it will be assumed to be concomitant.  
Details of prior and concomitant medications will be listed by participant, start date, and 
verbatim term.

13.8. Sample Size  and Power  
Using a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, a sample size of 382 total evaluable participants would 
provide 90% power to detect a treatment difference (between SAGE -217 + sertraline and 
placebo  + sertraline) of approximately 3 points in the primary end point, change from baseline in 
HAM -D total score at Day 15, assuming standard deviation of 9 points. Assuming a 
10% dropout rate and a 1:1 randomization ratio within each treatment group, approximately 
424 total randomized participants will be required to obtain a total of 382 evaluable participants. 
Evaluable participants are defined as those randomized participants who receive IP and have 
valid baseline and at least 1 postbaseline HAM -D assessment.  
13.8.1.  Interim and Data Monitoring Committee Analyses  
No interim  analyses or data monitoring committee analyses will be conducted.

Therapeutics will visit the investiga tional study site per Sage SOPs to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to 
protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of Sage Therapeutics or its representatives . 
This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between Sage Therapeutics and 
the investigator.  
During the study, a monitor from Sage Therapeutics or representative will have regular contacts 
with the investigational site, for the following:  
• Provid e information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the case report forms, and that IP accountability check s are being 
performed  
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the case report 
forms with the participant’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the study. This will require direct ac cess to all original records for each 
participant (eg, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to Sage Therapeutics.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on eCRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to Sage Therapeutics and those SAEs that met criteria for 
reporting have been forwarded to the IRB o r independent ethics committee .

217-MDD-305 Summary of Changes Sage Therapeutics  
Version 4, Amendment 3 
 
 1 Protocol 217- MDD-305, Amendment  3 
Date of Draft Amendment:  10 January  2022 
A PHASE 3, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE- BLIND STUDY COMPARING THE EFFICACY 
AND SAFETY OF SAGE- 217 PLUS AN ANTIDEPRESSANT VERSUS PLACEBO PLUS 
AN ANTIDEPRESSANT IN ADULTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER  
Rationale for Protocol Amendment 
The primary purpose for this protocol amendment is to revise the primary endpoint to change 
from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 3 (instead of Day 15). In line with the objectives of 
this study as a rapid response therapy in the treatment paradigm of co- initiation, an earlier time  
point in the treatment period will characterize the rapid onset of effect while awaiting the 
efficacy of a standard antidepressant. Additional changes are outlined below: 
 Study Endpoints 
• The change from baseline in HAM -D total score over the blinded treatment period (using 
equal weights for the scheduled visits – Day 3, Day 8, Day 12, Day 15) has been added as 
the key secondary endpoint 
• The change from baseline in CGI -S at Day 15 has been designated as an ‘other 
secondary’ endpoint (previously key secondary endpoint ) 
• The c hange from baseline in HAM -D total score at Day 3, Day 8, and Day 42 (previously 
key secondary endpoint) has been removed 
• The change from baseline in HAM- D total score at Day 15 and Day 42 has been 
designated as an ‘other secondary’ endpoint 
• Added the following as new ‘other secondary’ endpoints: 
o CGI-I response at Day 3  
o The change from baseline in the HAM -D total score around end of blind ed 
treatment (using equal weights for the scheduled visits – Day 12, Day 15, Day 18) 
o MADRS response at Day 15  
o MADRS remission at Day 15  
Statistics  
• Expanded t he Full Analysis Set definition to include participants  who have data from 
other efficacy endpoints in addition to HAM- D total score  
• Modified the condition of the sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing  data  to 
be performed  regardless of missing data rate 
• Clarified the  estimand for the primary and key secondary endpoints

217-MDD-305 Summary of Changes Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3, Amendment 2 
 
 1 Protocol 217- MDD-305, Amendment  2 
Date of Amendment : 22 January 2021 
A PHASE 3, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND STUDY COMPARING THE EFFICACY 
AND SAFETY OF SAGE -217 PLUS AN ANTIDEPRESSANT VERSUS PLACEBO PLUS 
AN ANTIDEPRESSANT IN ADULTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER 
Rationale for Protocol Amendment  
The primary purpose for this protocol amendment in response to FDA feedback is  to update the 
visit schedule for participants that discontinue any treatment early : these participants will now 
complete remaining study visits as scheduled through Day 42 (ie, relative to Day 1), unless the 
participant withdraws consent. Additional changes to incorporate FDA feedback or clarify the study design are outlined below: 
 
Schedule of Assessments  
• Subsequent to the primary purpose for this amendment, the End of Treatment (EOT) visit 
is no longer needed and has been removed 
Investigational Products 
• Updated the recommended starting dose options for duloxetine to better align with its 
labeled prescribing information 
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
• Corrected  Exclusion Criterion #7, which incorrectly specified sertraline  
• Specified  the types of bilateral tubal occlusion procedures that are considered to be 
acceptable forms of contraception , including a minimum time for which h ysteroscopic 
bilateral tubal occlusion  procedures may have been performed prior to Screening 
Statistical Analysis:  
• Specified separate Safety Sets for those participants that administered blinded IP and 
those that administered  open -label antidepressant therapy  only; subsequently updated the 
Full Analysis Set definition to specify this set include s participants who administered 
blinded IP 
• Removed the statement that no imputation process will be used to estimate missing data and replaced with a statement that m issing data for particular visits may be imputed using 
the visit window and available data, as described in the statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  
• Specified the 2 treatment regimens as part of the estimand definition and re- formatted the 
estimand definition  
• Added a reference to  the SAP for the definition and details of the Per Protocol Set 
Other  
• Updated the study medical monitors  
217-MDD-305 Summary of Changes Sage Therapeutics  
Version 3, Amendment 2 
 
 2 • Specified that any restriction (s) for the assigned SSRI/SNRI with concomitant 
medications per the labeled prescribing information should be considered; subsequently 
removed a restriction specific only to sertraline  
• Specified  that the treatment adherence monitoring application will only record details of 
IP ingestion that has been visually confirmed 
• Updated the emergency unblinding procedure to specify that if the blind is to be broken, it should be done by the investigator vi a the IRT system , removed the statement that the 
investigator should discuss requests about treatment with the Sage medical monitor, and 
specified that the responsibility to break treatment code resides solely with the 
investigator

SAFETY 
EVALUATIONS  Incidence and severity of adverse events  and comparison of 
MRI images from baseline to 6 months for any unusual 
findings.   
EFFICACY 
EVALUATIONS  & 
PRIMARY 
ENDPOINT  Pain, function and stiffness  will be compared at baseline and 6 
months po st-operatively using the validated short -form of the 
WOMAC instrument and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for 
pain.  
Efficacy will be achieved if either SVF dose is shown to be 
superior to the placebo group at the 6 -month time point.  The 
measures of interest are from baseline to 6 months of the 
changes in the WOMAC and VAS pain scales  and compar ison 
to the placebo control group.  
PLANNED INTERIM 
ANALYSES  After the first 15 subjects have completed the 6 week follow -
up, an interim analysis for safety will be con ducted.   If there 
are two (2 ) or fewer adverse events  less than grade  4 on the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
scale,  then the high dose will be administered. Serious adverse 
events will be monitored on an ongoing basis throughout th e 
study and safety follow -up period.  
STATISTICS  
 The primary efficacy will be evaluated using Dunnett’s 
multiple comparison with a control test.  
RATIONAL FOR 
NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  The samples size determination is based on the primary

comparison with a control one -sided (i.e., superiority) test.  
Assuming a standard deviation of 14 points and a difference to 
detect (i.e., minimal clinically signi ficant difference) of at least 
17 (representing about a 33% decrease from baseline) points 
with an α = 0.05 significance level and a power of 80% a 
conservative sample size of 11 subjects per group is needed .   
This sample size estimate is based on a Bonfe rroni correction 
and as such is conservative (i.e., larger than necessary). Thus, 
the goal will be to have no fewer than 11 subjects per treatment 
group. To account for possible exclusions/lost to follow -up of 
data an additional 2 subjects per treatment gr oup (20%) will be 
added for a sample size of 13 subjects per group for a total 
enrolled sample size of 39 subjects.  
1 PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION  
1.1 Overview of Investigation and Clinical Plan  
Osteoarthritis (OA) is known as degenerative arthritis or degener ative joint 
disease or osteoarthrosis , and represents a group of mechanical abnormalities 
involving degradation of joints, including the articular cartilage and subchondral 
bone. Symptoms typically may include joint pain, tenderness, stif fness, locking, 
and sometimes  effusion. Clinical treatment generally involves a life -long 
combination of exercise, lifestyle modifications, and/or analgesics. If pain 
becomes debilitating, joint replacement surgery may be an option to improve 
the quality of life.  
A new and  novel treatment strategy has had preliminary success in preclinical 
studies as well as in pilot clinical studies that have utilized the autologous 
stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells derived from adipose tissues. The SVF is a 
concentration of nucleated cells normally present in the adipose tissue.  This 
treatment strategy uses the autologous SVF cells derived from harvested 
adipose tissue within a single clinical procedure (bedside).  The adipose tissue is 
harvested under sterile conditions, then washed,  then dissociated using 
enzymatic digestion, then the SVF cells are concentrated and returned to the 
patient using a syringe injection to the joint space.  
This IDE application addresses the GID SVF -2 medical device and GID SVF 
Procedure  Pack produced by Th e GID Group, Inc. for collection and processing 
of adipose tissue including collect, wash, dissociate, separate, and concentrate 
SVF cells from human lipoaspirate.  The GID Group, Inc. and its contract 
manufacturer are both FDA -registered and audited, MDD certified, and 
ISO13485:2003 certified companies.  Both maintain a Quality Management 
System (QMS) compliant with the Quality System Regulation (QSR) to provide 
the framework of controls for the facility and processes employed in the 
manufacture, assembly,  labeling and distribution of medical devices.  
This clinical trial with this IDE proposal is a multi -center, randomized, double -
blinded, controlled clinical study to investigate the safety and efficacy in the use 
of adult autologous adipose SVF for the tre atment of pain associated with joint

OA.  The hypothesis of this trial is that the proposed clinical outcome measures 
of reduced pain resulting from the treatment of OA of the knee joint with 
autologous adipose SVF tissue will be superior to a placebo cont rol treatment.

An SVF dose escalation design will be included in the study.  The first 
fifteen (15) subjects will be randomized to low dose or placebo as follows: 
nine (9) subjects will receive the low SVF dose (15 x 106 cells) and six (6) 
subjects will receive the placebo (no SVF cells).  When all fifteen (15) 
subjects have reached the 6 week follow up the cohort of 15 will be 
evaluated for adverse events and any safety issues.  If there are two or less 
adverse events of less than grade 4 on the Com mon Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale  in the low SVF dose group, then the 
remaining twenty -four (24) subjects will be randomized to receive the 
following doses: four (4) subjects will receive the low SVF dose (15 x 106 
cells), thirteen (13) subjects will receive the high SVF dose (30 x 106 
cells) and seven (7) subjects will receive the placebo dose.

2.5.3 Study treatment  
The subject’s adipose tissue will be acquired through liposuctio n of the 
abdomen or thigh and will be suctioned directly into the GID SVF -2 
device.  The harvested adipose tissue will be enzymatically digested and 
centrifuged in the same GID SVF -2 device to produce SVF cells.   The 
subject will then be treated with an i njection in the knee of  4 ml of LR 
containing one of the following:

a) Low Dose - 15 x 106 (range 12.5  x 106 – 17.2 x 106) nucleated SVF 
cells;  
b) High Dose - 30 x 106 (range 27.5  x 106 – 32.5 x 106) nucleated SVF 
cells; or  
c) Placebo - 0 SVF cells.   
Treatment will be randomized and both the physician and subject will be 
blinded to the dosage.  
2.5.4 Study treatment procedures  
1. Liposuction  
The procedure will be performed at the clinical site according to 
standard clinical practice for all participants.   
2. Process ing of Collected Fat  
The fat will be processed by the processing technician, who will not 
be involved in safety or efficacy evaluation.  Processing of the fat will 
be done immediately after harvest in the operating room on a sterile 
table that is not visib le to any study personnel.  The processing 
technician will use the GID SVF Procedure Pack for fat processing.    
All tissue contacting equipment (GID SVF -2, syringes, tubing) will 
be sterile single -use laboratory disposables.  All procedures must be 
follow ed as outlined in the IFU.   Figure 2 shows an overview of the 
adipose lipoaspirate processing.

3. Dose Escalation, Dosing and Release Cr iteria  
The first group of 15 subjects will be randomized to  receive one of 
the following  SVF doses :   
• Low SVF dose, 15 x 106 (range 12.5 x 106 – 17.5 x 106) 
nucleated SVF cells, suspended in 4  ml of lactated 
Ringer’s  (9 subjects) or  
• Placebo  control , 0 SVF cells, in 4 ml of lactated Ringer’s  
(6 subjects)  
If there are two or less  adverse events of less than grade 4 on the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale , 
then the remaining twenty -four (24) subjects will be randomized to 
receive th e following doses : 
• Low SVF dose,  15 x 106 (range 12.5 x 106 – 17.5 x 106) 
nucleated SVF cells, suspended in 4 ml of lactated 
Ringer’s  (4 subjects)  or 
• High SVF dose, 30 x 106 (range 27.5 x 106 – 32.5 x 106) 
nucleated SVF cells, suspended in 4 ml of lactated  
Ringer’s  (13 subjects) or  
• Placebo control group,  0 SVF cells, in 4 ml of lactated 
Ringer’s  (7 subjects)  
Release Criterion for each injection of the SVF cells will be:  
• a minimum of 70% viability (Chemometec NC -200) cells 
and 
• total nucleated cell count in d ose range (Chemometec NC -
200) and 
• endotoxin assessment using rapid methodology with 
endotoxin  level ≤ 200 EU  per dose  and 
• no gram negative detected .   
The data for the cell yield , viability , endotoxin and gram ID  
assessment s are recorded on the Cell Count Assay  case report  form .  
   
Release Criteria Not Met:    
• If the dose is equal to placebo,  then continue with the 
study checking the ‘Release’ box on the Cell Count Assay 
CRF.  
• If the release criteria are not met, then all criteria will be 
retested with only one retest allowed  per release criteria .   
• If the retest does not meet the release criteria,  then the 
patient is withdrawn from the study  (see Section 3.3).

Release Criteria Are Met:  
• The box for ‘Release’ is checked and the processing 
technician signs  the Cell Count Assay form.  
The form will not be added to the subject’s binder until after the study 
has been completed and all unblinding is complete.  
4. Injection of Cells  
The anteromedial  or superolateral portal  of the treatment knee will be 
prepare d for injection. These  location s were chosen  due to ease of 
access into the intra -articular space and to avoid injecting into the fat 
pad of the knee.  No sedation or pain medication will be administered 
to the patient.  An ethyl chlorid e topical anesthetic will be sprayed on 
the injection site until the skin color changes to white. Lidocaine local 
anesthetic will be injected using a 25 gauge needle to numb the skin 
and subcutaneous tissues. Verification of the needle in the 
intraarticula r space  of the knee  will be done by  visual evidence of 
synovial fluid upon  aspirati on or ultra sound guidance .  The knee will 
be aspirated up to a maximum of 5 ml using an 18 gauge/1.5  inch 
needle.  Then all of the 4  cc SVF cells suspension will be injecte d 
into the intra -articular space through the same 18 gauge/1.5 inch 
needle.    The needle will then be removed and direct pressure over 
the injection site will placed for approximately ten (10) seconds.  
Hemostasis after injection will be confirmed, the in jection site will 
then be cleaned with an alcohol wipe and covered with a sterile 
bandage . This can be removed the next morning. The patient will be 
given crutches and asked to be non -weight bearing on the injected 
knee for two (2) days.  The patient will be encouraged and allowed to 
bend and flex the knee as long as non -weight bearing condition s are 
maintained.  Patients will be given written instructions concerning 
after-injection  and liposuction  care and encouraged to call the 
administering physician at any time with questions and concerns . The 
patient will be asked to wait in the waiting room for 45 minutes 
before leaving.  
2.5.5 Allocation to treatment  
Subjects will be enrolled consecutively at each site.  Due to the objectives 
of the study, the identity of t est and control treatments will not be known 
to investigators, research staff, or subjects.  The following study 
procedures will be in place to ensure double -blind administration of study 
treatments.   
▪ Access to the randomization code will be strictly cont rolled and only 
the processing technician, who will not be involved in safety or 
efficacy evaluation, will know to which group the subject is 
randomized on the day of the surgery.   
▪ The processing technician will process the SVF or placebo syringe out 
of sight of any personnel involved in the study.  The technician will

mask the syringe (tape) before it is seen by any study personnel so 
that no one will be able to identify the treatment by sight.  
2.5.6 Unblinding  
The processing technician will have sole control o f the Identification of 
Treatment by Subject log. If the need arises to unblind the treatment for a 
patient (i.e. adverse event) the processing technician can consult the log 
for treatment identification.   
2.5.7 Treatment adherence  
Each subject will be given a n information sheet containing instructions for 
pre and post -operative care of their knee  and liposuction site .  At all of the 
following study visits each subject will be asked to fill out questionnaires 
and questioned about their knee.     
2.5.8 Withdrawal of s ubjects due to non -compliance  
Subjects may be terminated from the study at the discretion of the PI only 
for reasons related to the study examinations that would jeopardize the 
subject’s health and/or welfare if they were to continue in the study.  
Subject s may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time without 
prejudice.  
Subjects who are withdrawn will not be replaced if they have received 
study treatment and if it is determined that there is not sufficient data for 
analysis the subject’s data will b e removed from analysis.    
2.5.9 Procedures to assess efficacy  
Efficacy will be determined by the change in score on the WOMAC 
questionnaire completed by the patient between baseline and 6 months 
post-op.  Measurements consist of 3 sub scores; 1) pain with 5 qu estions 
and 20 total points; (2) stiffness, with 2 questions and 8 total points and 
(3) functionality with 7 questions and 28 total points, for a total score of 
56 points, the total score  will be  normalized to 100 points.  A decreasing 
score is indicative of a positive change, i.e. less pain, less stiffness and 
more functionality.   
Additionally, at baseline , 6 weeks, 3 months  and 6 months, each subject 
will be asked to rate their pain using a visual analog scale (VAS), a 
horizontal 100 mm line with anchors  of ‘no pain’ and ‘worst imaginable 
pain’.  The patient will be asked to mark a point on the line to indicate 
their pain intensity when climbing or descending stairs.  
 
2.5.10  Procedures to assess safety  
Adverse events will be continuously monitored  by the PIs,  the 
independent Safety Monitor and sponsor  to evaluate safety of the device 
and treatment up to 2 years.

MRI’s will be taken pre -treatment , 6 months  and 1 year  according to the 
following sequence:  
• Sequence: proton density fat saturation (PD fat sat)  
• Sagittal plane only  
• Magnet: 3.0T or 1.5T with knee coil (8 -16 channel)     
2.5.11  Schedule of study visits  
Initial screening may be done over the phone or at the office.  All 
subsequent visits will be at the site offices with the 2 year safety 
evaluation to be complet ed at the office or over the phone  (Appendix A). 
Prior to surgery the subjects will come into the office for an evaluation 
visit where they will be enrolled in the study and the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria will be con ducted.  If they qualify for the study the subject will 
have an MRI of their treatment knee.  Subjects will return to the office 2 
days post -surgery to have the surgery and injection site inspected.  At the 
remaining 6 week, 3 month and 6 month  visits the surgery and injection 
site will be evaluated and the subject will complete the VAS and 
WOMAC questionnaires. MRI’s of the knee will be taken at the 6 month  
and 1 year  visits for evaluation of any adverse changes  to the joint space.  
At the 1 year  safety fo llow-up visit  the subject will return to the office to be 
evaluated for any safety concerns.  Safety assessments will be completed 
using MRI, study questionnaires, and physical examination .  It is anticipated 
that these visits should range from 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the 
type of questions and measurements needed .  The subject  will be contacted 
2 years after surgery for an  additional safety  update.   
2.5.12  Subject Compensation  
There will be no cost to the subjects other than the initial screening visits,  
which will be billed to the subject’s insurance.  Subjects will be given a 
stipend of $ 350.00 to participate in the study to defray the cost to complete 
the 4 post-operative clinical office visits  (Table 1)   Subjects will receiv e 
compensation only at the time of these visits .  Subjects will not be 
compensated for missed visits or visits outside the required 4 visits.

2.6 Study outcome evaluations  
2.6.1 Study endpoints  
Safety: Safety endpoints are adverse events  at any time  point  and MRI of 
the knee at 6 months  and 1 year  for any findings indicating that the device 
is not safe as used . 
Efficacy : This will be achieved if either dose is shown to be superior (i.e., 
less pain , better function and less stiffness ) to the placebo g roup at the 6 -
month time.  The measure of interest is the change in the WOMAC score 
and VAS pain scale from baseline.  The hypotheses of interest are:  
H0: µL = µC and µH = µC 
Ha: µL < µC and/or µH < µC 
2.6.2 Sample size determination  
The samples size determinati on is based on the primary efficacy endpoint 
using the WOMAC score (100 points full scale) and evaluated using 
Dunnett’s multiple comparison with a control one -sided (i.e., superiority) 
test.  Assuming a standard deviation of 14 points and a difference to detect 
(i.e., minimal clinically significant difference) of at least 17 (representing 
about a 33% decrease from baseline) points with α = 0.05 significance 
level and a power of 80% a conservative sample size of 11 subjects per 
group is needed .  This sample  size estimate is based on a Bonferroni 
correction and as such is conservative (i.e., larger than necessary). Thus, 
the goal will be to have no fewer than 11 subjects per treatment group. To 
account for possible exclusions/lost to follow -up of data an addi tional 2 
subjects per treatment group (20%) will be added for a sample size of 13 
subjects per group for a total enrolled sample size of 39 subjects.  
2.6.3 Outcome data and data analysis  
Data analysis will be performed by a trained statistician using appropriat e 
statistical methods and software (e.g. JMP or SAS). Descriptive statistics 
will be presented as means, standard deviations, medians and ranges for 
the continuous variables and as counts and percents for categorical 
variables. An alpha level of 5% will be  used for all analyses, unless 
otherwise stated.  Demographics will be tabulated overall and by relevant 
populations.  Confidence intervals will be provided where appropriate.

The primary efficacy will be evaluated using Dunnett’s multiple 
comparison with a control test (one -sided for superiority).  
The safety analysis will be descriptive and narrative in nature, with SAE's 
and AE's tabulated by body system, preferred term, severity and relation to 
procedure.  
MRIs will be evaluated for any anomalies or safet y issues as observed by 
the PI.  
3 RISK ANALYSIS  
3.1 Anticipated risks  
The Study adds no expected risks or the need for additional safety precautions 
for the subject beyond what they would have for small volume liposuction 
surgery and a knee injection. These are detailed in the Informed Consent 
materials . 
3.2 Adverse event s and  reporting  
3.2.1 Adverse event definitions  
Adverse Event (AE): Any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical 
study of an investigational device; regardless of the causal relationship of 
the problem w ith the device or, if applicable, other study treatment or 
diagnostic product(s).  
Unanticipated adverse event (UAE): Any adverse effect, the frequency, 
specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the clinical s tudy protocol(s).  
Serious adverse event (SAE):  An adverse event is considered “serious” 
if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of 
the following outcomes:  
• death  
• a life -threatening AE  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolo ngation of existing hospitalization  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE): Any serious adverse 
effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death ca used 
by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan or any other unanticipated serious problem associated 
with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
3.2.2 Eliciting adverse event information  
Clinical study subjects will be routinely questioned about adverse effects 
at all study visits.

3.2.3 Recording and assessment of adverse events  
All observed or volunteered advers e events (serious or non -serious) and 
abnormal test findings, regardless of treatment group, if applicable, or 
suspected causal relationship to the investigational device or, if applicable, 
other study treatment or diagnostic product(s) will be recorded in  the 
subjects’ case histories.  For all adverse events, sufficient information will 
be pursued and/or obtained so as to permit 1) an adequate determination of 
the outcome of the effect (i.e., whether the effect should be classified as a 
serious adverse eve nt) and; 2) an assessment of the casual relationship 
between the adverse event and the investigational device or, if applicable, 
the other study treatment or diagnostic product(s).    
Adverse events or abnormal test findings felt to be associated with the 
investigational device or, if applicable, other study treatment or diagnostic 
product(s) will be followed until the effect (or its sequelae) or the 
abnormal test finding resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
sponsor and investigator.  
3.2.4 Abnormal  test findings  
An abnormal test finding (i.e. sterility of SVF) will be classified as an 
adverse event if one or more of the following criteria are met:  
• The test finding is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• The test finding necessitates additional diagnosti c evaluation(s) or 
medical/surgical intervention; including significant additional 
concomitant drug or other therapy (Note: simply repeating a test 
finding, in the absence of any of the other listed criteria, does not 
constitute an adverse effect.)  
• The tes t finding leads to a change in study dosing or exposure or 
discontinuation of subject participation in the clinical study  
• The test finding is considered an adverse event by the sponsor and 
investigator  
If a culture results in a positive sterility test it w ill be considered an 
abnormal test finding and reported to the FDA within 30 days.  This report 
will include results of any investigation into the cause and any corrective 
action taken.  The subject will be monitored for infection or other sign s 
that may b e attributed to the sterility failure .  
If any serious or unexpected adverse  events related to abnormal test 
findings occur due to the device,  the FDA, IRB and other investigators  
will be notified  within 10 days of first learning of the event.  
3.2.5 Causality an d severity assessment  
The sponsor , safety monitor  and investigator will promptly review 
documented adverse events and abnormal test findings to determine 1) if 
the abnormal test finding should be classified as an adverse event; 2) if 
there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by the

investigational device or other study treatments; and 3) if the adverse 
event meets the criteria for a serious adverse event . Adverse events will be 
scaled according to Common Terminology Criteria for Ad verse Events 
(CTCAE, ver . 4.03: June 14, 2010).  
If the sponsor , safety monitor  and/or investigator’s final determination of 
causality is “unknown and of questionable relationship to the 
investigational device or other study treatments,” the adverse event will be 
classified as associated with the use of the investigational device or other 
study treatments  for reporting purposes.  If the sponsor , safety monitor  
and/or investigator’s final determination of causality is “unknown but not 
related to the investig ational device or other study treatments,” this 
determination and the rationale for the determination will be documented 
in the respective subject’s case history.  
3.2.6 Stopping Rules  
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if the intervention is 
associated with adverse effects that call into question the safety of the 
subjects as follows; (1)  if there are 5 or more device related adverse events 
of severity greater than grade 4 on the CTAE scale; (2) if more than 20% 
of subjects (8 subjects) receiving  SVF report an increase in pain to a level 
greater than eight (8) on the VAS pain scale or function decreases more 
than 50% compared to baseline functional assessment using the WOMAC 
function assessment subscale A3; (3) if escalation difficulty in study 
recruitment or retention will significantly impact the ability to evaluate the 
study endpoints; (4)  any new information becomes available during the 
trial that necessitates stopping the trial.  Any subject that has been treated 
prior to stopping the study fo r any reason will be monitored for adverse 
effects and if such events occur the subject will be treated until resolution .    
3.2.7 Reporting adverse events to the FDA  
For any observed or volunteered adverse event that is determined to be a 
UADE or any abnormal t est findings, the investigator shall submit  the 
event  to the sponsor and FDA through the  FDA’s FDA Adverse Event 
Reporting System (FAERS) .   
A copy of this report will be provided to all participating study 
investigators.   
The event  will be submitted to t he FDA as soon as possible and, in no 
event, later than 10 working days after the investigator first receives notice 
of the UADE and 30 days in the case of abnormal test findings  
If, following receipt and investigation of follow -up information regarding 
an adverse event that was previously determined not to be a UADE, the 
sponsor , safety monitor  and/or investigator determines that the event does 
meet the requirements for expedited reporting, the sponsor and/or 
investigator will submit the event to FAERS  as soon as possible, but in no 
event later than 10 working days, after the determination is made.

Subsequent to the initial submission of a completed FAERS , the sponsor 
and/or investigator will submit additional information concerning the 
reported adverse ev ent or abnormal test finding as requested by the FDA.  
3.2.8 Reporting adverse events to the responsible IRB  
For any adverse event determined to be a UADE or any abnormal test 
findings, the investigator will submit a copy of the FAERS report  to the 
IRB as soon as  possible and, in no event, later than 10 working days after 
the sponsor and/or investigator first receives notice of the UADE or 30 
days for an abnormal test finding.  
Follow -up information to reported adverse events and abnormal test 
findings will be subm itted to the IRB as soon as the relevant information 
is available.   
3.3 Withdrawal of subjects prior to completion of the study  
Any subject that has been treated prior to withdrawal from the study for any 
reason will be monitored for adverse effects and if su ch events occur the subject 
will be treated until resolution and their medical outcome is determined.  
4 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE  
The GID SVF -2 device is a sterile single -use disposable canister used for harvesting, 
filtering, separating, and  concentrating autologous stromal vascular fraction cells 
from adipose tissue for reintroduction to the same patient during a single surgical 
procedure for treatment of pain associated with joint osteoarthritis. The GID SVF -2 
device is to be used only with  the GID SVF Procedure Pack.  
The GID SVF -2 device is a canister with various ports molded from polymer 
materials and a convenient tray. The canister is a closed system protecting the tissue 
aspirate through the harvesting process. The harvested tissue is d eposited into the 
canister and filtered to capture the tissue and separate the fluid portion.  
Functional Principle:  
The harvested tissue and fluids are aspirated into a filter in the canister which 
captures the tissue particles and allows fluids through.   The harvested tissue may be 
rinsed with a sterile LR solution injected through the Patient port or Luer port. A 
manual stirring assembly allows the user to mix the tissue and fluids during the 
filtering process. Waste fluids are transferred to a waste cont ainer that is in -line with 
the aspiration device.  
5 MONITORING PROCEDURES  
Monitoring for safety will be conducted by  an independent safety monitor with the 
assistance of the PI and sponsor.  A study monitor will monitor the  study for 
compliance with t he clin ical protocol.

ICH GCP, US Code of Federal Regulations for Protection of Human Subjects (21 
CFR 50.25[a,b], CF R 50.27, and CFR Part 56, Subpart A), the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA, if applicable), and local regulations.  
The Sponsor and/or Investigator will prepare the informed consent form and HIPAA 
authorization and provide the docu ments to IRB for approval.  The written consent 
document will embody the elements of informed consent as described in the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and will also comply with local 
regulations. The Sponsor and Investigator will retain an IRB -approved copy of the 
Informed Consent Form in the study master file.  
A properly executed, written, informed consent will be obtained from each subject 
prior to entering the subject into the trial.  Information should be given in both oral 
and writte n form and subjects (or their legal representatives) must be given ample 
opportunity to inquire about details of the study.  A copy of the signed consent form 
will be given to the subject or legal representative of the subject and the original will 
be main tained with the subject’s study binder.  
8 IRB INFORMATION  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the applicable IRB 
of each participating center prior to study initiation.  UADEs will be reported to the 
IRB in accordance with the stan dard operating procedures and policies of the IRB, 
and the Investigator will keep the IRB informed as to the progress of the study.  The 
Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill i ts responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, consent forms, information concerning patient recruitment, 
payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) will be 
submitted to the IRB.  The IRB’s written unconditional approv al of the study protocol 
and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator before the 
study is initiated.  The IRB’s unconditional approval statement will be transmitted by 
the Investigator to the Sponsor prior to the shipment of study supplies to the site.

During the study, patient data paperwork will be kept using standard patient 
records criteria, confidentiality and information security procedures that include 
limited access, Co -PI oversight of records and secured files.  The data will be 
stored consiste nt with the clinics Records Retention Policies.  
The subject will be assigned an anonymous, unique identifier called the Subject 
ID unrelated to the subject’s name from a list of possible ID’s.  The subject’s 
name and corresponding identifier will be record ed in a study look up 
document, which shall be kept at the study site consistent with confidential 
document policies.  
The subject ID of excluded subjects will not be re -assigned.  Information 
describing the reason(s) for exclusion will be documented on the  
Inclusion/Exclusion CRF.  
CRFs will be labeled with the subject’s Subject ID and no subject identifying 
information will appear on reports,  publications, or other disclosures of clinical 
study outcomes.  
The sponsor and investigator will retain the specifie d records and reports for up 
to two years after the marketing application is approved for the investigational 
device; or, if a marketing application is not submitted or approved for the 
investigational device, until two years after investigations under the  IDE have 
been discontinued and the FDA so notified.  
10.3 Data Management  
The sites will send CRFs to the sponsor for data entry.  CRFs may be sent via 
FedEx, fax or uploaded to the secure, HIPAA compliant share site.  Data from 
the CRFs will be entered into a clinical data management system (CDMS) by 
the sponsor.   
The data man agement system will have verifications and restrictions on data 
entry.  The data entry will be 100% reviewed by an independent reviewer for 
accuracy.  Erroneous, questionable or missing data will be collected on a Data 
Clarification  Form  (DCF)  for each sit e and sent to the site for correction.  The 
DCF  will have an area for the site to make corrections or the site may make the 
correction on the original CRF and return to the sponsor.  
Once all data has been entered, clarification and queries have been resolv ed, and 
the data is determined to be clean the database will be declared locked.

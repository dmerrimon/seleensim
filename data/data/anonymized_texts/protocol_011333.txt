4. Background /Rationale 
Hospital admission and readmission have been a n interest as an important driver of healthcare costs (AHRQ – 
Au-DH).1  In 2014, CMS implemented a COPD readmission penalty with assumptions that 30 -day hospital 
readmissions were in part related to quality of care  received while in hospital .  Interest has focused on 
interventions to reduce COPD readmission with systematic reviews expressing doubt about the effectiveness 
of such int erventions.2,3  From a patient perspective, exacerbations cause significant decrements in health -
related quality -of-life.4,5,6,7   Across health systems, exacerbations drive health care expenditures with as many 
as half of patients requiring readmission within 6 months.   The time after discharge  (DC)  for hospital can be 
viewed as a sensitive period where the likelihood of relapse peaks within 8 to 12 weeks after the incident 
exacerbation.  How to deliver guideline recommended services in a timely fashion is a challenge across most 
health systems.  
Within North America, the Department of Veterans  Affairs provides care to Veterans at more than 1000 
primary care settings and 150 medical centers.   To meet  the needs of Veterans across all instances of health 
care settings, VA needs to redesign care delivery systems regardless of locale.  VA’s current  specialty care 
system reflects a fee- for-service model where specialists wait for patient referrals and do not assume 
responsibility for the health of a population of patients.  This approach does not take advantage of the VA 
integrated health system incr easing risk of care fragmentation.  Specialists also are geographically 
concentrated at major medical centers that are culturally and physically separated from the patient's medical 
home. Determining how to deploy existing specialties using a primary care and patient centric approach 
represents an important opportunity to improve access, timeliness, and quality -of-care.  
 
5. Rationale and objectives  
To be success ful, health systems require a pragmatic health system -level solution . In this intervention, w e 
propose to realign  specialty care to collaborate with primary care teams and focus on patient needs and 
guideline concordance after discharge from hospital for COPD exacerbation.  The intervention was designed to: 
1) support primary care t eams in the care of patients recently discharged for a COPD exacerbation, 2) utilize 
population health methods to identify patients at risk of readmission, 3) integrate proactive collaborative care 
12/30/2020   Page  | 5 with specialty care and primary care teams 4) deliver care  within the context of existing services and ongoing 
care, 5) leverage data systems and virtual care to facilitate improved delivery, and 6) respect the role of primary 
care while attempting to minimize their workload.  Our goal is to improve 1) patient quality -of-life as measured 
by the Clinical COPD questionnaire and 2) reduce 180- day hospital readmission and mortality after hospital 
discharge.   
6. Setting 
We will conduct this trial at the VA Pug et Sound Health Care System in Washington State, and the Boise VA 
Medical Center  in Idaho . These are two academic medical facilities within VISN 20.  We will include their  
accompanying 10 community-based outpatient clinics. These facilities cover a wide ge ographic range, 
including six that are designated as rural facilities.  
 
7. Overall Design  
We will perform  a modified stepped wedge clinical 
trial which is a variant of a clustered randomized 
cross -over design .8,9   Our focus will be to evaluate a 
mult ifaceted intervention designed to improve 
qual ity-of-life and decrease rate of hospital 
readmission and mortality among patients who were 
discharged from hospital with an exacerbation of 
COPD  (Figure 2).  We chose a modified stepped 
wedge design for several reasons: 1) resource 
constraints require a staggered roll out of the 
intervention; 2) timing is randomized, allowing all 
providers to eventually receiv e the intervention; 3) 
utilizes within and across provider comp arisons 
maximiz ing efficiency and  allowing the fewest 
number of providers to be enrolled because analyses 
utilize within provider and between provider comparisons increasing power .   
 
In this  stepped wedge design, clusters of teams transition from the control group to the intervention group 
over time .  For this trial  (Figure 2) , we will assemble  30 clusters of primary care teams (see Section 8.4) .   Each 
primary care team consists of between 1-4 primary care clinicians.  The number of primary care teams allocated to each cluster will be done to ensure a balanced number of patients with COPD in each cluster.  All 
clusters of teams  will start in the control group  (first column of Figure 2) .  At the beginning of e very 30- day 
period , a randomly selected cluster of primary care teams will transition to the intervention group such that 
all clusters will be in the intervention group in the 30th period  (last column of Figure 2) .  The first control 
period (period 0) started on May 12, 2015. 
 
We describe the trial flow in the following sections as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2.  Transition of primary care team clusters 
from control to intervention.

8. Provider Eligibility , Recruitment, and Consent  
8.1. Eligibility:  
We will obtain names and contact information for providers from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW).10 
We will invite all PCPs  (physicia ns, physician residents, physician’s assistants, and nurse practitioners) from  
the V A Puget Sound  and the Boise VA Medical Center  to participate.  The only exception will be PCPs who 
agreed to be co -investigators on this trial.   
 
8.2. Recruitment:  
We will approach providers using the following methods:  
Primary c are t eam meetings :  We will introduce the study at primary care  team meetings  and grand rounds .  
At the end of the presentation, we will ask providers to complete a n enrollment sheet indicating their 
willingness , or not,  to participate and a short demographic survey.  Providers will either return the enrollment 
forms to trial staff after the meeting or mail it to us after the meeting.  F or providers who d o not indica te their 
willingness , we will send an email inviting them to participate (see next section) .   
 
Email:  We will invite providers via email if they d o not return an enrollment sheet after  a team meeting or if 
they are hired after the intervention launches .  The email will contain a n overview of the study, and a  link to a 
detailed study description and the demographic survey, as well study contact information.  The email will ask 
provider s to review the material and repl y if they wish to be excluded .  The email explains that we will 
consider them enrolled in the study if  they do not respond within one week  (default opt -in), and that they 
could withdraw at any time.

12/30/2020   Page  | 7 8.3. Consent:  
We will consider a provider consented once they return the enrollment sheet , respond to the invitation email 
indicating that they want to participate , or we receive no response to the email within one  week.  
 
8.4. Provider c lustering/ randomization : 
We will group VA Primary care teams based on continuity and usual cross -coverage purposes.  Primary care 
teams consist of 1- 4 providers .  We will group consented providers into 30 clusters.  When assembling 
provider clusters , to the extent possible, we will group teams 1) that had  shared staffing (e.g. nurses, medical 
support assistants), 2 ) are from the same site, and 3) when combined ha ve relatively even distributions of 
empaneled clinic  patients with a COPD diagnosis.  By cluster ing this way , we minimize potential 
contamination of providers in the control arm by providers who had already crossed into the intervention.   
 
The trial biostatistician will randomly assign each cluster to one of 30 30- day time period s.  Each period the 
next cluster of PCP teams will transition from the control to the intervention period .  When  new providers  join  
a primary care team, they assume their team’s cluster and randomization time period. If providers change teams after randomization , they will  retain their original cluster assignment.  Any new teams created will be 
randomly assigned into one of the remaining intervention time periods such that they will have  at least one 
time period in the control and intervention period s.   
 
9. Index discharges   
An index discharge is the date of a hospital discharge  involving care for COPD for a patient under the care of 
an enrolled provider  starting May 12, 2015.  We will interrogate the CDW daily to identify all eligible 
discharges as described below.   
 
9.1. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) discharge diagnosis codes: 
We will define a COPD exacerbation as a primary ICD- 9 primary discharge diagnosis of COPD ( 491%, 492%, 
493.2%, or 496%), or a primary discharge diagnosis of respiratory failure (518.51, 518.53, 518.81, 518.83, 518.84) with any secondary diagnosis of COPD. In October 2015, VA will  switch from the ICD-9 to the ICD-10 coding 
convention ( J41.0, J41.1, J41.8, J42., J43.0, J43.1, J43.2, J43.8, J43.9, J44.0, J44.1, or  J44.9 for COPD and J80., J96.00, 
J96.01, J96.02, J96.10, J96.11, J96.12, J96.20, J96.21, J96.22, J96.90, J96.91, J96.92 for respiratory failure ).  
 We will exclude patients who were miscoded as having COPD discharge.  Study coordinators  will review the 
electronic health  record ( EHR ) to confirm that t he patient  received care consistent with a COPD exacerbation.  
A single coordinator will review discharges where COPD is the primary  discharge diagnosis.  For cases of 
uncertainty, a second coordinator will review.  If discordant, a study clinician will adjudicate and make the 
final decision.  
Discharges for respirato ry failure with a secondary COPD diagnosis are often more complicated . In this 
situation, two coordinators will independently review and adjudicate with a clinician when discordan t.   
 
9.2. Discharges with missing ICD codes:  
For discharges with a missing ICD discharge code, we will employ a N atural Language Processing algorithm 
to identify potential index discharges .  This algorithm identifie s discharges with  pre-defined keywords  
(%COPD%, %Bronchitis%, %Bronchiectasis%, %Bronc hospasm%, %Emphysema%, %Acute% and %Bronc%, 
%SOB% and %Bronchitis%, %Chronic% and %Bronc%, %Chronic% and %Pulm%, %Chronic% and 
12/30/2020   Page  | 8 %Obstruct%, Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, or Reactive Airway Disease) contained within the admission 
diagnosis or discharge summary text. Once identified, coordinators will review  the EHR to confirm the 
hospitalization covered treatment for a COPD exacerbation.   
 
9.3. Additional eligibility criteria.   
• A patient may have more than one  index discharge if the 180- day outcomes period for the prior index 
discharge is completed and was with a provider in the control group.  Once a patient has a discharge with 
a provider in the intervention group, they cannot have additional index discharges.  We will include each 
patient’s first discharge only in primary analyses.  
• We will exclude patients for whom we would not be able to provide recommendations including those 
discharged to a domiciliary unit, a nursing home, respite care, or to hospice.  
• We considered patients discharged and readmitted within 12 hours to have a continuous hospital 
admission.   
 
10. Intervention  
10.1. Recommendations for COPD guideline care : 
Each week , for patients with a new index discharge and under the care of a provider in the intervention group, 
we will perform the following:  
Chart abstraction: A study coordinator will cut and paste pertinent sections of the EHR  into an abstraction 
template ( Appendix 1).  These abstractions will includ e notations from emergency care, discharge summaries, 
primary care, pulmonary/sleep, social work, advanced directives, post-discharge telephone calls, and procedures and imaging studies .   
 
Clinical review : The intervention team, consisting of pulmonary, primary care, and pharmacy providers, and 
study coordinators will convene to prepare recommendations for each patient with an abstraction as follows:  
• Clinical lead:  
o A pulmonologist or PCP team member will be designated to lead the review  each week  
o Reviews the abstractions, and/or EHR as needed, to draft a recommendations checklist 
(Appendix 2 ).  The checklist will include:  
 Recommendations for diagnostic testing, medications, therapies/referrals, and/or 
follow- up, addressing any gaps in contemporary COPD guideline recommended 
care4,11 and related co- morbidities . 
 Draft of the recommendations note that will be placed into the EHR for the PCP ’s 
review.     
• Review meeting:  
o Moderat or: clinical lead . 
o Attendees: a clinical team consisting of at least one pulmonologist and one PCP, with input by the pharmacist as needed , and coordinators . 
o Review: the clinical team will discuss each patient’s history, consulting the abstraction and 
EHR as needed, and identify any gaps in guideline COPD/comorbidity care . 
• Recommendations:  
o Final recommendations: modify draft recommendations checklist as appropriate per team review  
o Language/content: ensure that notations will be acceptable to primary care providers.  For 
example, smoking cessation counseling:   
12/30/2020   Page  | 9  Do not recommend if there have been notations reflecting previous discussions.  
 Do offer recommendations such as addition of pharmacotherapy for smok ing cessation 
if none has been previously offered. 
o No recommendations: if a patient is receiving all guideline care, reinforce the excellent work . 
 
Entering recommendations and/or order s into EHR:  We will provide recommendations to the PCP timed to 
coincide with the patient’s post- discharge clinic follow -up (usually within two weeks of discharge) as follows:  
• EHR notation :  
o Enter note: a study coordinator  will cut and paste the finalized recommendation s note into the 
EHR as an E- Consult note for the lead clinician to sign.   
o Lead study clinician signs: once entered, the clinician will receive an EHR alert that they have 
a note ready for signature.   
o Additional signers: To ensure awareness, we will add  the patient’s PCP  and pulmonologist, if 
any, as additional signer s. If the PCP is a resident, we will add the attending physician as a 
signer .  
o Questions: The note will encourage  the PCP to ask any questions about the recommendation s, 
or any other elements of their OPD care,  by responding with an addendum to the note, 
through encrypted email, or telephone.  
• Enter unsigned orders:   
o A study  coordinator will enter any recommended orders  notated on the finali zed. 
recommendations checklist  as an unsigned order o n behalf of the PCP  to sign .  
o For any questions that arise, the coordinator will seek guidance from the lead clinician.  
• PCP reviews recommendations :  
o View alert: o nce entered, the PCP will receive an EHR alert that an order  is awaiting signature.   
o Signs, modifies, or cancels orders: the PCP may choose to sign the order as is, modify the 
order , or decline t he order a s appropriate given their personal knowledge of the patient’s 
clinical condition .   
o Autonomy: this process e nsur es the PCP maintains autonomous care of the patient.   
• Recommendations requiring more clinical context:  
o We will elaborate on recommendations that require more clinical context in the E- consult  note 
but will not enter  any related orders on behalf of the PCP.   
 
10.2. In-services:  
The study pharmacist will provide  periodic training to residents on correct use of inhalers available in the VA 
formulary.  
 
11. Blinding: 
Because we will only review for recommendations patients whose PCP was in the intervention, it is not 
possible for anyone on the study team to be blinded for the intervention .  Patient self -report outcomes 
collected over the telephone were collected by a coordinator blinded to the patient’ s intervention status.  
 
12. Outcome  and Baseline  Assessments  
We will assess the following  using a combination of data extracted from CDW, EHR chart review, and self-
report surveys (Table 1) .  For patient self -report , we will mail an invitation to complete surveys six weeks after 
their index discharge.  The mailing  will includ e a cover letter inform ing them that their provider is  taking part 
in the study and asking for their input about their satisfaction with their COPD care and COP D-related health.  
12/30/2020   Page  | 10 The mailing also will includ e an Information Statement with detailed information about the study.  The letter 
will ask them to either return completed surveys by mail, or to return a postcard indicating they do  not want 
to participate or t hat they want more information through a telephone call.  For those who do not respond 
after two weeks, we  will follow up with a telephone call.  For those who prefer, we administered the surveys 
over the telephone.   We describe provider self -report metho ds below.  
 
12.1. Primary o utcome  measures 
Hospital readmission and mortality :  assess 180 days after the index discharge with a composite measure of 
any hospital readmission or death.  
COPD specific health status :  measured with the Clinical COPD Questionnaire  (CCQ),12-14 which consists of 10 
items that encompass three domains (symptoms, functional state, mental state).  Scores range from 0-to- 6 with 
higher scores indicating better  health. The minimally important difference (MID) is 0.39 with a standard error 
of 0.21.     
 
12.2. Secondary measures 
Secondary outcomes - patient -reported: 
General health status: measure using  the Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR -12),15,16 which consists of 12 
items  yielding a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) score of 0 -100, 
with higher scores reflecting better health.  Our outcome is the PCS score, which has a national mean of 27.0 
(SD=8.4) among Veterans admitted for COPD.17 
Patient satisfaction :  assess patients’ satisfaction with respect to the post- discharge primary care follow -up visit 
using  sections of the  Patient Care Medical Home Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients (SHEP)  (Appendix 3 ).  
We will use the  6-item communication, 3 -item medication decisions, and the 2-item self- management 
composite scores, as well as single- item questions covering coordination of care, information, and provider 
rating.   
Secondary outcomes - provider experience and perception:  
To assess providers’ experience and perception of  the intervention,  we will use a convergent mixed methods18 
approach, c oncurrently using quantitative and qualitative measures.18 For quantitative measures, we 
develop ed a brief 10-item survey ( Appendix 4 ), based on our work with the VA Office of Specialty Care 
Transformation evaluation, that assessed topics directly relevant to our intervention including satisfaction 
with the consultation process, workload, patient access to specialty care, and quality of care delivered.  Within 
two weeks of posting recommendation s for their first intervention patient, w e will emai l providers asking 
them to complete this survey on -line.  For those who do not respond, we will mail the survey with a return 
inter -office envelope.     
 For the qualitative approach, coordinators will conduct semi -structured interviews using scripted, open -ended 
questions and semi-structured prompts ( Appendix 5
) to elicit thick descriptions that capture the depth and 
breadth of providers’ experiences including: acceptability; fit with practice; feasibi lity and satisfaction with the 
intervention; and its perceived effectiveness.  We will invite providers to participate in the interview after the ir 
first intervention patient is discharged.  We anticipated needing to interview no more than 30 providers to 
reach thematic saturation, the point at which no new or novel insights are provided 19 
 
12/30/2020   Page  | 11 12.3. Other measures: 
Uptake of c are recommendations:   A coordinator will use the finalized recommendations checklist to enter 
recommendations into the study database.  A second coordinator, blinded to the first coordinator’s entries, 
also will enter the recommendations.  The coordinators will discuss any disc repancies, clarifying with that 
week’s lead clinician as needed to resolve. Six weeks after an index discharge for a patient of an intervention provider, two study coordinators  will independently conduct EHR chart reviews to determine which of the 
care recommendations  have been endorsed and completed by the PCP.  They will discuss any determination 
for which they did not agree and consul t with a study investigator for resolution as appropriate.  
 
 
Quality of COPD care:   
Using  a composite measure of quality metrics  endorsed by the National Quality Forum20, we will use a 
combination of data from CDW and EHR chart review to assess the overall quality of COPD care 180 days 
after discharge.  Similar to the approach used by Lindenauer21 et al., our measure will dichotomized those 
patients who achieved all of the recommended care processes for which they were eligible (score =1) versus 
those who did not (score =0).  Individual measures may be assessed individually or grouped based on whether 
they are generic (tobacco use, vaccinations) or COPD specific (medications, spirometry). These recommended 
processes include:  
• Assessment of smoking status  
• Referral/counseling for smoking cessation, if current or recent quitter (within 1 year) 
• Assessment of resting O2 saturation or PaO2  
• Provision of O2 for long-term continuous therapy for patients with SpO2<88% or PaO2<55mhg 
• Addition of at least one controller agent (LABA, LAMA, ICS, Roflumilast) when appropriate  
• Confirmation of COPD by lung function assessment  
• Offer, confirmation or administration of influenza vaccination during appropriate season 
• Offer, confirmation or administration of pneumococcal vaccination 
• Other inhaled therapy types --date filled 
• Systemic corticosteroid therapy types --date filled  
• Antibiotic therapy types-- date filled

12.4. Baseline Characteristics:  
• Sociodemographic: patient and provider characteristics at enrollment  using a combination of CDW 
and self- report.   
 
We will use CDW to identify/calculate the following:  
• COPD and medications: results from patients’ most recent  pulmonary function tests and pulmonary 
medication prescriptions  over the past 12 months .    
• Days exposed to steroid: number of days a patient was prescribed an oral corticosteroid in the year 
prior to index admission.  
• COPD exacerbations not requiring hospitalization: number of outpatient exacerbations over the year 
prior to the index discharge, defined by a primary outpatient ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis associated with a clinical event and prescription for an antibiotic and systemic corticosteroid within 2 days of the diagnosis. 
12/30/2020   Page  | 12 • Comorbidities and health status indicators: collected information on common comorbidities that 
comprised the health inventory checklist used in previous intervention studies22,23 for the year prior 
to and through the index admission:  
o diagnoses for COPD and common co -morbidities such as diabetes, liver disease, chronic heart 
failure, vascular disease, and the like to include diagnoses that comprise the Charl son 
comorbidity index24 
o number of all -cause admissions 
o number of inpatient COPD  exacerbations 
o number of COPD outpatient exacerbation 
o length of admission  
o Intensive care unit hours  during index admission

12.5. Remuneration:  
We remunerated participant $20 for survey completion.  We did not pay providers .   
 
13. Analytic Approach 
Our modified stepped wedge design, through its randomized intervention allocation, offers several 
advantages to interval validity compared to observational approaches. However, our clustered design also 
require s additional analytic evaluation comp ared to a simple two- arm randomized trial.9  The primary 
outcome measure is COPD hospital readmission/mortality within 180 days as assessed through the CDW.  
Time zero for intervention patients is the start of the period when the provider cluster is  randomized to 
receive the intervention.  Time zero for control patients is the start of each 30- day period (wedge) while the 
provider cluster remained unexposed to the intervention.  Provider clusters r andomized to receive the 
intervention at later time periods will accrue fewer patients than clusters randomized to earlier periods.  We will present the analysis for hospital readmission as the example for the analytic approach that would also apply for our secondary outcome measures.  
 
13.1.  Models 
We will use  mixed -effects linear regression or logistic regression as appropriate for the outcome of interest25 
(180- day readmission or death, CCQ Total Score, VR -12 PCS) with clustering by provider: 𝑔𝑔�E�𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖�𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖,𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]��=
𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖𝛃𝛃+𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖], where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is the outcome for patient i and  𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖] is a random effect for provider j seen by patient i  such 
that, across providers, the 𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]’s are assumed independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Normal (0,𝜎𝜎𝛼𝛼2). 𝛃𝛃 
is a 7 × 1 vector of fixed effects regression coefficients, and 𝐗𝐗 𝑖𝑖 is a 1 × 7 vector containing the following fixed 
effects terms for patient i : a constant term (identical across patients), an indicator for patient i’s receipt of the 
intervention ( X𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 1 if patient i  received the intervention, X𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖= 0 otherwise), three time-
based restricted cubic spline terms for patient i, the number of days in the past year that patient i was exposed 
to systemic corticosteroids, and the number of COPD exacerbations not requiring admission experienced by 
patient i in the past year. The logistic link function was used for the 180- day readmission or death GLMM such 
that E�𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖�𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖,𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]�=𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖=  �𝑒𝑒𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖𝛃𝛃+𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]� �1 +𝑒𝑒𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖𝛃𝛃+𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]� � . The identity link function was used f or the CCQ Total 
Score and VR -12 PCS GLMMs such that E�𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖�𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖,𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]�=𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖=𝐗𝐗𝑖𝑖𝛃𝛃+𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗[𝑖𝑖]. 
 
13.2. Sampling and non- response bias and missing data  
We will perform an intention -to-treat analysis.  The analysis will include all patients in the groups and time 
period which they were randomly assigned to begin receiving treatment, regardless of their adherence with 
the treatment and/or subsequent participation. An adjusted odds ratio will be estimated to compare control 
and intervention group odds of 180- day readmission or death, and adjustment mean differences will be 
estimated to compare control and intervention group means for CCQ Total Score and VR -12 PCS. In the event 
of missing outcome data, the primary analysis of the respective outcome will be based o n outcome data 
imputed under a multiple imputation using chained equations procedure, with inference from 70 models of 
imputed data combined using Rubin’s Rules. Sensitivity complete- case analyses will be performed for 
outcomes with missing values to assess whether direction of association or statistical significance is impacted 
by a change in missing data approach. 
 
12/30/2020   Page  | 14 13.3. Sample size and study power  
For the sample size calculation,9 let the design have I  clusters, T  time points, and N individuals sampled per 
cluster per time interval.  Assume the model, 𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗=𝜇𝜇+𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖+𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗+𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝜃𝜃+𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗, where 𝛼𝛼 𝑖𝑖 is a random effect for 
cluster i such that 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖~𝑁𝑁(0,𝜏𝜏2), 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 is a fixed effect corr esponding to time interval j , 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 is an indicator of the 
treatment mode in cluster i at time j (1=intervention; 0=control), 𝜃𝜃 is treatment effect and 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗=∑𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑁𝑁⁄𝑘𝑘  are 
independent and identically distributed 𝑁𝑁(0,𝜎𝜎2) and 𝜎𝜎2𝑖𝑖𝑁𝑁⁄.  Let 𝑌𝑌 𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗 be the mean for cluster i  at time j .  
Assume testing the hypothesis 𝐻𝐻 0:𝜃𝜃= 0 versus 𝐻𝐻𝐴𝐴:𝜃𝜃=𝜃𝜃𝐴𝐴, where 𝜃𝜃𝐴𝐴 is the treatment effect size.  The 
approximate power for conducting a two -tailed test of size alpha is 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝
𝑒𝑒𝑝𝑝=Φ��𝜃𝜃𝐴𝐴�𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑝𝑝�𝜃𝜃�� � �−𝑍𝑍1−𝛼𝛼 2⁄� 
where Φ is the cum ulative standard normal distribution function, 𝑍𝑍 1−𝛼𝛼 2⁄ is the (1−𝛼𝛼 2⁄)𝑡𝑡ℎ quantile of the 
standard normal distribution function and 𝜃𝜃 � is the estimated treatment effect size.  Let 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗= 0 if cluster i 
receives the control at time j  and let 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗= 1 if cluster i receives the intervention at time j .   Thus with this 
matrix 𝑿𝑿 and assuming equal N  per cluster per time interval, then assume 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉
𝑝𝑝�𝜃𝜃��=
[𝐼𝐼𝜎𝜎2(𝜎𝜎2+𝑇𝑇𝜏𝜏2)] [(𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼−𝑊𝑊 )𝜎𝜎2+(𝐼𝐼2+𝐼𝐼𝑇𝑇𝐼𝐼−𝑇𝑇 𝑊𝑊−𝐼𝐼𝑉𝑉)𝜏𝜏2] ⁄  where 𝐼𝐼=∑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗, 𝑊𝑊 =∑�∑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑖𝑖�2
𝑗𝑗  and 𝑉𝑉=
∑�∑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗�2
𝑖𝑖 . This variance equation is used in the power calculation.  We have approached the power estimates 
conservatively allowing for a lower proportion of subjects who may experience hospital readmissions, 
allowing for regression to the mean.  
We assume 30 unidirectional movements from control to intervention among 30 clusters (clinics) and 15 individuals sampled per cluster per time interval. We assume a significance level of alpha = 0.05. We assume 
baseline hospital readmission of 0.40 with a 10% relative reduction to 0.36, baseline CCQ of 0.40 with a 10% relative reduction to 0.36, and baseline SF-12 of 0.35 with an 11% relative increase to 0.39. We assume each 
outcome to have a coefficient of variation equal to 0.1. Under these assumptions, our power is estimate d for 
hospital readmission, CCQ, and SF-12 analyses to be 0.874, 0.874, and 0.889, respectively. 
 
13.4. Qualitative analyses   
We will conduct q ualitative data collection and analysis concurrently. We will conduct d ata analysis using 
simultaneous deductive and inductive content analysis26. We will upload transcripts to ATLAS.t i.17 13 for 
coding and data management. Coding will use  audio recordings and transcriptions simultaneously to ensure 
transcription fidelity, and capture participant inflection not contained in written transcripts. We will conduct 
deductive content analysis through the identification of quotes and phrases that fit within pre- identified and 
defined a -priori categories. A -priori categories  to be  included: acceptability, feasibility, provider satisfaction, 
sustainability, barriers, facilitators, intrusions, collaboration, engagement and perceived patient outcomes. Inductive content analysis will be conducted through open/unstructured coding, allowing for the 
identification of emergent , previously unidentified or unexpected themes . This will allow us to capture data 
that did not fit into a- priori categories. Coding will continue until thematic saturation: the point at which 
subsequent data failed to produce new findings
 19.  
 
An important component of mixed methods is the ability to compare and contrast the findings from each data 
source.27 “Triangulation” describes a process by which data collected from multiple data sources are used 
comparatively, broadening and validating the definition and understanding of comp lex cons tructs. We will 
compare  the survey derived satisfaction ratings from the full sample with the coded constructs that we have 
identified from the qualitative data.  We will assess if there is concordance or discordance between these scores/constructs with a particular focus on whether the qualitative constructs offer some mechanism for 
understanding sources or satisfaction or dissatisfaction.  
 
12/30/2020   Page  | 15 14. Protection of Human Subjects  
14.1. Minimal risk  
Since the intervention will be at the provider level and represents an enc ouragement of a variant of standard 
of care, the IRB determined that the study intervention presents minimal risks. 
 
14.2. Consent  
Using methods described above we will consent PCPs  to receive guideline care recommendations ( Section 8)  
for their patients discharged with COPD and to complete self -report surveys and interviews   (Section 12.2) 
under a Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent.  The IRB does not require informed conse nt for 
activities  that do not directly engage the patient by the study team; therefore, we will collect information about 
patients under Waiver of Informed Consent.  For patient reported outcomes, w e will provide an information 
sheet and opportunity to add ress questions.  We will invite patients to complete self- report surveys ( Section 
12) approximately six weeks after their index discharge under a Waiver of Documentation of Informed 
Consent.  
 
14.3. Data and safety monitoring  
Adverse events: Although all clinical decisions will be  left with the patient’s primary care clinician, there is an unlikely, but 
small chance for unanticipated adverse events.  For example, recommendations may not consider a unique patient circumstance that is not well d ocumented in the chart, yet the provider accepts the recommendations 
without review, resulting in worse outcomes.  As such, our monitoring entity consists of Dr. David Au, the 
study P rincipal Investigator, and a clinical researcher with expertise in pulmonary medicine and not part of 
the study team, Dr. Kristina Crothers.  We will not have a formal data and safety monitoring committee or 
board.    
Based on previous work with a cohort of 3764 patients hospitalized for COPD, we identified  diagnoses 
affecting at least 1% of patients during their initial hospital admission and subsequent admissions and 
outpatient visits over the year following their initial hospitalization.  We will consider any occurrence of these 
events to be expected .  All deaths and all- cause re -admissions will be considered expected.  
 Systematic adverse event review will occur  after a patient’s 180 -day outcomes period when a coordinator will 
review the EHR for urgent care notes, hospital admissions, and PCP visits. A c oordinato r will prepare reports 
summarizing events involving urgent care, admissions, or respiratory symptoms , along with event outcomes 
and any study recommendations . A member of the monitoring entity will review for expectedness, 
relatedness , and severity.   We w ill reported serious, unexpected events to the IRB within five days, and other 
events at annual review. We will process ad hoc events discovered during the six- week review of which study 
intervention recommendations were adopted in the same way. 
 
Given tha t the intervention is a variant of normal care and that the likelihood for unanticipated adverse events 
is low, we will not have formal stopping rules for safety, efficacy, and futility are not proposed.   
 
Care recommendation fidelity:  
Prior to study launch, the study team will conduct mock reviews using actual patients discharged with a 
COPD diagnosis.  We will continue reviews until the team has reached consensus about types of 
recommendations, orders, and standardized language we will  use for providers in the intervention.   
12/30/2020   Page  | 16 We will prepare a detailed “how- to” guide to entering notes and orders in the EHR for coordinators to follow.  
Using the guide, coordinators will enter orders into the EHR for a test patient until they have demonst rated 
100% accuracy as assessed by a study clinician.  For intervention patients, we will require c oordinators to 
consult with a study clinician before entering any information in the EHR about which they have any 
questions. 
 
14.4. Data management and confidenti ality  
This project require s the creation, maintenance, and analysis of a large, multivariate, database that includes a 
variety of measures from multiple sources.  Recognizing that the success of this study critically depends on the 
quality of the data collected, systematic data collection, quality control, and data management procedures, we 
will implement: 1) specification and use of concise protocols; 2) rigorous training, certification, and periodic re-
training of study per sonnel, with on -going monitoring of adherence to data collection and handling protocol; 
3) regular review of questionnaire response rates, reported respondent burden, and missing items to identify and correct problem areas; 4) validation and verification of all data, and 5) regular meetings and progress 
reports to provide specific, well- documented feedback to project personnel concerning potential difficulties as 
well as follow -up to ensure that problems are resolved quickly.   
 
We will assign all participa nts a unique study ID. The master list will be  stored separately from the data and 
accessible only by IRB approved study staff.  For clinical note abstractions, we will not remove identifiers 
because that material is  copied verbatim, making it difficult to ensure that any reference to names, location, 
and dates were removed. We believe it is safer to acknowledge that identifiers will be  present, and to carefully 
adhere to our strict protocol to store the abstracted notes on a secure server accessible only by study staff.  
Chart abstracted notations will not be entered into the study database. 
 
We will store data in strong password protected SQL and ACCESS relational databases that reside on a secure 
VA network server.  To reduce errors in data entry with participant self-report data elements, we will use 
double data entry and field valuation che cks wherever possible.   
 
For provider on -line surveys, we will e-mail a link that populates data on the VA secure server.  Data will be 
secured at the database level, using a role- based and record- level security model.   Providers will belong to a 
Windows group, which allows  access to the database.  Roles and the provider’s login credentials restrict  them 
to records associated only with themselves.   They will not  be able to see any other provider’s records, 
regardless of the application used to connect to the database. 
 
We will store d ata on paper in secure, locked file cabinet s within secure office s. Any communications between 
study staff and provider participants regarding patient care will  occur via encrypted e -mail.   
 
 
 
15. Summary of Changes fr om original protocol  
• 2/12/2014: VA CDW:  
o Used instead of Veterans Integrates Service Network (VISN) 20 data warehouse because of changes in VA policy . 
• 2/12/2014: Remuneration 
o Patient participants were remunerated $20 instead of $25 based on budget and IRB application. 
12/30/2020   Page  | 17 • 3/5/2015: Provider enrollment  
o Modified to passively consent providers who had not responded to invitation after one week. 
• 4/2/2014: Outcomes  
o Used VR-12 instead of the SF-12 because VR- 12 is the SF -12 modified for a Veteran population.  
• 2/12/2014: Wedge interval length/outcomes period:  
o Wedges consisted of 30-day wedge intervals instead of 1 month to maintain standard interval 
length . 
o 30-day int ervals resulted in 180- day outcomes period instead of six months.  
• 5/6/2014: Number of wedges  
o Used 30 wedges over 30 months instead of 36 wedges over 36 months;  
o Recalculated power estimates based on actual numbers of consented providers and COPD exacerbat ion discharge data.  To maintain 0.90 power assuming an alpha of 0.95 and coefficient 
of variation of 0.1, we would require 30 clusters in lieu of 36.   
• 5/21/2015: Smoking status self- report  
o Added short smoking status questionnaire with patient outcomes, as smoking status around the time of discharge is an indicator of quality of COPD care.  
• 8/4/2016: COPD Training for inpatient discharge and primary care  teams   
o After several attempts to coordinate in-services to inpatient and primary care  teams, we were 
unable to develop a practical and mutually agreeable schedule because of logistical and 
scheduling constraints.  
• 7/23/2015: Mailed patient outcomes 
o Added option for patient participant to complete surveys via mail instead of telephone. 
• 3/22/2016: E-cigarettes and vaping 
o Included a question about e -cigarette and vaping use, as these devices’ popularity increased 
and many Veterans had adopted these practices over cigarette smoking. 
• 7/27/2017: Qualitative interviews  
o Initially targeted providers after three intervention discharge; because of low response rate we 
reduced to one in attempt to include more providers. 
• 1/12/18: Correlation of measures within patient/used participants first DC only  
o We did not correlate measures within patient, because we used only the first index discharge per patient. Given the small number of patients with > 1 index discharge, the additional 
complexity of modeling within -patient correlation would not be c ost-effective with respect to 
degrees of freedom.  
• 7/27/18: VR- 12 PCS  
o demoted from primary to secondary because COPD intervention studies have not shown effects 
on QoL so no good rationale that there will be any significant effect – we will not adjust for i t. 
• 12/28/18: Analyses  
o Modeling time: w e originally wanted to model (k – 1) fixed effects for the k wedges in the 
stepped-wedge design. However, each wedge only had ~10 discharges, on average, and it would be expensive (and likely not very informative) to model all of the wedges individually. 
Therefore, we modeled time using a 3 -knot restricted (or natural) cubic spline for flexibility and 
lower degrees of freedom cost.  
o Medicare data: n ot used because of insufficient time/resources to pull and merge with cu rrent 
data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  

12/30/2020   Page  | 28 ********************************************************************************* 
STANDARD PHRASES 
********************************************************************************* 
DIAGNOSTICS:   
CXR 
        - Follow up 2- view chest x- ray in 6- 8 weeks to evaluate... 
- Follow-up 2-view chest X- ray in approximately one month to evaluate areas of  
infiltrate/atelectasis evident on admission films. 
PFT 
        - Pulmonary function testing – spirometry before and after bronchodilator, lung 
volumes and DLCO.  Needs updating. 
 
- Pulmonary function testing with bronchodilator response, volumes, DLCO, 6- MWT, exercise 
oximetry with titration. Functional assessment should be performed when the patient is at 
or approximating his respiratory baseline. 
 
        - Minimum of spirometry with and without bronchodilator.  If no airflow 
obstruction is found by spirometry, focus evaluation of <dyspnea> on <list other 
diagnoses> issues as he is not likely to have COPD. 
 
MIP and MEP 
- Although the admitting diagnosis was Acute Respiratory failure related  
to COPD exacerbation we do not think this is COPD. To verify diagnosis,  
we suggest obtaining an updated pulmonary function test including MIP  
and MEP to evaluate for neuromuscular dysfunction. 
 
MRI 
        - Follow-up on previously ordered MRI. 
 
Obesity 
        - The team is unclear if the symptoms are driving by weight vs copd.   
 
 
MEDICATIONS: 
COPD 
        - Agree with current medication management.  However, if pt. does not stabilize, 
would consider addition of Symbicort 160/4.5 mcg q12 and discontinuation of mometasone. 
        - If he has COPD, consider adding as needed albuterol by nebulization as rescue 
therapy.  
        - Agree with albuterol mdi and neb, and tiotroprium 
        - Discontinue duoneb because patient is already on tiotroprium  
        - Consider discontinue symbicort because of potential side effect of PNA  
                from steroid component  
        - Consider replacing with combination of mometosone and formoterol with  
                plan to titrate off mometasone as described (we have arranged  
                pulmonary follow up for patient) 
-LABA/ICS or LAMA/LABA:  
- simplify regimen with LABA/ICS (budensonide/formoterol) or LAMA/LABA  
(tiotropium/oldaterol) if he becomes willing. As you are aware, tiotropium and  
ipratropium should not be used together - ipra outcompetes tio for binding sites 
 
LABA  
- Starting Olodaterol 2 actuations daily. Long -acting bronchodilator (in this case a Long- acting beta -agonist) is the preferred 
controller therapy approach for symptomatic patients with COPD.  
 
Opiate titration for dyspnea 
- We also recommend consideration of an opioid to help with the sensation of dyspnea. The 
Canadian Thoracic Society guidelines on the management of dyspnea in COPD are extremely 
useful and include a regimen for the initiation of morphine for dyspnea. This guideline provides very clear recommendations for how to initiate opioids for the management of 
12/30/2020   Page  | 29 dyspnea in COPD using morphine solution. This allows you to start at an extremely low 
dose, such as 1mg and then titrating extremely slowly. Such low doses are unlikely to 
cause respiratory depression. Marciniuk et al. Managaing dyspnea in patients with 
advanced COPD: A Canadian Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline. Can Respir J 
2011;18(2):69- 78 
 
Suggested protocol for managing dyspnea with opioid therapy in advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: 
• Initiate opioid therapy with oral immediate- release morphine syrup – 
titrate slowly at weekly intervals over a 4- to 6-week period 
• Start therapy with morphine 0.5 mg orally twice daily for 2 days, and then increase to 0.5 mg orally every 4 h while awake for remainder of week 1 
• If tolerated and indicated, increase to morphine 1.0 mg orally every 4 h 
while awake in week 2, increasing by 1.0 mg/week or 25% dosage 
increments/week until the lowest effective dose that appropriately 
manages the dyspnea is achieved • Once a stable dosage is achieved (ie, no significant dose change for 
2 weeks and dyspnea managed), a sustained- release preparation at a 
comparable daily dose could be considered for substitution • If patients experience significant opioid- related side effects such as nausea 
or confusion, substitution of an equipotent dose of oral hydromorphine 
could be considered (1 mg hydromorphine = 5 mg morphine) 
• Stool softeners and laxatives should be routinely offered to prevent 
opioid-associated constipation 
 
Titrate methadone/opiates:  
-Titrate methadone and opiates:  from a pulmonary standpoint based on 
pharmakinitics and risk these can repress breathing.  Please discuss with patient 
the need to reduce these medications.  
Step down on inhaled corticosteroids once resolved.   
Titrate glucocorticoid:  
- Modified Titration of glucocorticoid medications based on the NEJM article found here: 
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1407154  to comply with medications available 
at VA. At least eight (8) weeks after the patient started the high potency high dose 
regimene they are currently on reduce the dose by half.  Six(6) weeks later cut the dose 
in half again and six (6) weeks after that discontinue the medication completely.  
 
For Mometasone: Beginning at highest dose than the patient is currently on usually 
Begin at 220 mgm BID 2 puff 
after 8 weeks reduce it to 110mgm bid, 
after 6 weeks reduce it to 110 mgm QD 1 puff OD, 
after 6 weeks off  
For steroid: beginning at the high dose that the patient is currently on  Begin flovent at 500 BID 
 After 8 weeks cut flovent in half (flovent 250 BID) 
 After 6 weeks cut in half again (flovent 125 BID) 
 After 6 weeks off 
 
Smoking Cessation 
Nicotine lozenges:         - Consider prescribing nicotine lozenges as use for replacement of cigarettes, 
                which is effective even among precontemplators.. 
 
Bupropion 
Bupropion is recommended along with a tobacco cessation program to provide the patient with additional 
support and educational materials.  
http://www.publichealth.va.gov/smoking/professionals/treatment/pharmacotherapy.asp  
 
GERD:  
12/30/2020   Page  | 30 - GERD controlling medication (H2 blocker or PPI) and GERD education  
 
PHARMACY USE/EDUCATION:         
         - To maximize inhaler teaching we are entering a return to clinic order for PCC 
pharmacy teaching.  This can be done on a day he is already at VA.  
 
THERAPIES/REFERRALS 
Smoking Cessation 
- Refer to behavioral health for assistance with smoking cessation  
- Consider a warm hand- off to behavioral health at next visit to address smoking 
cessation and oxygen compliance. 
- Consider behavioral health referral for assistance in smoking cessation, as it 
is evident that prior attempts to offer assistance with smoking cessation has 
been declined. 
- Continue to encourage smoking cessation, consider referral to behavioral medicine or 
home telemonitoring if patient willing. 
 
Smoking Cessation- inconsistent pt report of status  
- In reviewing chart, we noticed patient inconsistent in reporting of smoking  
status (told PCP none x3 mo, reported 2 cigs/day to admitting resident).  
Encourage continued attention to smoking, as you are doing. 
 
Co-Smoking Cessation and Mental Health  
-Dr. Saxon and colleagues have demonstrated that co- treatment of mental health 
and tobacco concomitantly is effective for smoking cessation. 
 
Marijuana 
-Encourage patient to not smoke marijuana  
 
Palliative Care 
-Consider focusing on palliation of symptoms and clarifying goals of care. 
-Consider a Palliative care consult to address goals of care and symptomatic treatment of 
dyspnea. 
 
Pulmonary Rehab 
-Pulmonary rehabilitation: Demonstrated to reduce readmission and improve quality of life 
by improving functional ability and improving dyspnea management. 
 
-Pulmonary rehabilitation – we will enter a non- VA care consult given patient lives > 40 
miles from the Seattle VA 
 
- Pulmonary rehabilitation: randomized evidence reduces readmission and improves functional status.  
 
Rule out DVT -BLE venous duplex exam  
- Consider ruling out DVT- BLE venous duplex exam. Patient has sufficiently elevated 
pulmonary arterial pressures thus increasing the morbidity factor of PE if he does have 
DVT. Further diagnostics for PTE would depend on results of duplex.  
-If clinically indicated at this time, further assessment for cardiac ischemia with 
cardiac stress test could be considered. 
 
O2*** 
-Needs reevaluation for use of long- term oxygen therapy. 
- Consider a warm hand- off to behavioral health at next visit to address oxygen 
compliance. 
- Respiratory therapy for 6 minute walk test, exercise oximetry, o2 titration  
evaluation, and home oxygen evaluation (order entered) 
 
***Seattle Reevaluation does not have the staff for us to be able to do the evaluations routinely. Alice Hanse n may 
complete some on Thursdays if the Provider requests her, otherwise it is up to the PCP to re- assess. When Norco does 
12/30/2020   Page  | 31 the every 90 day concentrator check, she will write a progress note and have the PCP co -sign when a discrepancy is 
noted. Per A. Hans on 4/2016  
 
 
MOVE! 
Lung specialists agree that obesity is likely the driving factor in this 
patient’s disease process, and weight reduction may be the most beneficial therapy; therefore encouragement to participate in MOVE! or TeleMOVE! is recommended.  
 
Dental 
        - Agree with dental and nutrition consult 
 
Nutrition 
        - Agree with dental and nutrition consult 
 
Non-compliant patient  
Based on this review, patient has received excellent care in the hospital and in  
follow-up. He is receiving guideline concordant care for COPD and any co-  
morbidities; therefore, we have only minor suggestions to consider adding to  your management of this patient. We understand the difficulties providing care in this 
apparently reluctant participant with recommend Rx. 
 
Other: 
- If the patient completes smoking cessation for 6 months and pulmonary rehabilitation, 
he may be considered for lung transplantation. 
 
Question of if patient actually has COPD: 
This patient has a number of complex comorbid issues of which respiratory 
problems are prominent.  The etiology of his symptoms includes both potential 
cardiac and pulmonary etiologies.   Although the pretest probability is 
reasonable that the patient has COPD, we were unable to find records of PFT to confirm the diagnosis.  Some of the below recommendations are based on whether he actually has COPD.  
 
 
Good job-minor suggestions: 
Based on this review, patient has received excellent care in the hospital and in  
follow-up. He is receiving guideline concordant care for COPD and any co- 
morbidities; therefore, we have only minor suggestions to consider adding to  
your management of this patient. 
 
We agree thus far with excellent inpatient and outpatient management, with the following 
recommendations to further the plan that has been initiated.  
 
This patient with typical COPD exacerbation is receiving guideline concordant care in primary care and through his hospitalization. His disease is obviously very severe COPD. Appreciate attention to his goals of care/discussion with DPOA. 
 
********************************************************************************* 
GOOD Job - NO RECOMMENDATIONS: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Based on this review, your patient is receiving guideline concordant care for COPD and any co- morbidities; therefore, we do not have additional 
recommendations. We agree with your excellent management of this patient.

IF YES: Please describe the program for me.  
 
IF NO:  The InCasE study began in May 2015.  The intervention was developed by a team of primary care,  pulmonar y, pharmacy, and palliative care providers to decrease rates of hospital readmissions and mortality among 
Veterans discharged for COPD exacerbations.  
 
After patients are discharged for a COPD exacerbation, the study team reviews the patient’s CPRS record a nd 
provides a summary of recommended COPD treatments, medication, and follow -up through a CPRS note.  They also 
enter any recommended orders for the provider to review, and then sign, modify, or decline.

 1.0 Introduction  
Acute Pulmonary Embolism  
Deep  vein thrombosis  (DVT)  occurs  when  a blood  clot forms  in a deep  vein,  typically  in the lower 
extremities. Pulmonary embolism (PE) occurs when a DVT clot (or fragment) breaks free and  
travels through the heart to the pulmonary arteries and lodges in an artery causing complete or 
partial obstruction. Together DVT and PE comprise venous thromboembolism (VTE) , a major 
public  health  problem  in the United  States  (USA).  VTE is the third leading cause  of cardiovascular 
death  (1), is estimated  to result  in 5% to 10% of all hospital  death  (2), and the third most  common  
cause of preventable hospital death in patients recovering from surgery ( 3). Using the 2007 -9 
National Hospital Discharge Survey data, 548,000 hospitalizations were for VTE and of those 
278,000 were for acute PE ( 4). The annual cost of VTE to the US healthcare system is $7 -10 
billion for newly diagnosed, medically treated VTE cases ( 5). PE is associated with a high short - 
term mortality,  requiring  a timely  and accurate  diagnosis  for the initiation  of antithrombotic  therapy. 
PE is difficult to diagnose on presentation due to the non -specific signs and symptoms for this 
condition such as cough, shortness of breath, hypoxia, tachycardia, and  hemoptysis.  
Computed Tomography Angiography  
Pulmonary computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the gold standard for the detection of 
pulmonary emboli (PE) ( 6), however, radiation exposure and complications related to 
administering intraven ous contrast prohibit universal applicability ( 7). CTA can detect acute PE 
with a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 95 percent when combined with CT venography 
(8, 9). In those who are medically ineligible for CTA, ventilation -perfusion (V/Q) single photon 
emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is commonly acquired to detect PE ( 10, 11). 
However, SP ECT imaging acquisitions requires transporting the patient to the nuclear medicine 
clinic,  a prolonged  acquisition  period  compared  with CTA,  and in many  hospitals  SPECT  imaging 
is not available on weekends or evenings. In this study we will investigate an alternative method 
to obtain ventilation and perfusion images from respiratory gated non -contrast CT (commonly 
called 4DCT) that can be performed in the Emergency  Department.  
99mTc-MAA SPECT Imaging  
Wagner reported the first use of radiolabeled macroaggreg ates of albumin (MAA) imaged with 
planar scintigraphy for the detection of pulmonary emboli (PE) causing vascular occlusion ( 12). 
MAA  is composed  of particles  ranging  in size from 10 to 150 µm that are trapped  in the pulmonary 
microvasculature on their first pass after intravenous injection. Their distribution remains fixed 
with a biological  half-life of 11 h and is dependent  on the conditions  at the time of injection.  99mTc- 
labelled MAA (99mTc-MAA) imaged with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 
is considered  the standard  method  for the quantitative  determination  of pulmonary  perfusion  (13). 
Alternative  pulmonary  perfusion  imaging  methods  include  positron  emission  tomography  imaging 
following administration of 68Ga-labeled particles or after bolus injection of 13N-N2 (14). Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast agents have been utilized experimentally to image the  
pulmonary vasculature and tissue perfusion ( 15). Quantification of SPECT images requires 
correction of the acquired data for attenuation and scatter ( 16, 17). One approach is to utilize 
spatially correlated CT images to determine the attenuation correction, which has lead to the 
development of SPECT -CT scanners ( 18). The low -dose CT can be utilized to evaluate the lung 
airway archi tecture, lung parenchyma, and pleural space in conjunction with the registered 
perfusion images rivaling CTA in sensitivity and specificity  (19). 
Variation in Pulmonary Perfusion with Breathing  
In a recent study using 99mTc-MAA SPECT imaging, the difference in distribution due to injection 
at maximum  inspiration  versus  maximum  expiration  breath -hold was measured  (20). Each  subject 
received  SPECT  imaging  after injection  of 99mTc-MAA  in either  maximum  inspiration  or expiration. 
There  was a posterior  displacement  of the activity  centroid  in each  lung between  the expiration

Figure 1. Lung mass difference across 4D 
CT. The total mass of the lung parenchyma 
(HU <  –250) for each patient (p1 -3) was 
calculated within the manual segmented lungs 
from the CT values and equation. Note there 
are difference between the three patients’  data 
in amplitude and average  value.  and inspiration images. In another study of normal volunteers MRI perfusion imaging obtained  at 
either  maximum  inspiration  or expiration  breath -holds  revealed  higher  perfusion  at expiration  (15). 
In a study comparing CT attenuation with SPECT perfusion defects, patients were found to have 
hypo -attenuated  pulmonary  regions  corresponding  to regions  with decreased  perfusion  in 57% of 
acute pulmonary emboli and 88% of chronic embo li cases ( 21). In the same study hyper - 
attenuated regions were found to correspond to regions with hyperperfusion. A method to 
measure  pulmonary  perfusion  based  on subtraction  digital  fluoroscopy  without  contrast  has been 
reported ( 22). In that study subtraction images were generated between chest projection images 
at systole and diastole generating an image representing the perfusion difference. These 
perfusion projection images were corre lated with 99mTc-MAA scintigraphy. Thus, changes in the 
amount  and distribution  of pulmonary  perfusion  throughout  the respiratory  cycle  can be expected 
and these changes may be apparent on dynamic  CT. 
Imaging Pulmonary Perfusion Defects with 4DCT  
Simon ( 23) described a technique to calculate the change in fractional content of air within 
pulmonary tissue between anatomically matched CT regions based on a simple model that 
assumes the density changes were solely due to air conten t (see appendix A in ( 24)). We 
successfully applied that model to inhale & exhale breath -hold CT image pairs ( 25) as well as 
4DCT images ( 24, 26) to create ventilation images. However, the amount of blood in the thorax 
and lungs  varies  with the respiratory  cycle  increasing  with inspiration  during  normal  breathing  (27) 
and decreasing with in spiration with positive pressure ventilation ( 28). Thus violating the 
assumption  of the model.  We found  a cyclic  variation  in the apparent  weight  of the  lung on 4DCT 
(see figure 1 below ( 26)) and others have reported respiratory induced variations in pulmonary 
perfusion  of the lung on magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  (29). The pulmonary  density  changes 
found on 4DCT thus result from both changes in air and blood  content.  
4DCT  derived  ventilation  images  can also be inferred  from the respiratory  motion  induced  local 
tissue volume changes ( 24) independent of the 
4DCT density values. The Jacobian determinant 
of the deformation field, calculated from the DIR 
result of images depicting different respiratory 
phases of the lungs, is used to estimate the  local 
volume changes or ventilation ( 24, 30). There is 
a discrepancy  between  the density  based  and the 
Jacobian based ventilation images suggesting a 
method  to extract  respiratory  induced  blood  mass 
change from 4DCT images. We hypothesize t he 
respiratory induced blood mass change will only 
occur within perfused lung regions. Each 4DCT 
image set contains information representing the 
density change resulting from both ventilation 
and respiratory induced blood mass changes. 
Extracting both vent ilation and a perfusion -like 
image from the 4DCT image intensities, referred 
to as Hounsfield  Units  (HU),  is our goal.  However,  
novel image processing methods are required to 
extract this information.  
We found a cyclic variation in the apparent mass 
of the pulmonary  parenchyma  (Figure  1) (26). We hypothesize  this variation  is due to changes  in 
pulmonary  perfusion  from the respiratory -induced  variation  in cardiac  output  (20, 31, 32). We 
IRB NUMBER: 2017 -018

Page  4  
 hypothesize this respiratory 
induced blood mass  change will 
allow the identification of 
hypoperfused lung regions. As 
a preliminary study we created 
4DCT RIBMC images from 
cases with hypoxia induced 
vasoconstriction, patients with 
malignant airway obstruction. 
The resulting images visually 
compare well with SPECT 
99mTc-MacroAggregates of 
Albumin (MAA) perfusion 
images (Figure 2). However, in 
these cases there are matched 
ventilation and  perfusion  
defects  due to malignant  airway  obstruction.  It is unknown  if this process  works  to detect  perfusion 
defects due to pulmo nary emboli, where perfusion is obstructed and ventilation  normal.  
With spontaneous tidal breathing, venous 
return to the right a trium increases with  the 
decrease in intrathoracic pressure ( 33) 
and as a consequence pulmonary arterial 
blood  flow to the lungs  increases  (34). With 
positive pressure ventilation the  opposite  
occurs, positive -pressure inspiration 
decreases the pressure gradient for 
venous return, which decreases venous 
blood flow, RV stroke volume, and 
consequently cardiac output ( 33). We 
expect the decrease in lung mass, or 
pulmonar y blood, with normal expiration to 
become an increase in lung mass with 
positive pressure ventilation as shown in 
Figure 3 at the right.  
In this study, patients found to have new 
segmental, lobar or greater perfusion 
defects, will be imaged with 99mTc-MAA 
SPECT/CT and 4DCT to compare 
perfusion with RIBMC defects.

 Hypothesis: Thromboembolic pulmonary perfusion defects on 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT will 
coincide with 4DCT RIBMC defect regions.  
Summary & Significance  
This is a prospective imaging trial of 20 patients with segmental or lobar pulmonary emboli on 
CTA. Each will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT imaging on the same day. Respiratory 
induced blood mass change (RIBMC) images will be derived from the 4DCT im age and 
quantitatively compared with the SPECT perfusion images. A 5 patient cohort (cohort 2) to test 
effect of respiratory pressure on RIBMC was added. A 124 patient cohort (cohort 3) to test the 
sensitivity & specificity of RIBMC was added. Illustrated in Figure 4 below.  
 
Figure  4. Study  design.  15 patients  (cohort  1) found  to have  segmental  or lobar  pulmonary  emboli  on CTA 
will be recruited for this study. All enrolled subjects will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT imaging. 
The 4DCT acquisitions will be performed at a single setting to evaluate reproducibility, prior to the 
SPECT/CT imaging. The primary end -point will be the identification and spatial correspondence of 
pulmonary perfusion def ects on the 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 4DCT derived RIBMC images. All  imaging 
will be performed  on the same  day. An additional  5 patients  (cohort  2) with the same  criteria  will be recruited. 
Each will receive 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT imaging as before. They will als o receive two 4DCT acquisitions, 
one with normal breathing and the other with positive pressure breathing using BPAP. 62 patients  (cohort  
3) found to have PE on CTA and 62 patients negative for PE will be recruited for this study. All enrolled 
subjects will receive a single 4DCT image acquisition. The 4DCT acquisitions will be performed within 48 
hours of the CTA.

2.1 The primary obje ctive of this study is to test if 4DCT derived RIBMC images can 
detect segmental or lobar pulmonary perfusion  detects.  
2.2 A secondary objective is to evaluate the reproducibility and variability of RIBMC 
images on repeat  imaging.  
2.3 To evaluate  the pulmonary  blood volume  response  to positive  pressure  ventilation

4.0 STUDY  EVALUATIONS  
Study patients will receive 4DCT imaging after signing consent, followed by 99mTc-MAA 
SPECT/CT, and a second 4DCT imaging session.  
4.1 4DCT ACQUISITIONS*.  The patients will be imaged lying supine and flat on the 
scanner bed with their arms above their head. On a multislice CT scanner, CT 
images  will be obtained  through  the entire  lung during resting  tidal breathing  while 
the patient’s respiration is monitored with an external device for respiratory 
gating using the standard over -sampled spiral 4DCT acquisition method ( 35, 36). 
The 4D CT acquisition will be acquired in duplicate at standard low  dose.  
4.2 4DCT ACQUISITIONS W/ BPAP.  The patients will be fitted with a face mask 
covering mouth and nose. The expiratory positive airway pressure (ePAP) will be  
set to 4 cm H 2O and inspiratory posit ive airway pressure (iPAP) to 12 cm H 2O. A 
4DCT  will acquired  as described  in the previous  section.  The patients  will undergo 
BPAP for <10 minutes. Upon completion of the scan the patients will resume 
normal breathing of room  air. 
4.3 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT ACQUISITIONS*. The patients will undergo 99mTc-MAA 
SPECT/CT  pulmonary  perfusion  imaging  in the nuclear  medicine  clinic  using  the

 standard  clinical  procedure  under  the supervision  of a Beaumont  nuclear  medicine 
physician. This will include SPECT/CT imaging using 99mTc-labeled macro - 
aggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA), an FDA approved radiopharmaceutical in 
routine clinical use at Beaumont. The dose and administration will be prescribed 
by the nuclear  medicine  physician.  A CT will be acquired  for attenuation  correction 
and image registration purposes and is a st andard part of this procedure. The 
patients will be imaged supine with arms above their head. This scan will be 
performed on the same day as the 4D CT  scans.  
*If any incidental findings are noted, that have not been previously reported, the 
researcher will  discuss these with the patient’s treating clinical physician who will 
determine appropriate follow up.  
5.0 CRITERIA FOR STUDY  REMOVAL  
5.1 Unacceptable adverse event (at the discretion of the treating  physician).  
5.2 Patients unable to tolerate imaging sessions (1 hou r total).  
5.3 Patient choice (patients can withdraw from the study at any time, for any  reason).  
5.4 Patients who’s image quality does not meet criteria for primary endpoint analysis 
due to imaging techniques, scanner settings, patient movement,  etc…  
6.0 REGISTRATION  PROCEDURES  
6.1 Informed consent is required prior to participation in this study. The study 
coordinator will inform potential subjects about the study opportunity and ask if 
they would like to participate. If the patient is interested, they will be given an 
opportunity to read the informed consent and authorization document specific to 
the study and ask questions of the study coordinator. The patient will be informed 
about:  1) the rationale  for the study;  2) the logistics  of the study;  3) the risks of the 
study; 4) how the data will be used. Consent will be obtained by the study 
coordinator. The patient will be given a copy of the consent, and asked to sign 
another copy for our  records.  
6.2 Patients  will be registered  for the study  after pretreatment  evaluation  is completed 
and eligibility criteria are  met. 
6.3 The principal investigator and all key personnel have completed NIH approved 
institutional and HIPAA training in the conduct of medical research  studies  
 
7.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
Spatial overlap between hypoperfused regions of interest (ROIs) on SPECT perfusion 
(standard) and deficit ROIs on RIBMC will be assessed using Dice similarity coefficient 
(DSC) ( 37). A priori , we expect a DSC of approximately 0. 7 between RIBMC and SPECT 
ROIs. Indication of larger overlap is desirable for RIBMC validation. Thus, we require a 
DSC of at least 0.85 ( 38) and base our sample size calculations on this degree of 
improvement over a priori expec tations. With three experts delineating ROIs on RIBMC 
and SPECT  images,  we will calculate  an average  (n = 3 experts)  DSC  per patient.  Sample 
size considerations are based on a t -test for the mean DSC. Castillo et al. ( 39) provid e a 
working  DSC  standard  deviation  of ~0.2,  leading  to a standard  deviation  of 0.11 (=0.2/√3) for a 
mean DSC based on three experts. Assuming a significance level of .05, power of 95%, 
and standard deviation of 0.11, we find that 15 patients are required to detect a mean 
DSC of at least  0.85.  
Cohort 3 . The objective of this study is to collect an d process the image data necessary to 
assess the sensitivity and specificity of our CT Functional Imaging (CT -FI) diagnostic 
test, consisting of RIBMC and 4DCT -Ventilation, as well as perform receiver operator

 characteristic  (ROC)  analysis.  We will conduct  a prospective  imaging  study  of 124 patients 
who present to the Emergency Department with clinical concern for PE and who 
subsequently undergo chest CTA for further  evaluation.  
For each case, an expert reader will determine if functional deficits exist within CT -V and 
RIMBC. The patient will  be classified as PE positive if the reader confirms the presence 
of two or more mismatched segmental or subsegmental defects between CT -V and 
RIBMC images, and negative otherwise. This CT -FI binary classification indicator will be 
acquired for each patien t. Sensitivity and specificity will be computed with respect to the 
known  (CTA  defined)  PE diagnosis.  A score  of 1 (low)  to 5 (high)  will be assigned  to each 
defect for the ROC  evaluation.  
Because  PE status  of the subjects  will be known  a priori,  we may use the statistical  theory for 
estimating a single proportion to determine the sample size needed to estimate the 
sensitivity or specificity of the CT -FI diagnostic test. Assuming that the sensitivity will be 
(at least)  approximately  80%,  we can estimate  the true sensitivity  with a margin  of error  of 
10% (percentage points) with 95% confidence based on a sample size of 62 positive PE 
cases.  Similarly,  the specificity  can be estimated  with 62 negative  PE controls.  Concerning 
the ROC  analysis,  to determine  the sample  size needed  to detect  an "Area  under  the ROC 
Curve" (AUC) greater than 50%, it is not necessary to have a prevalence value for PE 
(since PE status is known a priori). To detect an AUC of at least 70% with Type I error of 
1%, power 95% and a 1:1 ratio of cases:controls we require at least 60 cases and 60 
controls ( 40). Our study is designed to exceed the minimal sample size  requirements.  
 
8.0 POTENTIAL  RISKS  
The patients recruited for enrollment in this study will consist of patients who were found 
to have pulmonary emboli on diagnostic CTA. Their participation in this study will consist 
of 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT imaging once and 4DCT imaging twice. The total dose per 
patient  for this study  is estimated  at 44.2 mSv.  This dose  is less than the Radiation  Safety 
Committee guidelines of 50 mSv per year from  research.  
8.1 SPECT/CT tests.  The patients recruit ed to this study will have 99mTc-MAA 
SPECT/CT  imaging  at study  entry.  No changes  are made  to the clinical  SPECT/CT 
imaging techniques specified by this study. A SPECT/CT imaging may cause a 
feeling of claustrophobia while lying in the scanner. The scanner is open at both 
ends and an open dialogue with doctors and staff will be maintained to minimize 
this risk. SPECT/CT imaging utilizes ionizing radiation. The radiation dose will be 
approximately 4.2 mSv. The radioactive isotope 99mTc-MAA has a half -life of 6.0 
hours due to physical decay along with a biological  clearance.  
8.2 4DCT test.  The major risk from the two 4DCT scans is from the radiation. Each 
4DCT scan will deliver approximately 10 -20 mSv to the patient. Erring on the high 
side of this range, this will befor a total of 40  mSv.  
 
9.0 LONG TERM  GOALS  
This study investigates the use of  4DCT, an imaging study that can be 
rapidly performed in the emergency department without the need 
for contrast, in the evaluation of PE.  
9.1 If successful, this strategy may be tested in further prospective studies in patients 
who have an unknown PE  status.  
9.2 4DCT RIBMC images may provides a means to detect pulmonary perfusion 
defects rapidly, at low radiation dose, and in patients who cannot receive 
intravenous  contrast.

10.0 DATA MONITORING & ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
10.1 Data Monitoring.  The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) is established to 
ensure the safety of research participants and the integrity of the study data.. The 
study staff (PI, Co -Investigators, research nursing, etc.) are responsible for 
collecting and recording all c linical data. As these results are collected, all 
toxicities and adverse events will be identified, graded for severity and assigned 
causality, reported to the required entities, and compiled for periodic review. After 
assigning causality, the PI will deci de the course of action for the study 
participant. The PI will evaluate all adverse events (AE) and determine whether 
the AE affects the risk/benefit ratio of the study and whether modifications to the 
protocol or informed consent form are  required . 
10.2 Image Quality Evaluation:  Images will be computed in Radiation Oncology within 
2-3 days of 4DCT acquisition. The investigators will perform QA of the images 
directly after computation. If the imaging is not evaluable, the investigator will 
inform the research st aff and an additional patient will be  acquired.  
10.3 Toxicity  Grading.  The Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  version  
4.0 will be used  to grade  all (CTCAE  v4.0;  available  at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ) 
treatment -related adverse events. All patient encounter or treatment areas  should 
have ac cess to a copy of these  criteria.  
10.4 Adverse Events.  All AE’s (or unanticipated events) must be reported to the 
Protocol PI. All serious adverse events, defined as grade 4 or 5 toxicity, will be 
reported to the Beaumont Health System’s IRB (institutional revi ew board) of 
according to institutional reporting guidelines and using institutional reporting 
forms. Reports of serious adverse events will be delivered to Clinical Research 
Compliance  and will be submitted  to the U.S. Food  and Drug  Administration  by the 
safety coordinator according to 21CFR  312.32.  
10.5 AE Reporting.  The following AEs experienced by patients accrued to this protocol 
and attributable to the protocol treatment (definitely, probably, or possibly related) 
should be  reported.  
10.5.1  Death on  study.  
10.5.2  Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization on  study  
10.5.3  Life-threatening  event  
10.5.4  Persistent or significant disability or  incapacity  
 
11.0 DATA CONFIDENTIALITY  PLAN  
11.1 All patient -reported outcome, laboratory, radiographic, and clinical data gathered 
in this protocol will be stored in a password -protected database. All patient 
information  will be handled  using  anonymous  identifiers.  Linkage  to patient  identity

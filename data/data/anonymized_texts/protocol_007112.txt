Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1IV. SYNOPSIS
Title of Study A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- Controlled, Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate 
the Protective Efficacy and Safety of a Therapeutic Vaccine, ASP0113, in 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) -Seropositive Recipients Undergoing Allogeneic, 
Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT)
Planned Study 
Period: Primary Study Period: From 3Q2013 to 3Q2017
Long- Term  Follow -up Period: until 1Q2022
Study O bjective s To evaluate the efficacy of ASP0113 compared with placebo as measured 
by a primary composite endpoint of overall mortality and CMV end organ 
disease (EOD) through 1 year post -transplant.
To evaluate the safety of ASP0113 in subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT. 
Planned T otal 
Number of S tudy 
Centers and 
LocationApproximately 90 sites globally 
Countries may include, but are not limited to, Australia, Belgium, Canada, 
France, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan and United 
States
Design and 
MethodologyThis is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately 
500 c ytomegalovirus (CMV) -seropositive recipients undergoing allogeneic, 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, 
ASP0113 or placebo, and stratified by donor -recipient relatedness and donor 
CMV seros tatus. At least 30% of subjects enrolled will be donor
CMV -seronegative.
The test compound will be a vaccine (ASP0113) which contains 2 plasmids 
encoding glycoprotein B (gB) and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65), each at 
2.5mg/mL, formulated with CRL1005 poloxam er and benzalkonium chloride 
(BAK).  The placebo control will be phosphate -buffered saline (PBS). 
Subjects will receive either 5 doses of ASP0113 or placebo on days -14 to -3, 
14-40, 60 ±5, 90 ±10 and 180 ±10 in relation to the day of transplant (donor cell 
infusion). 
The first injection must be given within 72 hours prior to the start of chemo -
therapy and radiation therapy for conditioning and the second injection is to be 
given as close as possible to, but not prior to, day 14.
The platelet count must be ≥ 50000 mm3(spontaneously or after platelet 
transfusion) performed by the local laboratory within 3days prior to all study 
drug injections. Prior to all study drug injections, confirmation must be made 
that there is no medical contraindication to an IMinjection. Results received in 
an equivalent local unit of measure must be converted to SI units.   Syringes will 
be masked prior to dosing to blind the subjects and all other per sonnel who need 
to remain blinded to the treatment assignment (i.e., site staff other than 
pharmacy personnel and staff designated to administer study drug injections). 
CMV plasma viral load will be monitored per the following schedule during the 
primary study period (through day 365/ V14): weekly ( ±2 days) during days 
0-100, every other week (± 5 days) during days 101-180, every 30 days
(±5 days) during days 181 -365. The CMV plasma viral loads will be performed 
by the central laboratory. CMV plasma viral load will also be performed by the 
central laboratory at the initiation of CMV -specific antiviral therapy ( AVT ).

Methodology
continuedUpon initiation of CMV -specific AVT, plasma viral load testing will be 
performed at least weekly until the CMV -specific AVT is discontinued, at
which point, the regularly scheduled viral load assessments will resume. 
Note: CMV plasma viral loads may be performed at a local laboratory approved 
by the Sponsor and at the discretion of the Investigator . However, every time a 
viral load sample is sen t to the local laboratory a sample will also be sent to the 
central laboratory for confirmatory testing . Pre-emptive therapy may be started 
based on the central or local laboratory assessment and the subject’s clinical 
condition.
Adjudicated CMV -specific AVT will be assessed for subjects up to 1year 
following transplant through the primary study period (through day 365/ V14).
Immunologic response will be assessed in all subjects at V2, V5, V8, V9, V11 
and V14. If the visit coincides with a study drug adminis tration, the sample will 
be drawn prior to injection. 
In addition, if a CMV seropositive donor has consented and is participating in 
the optional donor cell sub -study, a 20 mL peripheral blood sample from the 
donor will be obtained prior to the stem cell donation for recipients participating 
in the main trial to test for CMV -specific T -cells.   For those donating peripheral 
stem cells, the donor blood sample is to be collected prior to the initiation of 
mobilization therapy (e .g., G- CSF).   This process is not applicable to sites in 
Japan.
Subjects will be evaluated for local reactogenicity and systemic signs 
for60minutes after each injection. Subjects will be directly observed for 
15minutes following the injection for any injection -related side effects, then 
remain in a designated area at the study site for 45 minutes so that side effects 
can be noted and treated, if necessary. Local reactogenicity will also be 
evaluated for each of the 7consecutive days following each injection beginning 
approximately 24 hours after the dose (day 1 -7 post dose). The assessments for 
each of the 7consecutive days following an injection will be done by the subject 
and reported to the site via diary. Wh en reactogenicity is reported as an AE, it 
must be followed until resolution or medically stable. All local reactions 
≥grade 3 [Appendix 7] require co nfirmation by a health care professional.
Subjects will be contacted after the last injection of vaccine through 5.5 years 
post-transplant for long -term safety related to the DNA vaccine.  Items to be 
assessed include mortality, development of any new/ rec urrent cancer, 
development of infection requiring hospitalization or resulting in death and 
erythema and/or induration at the injection sites [Appendix 20].  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing o f the informed consent 
through 30 days post last dose of study drug. All events requiring adjudication, 
grade 3 and higher grade AEs as well as SAEs will be collected from 31 days 
post last dose of study drug through 1year post -transplant. Achange in medical 
status or medical history from time of signing of informed consent through first 
dose of study drug is to be reported as an AE or SAE, as appropriate . 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be chartered to 
oversee safet y issues and futility  anal ysis.

continuedFutility analysis will be performed when the first 100 subjects have been 
randomized, and every 3 months thereafter until t he total enrollment reaches 
400subjects. Futility analyse s are based on the rate of CMV viremia defined as 
CMV plasma load ≥1000 IU/mL as assessed by the central laboratory. At each 
futility analysis, a Bayesian posterior probability that t he hazard ratio for 
viremia of the ASP0113 treatment group to the placebo treatment group will be 
less than 0.75 will be calculated. The study may stop for futility if this posterior 
probability is less than 0.15.
An Adjudication Committee (AC) will be cha rtered to adjudicate all cases of 
CMV EOD, initiation of CMV -specific AVT, and cause of death.

Statistical 
MethodsThis is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately 
500 subjects. In the primary analysis set of a phase 2 study of the efficacy of 
ASP0113 in HCT, 7 subject sdied and 2 additional subjects experienced CMV 
EOD out of 40 treated with ASP0113, for an overall failure rate of 22.5%, 
while among the placebo subjects 11 subjects died and 1 additional subject
experienced CMV EOD out of 34, for an overall failure rate of 35.3%. 
To detect the estimated difference in mortality and CMV EOD from the phase 2 
study (35.3% vs. 22.5%), the study needs a sample size of at least 424 (212 per 
arm) to have 80% power at the 2-sided significance level of 0.050. A trial of 
size 500 (250 per arm) is expected to have 86% power for the composite 
endpoint.
The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all randomized subjects who receive at 
least 1dose of randomized study drug.
Efficacy analyses will be limited to the data obtained from time first of dose of 
study drug through the 1year post -transplant follow -up period. Data collected 
after the 1year post -transplant follow -up period for the long -term follow -up 
will not be included for the primary analysis of efficacy variables. 
Comparison be tween ASP0113 and placebo with respect to the primary 
endpoint will be performed using the Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel test stratified 
by factors for randomization (donor -recipient relatedness and donor CMV 
serostatus). 
In a supportive analysis, time to first occur rence of aprimary endpoint event 
will be analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model where the time-to-event 
will be calculated in days from transplant to the earliest of death or CMV EOD . 
Subjects not experiencing the primary endpoint event will be censored at the 
time of their last follow -up visit. The Cox model will include treatment and the 
stratification factors for randomization.
Key secondary endpoints of t imetofirst protocol defined CMV viremia 
through 1 year post -transplant and t ime to f irst adjudicated CMV -specific AVT 
through 1 year will each be compared between treatments using a Cox 
proportional hazards model with factors for treatment, donor- recipient 
relatedness ,and donor CMV serostatus.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1The endpoint of time to first CMV -specific A VT for protocol -defined CMV 
viremia or CMV EOD through 1 year post -transplant will be analyzed using a
Cox proportional hazards model as described above.
Incidence of overall mortality, CMV EOD, grade 3- 4 aGVHD, severe cGVHD, 
grade 3 infections other than CMV, relapse mortality, non -relapse mortality, 
graft rejection, failure to engraft, and relapse of primary disease requiring 
therapy will each be tested using a stratified analysis of the binary response 
using a CMH test to account for the stratification v ariables used as part of the 
randomization. 
Number of episodes of protocol -defined CMV viremia will be compared 
between treatments using astratum -adjusted Kruskal -Wallis test, adjusting for 
donor- recipient relatedness and donor CMV status.
To estimate the association between CMV viremia and mortality, a 
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model will be constructed in a time -
dependent manner. The model will be adjusted for the factors used to stratify 
the randomization. CMV viremia will be treated as a time -dependent variable, 
starting at the time of the first occurrence of protocol -defined CMV viremia.
The maximum grade of aGVHD, maximum cGVHD global score, and duration 
of hospitalizations will each be tested using a stratum -adjusted Krusk al-Wallis 
test. 
The treatment effect on time to engraftment and time to platelet recovery will 
each be analyzed in a Cox proportional hazards model including the factors 
used to stratify the randomization. 
Treatments will be compared with respect to each domain of the EQ -5D, the 
FACT -BMT, and productivity outcomes from the WPAI:GH using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) of change from baseline to final visit with treatment, 
donor- recipient relatedness, and don or CMV serostatus as factors and baseline 
value as covariate.
Safety Analysis The SAF will consist of all randomized subjects who have received at least 
1 study drug injection. This analysis set will be used for all summaries of AEs, 
reactogenicity, clini cal lab data, physical exams, vital signs and subject survival 
through 1 year post first study drug injection. All recorded AEs will be listed, 
including duration, outcome, toxicity grade, and association with use of study 
drug.
Pharmaco-
genomics (PGx) Subjects who consent to participate in the optional pharmacogenomics (PGx) 
sub-study will have a saliva sample collected during the baseline v isit (V2), 
after randomization, but prior to the first dose of study drug. These samples will 
be stored for explor atory retrospective PGx analyses.

Flow Chart
Primary Study Period: Screening/ICF through 12 -months post-transplant (Day 365/Visit 14)
1.Screening visit and V2 (first dose) may occur either separately or on the same day. Eligibility will be 
determined using local laboratory results collected at the screening visit.  The first dose of study drug 
must be administered prior to conditioning therapy.  The dosing interval in relation to 
transplant/conditioning must be maint ained.
2.Local laboratory assessments may be repeated 1 time if abnormal within the 25 day screening period.
3.The subject may be rescreened 1 time if the transplant is delayed and it will be outside the 25 day 
screening window.  If outside the 25 day screening period, all screening procedures must be repeated.
4.Baseline is date of first dose ( V2). The day of transplant ( donor cell infusion) is day 0 and all visit days 
are relative to day0.
5.Note that the day 365 visit must occur on day 365 +14 days (bet ween day 365 to 379); it cannot occur 
prior to day 365.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 17. Safety Laboratory will be drawn at the screening visit using the local laboratory. Safety laboratory will be done by a centra l laboratory at baseline, before doses 2 -5, and at each follow -up 
time point for doses 2 -5, and will include hematology and biochemistry, including a hepatic profile. Please refer to [Protocol Appendix 1] for a ful l list of routine safety parameters that will be 
tested, and to [Section 5.4.3 ] and the Laboratory Manual for further instruction on laboratory collection and processing.
8. Screening for cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity by th e local laboratory may be performed up to 30 days prior to transplant and before randomization.
9. The modified hematopoietic cell transplant -comorbidity index (HCT -CI) score are to be completed during screening with history and laboratory from the screening visit. Local laboratory 
results are to be used in the assessment. Local laboratories may be repeated once to score the HCT -CI. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) including forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and 
diffusing lung capacity of carbon monoxide (DLco), multi gated acquisition scan (MUGA), and/or echocardiograms performed within 6 months (180 days) prior to screening are to be used 
for scoring pulmonary and cardiac comorbidities. PFTs (FEV1 and DLco), MUGAs /or echocardiograms not performed within 6 month s of screening will have to be repeated for scoring 
purposes. 
10. For all females of childbearing potential and all females who are of non -childbearing potential but are < 50 years of age and not documented to be surgically sterile , a urine or serum 
pregn ancy test will be performed at s creening, on the same day and prior to each dose, at visit 13, and at the primary study period completion/day 365 visit (V14) . All pregnancy tests will be 
done locally. For subjects who receive mycophenolate mofetil, additional pregnancy testing should be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements.
11. All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing of the informed consent through 30 days post last dose of study drug. All eve nts requiring adjudication (CMV end organ disea se [EOD], 
initiation of CMV -specific antiviral therapy [AVT], and cause of death), grade 3 and higher grade AEs as well as all SAEs will be collected from 31 days post last dose of drug t hrough 1 year 
post-transplant. A change in medical status or medical history from time of signing of informed consent through first dose of study drug is to be reported as an AE or SAE as applic able. In 
this study, the day 0 HCT is not considered an AE.  
12. The EuroQol –5D (EQ -5D), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT -BMT), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) are 
to be completed by the subject prior to any other study assessments or visit procedures. Subjects are to complete these asses sments in the following order: EQ -5D first, FACT -BMT second, 
WPAI:GH last. For all 3patient -reported outcome measures, i.e. EQ -5D, FACT -BMT, WPAI, the answers must come from the subject. If the subject is unable to fill out the questionnaire, the 
assessment should not be performed . If the subject is unable to answer a question, the rest of the questionnaire still needs to be completed.
13. Immunogenicity laboratories include collection of blood for the glycoprotein B (gB) antibody and phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) T -cell assays. Samples are to be drawn on visits V2, V5, V8, V9, 
V11 and V14. Samples for T -cell assays will not be collected if the absolute lymphocyte count is known to be < 500mm3by local or central laboratory measurement. If the visit coincides 
with a study drug administratio n, the sample will be drawn prior to injection .
14. The platelet count must be at least ≥ 50000 mm3(spontaneously or after platelet transfusion) performed by the local laboratory within 3 days prior to all study drug injections. Prior to all 
study drug inject ions, confirmation must be made that there is no medical contraindication to an IMinjection. Results received in an equivalent local unit of measure must be converted to SI 
units.  If the subject’s platelet count does not meet this threshold at the time o f the visit, the subject may return for the study drug injection and local reactogenicity assessment at a later time 
within the allowable window for the visit. If the subject’s platelet count does not meet this threshold during the visit wind ow, the dose m ust be skipped and the corresponding follow -up safety 
laboratory and reactogenicity assessment should not be done. The second injection should be given as close to, but not prior to, day 14 as possible.
15. Subjects who consent to participate in the pharmacoge nomics (PGx) substudy will have a saliva sample collected during the baseline visit (V2), after randomization but prior to th e first dose 
of study drug.
16. Plasma viral load by the central laboratory will be monitored weekly (± 2 days) during days 0 -100, ever y other week (±5 days) during days 101 -180, every 30 days (±5 days) during days 
181-365, at the initiation of CMV -specific AVT, when clinically indicated, and every time a viral load sample is sent to the local laboratory. When CMV -specific AVT is initiate d, a central 
CMV viral load will be obtained a minimum of weekly until CMV-specific AVT is discontinued. Thereafter, the regularly scheduled viral load assessments will resume according to the 
scheduled protocol assessments.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 11 INTRODUCTION
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family that establishes latency  in host 
cells after acute infection. I mmunocompromised patients, including patients undergoing 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT), are particularly  vulnerable to CMV infection and 
reactivation. CMV infecti on is a risk factor for CMV end organ disease (EOD) , as well as a risk 
factor for acute graft- versus -host disease ( aGVHD ), chronic graft -versus -host disease ( cGVHD ), 
bacterial and fungal infections, and increased mortality . ASP0113 is a DNA vaccine designed to 
prevent CMV infection in immunocompromised hosts. I t contains 2 plasmids which encode the 
antigens gB and pp65 to induce humoral and cellular immunity  to the virus. A phase 1 and phase
2 study  suggest that the vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in preventing CMV viremia 
in CMV seropositive subjects undergoing hematopoietic transplant. This phase 3pivotal, 
randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial is designed to assess the incidence of 
mortality  through 1 year post-transplant in the ASP0113 group as compared to the placebo group.
1.1 Back ground
Members of the Herpesviridae family  are a group o f viruses that includes the CMV, 
Epstein -Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses and varicella zoster virus. Herpesviridae 
viruses are double -stranded DNA viruses that become latent in host cells after acute infection. 
CMV infection is ubiquitous and evid ence of seroconversion has been found in all populations. 
CMV infection is usually harmless, except in the fetus and immunocompromised hosts. I n the 
immunocompromised host, primary  infection, re -infection, and reactivation can cause 
significant morbidit y and mortality .
Persons undergoing HCT are particularl y susceptible to both primary infection and 
reactivation of CMV as a result of the interventions and drugs that ablate and suppress their 
immune sy stems. Patients with viremia that results from primary  infection or reactivation of 
CMV are at greatl y increased risk of CMV tissue -invasive disease and may also be at risk for 
mortality  not resulting from direct tissue invasion of CMV, aGVHD, cGVHD and non -CMV 
infections due to the immunomodulatory  effects of C MV [Cantoni et al, 2010; Boeckh & 
Ljungman, 2009] .
CMV tissue -invasive disease was the leading cause of death due to infectious disease among 
CMV -seropositive recipients of HCT prior to the introduction of effective antiviral therapy  
(AVT) in the 1990s.  S ince the introduction of effective AVT, the mortality from CMV 
disease during the first 3 months after HCT has been reduced from 20 -30% to less than 5% in 
most studies [Boeckh and Nichols, 2004].  However, despite the significant decrease in CMV 
tissue -invasive disease related mortality , man y studies indicate that survival continues to be 
decreased in CMV -seropositive patients, suggesting an indirect effect of subclinical CMV 
infection on mortality  [Craddock et al, 2011; Yakoub -Agha et al, 2006; Boeckh & Ni chols, 
2004]. Mortality  related to CMV seropositivity  may  partially  result from an increase in 
aGVHD, cGVHD and infections other than CMV as these outcomes result in decreased 
survival and are associated with CMV infection and CMV seropositivity  in the rec ipient or 
donor [Srinivasin et al, 2012; Cantoni et al, 2010; Larsson et al, 2004; Nichols et al, 2002].

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1Two strategies currentl y exist to prevent CMV disease in transplant recipients. I n the 
preemptive approach, viremia is monitored on a regular schedule and when a certain threshold 
of viremia is detected, AVT is initiated. Alternatively , in the proph ylactic approach, AVT is 
administered for an arbitrary  period of time to prevent reactivation. In HCT, preemptive 
therap y is used more commonly  than prophy laxis because of the toxicities associated with 
CMV -specific AVT, including m yelosuppression. 
Given the side effect profile of current AVT used to prevent CMV disease, and the inability  
of current strategies to prevent CMV infection, alternate strategies to prevent CMV disease 
and infection are needed. ASP0113 is a first- in-class therapeutic vaccine that is designed for 
the prevention of CMV infection in HCT recipients through the stimulation of both humoral 
and cell -mediated immune responses. I t contains 2 plasmids which encode CMV 
glycoprotein B (gB) and tegument phosphoprotein 65 (pp65). gB is the major neutralizing 
target for antibodies stimulated by  CMV in healthy  humans [Britt et al, 1990]; pp65 is 1of 
the proteins most frequently  recognized by  CD8+and CD4+cells in healthy  humans [Kern et 
al, 2002; Gy ulai et al, 2000; Wills et al, 1996]. ASP0113 appears to be both effective and 
safe and therefore warrants further stud y.
1.2 Product Composition
Plasmid DNA (pDNA) is covalentl y closed, circular, double -stranded DNA molecules that 
are engineered to encode protective antigens from infectious disease pathogens. This 
platform technology  provides an ideal approach for treating immunocompromised subjects 
because it eliminates the safet y concerns engendered by the use of live viral vectors yet 
preserves the ability  to induce both cellular and humoral responses. In addition, a pDNA 
vaccine is delivered without other viral genes that may  be involved in evasion of the immune 
system; ASP0113 does not include CMV -encoded genes involved in the downregulation of 
major histo -compatibility  complex (MHC) molecules, production of chemokine receptors, or 
mimics of cy tokines [Mocarski, 2002].
ASP0113 is a bivalent product that consists of 2 separate pDNAs each containing a 
codon -optimized CMV gene. Phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) is included to induce CD4+ and 
CD8+ T -cell responses; gB is included to induce antibodies. The plasmids are formulated 
with CRL 1005 poloxamer and BAK, a cationic surfactant, in PBS. The combination of 
CRL1005 and BAK produces a thermody namically  stable self -assembled particulate s ystem 
at room temperature and is used as a gene delivery sy stem. The addition of CRL1005 and 
BAK has been shown to enhance immunogenicity in mice vaccinated with ASP0113.
1.3 Nonclinical and Clinical Data
1.3.1 Nonclinical Data
Vaccination of mice with ASP0113 led to production of antibodies against gB and , to a lesser 
extent, against pp65 . Vaccination of mice with A0113 did result in a robust T -cell response 
to pp65. Plasmid copy  number of ASP0113 was not detectable or quantifiable in the gonads, 
spleen, liver, heart, ly mph node, kidney , brain or blood 15 day s post injection. On day  
62 post injection, plasmid was present at the bone marrow and the injection site, howev er,

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1their cop y numbers were reduced b y approximately  596-fold and 76- fold, respectivel y, 
compared to day  3. No genomic integration of the pDNA was observed 2 months after 
vaccination.   
Administration of ASP0113 as a single dose is well -tolerated and results in no demonstrable 
clinical signs of toxicity  due to injection of vaccine. Repeat dose administration of ASP0113 in 
rabbits is well-tolerated, with no drug-related changes in clinical signs. However, vaccination 
with ASP0113 did lead to a significant, but reversible, increase in creatine phosphokinase 
(CPK ) and minimal to moderate inflammation of the muscle, skin and subcutis, that persisted 
to a slight degree in the recovery period. Based on these nonclinical a nimal studies, ASP0113 
is considered safe and well -tolerated, is not anticipated to present a toxicity  risk in humans 
when delive red by  IM injection , and immunogenicity  data suggest that vaccination can induce 
immune responses to human CMV. For a detailed summary  of the nonclinical studies please 
refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.3.2 Clinical Data
To date, ASP0113 has been evaluated in a phase 1 study in health y volunteers and a phase 2 
study  of matched related donor/recipient pairs and related or unre lated recipients undergoing 
allogeneic HCT for hematologic disorders.  
1.3.2.1 Phase 1 (VCL -CB01- 101) Results
The first clinical stud y of ASP0113 was a multicenter, randomized, ope n-label phase 1 clinical 
study  (VCL -CB01 -101) designed to evaluate the safet y and i mmunogenicity  of ASP0113 in 44
healthy  adult CMV -seropositive and CMV -seronegative volunteers at doses of either 1 mg or 
5mg IMadministered on weeks 0, 2, and 8 in a dose escalation format and at a dose of 5 mg 
IMadministere d on day s 0, 3, 7 and 28 (accelerated schedule)[Wloch et al, 2008].
Overall ASP0113 was safe and well -tolerated. Volunteers receiving the higher dose or 
accelerated vaccine schedule tended to experience more local reactogenicity , but the severity  
of the treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs )did not increase with increasing dose an d 
a more compressed schedule. The incidence of local reactogenicit y, predominantly  injection 
site pain, was 62.5% for the lowest weekly  dose group , 87.5% for the highest weekly  dose 
group, and 100% forthe acc elerated schedule group . Several cutaneous TEAEs were 
considered related to ASP0113 by  the Investigator and included ery thema, rash and pruritus. 
One volunteer did experience a transient incre ase in CPK value greater than 5 x the upper 
limit of nor mal (UL N), but less than 10 xnormal. 
Immune responses to the 2 immunogens encoded in the vaccine, gB and pp65, were assessed 
by the use of an indirect gB binding enzy me-linked immunosorbent assay  for antibod y 
responses to gB and a pp65 direct ex -vivo interferon γ (IFN -γ)enzy me-linked 
immunosorbent spot assay  for T -cell responses to pp65. At 16 weeks, antibody  and/orcell 
responses were elicited in 38% and 50% of the CMV- seronegative volunteers adm inistered 
1mg and 5 mg ASP0113, respectivel y. CMV -seropositive volunteers had increases in pp65 
T-cell responses of 12.5% and 37.5% across all groups, but no increase in gB antibod y levels 
were detected for CMV -seropositive volunteers.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 11.3.2.2 Phase 2 (CB01- 202) Results
The second clinical study of ASP0113 was a mult icenter, randomized, double -blind phase 2 
clinical study  designed to evaluate the efficacy , immunogenicit y and safet y of ASP0113 in 
donors and CMV -seropositive r ecipients undergoing 5 of 6 or 6 of 6 HLA -allele -matched 
allogeneic HCT for the treatment of he matologic disorders [Kharfan- Dabaja, 2012] . A total 
of 108 subjects were enrolled in the study , including 14 donor/recipient pairs, and received at 
least 1 dose of stud y drug [5 mg/mL (1 mL dose)] or placebo. Recruitment of donor/
recipient pairs was found to be impractical earl y in the study so that arm was dis continued; 
theresults are not discussed here. The intent -to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) populations 
comprise 80 and 74 trans plant recipients, respectively .Recipients received injections at 
approximately  days -5 to -3, 21 to 42 (1 injection in this window, health permitting), on day  
84, and on day  196 relative to transplantation. Results shown below are for the PP population.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of the study  was the occurrence of clinically significant CMV 
viremia, defined as detection of CMV viremia that resulted in the initiation of CMV -specific
antiviral therap yduring the first y ear of transplant . The clinical decision to treat at the sites 
was based on the most current local or central CMV assay  results. CMV -specific antiviral 
therap y was i nitiated for a lower percentage of recipient subjects in the ASP0113 group 
(47%) than in the placebo group (61.8%), but the difference was not statistically  significant 
(P = 0.145 , Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel [CMH] test stratified by site ). The PP population was 
modified for this anal ysis to exclude 2subjects who received CMV -specific AVT because of 
false positive results from the local viral load assay ).  
When t he occurrence of CMV viremia, as defined as ≥500 copies/mL  bya laboratory  
developed test (LDT) based upon the LightC ycler®polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) , was 
evaluated in a central laboratory , the rate was lower in the ASP0113 group (33%) than in the 
placebo group (62%) and was statistically  significant ( P = 0.008, CMH test stratified by  site). 
Post-hoc anal yses of the phase 2 data also suggest that the clinical endpoints which have been 
reported to be associated with CMV infection may be reduced as a result of vaccination with 
ASP0113, including mortality , aGVHD and cGVHD. For the clinical endpoints of aGVHD, 
cGVHD, and mortality  and a composite of CMV EOD, aGVHD, cGVHD and mortality , the 
observed rate for ASP0113 was lower than the corresponding obser ved rate for placebo, 
although the differences were not statisticall y significant [ Table 3].

Immune responses to the 2 immunogens, gB and pp65, encoded in the vaccine were assessed 
by 2immunoassay s: 1) a gB-specific IgG -binding ELISA; and 2) an ex vivo pp65- specific 
IFN-γ ELISPOT [Kharfan- Dabaja, 2012]. T -cell responses to CMV pp65 and gB as well as 
gB-specific serum antibody  levels were similar in the ASP0113 and placebo recipients prior 
to conditioning therap y and transplant. The CMV pp65 T- cell responses were numerically  
enhanced in the ASP0113 group relative to the placebo grou p at all post -transplant times 
evaluated;  the differences in the responses were statistically  significant b y the Wilcoxon 
rank sum test at day  84 (P = 0.036). Please refer to the IBregarding other post -hoc anal yses

(P = 0.064, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and reached significance b y day 365 (P = 0.009, 
Wilcoxon rank sum test). Although the geometric mean gB antibody  levels were higher for 
the ASP0113 recipients at all time points evaluated, the repeated measurement ANOVA

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1using log 10transformed data from days 56 to 365 did not show a significant d ifference 
between the longitu dinal gB antibody  responses (P = 0.749).
Overall the vaccine appears to be safe and well -tolerated. The incidence of local reactogenicit y 
was higher in the ASP0113 group than in the placebo group (22.9% and 10.9%, respectively ), 
primarily  due to injection site pain. Fatalities were reported for 20.8% recipients in the 
ASP0113 group and 32.6% recipients in the placebo group during the 1 -year study  follow -up.  
No recipient died due to study  drug -related AEs. No subject experienced CPK elevation in this 
study . One subject in the ASP0113 arm discontinued the study  due to a serious allergic 
reaction that was considered b y the Investigator to be possibly  related to ASP0113. 
The subject

1.4 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs
ASP0113 in nonclinical studies was in general well -tolerated. Nonclinical studies 
demonstrated that the risk of integration of injected DNA into the host’s genome is negligible 
per FDA regulatory  guidance and induction of autoimmunity  is unlikely . No sy stemic organ 
toxicity  was noted. There was no local reactogenicity  reported, but in the highest dose groups 
in a repeated- dose toxicity  study  in rabbits, there was histologic evidence of inflammation in 
the muscles injected with vaccine and concurrent elevati ons in CPK.  
In the phase 1 and phase 2 clinical studies the vaccine was safe and well -tolerated. One healthy  
volunteer had a transient elevation in CPK (> 5x normal but < 10x normal). L ocal (injection 
site) reactions including pain, induration, ery thema, pruritus, discomfort and swelling were 
reported more frequently in the higher dosing group and more accelerated schedule with 
ASP0113 in healthy  volunteers and in the ASP0113 treated group when compared to the 
placebo group. The onl y discontinuation due t o an SAE that was possibly  related to ASP0113 
was the transplant recipient who was previousl y discussed in [Section 1.3.2.2].
1.5 Risk -
Benefit Assessment
Despite currently  licensed CMV -specific antiviral therapies, CMV disease continues to cause 
significant morbidit y and mortality in transplant recipients and CMV infection may  be 
associated with multiple other clinical outcomes including infections other than CMV 
aGVHD, cGVHD and mortality . In addition, the treatments and associated toxicities can 
incur significant healthcare costs. 
ASP0113 appeared to show efficacy  in a single phase 2 trial over multiple secondary  end-
points. The incidence of local reactogenicit y may be greater with ASP0113 than placebo. In 
addition, while there were CPK elevations at the highest dose level in toxicity  studies in 
rabbits, significant damage to the muscle, as determined by  CPK elevations greater than 
10times the ULN, has not been o bserved in humans. One SAE (h ypersensitivity /allergic 
reaction) leading to discontinuation responded well to medical treatment and was deemed not 
life-threatening. False positive results in the assessment of CMV viral load can occur in 
subjects receiving A SP0113 with the use of PCR assay s that utilize primers targeted at gB

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1and pp65. Such false positive results, if unrecognized, can lead to misdiagnosis and 
unnecessary  initiation of AVT . 
Given the continued morbidity  and mortality  associated with CMV infec tion and treatment, the 
evidence of e fficacy  in the p hase 2 trial in HCT recipients and the safety  profile of ASP0113, 
continued investigation is warranted.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES, DE SIGN AND VARIABLES
2.1 Study Objectives
●To evaluate the efficacy  of ASP0113 compa red with placebo as measured by  a primary  
composite endpoint of overall mortality  and CMV EOD through 1 year post -transplant.
●To evaluate the sa fety of ASP0113 in subjects undergoing allogeneic HCT.
2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale
2.2.1 Study Design
This isa randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately  500 subjects 
being conducted in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio, ASP0113 or placebo, and stratified by  donor -recipient relatedness and donor 
CMV serostatus. At least 30% of subjects enrolled will be donor- seronegative. The test
compound will be a vaccine (ASP0113) which contains 2 plasmids encoding gB and pp65, 
each at 2.5mg/mL, formulated with CRL 1005 poloxamer and benzalkonium chl oride (BAK). 
The placebo control will be phosphate -buffered saline (PBS). Subjects will receive either 
5doses of ASP0113 or placebo on days -14 to -3, 14 -40, 60 ±5, 90 ± 10and 180 ±10 in 
relation to the day  of transplant (donor cell infusion). The first i njection must be given within 
72 hours prior to the start of chemotherap y and radiation therap y for conditioning andthe
second injection should be given as close as possible to, but not prior to , day 14 .The platelet 
count must be at least ≥ 50000/mm3(spontaneously or after platelet transfusion) performed 
by thelocal laboratory within 3 days prior to all study  drug injections. Prior to all study  drug 
injections, confirmation must be made that there is no medical contraindication to an I M 
injection. Resul tsreceived in an equivalent local unit of measure must be converted to SI 
units. Syringes will be masked prior to dosing to blind the subjects and all other personnel 
who need to remain blinded to the treatment assignment (i.e., site staff other than pharmacy  
personnel and staff designated to administer study drug injections).
The pre -specified primary  endpoint is the composite of overall mortalit yand CMV EOD , 
through 1year post -transplant. Despite the significant decrease in CMV tissue- invasive 
disease related mortality , many  studies indicate that survival continues to be decreased in 
CMV -seropositive patients, suggesting an indirect effect of subclinical CMV infection on 
mortality  (see [ Table 5]) [Craddock et al, 2011 Yakoub- Agha et a l, 2006; Boeckh & Nichols, 
2004 ].

Some publications have suggested that mortality  related to CMV seropositivity  may  partiall y 
result from an increase in aGVHD, cGVHD and infections other than CMV as these outcomes 
result in decreased survival and are associated with CMV infection and CMV seropositivity  in 
the recipient or donor [Srinivasin et al, 2012; Cantoni et al, 2010; Larsson et al, 2004; Nichols 
et al, 2002] .
A key  secondary  endpoint is CMV viremia. CMV viremia will be protocol -defined as CMV 
plasma viral load of ≥ 1000 IU/mL as assessed b y the central laboratory through 1 year 
post-transplant . Another key  secondary  endpoint is adjudicated CMV -specific AVT through 
1year post -transplant .
CMV plasma viral load will be monitored per the following schedule during the primary  
study period (th rough day  365/V14): weekl y (±2 day s) during day s 0-100, every  other week
(± 5 days) during day s 101 -180, every  30 day s (±5 day s) during day s 181-365 .  The CMV 
plasma viral loads will be performed b y the central laboratory. CMV plasma v iral load will 
also be performed by the central laboratory  at the initiation of CMV -specific AVT. Upon 
initiation of CMV -specific AVT, plasma v iral load testing will be performed at least weekl y
until the CMV -specific AVT is discontinued, at which point, t he regularly scheduled plasma 
viral load assessments will resume.
Note: CMV plasma viral loads may  be performed at a local laboratory  approved b y the 
Sponso r and at the discretion of the Investigator. However, every  time a viral load sample is 
sent to the local laboratory a sample will also be sent to the central laboratory for

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1confirmatory  testing .Pre-emptive therap y may be started based on the central or local 
laboratory  assessment and the subject’s clinical condition.
As 1 of the plasmids of the ASP0113 vaccine codes for the pp65 antigen, the theoretical 
possibility  of interference with the pp65 antigenemia assay  has been raised. At present, there 
are no data to suggest that such interference occurs. However, to ensure pati ent safet y and 
study  integrit y, sites that use pp65 antigen as their local methodology for the detection of 
CMV infection must adhere to the procedures defined below as a condition of participation in 
the trial.
●The local pp65 antigenemia results must be e ntered i nto the eCRF database within 
72hours (or next business day ) of receipt to facilitate in -time monitoring of results.
●The Medical Monitor must be called within 48 hours (or next business day) if the pp65 
antigenemia test is positive and the central laboratory  PCR viral load result is negative .
●Both the pp65 antigenemia and the central laboratory test must be repeated within 
48hours if the local pp65 antigenemia result is positive, the central laboratory  PCR viral 
load result is negative and the subject is treated with CMV -specific AVT.
The plasmids in the study  vaccine may  interfere with certain PCR assay s.If a PCR assay  is 
used that amplifies the genes UL55/gB or UL83/pp65, this could result in either a false 
positive viral load or unblinding of the stud y subject.
Sites that aredetermined to have unacceptable PCR assay  in their local laboratory but were 
able to determine a Sponsor deemed acceptable work practice flow for utilizing another 
acceptable local assay  or methodology  will be allowed to pa rticipate in the trial .
Note:   Local CMV plasma viral load testing may be performed onl y at a local laboratory 
approved b y the Sponsor.
Adjudicated CMV -specific AVT will be assessed for subjects up to 1 year following transplant 
through the primary  study  period (through day  365/ V14).
Immunologic response will be assessed in all subjects atV2, V5 , V8, V9, V11 and V14. If the 
visit coincides with a study  drug administration, the sample will be drawn prior to injection. 
In addition, if a CMV seropositive donor has consented and is participating in the optional 
donor cell sub- study , a 20mL peripheral blood sample from the donor will be obtained prior 
to the stem cell donation for recipients participating in the main trial to test for CMV -specific 
T-cells. For those donating peripheral stem cells, the donor blood sample is to be collected 
prior to the initiation of mobilization therapy  (e.g. ,granulocy te colon y stimulating factor 
[G-CSF]).
Subjects will be evaluated for local reactogeni city and sy stemic signs and sy mptoms for 
60minutes (±10 minutes) after each injection. Subjects will be directl y observed for 
15minutes following the injection for an y injection -related side effects, then remain in a 
designated area at the study  site for 45 minutes so that side effects can be noted and treated, if 
necessary . Local reactogenicity  will also be evaluated for each of the 7consecutive day s 
following each injection beginning approximately 24 hours after the dose (day  1-7 post dose).

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1The assess ments for each of the 7consecutive days following an injection will be done by  the 
subject and reported to the site via diary . When reactogenicity  is reported as an AE, it must be 
followed until resolution or medicall y stable. All local reactions ≥ Grade 3 [ Appendix 7] 
require confirmation b y a h ealth c are professional.
Subjects will be contacted after the last injection of vaccine through 5.5 years post -transplant 
forlong-term safet y related to the DNA vaccine.   Items to be assessed b y telephone interview 
and available patient records include mortality , development of an y new/recurrent cancer, 
development of infection requiring hospitalization or result ingin death, a nd ery thema and/or 
induration at the injection sites [ Appendix 20].  
All AEs and SAEs will be collected from signing of the informed consent through 30 day s post 
lastdose of study  drug. All events requiring adjudication, Grade 3 and higher AEs as well as 
SAEs will be collected from 31 day s post last dose of study  drug through 1 year post -transplant .
Achange in medical status or medical history  from time of signing of informed consent 
through first dose of study  drug is to be reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate . 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be chartered to oversee safet y 
issues and futility  anal ysis. 
An Adjudication Committee (AC) will be chartered to adjudicate all cases of CMV EOD, 
initiation of CMV -specific AVT, and cause of death.
2.2.2 Dose Rationale
Efficacy  and s afety data was collected from normal healthy  subjects in a phase 1 trial as well 
as HCT recipients in a phase 2 clinical tr ial (V CL-CB01 -101 and CB01 -202, respectivel y).The 
dose used in the phase 2 study was1 mL of 5 mg/mL and 4 doses were given over 
approximately  a 6 month time period. The dose and dose schedule appeared to be well
tolerated.
The first dose of vaccine is schedule d to be administered at - 14 to -3 day s prior to transplant, 
and within 72 hours prior to the start of conditioning therap y. The first dose is scheduled 
during this time frame to ensure protein expression at the time of infusion of the donor stem 
cells as a nimal models demonstrate that the peak protein expression after injection of a DNA 
plasmid is between 3 and14 day s. This dose is given prior to the start of conditioning therapy  
as protein expression may be decreased because of a catabolic state in the pat ient after the start 
of conditioning therap y. The second dose of vaccine is scheduled as close to Day  14 after 
transplant as possible to ensure protein expression and development of a protective immune 
response at the expected time of the first viremic epi sodes, which is approximately  30 day s 
after transplant. Finall y, doses are scheduled for 60, 90 and 180 day s after transplant to help 
protect against late -onset viremia.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 14 STUDY PRODUCTS
4.1 Description of Study Products
4.1.1 Test Product
ASP0113 contains 2 closed circular plasmid macromolecules. The plasmids are purified from 
cellular components and formulated with CRL 1005 poloxamer and BAK, a cationic surfactant, 
in PBS. The combination of CRL 1005 and BAK produces a thermod ynamically stable 
self-assembled particulate sy stem with a defined particle size, surface charge and stability  
profile at room temperature. BAK is used to control and maintain the particle size distribution 
of the formulation.  
ASP0113 will be supplied by  theSponsor as a frozen solution in single dose 2 -mL vials 
containing 1.3 mL of 5 mg/mL ASP0113. ASP0113 is packaged in a cardboard secondary  
container.
ASP0113 is a milky  white suspension at room temperature, an d clear at temperatures below 
the cloud point of CRL 1005 (4°C -7°C). ASP0113 is to be stored frozen at -25oC ± 10oC.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1●That an y unused stud y drug is returned to the Sponsor or standard procedures for the 
alternative disposition of unused study  drug are followed with prior Sponsor approval.
Drug inventory  and accountability  records for the study  drugs will be kept by  the Investigator/ 
pharmacist. Study  drug accountability  throughout the study  must be documented. The 
following guidelines are therefore pertinent:
●The Investigator agrees to not supply  study  drugs to any  persons except the subjects in 
this study .
●The Investigator/pharmacist will keep the stu dy drugs in a pharmacy  or other locked and 
secure storage facility under controlled storage conditions, accessible only  to those 
authorized by  the Investigator to dispense these test drugs.
●A study  drug inventory  will be maintained by  the I nvestigator/phar macist. The inventory  
will include details of material received and a clear record of when they  were dispensed 
and to which subject.
●At the conclusion or termination of this study , the Investigator/pharmacist agrees to 
conduct a final drug supply  inventory and to record the results of this inventory  on the 
Drug Accountability  Record. I t must be possible to reconcile delivery  records with those 
of used and returned medication. Any  discrepancies must be accounted for. Appropriate 
forms of deliveries and retur ns must be signed b y the person responsible.
●Used or unused stud y drug must be returned to the depot for destruction unless 
prohibited by  local policy . In this instance, study  drug may  be destroy ed at the study  
center according to standard institutional pr ocedures and preferabl y after drug 
accountability  has been conducted by  the Sponsor or representative. Should this occur, a 
copy  of the standard institutional procedure for destroy ing investigational drugs will be 
provided to the Sponsor. Upon destruction, a cop y of the certificate of destruction must 
be provided for the Sponsor files and site drug accountability  records.
For sites in Japan:
The head of the study  center or the study  drug storage manager should take accountability  of 
the study  drugs as following issues.
●The study  drug storage manager should store and take accountability  of the study  drugs 
in conforming to the procedures for handling the study  drugs written by  the Sponsor.
●The study  drug storage manager should prepare and retain records of the study  drug's 
receipt, the inventory  at the study  center, the use by  each subject, and the return to the 
Sponsor or alternative disposal of unused study  drugs. These records should include 
dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if appli cable), and the subject 
identification codes.
The study  drug storage manager should prepare and retain records that document adequatel y 
that the subjects were provided the doses specified in the protocol, and reconcile all the study

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 14.4 Blinding
4.4.1 Blinding Method 
Subject s will be assigned to a double- blind treatment arm in the order in which they  are 
entered into the interactive response technology  randomization sy stem . Subject s will receive 
their allocated treatment assignment according to a computer -generated randomization 
schedule prepared b y the Sponsor or designee prior to the start of the study . (Refer to 
[Section 4.5]).
Only  the pharmacist and designated staff, including the person(s) injecting the vaccine will 
be unblinded to treatment. All other study  site staff will remain blinded to subjects’ treatment 
assignment. The s yringes will be masked prior to dosing to maintain the bli nd for subjects 
and all other personnel . Details regarding stud y blinding will be described in the Pharmacy  
Manual for the stud y.  
4.4.2 Retention of the Assignment Schedule and Procedures for Treatment Code 
Breaking 
The randomization list and study  medication blind will be maintained by the IRT s ystem 
vendor .
The DMC will be provided with access to the dosing assignment for periodic review of the 
unblinded data as documented in the DMC Charter.
Study  drug treatment may  be revealed onl y for reasons relating to the subject’s safet y and 
when critical therapeutic decisions are contingent on knowing the assigned study  drug ( refer 
to [Section 4.4.3] ). 
Withdrawal of a subject from the study  [Section 3.5] is not a sufficient reason to break the 
study  blind. The onl y reason to break the blind is whether the information gained materiall y 
alters the subsequent care of the subject. The reason to break the blind must be discussed 
with the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind. After receiving authorization for 
unblinding from the Sponsor , the Investigator will uti lize the I RT to unblind the subject’s 
treatment assignment.  Unblinding through the interactive s ystem may  only be done b y 
designated individuals at the site (ty pically  the Investigator or any  others specified b y the 
Sponsor ).As treatment assignment infor mation for each subject will be kept in the site’s 
pharmacy  records, if for some reason access to the I RT is not available the Investigator may 
obtain this information from the Pharmacist or designee. If the clinician breaking the blind is 
unable to reach the Medical Monitor and an urgent safet y issue with direct impact on patient 
care decisions warrants this action, the blind may  be broken, but the Medical Monitor must 
be informed as soon as possible after the blind is broken.
If the blind is broken for a subject, the reason is to be documented as a written entry  in the 
source document. Key  information will be recorde d at the time the blind is broken and 
entered in the subject’s e lectro nic case report form (eCRF ). This includes the subject number, 
date the blind was broken, the reason, the person who requested the breaking of the blind, the

contacted.
4.4.3 Breaking the Treatment Code for Emergency 
Breaking the treatment code, or u nblinding of an individual subject’s treatment assignment, 
may be done onl y for reasons relating to subject safet y or when critical therapeutic decisions 
are contingent upon knowing the blinded stud y drug assignment. As noted in [Section 4.4.2],
the only  reason to break the blind is whether the information gained materially  alters the 
subsequent care of the subject. The reason to break the blind must be discussed with the 
Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind. If the clinician breaking the blind is unable to 
reach the Medical Monitor and an urgent safety issue with direct impact on patient care 
decisions warrants this action, the blind may  be broken, but the Medical Monitor must be 
informed as soon as possible after the blind is broken.   
If it bec omes necessary  to break the code during the study , the date, time and reason will be 
collected in the subject’s eCRF and the appropriate source documents at the site .
4.4.4 Breaking the Treatment Code by the Sponsor
The Sponsor may break the treatment co de for subjects who experience a Suspected 
Unexpected Serious Ad verse Reaction (SUSAR) in order to determine if the individual case 
or a group of cases requires expedited regulatory  reporting . A code breaking process will be 
provided to the limited staff w ho are empowered to break the codes for all SUSAR cases for
regulatory  reporting purpo ses.
4.5 Assignment and Allocation
At the screening visit, after the Informed Consent Form (ICF) has been signed, the subject 
will receive a subject number assignment through the IRT for use throughout the study . 
Subjects who subsequently  meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be 
randomly  assigned to receive either ASP0113 or placebo . The randomization to treatment
will be equally allocated (i.e., 1:1) and stratified by  donor- recipient relatedness and donor 
CMV serostatus. At least 30% of subjects enrolled will be donor- seronegative.
The IRT vendor will generate the randomization schedule. To obtain the ran domized 
treatment assignment for a subject , the pharmacist or designee will utilize an I RT, which is 
available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day .
Randomization is to be done after the completion of the s creening period, and at 
least -14to-3 day sprior to the anticipated transplant day  (day  0). The first injection must be 
given within 72 hours prior to the start of conditioning therapy  after randomization .  After 
submitting required information about the eligible subject , the drug kit number assignment 
will be provided.
Study  drug assignment will remain bli nded to all site staff except the pharmacist and 
designated staff .

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1If a subject is randomized but does not receive study  drug, the subject number will not be 
used again. In this instance, the treatment assignment should only  be known by  the 
pharmacist and designated staff (i.e., the blind must be maintained as it is with all other 
subjects).
5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION
5.1 Dosing and Administration of Study Drugs and Other Medi cations
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period
One (1) mL of 5 mg/mL ASP011 3 or placebo will be administered to the subjects at the 
clinical site when there is no medical contraindication to an I M injection, in the deltoid muscle, 
alternating sides wi th each dose if possible .Preparation of study  drug will be described in the 
Pharmacy  Manual for the study . The s yringes will be masked to maintain the study  blind.  
The platelet count must be ≥ 50000/ mm3(spontaneously or after platelet transfusion) 
performed b y the local laboratory  within 3 days prior to all study  drug injections. Prior to all 
study  drug injections, confirmation must be made that there is no m edical contra -indication to 
an IM injection. Results received in an equivalent local unit of measure must be converted to 
SI units. If the subject’s platelet count does not meet this threshold at the time of the visit, the 
subject may return for the study  drug injection and local reactogenicit y asses sment at a later 
time within the allowable window for the visit. If the subject’s platelet count does not meet 
this threshold during the visit window, the dose must be skipped, and the reactogenicit y 
assessment and dose follow -up visit(s) should not be don e.
Doses will be given at the following time points:
●Dose 1 at day  -14 to -3 pre transplant, within 72 hours prior to the start of chemotherap y 
and radiation therap y for conditioning .
●Dose 2 at day  14-40(but not prior to day  14).
oDose 2 is to be administer ed as close to d ay 14 as possible. If the subject cannot be 
dosed by  day 40based on these criteria, V5 procedures (except study  drug injection 
and local reactogenicity  assessment) is to be completed within 5 day s of day  40
(day 40 to 45) and V6should be skipped.
●Dose 3 at day  60 (± 5 day s)
●Dose 4 at day  90 (± 10 days)
●Dose 5 at day  180 (± 10 days)

The number of stud y drug doses administered will be collected in the eCRF. If a subject fails 
to receive 1 or more doses of study  drug after the first injection, but is able to continue in the 
trial, the subject’s participation in the trial should not be t erminated.  
5.1.4 Emergency Procedures and Management of Overdose
No maximum tolerated dose for ASP0113 has been identified. In the event of an adverse 
clinical response to ASP0113 injection, interventions should be guided b y the subject’s

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 15.3.7 Immunogenicity
Because subject inclusion is dependent on serological evidence of previous CMV infection, 
IgG antibodies to gB will be present prior to transplantation.
An indicator of immunogenicity  elicited by  the vaccine is predicted to be an increase in 
gB-specific antibody  levels and the T -cell response to pp65 protein over time compared with the 
placebo group.  
Two immunog enicit y assessments will be performed:
1. T- cell response to viral protein pp65 using either ELISPOT assay  and/or intracellular 
cytokine staining (I CS).
2.Antibody  response to gB antigen using an ELISA- based platform.
Assessments will be done from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (T -cells) or serum samples 
(antibody ) isolated over the course of the trial. Time points of the assessments are as follows:
●On V2, V5, V8, V9, V11 and V14.
oSamples for T -cell assays will not be collected if the AL Cis known to be 
≤ 500 mm3by local or central laboratory  measurement. 
oIf the visit coincides with a study  drug administration, the sample will be drawn 
prior to injection.
Further details will be available in the Laboratory  Manual.
5.3.8 Resource Utilization and Patient Reported Outcomes 
Additional assessments include the following resource utilization and patient reported outcome 
measures:
●EuroQol (EQ -5D)
●FACT -BMT
●WPAI :GH
●Health Economic Assessment (HEA)
The EQ -5D, FACT -BMT , and WPAI :GH will be assessed at each dosing visit, at V13, and at 
the primary  study  period completion/day  365 visit (V14 ). The se questionnaires are to be 
completed b y the subject prior to an y other stud y assessments or visit procedures. Subjects are 
to complete these assessments in the following order: EQ -5D first, FACT -BMT second, WPAI 
last. For all 3patient -reported outcome measures, i.e. EQ- 5D, FACT -BMT, WPAI , the 
answers must come from the subject . If a subject is unable to answer a question, the rest of the 
questionnaire is still to be completed. If a subject is not able to provide an yanswer stothe 
questions, the assessment should be skipped.   
Health economic information will be collected for subjects through the primary  study  period 
completion/day  365 visit (V 14)[Section 5.3.8.4 ].

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 15.3.8.1 EQ-5D
The EQ -5D is an international standardized non -disease specific (i.e. generic) instrument for 
describing and valuing health status. I t is a measure of health- related QOL, capable of being 
expressed as a single index value and specifically designed to complement other health status 
measures. The questionnaire will be provided in the local language of the subject. The EQ -5D 
has 5 domains: Mobility , Self -Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and 
Anxiety /Depression. Each domain has 5 response levels (e.g., 1 = no problems, 2 = slight 
problems, 3 = moderate problems, 4 = severe problems, 5 = extreme problems). In addition, it 
has a visual analogue scale that elicits a self -rating by  the respondent of his/her health status 
[Appendix 14].
5.3.8.2 FACT -BMT
The FACT -BMT is a self -administered instr ument designed to assess multi -dimensional 
aspects of Q OL in BMT patients. The questionnaire will be provided in the local language of 
the subject.  It consists of the 27 -item FACT -General (FACT -G) and the 23- item Bone 
Marrow Transplantation Subscale (BMTS). The FACT -G assesses 4primary  dimensions of 
QOL, including ph ysical well-being (7 items), social/ family  well- being (7 items), emotional 
well-being (6 items), and functional well- being (7 i tems). A 5 point response scale ranging 
from 0 to 4 is used (0 = 'not at all'; 1 = 'a little bit'; 2 = 'some what'; 3 = 'quite a bit'; and 
4 ='very much') [Appendix 15].
5.3.8.3 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: General Health Questionnaire 
The WPAI :GH is a 6- question instrument designed to assess the effect of health problems 
(physical or emotional problem or sy mptom) on an individual’s ability  to work and perform 
regular activities [Appendix 16]. The questionnaire will be provided in the local language of 
the subject.
5.3.8.4 Health Economic Assessment 
Health Economic Assessments (see [Appendix 21]) will include the following: 
hospitalizations recorded as number of day s in the I ntensive Care Unit, Step -down Unit, and 
general medical ward, (including bone marrow transplant [BMT] unit) , (including emergency  
room [ER] visits greater than 24 hours) also non-protocol -related phy sician (MD/DO) visits 
and ERvisits less than or equal to 24 hours. The information will be collected by  the site via 
a retrospective review of the subject’s medical record. HEA data will include both data being 
routinely  captured for the subject (e.g., concomitant medications) as well as data that will be 
used specifically  for these anal yses (e.g., information on hospitalizations).
5.3.9 Optional Donor Sub -Study (Not Applicable to Sites in Japan )
For CMV seropositive donors, there is an optional sub -study  for the testing of CMV -specific 
T-cells. A 20 mL peripheral blood sample from the donor will be obtained prior to the stem 
cell donation for recipients participating in the main trial. For those donating peripheral stem 
cells, the donor blood sample is to be collected prior to the initiation of mobilization therapy  
(e.g., G-CSF). Whether donors donating at institutions other than the site where the HCT will

5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a stud y drug 
or has undergone study  procedures and which does not necessaril y have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be an y unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.
Some countries may  have additional local requirements for events that are required to be 
reported as AEs or in an expedited manner similar to an SAE.  I n these cases, it is the 
investigator’s responsibility  to ensure these andother reporting requirements are followed 
and that the information is appropriatel y recorded in the eCRF accordingly.  
In this stud y, the day 0 HCT is not considered an AE. All AEs will be collected from signing 
of the informed consent through 30 day s after last dose of study  drug.  Onl y events requiring 
adjudication, Grade 3 and higher AEs will be collected from 31 day s after last dose of study  
drug through 1 year post -transplant. 
An abnormality  identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory  paramet er, vital sign,

signs and s ymptoms:
●Jaundice (bilirubin > 2 mg/dL or > 34 µmol/L ).
●Hepatomegal y with right upper qua drant pain.
●Ascites and/or weight gain (> 5% over baseline).
5.5.2.3 Adverse Events Commonly Associated with Vaccines
The following AEs have been reported with other vaccines and will be subject to specific 
monitoring:
●Acute local vaccines reactions: local pain, r edness, swelling or induration (as defined in 
Section 5.4.2.1 )
●Allergic and dem yelination reactions
5.5.3 Definition of SAEs
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any  of the following outcomes:
●Results in death.
●Is life threatening ( an AEis considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AEthat, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death).
●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability  to conduct normal life functions. 
●Results in congenital anomaly , or birth defect.
●Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hospitalization for treatment/observation/examination caused b y AE is to be considered 
as serious).
●Results in drug exposur e during pregnancy . 
●Other medicall y important events.
In this stud y, the day 0 HCT is not considered an SAE.
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important me dical events that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may  jeopardize the subject or may  
require intervention to prevent 1 of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These 
events, including those that may result in disability /incapacit y, are also usually  considered 
serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an ER or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Safety  events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study  (e.g., stud y drug, comparator, background therap y) that may  require expedited 
reporting and/or safet y evaluation include , but are not limited to:

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1list does NOT change your reporting obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting 
the definition of an SAE as detailed above. The purpose of this list is to alert y ou that some 
events reported as SAEs may not require expedited reporting to the regulatory  authorities 
based on the classification of “common serious adverse events” as specified in 
[Appendix 3]Common Serious Adverse Events and Endpoint Events . The Sponsor will 
monitor these events throughout the course of the study  for any  change in frequency .Any 
changes to this list will be communicated to the participating investigational sites. 
Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as stated in [Section 5.5.6] 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events. 
5.5.9 Procedure in Case of Pregnancy
If a female subject or partner of a male subject becomes pregnant from first dose through
1year post -transplant, the Investigator must report the info rmation to the Sponsor /delegated 
CRO as if it is a nSAE . The expected date of delivery  or expected date of the end of the
pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated fertility  date, pregnancy  result, neonatal data, and 
any other clinicall y relevant information must be included, if available and if the mother has 
granted release of medical information.
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother ,as well as the fetus ,as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor /delegated CRO .
When the outcome of the pregnancy  falls under the criteria for SAE s (spontaneous abortion, 
induced abortion, stillbirth, death of newborn, congenital anomal y [including anomaly in a 
miscarried fetus)], the Investigator must respond in accordance with the report procedure for 
SAE s.  Additional information regarding the ou tcome of a pregnancy  (which is categorized 
as an SAE ) is mentioned below.
●“Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion.
●Death of an infant within 1 month (30 day s) after birth must be reported as an SAE
regardless of its relati onship with the study  drug. 
●If an infant dies more than 1 month (30 day s) after the birth, it must be reported if a 
relationship between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study  drug is judged as 
“possible” b y the Investigator .
●In the case of a de livery  of a living newborn, the “normality” of the infant is evaluated at 
the birth.
●“Normality ” of the miscarried fetus is evaluated by visual examination unless test results 
which indicate a congenital anomaly  are obtained prior to miscarriage.
If during the conduct of a clinical trial, a male subject makes his partner pregnant through 
1year post -transplant, the subject will be asked to report the pregnancy  to the Investigator . 
The Investigator will report the pregnancy  to the Sponsor viaan SAE/delegate d CRO
reporting form .

management of patients undergoing HCT and other diseases, and in the conduct and 
monitoring of randomized clinica l trials with interim analy ses.
The DMC statistician will perform a futility  anal ysis on efficacy  data for presentation to the 
DMC at selected DMC meetings. The futility  of ASP0113 will be monitored based on its 
effect on viremia (defined as a CMV plasma viral load ≥1000 IU/mL  as assessed by  the 
central laboratory ).It is believed that viremia is a surrogate of treatment effect on clinical 
endpoints. Subjects receiving ASP0113 had a statistically  significant reduction in viremia 
relative to placebo in the phase 2 trial of ASP0113. Although there are no explicit safety  
stopping rules, all safet y issues will be thoroughl y evaluated b y the DMC with special 
attention paid to local reactogenicity  and hy persensitivity  cases.
Futility  anal ysis will be performed when the first 100 subjects have been randomized, and 
every  3 months t hereafter until the total e nrollment reaches 400 subjects. Futility  anal ysis are 
based on the rate of CMV viremia defined as CMV plasma load ≥1000 IU/mL  as assessed b y 
the central laboratory . Analy sis will include all available viremia data obtained from t he 
central laboratory  up to the time of a cut -off point for each futility  anal ysis. At each futility  
analysis, a Bay esian posterior probabilit y that the hazard ratio for viremia of the ASP0113 
treatment group to the placebo treatment group will be less tha n 0.75 will be calculated.
The study  may  stop for futility  if:Posterior Probability  of (Vir trt/Vir con <0.75) < 0.15 at an y 
time point when futility  analy sis is performed, including when a planned interim data 
analysis is conducted, where Vir trtis the hazard of viremia in the ASP0113 group and Vir con
is the hazard of viremia in the placebo group.
The DMC will determine if the futility criterion for discontinuation of the study  has been 
met. If the criterion has been met, sufficient information will be provided to Astellas 
representatives to enable them to evaluate and, if applicable, act on the recommendation of 
the DMC.
If an Investigator intends to discontinue participation in the study , the Investigator must 
immediately  inform the Sponsor (UNIQUE to JP: and the head of the Study  site) of the 
discontinuation and the reason for it.
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY
This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of approximately  500 subjects.
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
standard deviation, minimum, median and maximum) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency  and percentage for categorical endpoints. Statistical tests will be conducted using a 
significance level of 0.05. Con fidence intervals will be 95%, except were otherwise indicated.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 17.1 Sample Size
In the primary  anal ysis set of a phase 2 study  of the efficacy  of ASP0113 in HCT, 7 subject s
died and 2 additional subjects experienced CMV EOD out of 40 treated with ASP0113, for 
an overall failure rate of 22.5 %.while among the placebo subjects 11 subjects died and 1 
additional subject experienced CMV EOD out of 34, for an overall failure rate of 35.3%. 
To detect the estimated difference in mortalit y and CMV EOD from the phase 2 study 
(35.3% vs. 22.5%), the study  needs a sample size of at least 424 (212 per arm) to have 80% 
power at the 2- sided significance level of 0.050. A trial of size 500 (250 per arm) is expected 
to have 86% power for the composite endpoint.
All calculations are based on 1:1 randomization and used nQuery  Advisor 7.0.
7.2 Analysis Set
Prior to database lock, a Final Review of Data and TLFs Meeting will be held to allow a 
review of the clin ical trial data and to verify  the data that will be used for analy sis set 
classification. If required, consequences for the statistical anal ysis will be discussed and 
documented.  A meeting to determine anal ysis set classifications will also be held prior to 
database lock.
7.2.1 Safety Analysis Set 
The safet y analysis set ( SAF) consists of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose 
of randomized study  drug. Subjects will be included in anal yses using the SAF based on 
treatment actually  received.
The SAF will be used for summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics and 
analysis for all safet y and tolerability related variables .
7.2.2 Full Analysis Set 
The full anal ysis set (FAS) consists of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of 
randomized study  drug. Subjects will be included in analyses using the FAS based on 
assigned treatment, even if 1 or more doses of the incorrect treatment were given. The FAS 
will be used for summaries of demographic and baseline characteristics and for prima ry 
analysis of the efficacy  variables.
7.2.3 Per Protocol Set 
The per p rotocol set (PPS) includes all subjects of the FAS who have no major protocol 
violations. Criteria will be defined in the SAP.
Final judgments on exclusion of subjects from the PPS, based on protocol violations, are to 
be made at the Blind Data Review Meeting held prior to unblinding. 
The PPS will be used for secondary  analyses of efficacy  variables. Also, selected 
demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the PPS.

The immunogenicit y analy sis set ( IAS)includes subjects who receive drandomized study
drug for whom at least 1 post-transplant immunogenicity  measurement is available .
The IAS will be used for analyses of the immunogenicity data.
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics such as age, race, gender, height, weight, base line 
disease status , baseline disease therap y, and donor -recipient relatedness will be summarized 
overall and by treatment group using each anal ysis set. For subjects with donors included in 
the optional donor substudy , numbers and percent of donors with T -cell immunity  to pp65 
will be summarized by  treatment group. 
Continuous variables will be summarized by  descriptive statistics ( e.g., n, mean, standard 
deviation, minimum, median, and maximum) and discrete variables will be summarized by  
the number and percentage of subjects in each category .
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Variable
7.4.1.1 Primary Analysis
In order to compare the effect on the primary  composite endpoint between ASP0113 and 
placebo, the following null hy pothesis will be constructed:
H0: Odds Ratio = 1.
The accompan ying alternative hy pothesis is:
H1: Odds Ratio ≠ 1.
The 2 -sided P value for the above h ypothesis tests will be calculated using the CMH test 
stratified by  the 2stratification factors for randomization ( donor- recipient relatedness and 
donor CMV serostatus). The effect of ASP0113 will be considered statistically  significant if 
the CMH rejects the null hy pothesis at the significance level of 0.050.   
Every  effort will be made to collect each subject’s stat us that will define the outcome of the 
primary  endpoint. For the primary  anal ysis, subjects with unknown survival status will be 
considered as having the primary  endpoint event.   
In addition, t he Breslow -Day test will be used to assess the consistency  of the odds ratio 
across the strata. In the event that the Breslow- Day test is significant at the 0.10 level, 
tabulations of the treatment effect w ill be provided for each stratum to assess the strength of 
possible treatment -by-strata interactions.

post-transplant follow -up period for the long -term follow -up will not be included for the 
primary  anal ysis of the primary  endpoint .
7.4.1.2 Secondary Analysis for the Primary Endpoint
An anal ysis of the pr imary  endpoint will be repeated on the PPS . The method used for this 
analysis will be identical to the primary  anal ysisdescribed in [Section 7.4.1.1 ].Additional 
sensitivity  anal yses for the primary  endpoint will be conducted using onl y the subjects having 
complete follow -up through 1 year post -transplant and using alternative imputations of 
outcomes.
7.4.1.3 Subgroup Analysis
The impact on treatment effect will be assessed b y a Breslow -Day test for each of the 
following factors:  a ge(less than study  median, greater than or equal to study  median) , race
(white, non- white), gender (male, female), subjects who had ATG as part of their 
conditioning regimen vs. those who did not, and myeloablative vs. non -myeloablati ve 
conditioning regimen. If the P value of Breslow -Day test is ≤ 0.10 the treatment effect will be 
estimated for each strata of the subgroup.  
If enough donors are enrolled in the optional donor substudy  then subgroup anal yses by 
donor T -cell mediated immunity  will also be performed.
7.4.2 Analysis of Secondary Variables
7.4.2.1 Key Secondary Variables
A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to assess the effect on the time -to-first 
protocol -defined CMV viremia through 1 year post -transplant. Protocol- defined CMV 
viremia is defined as a CMV plasma load ≥1000 IU/mL  as assessed b y the central laboratory.  
The Cox model will contain the same terms as the 1 described above. Vaccine efficacy  will 
be estimated as:
VE = 1 –hazard ratio, and 95 % CI  will be provided.
To compare the treatment effect on protocol -defined CMV viremia between ASP0113 and 
placebo, the following null hy pothesis will be constructed:
H0: VE ≤ 20%.

28Oct 2016 Astellas Page 78of 136
Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1The accompan ying alternative hy pothesis is:
H1: VE > 20%.
The P value for the above hy pothesis tests will use a Wald statistic using the Cox model 
parameter estimate for the treatment effect, θ t:
Z = ( θt–ln(1- 20%))/S.E.( θt)
The 95% CI for VE will be calculated b y taking 1 minus the 95% CI  for the hazard ratio. 
Alternative h ypothesis will be accepted if the 95% CI  for VE excludes 20%.
The hazard rate of first adjudicated CMV- specific AVT through 1 y ear post -transplant and 
for first CMV -specific AVT for protocol defined viremia will be anal yzed similar to the 
analysis for CMV viremia. These anal yses will test for simple superiority  (0% efficacy  
margin) rather than use a 20% efficacy  margin. 
7.4.2.2 Other Secondary Variable
The endpoint of time to first CMV -specific AVT for protocol- defined CMV viremia or CMV 
EOD through 1 year post -transplant will be anal yzed using a Cox proportional hazards model 
which includes effects for treatment, donor CMV serostatus, and donor -recipient relatedness.
7.4.3 Analysis of Other Variables 
The maximum grade of aGVHD , maximum cGVHD global score, number of episodes of 
protocol -defined CMV viremia, and duration of hospitalizations will e ach be tested using a 
Kruskal -Wallis test. 
Incidence of overall mortality , CMV EOD, grade 3-4 aGVHD, severe cGVHD, grade 3 
infections other than CMV, relapse mortali ty, non- relapse mortality ,graft rejection, failure to 
engraft, and incidence of relapse of primary  disease requiring therap y will each be tested 
using a stratified anal ysis of the binary  response using a CMH test to account for the 
stratification variabl es used as part of the randomization. Subjects who discontinue the study  
without experiencing the event considered in the analy sis will be considered as having the 
event for the statistical analy sis.
Number of episodes of protocol- defined CMV viremia [CMV plasma viral load 
≥1000 I U/mL by  the Abbott RealTi meCMV assay as assessed b y the central laboratory ] will 
be compared between treatments using the stratum- adjusted Kruskal -Wallis test, adjusting for 
donor- recipient relatedness and donor CMV status. To estimate the association between 
CMV viremia and mortality , a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model will be 
constructed in a time -dependent manner. The model will be adjusted for the factors used to 
stratify  the randomization. CMV viremia will be treated as a time-dependent variable, 
starting at the time of the first occurrence of protocol-defined CMV viremia.
The maximum grade of aGVHD, maximum cGVHD global score, and duration of 
hospitalizations will each be tested using a stratum -adjusted Kruskal -Wallis test adjusting for 
donor- recipient relatedness and donor CMV serostatus .

PD2- Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not withdrawn,
PD3- Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,
PD4- Received excluded concomitant treatment.
7.9 Interim Analyses and Early Discontinuation of the Clinical Study
Futility  anal ysis will be conducted during this study . Futility  will be monitored based on the 
effect of ASP0113 on viremia (defined as a CMV plasma viral load ≥1000 IU/mL as assessed 
by the central laboratory ).  It is believed that viremia is a surrogate of treatment effect . 
Futility  anal ysis will be performed when the first 100 subjects have been randomiz ed, and 
every  3 months thereafter until the total enrollment reaches 400 subjects. At each futility  
analysis, a Bay esian posterior probabilit y that the hazard ratio for viremia of the ASP0113 
treatment group to the placebo treatment group will be less than 0.75 will be calculated.  The 
study  may  stop for futility  ifthis po sterior probability is less than 0.15. 
Futility  anal ysis will be carried out by  an external data anal ysis group. Sponsor personnel 
will not have access to unblinded interim analy sis data during the study  unless the fut ility 
criterion is met and the Sponsor needs to make a decision on discontinuing the trial.
7.9.1 DMC
A DMC, independent of the Sponsor and investigators, will be established to review the 
safet y data throughout the study . The ind ependent DMC statistician will have access to the 
randomization schedule. Unblinded deliverables for use by  the DMC will be created b y an 
independent data anal ysis center. The Sponsor will not have access to the unblinded tables 
and listings created for th e DMC. All subjects who have been enrolled will be included in the 
DMC reviews and all data submitted to the DMC will remain blinded to Astellas personnel 
involved in the study .

7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information
In the anal ysis of the primary  endpoint, subjects with unknown survival status will be 
assumed to have had the primary  endpoint. Sensitivity  anal ysis excluding those subjects from 
the denominator will be conducted. Other imputations of missing data will be considered 
based on the nature and quantity  of missing data with appropriate statistical methods which 
will be fully  specified prior to unblinding. Assignments of observations to visits for analyses 
by scheduled visit will be based on dates relativ e to date of transplantation. The detail s will 
be described in the SAP.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1A protocol waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an Investigator to 
deviate from the protocol. Protocol waivers are strictly  prohibit ed within Astellas.
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any subject who: 
●Entered into the study  even though they  did not satisfy  entry  criteria. 
●Developed withdrawal criteria during the study  and was not withdrawn. 
●Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose. 
●Received exc luded concomitant treatment. 
When a deviation from the protocol is identified for an individual subject, the Investigator or 
designee must ensure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor will follow -up with the 
Investigator , as applicable, to assess the deviation and the possible impact to the safet y and/or 
efficacy  of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study . 
If a deviation impacts the safet y of a subject, the Investigator must contact Sponsor
immediately .
The Investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory  
authorities criteria are documented and communicated appropriatel y. All documentation and 
communications to the IRB/IE C and applicable regulatory  authorities will be provided to 
Astellas and maintained within the Trial Master File.

8.2.4 Subject Confidentiality
Individual subject medical information obtained as a result of this study  is considered 
confidential and disclosure to third parties is prohibited. Such medical information may  be 
given onl y after approval of the subject to the subject's ph ysician or to other appropriate 
medical per sonnel responsible for the subject's well -being.
The Sponsor shall not disclose an y confidential information on subjects obtained during the 
performance of their duties in the clinical study  without justifiable reasons.
The Sponsor affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy . Onl y a 
subject identification number and/or initials (if not prohibited by  local regulations) will 
identify  subject data retrieved b y the Sponsor. However, the Sponsor requires the 
Investigator to permit the S ponsor, Sponsor's representative(s), the IRB/IEC and when 
necessary , representatives of the regulatory  health authorities to review and/or to copy  any 
medical records relevant to the study .
The Sponsor will ensure that the use and disclosure of protected h ealth information (PHI) 
obtained during a research study  complies with the federal and/or regional legislation related 
to the privacy  and protection of personal information ( e.g., HIPAA for U.S. sites ).
For US sites, the HIPAA Privacy Rule provides federa l protection for the privacy  of PHI b y 
implementing standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually  identifiable 
health information of subjects participating in Sponsored clinical trials. "Authorization" is 
required from each research sub ject, i.e. specific permission granted b y an individual to a 
covered entity  for the use or disclosure of an individual's PHI. A valid authorization must 
meet the implementation specifications under the HI PAA Privacy  Rule. Authorization may  
be combined into the Informed Consent document (approved b y the IRB/IEC) or it may  be a 
separate document [approved by  the IRB/IEC or designated privacy  board (PB)] or provided 
by the Investigator or Sponsor (without I RB/IEC or PB approval). It is the responsibility  of 
the Investigator and institution to obtain such waiver/authorization in writing from the 
appropriate individual.
For sites in Japan:
All individuals and organizations involved in the study  must pay  very  careful attention to 
protect subjects' privacy  with app ropriate measures, for example, by  prohibiting the use of any

documents, or from other sources, they  may  not leak the content to third parties.
8.3 Administrative Matters
8.3.1 Arrangement for Use of Information and Publication of the Clinical Study
Information concerning the study  drug, patent applications, processes, unpublished scientific 
data, the IB and other pertinent information is confidential and remains the propert y of the 
Sponsor. Details should be disclosed only to the persons involved in the approval or conduct 
of the study . The Investigator may  use this information for the purpose of the study  only. It is 
understood by  the Investigator that the Sponsor will use the i nformation obtained during the 
clinical study  in connection with the development of the drug and therefore may  disclose it as 
required to other clinical i nvestigators or to regulatory  agencies. In order to allow for the use 
of the information derived from this clinical study, the I nvestigator understands that he/she 
has an obligation to provide the Sponsor with all data obtained during the study .
The study  will be considered for publication or presentation at (scientific) sy mposia and 
congresses. The Invest igator will be entitled to publish or disclose the data generated at their 
respective stud y site onl y after submission tothe Sponsor all transcripts, texts of 
presentations, and abstracts related to the stud y at least (for sites in Japan: 90 days prior to
the intended submission for publication or an y other disclosure studies, or ) 30 day sprior to 
the intended submission for publication or an y other disclosure studies for APGD -Sponsored 
studies. This is necessary to confirm whether an y inventive knowledge should be protected 
by a patent or not andto prepare and file a patent application accordingly . In addition this is 
in no way  intended to restrict publication of facts or opinions formulated by  the Investigator. 
The Sponsor will inform the I nvestigator in writing of any  objection or question arising 
within 30 day s of receipt of the proposed publication material.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.2 Appendix 2:  Definition of CMV Disease
Disease type Definition
CMV p neumonia Signs and/or symptoms of pulmonary disease combined with the detection of 
cytomegalovirus (inBAL fluid *)or lung tissue samples performed by virus 
isolation, histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, o r in situ 
hybridization   
(The presence of fungal copathogens such as Aspergillus species, together w ith 
radiologic signs typical of Aspergi lluspneumonia [e.g.,a halo sign or a crescent 
sign]indicates fungal pneumonia rather than CMV pneumonia )
CMV g astrointestinal 
diseaseCom bination of clinical symptoms from the upper o r low er gastrointestinal tract, 
findings of macroscopic m ucosal lesions on endoscopy, and demonstration of
CMV infection (by culture, histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical 
analysis, or in situ hybridizations) in a gastrointestinal tract biopsy specimen. If 
CMV is detected in normal mucosa near a lesion consistent with thos e typical of 
CMV infection, this can be accepted as CMV gastrointestinal disease.
CMV h epatitis Elevated bilirubin and/or enzyme levels during liver function testing, absence 
of other documented cause of hepatitis , and detection of CMV infection (by 
culture, histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) in a liver biopsy specimen. Other pathogens, such as hepatitis C 
virus, may be present without excluding the diagnosis of CMV hepatitis.
CMV CNS disease CNS sym ptoms tog ether with the detection of CMV in cerebrospinal fluid 
samples , by culture or PCR , or in brain biopsy specimens, by culture, 
histopathologic testing, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ hybridization.
CMV r etinitis Lesions typical of CMV retinitis must be confirmed by an ophthalmologist or as 
confirmed by detection of CMV in vitreous fluid by culture or PCR.
CMV nephritis CMV infection (by culture, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of histologi c features of CMV 
infection in a kidney biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with renal 
dysfunction.  Detection of CMV in the urine of a patient with kidney dysfunction 
does not fulfill the definition of CMV nephritis.
CMV cystitis CMV infection (by culture, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV infection in a bladder biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
cystitis. Detection of CMV in urine combined with identification of symptoms 
does not fulfill the definition of CMV cystitis.
CMV myocarditis CMV infection (by culture, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV inf ection in a heart biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
myocarditis.  
CMV pancreatitis CMV infection (by culture, immunohistochemical analysis, or in situ 
hybridization) together with the identification of conventional histologic features 
of CMV i nfection in a pancreatic biopsy specimen obtained from a patient with 
pancreatitis.  
Other CMV disease 
categoriesDefinitions for additional disease categories include the presence of compatible 
symptoms and signs and documentation of CMV by biopsy with other relevant 
causes excluded.
BAL: bronchoalveolar lavage; CMV: cytomegalovirus; CNS: central nervous system; PCR: polymerase chain 
reaction
*Whenever a BAL is performed, fluid should be collected and a sample will be stored at the central laboratory.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1Arrhythmia (score 1): Any type of arrhythmia that has necessitated the delivery of a specific anti -arrhythmia 
treatment at any time in the patient’s past medical history.  A score is assigned even if the patient was in normal 
sinus rhythm at the time of data acquisition or at the landmark date.  
No score is assigned to transient arrhythmias that never required treatment.
Cardiovascular Com orbidity (score 1):   Assigned for cardiovascular comorbidity in the presence of 1 or more 
of the following 3 presentations:
1.Coronary artery disease:  This is based on the presence of a documented diagnosis of chronic exertional 
angina, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction at any point the patient’s past medical history.  
Information on prior placement of a coronary stent or undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
should support coding this comorbidity.
2.Congestive heart failure: At any time in the patient’s medical history, symptoms/signs of congestive heart 
failure (e.g. ,an exertional or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) that later responded to diuretics, afterload -
reducing agents, B -blocker, and/or digitalis.

Hepatic com orbidity (score 2 levels of severity):   The safety laboratories obtained at screening should be 
used to assess this score.  
1.Mild hepatic com orbidity (score 1):   The presence of 1 or more of the follo wing 3 clinical 
presentations: (1) elevated total bilirubin to a value higher than the upper limit of normal (ULN) and up to 
1.5 times the ULN. (2) elevated values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate amino transferase 
(AST) to values higher than the ULN and up to 2.5 times the ULN; or (3) a prior diagnosis of an infection 
with hepatitis B or C at any time in the patient’s past medical history.
2.Moderate to severe hepatic com orbidity (score 3): The presence of 1 or m ore of the follow ing 3 
clinical presentations: (1) elevated values of total bilirubin to a level higher than 1.5 times the ULN; (2) 
elevated values of ALT or AST to levels higher than 2.5 times the ULN or (3) a documented diagnosis of 
liver cirrhosi s at any time in the patient’s past medical history.
Obesity (score 1):   A body mass index higher than 35.00 kg/m2
Infection (score 1):   The presence of 1 or more of the followi ng 4 clinical presentations at s creening: (1) a

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.6 Appendix 6:  Definition of Morphologic Complete Remission
Complete remission will be defined as all of the following according to the revised 
recommendations of the international working group:
1. A bone marrow aspirate containing spicules with < 5% blasts with a count of at least 
200 nucleated cells and no Auer rods seen. If spicules are absent in the aspirate, a bone 
marrow biops y should confirm that < 5% blasts are present.
2.No evidence of a persistently  abnormal leukemic population by  flow cy tometry , if 
performed †.
3.Absolute neutrophil count > 1000/µL  and platelet count > 100000/µL .
4.No extramedullary  leukemia.
5. No blasts in peripheral blood.
†: If a result of flow cytometry is available, complete remission needs to be confirmed based all criteria 
including No.2 . Otherwise, complete remission will be evaluated per the above criteria except for N o.2.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1Organ scoring of chronic GVHD. *AP may be elevated in growing children, and not reﬂective of liver dysfunction. 
†Pulmonary scoring is to be performed using both the symptom and PFT scale whenever possible, if performed based on 
symptoms.  When discrepancy exists between pulmonary symptom or PFT scores the higher value should be used for ﬁnal 
scoring. Scoring using the LFS is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, grading using FEV 1should be used. The LFS is a 
global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established.  The percent
predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as 
follows: >80% = 1; 70% -79% = 2; 60% -69% = 3; 50% -59% = 4; 40% -49% = 5; < 40% = 6. The LFS = FEV1 score + 
DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12.
Global Scoring of c GVHD
●Mild:  1 or 2 organs or sites (except lung), with no clinically  significant functional 
impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites).
●Moderate:
oAt least 1 organ or site with clinically  significant but no major disability  
(maximum score of 2 in any  affected organ or site)  or;
o3 or more organs or sites wi th no clinically  significant functional impairment 
(maximum score of 1 in all affected organs or sites) or;  
oA lung score of 1 
●Severe:
oMajor disability  caused by  chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any  organ or site);
oA lung score of 2 or greater

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.18 Appendix 18:  Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment
Drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) has been the most frequent single cause of safet y-related 
marketing withdrawals for the past 50 years. Robust monitoring and expedited regulatory 
reporting of DILI during clinical trials are therefore required by  the FDA ( FDA Guidance, 
2009 ). However, monitoring and reporting of elevated liver function tests (LFTs) will be 
confounded in this trial because elevated LFTs are common in patients within 1 y ear after a 
hematopoietic cell transplant. Therefore, while LFTs will be monitored throughout this trial, 
extra pharmacovigilance will be performed onl y on those subjects that have marked elevations. 
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as marked where upper limit of normal ( ULN ):
ALT or AST Total Bilirubin
Marked > 20 x ULN Or > 10 x ULN
ALT: alanine aminotransferase; AST: aspartate aminotransferase; ULN: upper limit of normal
Iflaboratory  testing for a subject enrolled in study and with normal serum aminotransferases 
(AT) and TBL has an increase of serum AT > 5x ULN or total bilirubin (TBL) > 2 xULN by 
either local or central laboratory , the medical monitor is to be notified within 24 hours. If the 
enrolled subject had abnormal AT or TBL at time of enrollment and there is an increase in the 
AT to > 5 x baseline or the TBL to > 2x baseline, the medical monitor is to be notified within 
24 hours. Alerts will be generated b y the cent ral laboratory  regarding abnormalities to inform 
the Investigator, study  monitor and study  team. Notification to the medical monitor only  needs 
to be done at the onset of LFT elevations. However, if the subject has normal LFTs for > 2 
weeks between the LFT elevations described above, the medical monitor is to be notified for 
each event.
If laboratory  testing for a subject enrolled in the study  reveals an increase of serum AT to > 
20xULN, or TBL >10x ULN, at least all4of the usual serum hepatic measures (alanine 
aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [AL P] and 
TBL) is to be repeated by the central laboratory  and the medical monitor is to be notified 
within 24 hours of the elevated LFTs. Testing should be repeated within48 to 72 hours of 
notification of the test results. Alerts will be generated b y the central laboratory  regarding 
marked liver abnormality to inform the Investigator , study  monitor and study  team. Subjects 
should be asked if they  have an y symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary  dysfunction.
Follow -up Procedures
Confirmed marked abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughl y characterized b y 
obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pertinent history , PE and laboratory  tests. 
The site is to complete the L iver Abnormality  Case Report Form (LA -CRF) or an appropriate 
document . Information collected will include the following:
●Diagnosis of condition causing the elevated LFTs
●Central and local laboratory  measurement of elevated LFTs (including AST, AL T, TBL , 
direct bilirubin, and ALP)
●Concurrent medical conditions

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 1●Concurrent medic ations
●Prior conditioning medications with doses
●Alcohol and illegal substance use
●Hepatitis A, B, C and CMV and EBV testing to detect active replication of virus
●Liver imaging and biopsy results, if performed
Confirmed marked abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2- 3 times weekly andthen weekl y or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.  
Study Discontinuation
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFTs, such as viral hepatitis, pre-existing or 
acute live r disease or exposure to other agents associated with liver injury , the subject may  be 
discontinued from treatment. The Investigator may determin e that it is not in the subject’s best 
interest to continue study participation . 
In addition, if close monitoring for a subject with marked hepatic laboratory  tests is not 
possible, drug must be discontinued.
DMC Monitoring
In addition to the above, the DMC will assess unblinded events between the ASP0113 and 
placebo groups to determine if there appears to be a signal that the frequency  or severit y of 
liver events is greater in ASP0113 than placebo or/and than that reported in the literature.

Version 6.1 Incorporating Non -Substantial Amendment 112.19 Appendix 19:  Pharmacogenomics (PGx) Sub -Study
INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturall y occurring changes in a 
subject’s gene and/or expression based on genetic variation may  impact what treatment options 
are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by  technologies such as 
genot yping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy  or toxicity  may  
be better understood. PGx research may  identify  which genes are involved in determining the 
way a subject may  or may  not respond to a drug.
STUDY OBJECTIVES
The PGx research that may  be conducted in the future with acquired saliva samples is 
exploratory . The objective of this research will be to analy zeor determine gene s of relevance 
to clinical response, and toxicity /safety  issues.
By anal yzing genetic variations, it may  be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to ASP0113 in terms of efficacy  and/or toxicity .
STUDY POPULATION
Subjects who have consented t o participate in this study  may  also participate in the optional 
pharmacogenomics sub-study . As part of this sub- study , subjects must provide separate written 
informed consent prior to providing an y saliva samples that will be used at a later time for the 
pharmacogenomic analysis.
STUDY DESIGN
Site Sample Collection and Storage
Subjects who consent to participate in the PGx sub- study  will provide 1 saliva sample at
baseline (V2) prior to dosing. Each sample will be identified with a unique identifier. Samples
will be collected and shipped to the Sponsor designated central laboratory for prolonged 
storage. Detailed collection, storage, and shipment procedures will be included in the 
Laboratory  Manual for the study .
Central Laboratory and Research Laborat ory Processing and Storage / Sample Coding
Once received at the banking CRO, the samples will be assigned a unique sample code (second 
code) and stored frozen. A table linking the subject number (first code) with the newl y-
assigned sample code (second code ) will be kept by  the banking CRO. PGx anal ysis will be 
conducted using the second code onl y.
PHARMACOGENOMIC ANALYSIS
Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established y et. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis incase evidence suggests that ge netic variants may  be influencing the drug’s kinetics,

ethical committee (AREC) must approve the analysis plan.
DISPOSAL OF PHARMACOGENOMIC SAMPLES/DATA
All PGx sa mples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 y ears following study  
database hardlock. If there is no requirement for analy sis, the saliva sample will be destroy ed 
after the planned storage period. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time. 
When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be destroy ed. The 
results of an y PGx analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will be retained at 
Astellas indefinitely .
INFORMATION DISCLOSURE TO THE SUBJECTS
Retrospective PGx analysis may  be conducted following the conclusion of the clinical study , if 
applicable. The results of the genetic analy sis will not be provided to any  investigators or 
subjects, nor can the results be requested at a later date. An y information that is obtained from 
the PGx analy sis will be the propert y of Astellas.

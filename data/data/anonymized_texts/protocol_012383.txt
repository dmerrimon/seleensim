Name of Sponsor/Company:  Revance Therapeutics, Inc.  
Name of Finished Product:  Daxibotulinum toxin A for Injection   
Name of Active Ingredient:  daxibotulinumtoxinA  
Title of Trial :  
An Open -Label , Multi -Center Trial to Assess the Safety of Single and Repeat Treatments  of 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for Treatment of Moderate to Severe Glabellar Lines  (SAKURA- OLS)  
Trial  Center(s):   Approximately  60 centers  in the United States (US)  and Canada   
Number of Subjects Planned:  Approximately  1500 subjects will be enrolled for a single treatment  in 
addition  to approximately  600 roll over  subjects from the phase 3 pivotal 
SAKURA- 1 and -2 studies  for a total of 2100 subjects . 
Trial  Period :  The duration of subject participation will vary depending on number of 
treatments and duration of follow -up. A subject may be on trial for a 
maximum of 86 weeks , inclusive of a two week screening period . 
Phase of Development:  3 
Objective:  
To evaluate the long term safety of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to 
severe glabellar lines following single and repeat administration . 
Design and Methodology:  
This is a phase  3, open label, multi -center trial to assess the safety of single and  repeat administration of 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines. Approximately  1500 
adult subjects will be enrolled  for a single treatment ; all subjects who have completed participation in either 
Revance protocol SAKURA -1 or SAKURA -2 will be rolled over for repeat treatment s. Subjects  will have 
the opportunity of receiving up to two repeat treatments in this trial. It is anticipated that approxima tely 400-
500 subjects will be treated with three  treatments  at selected centers .  
All subjects will be followed for at least 12 w eeks, and up to  36 weeks , after each treatment for safety 
assessments.  If both Patient Frown Wrinkle Severity (PFWS) and  Investigator Global Assessment  Frown  
Wrinkle Severity ( IGA-FWS)  score s at maximum frown  return to baseline  at the Week 12 visit , or at a visit 
between Weeks 12 and 36, the visit at which these two score s are recorded will be the Final Evaluation Visit,  
and for those  subjects who receive multiple  treatments  (up to two ), this visit will serve as a retreatment visit. 
Subjects with multiple treatments will have a Final Evaluation Visit at Week 12  following  their final eligible 
treatment.  
All treatments will be intramuscular injections administered by a trained physician. Subjects will receive a 
total of 0.5mL of treatment, with of 0.1 mL administered per injection to five injection sites: two injections 
into each corrugator muscle and one injection in the procerus muscle.  
The duration of subject participation in this trial (SAKURA -OLS)  will vary depending on the number of 
treatments and duration of follow -up. Subjects who completed participation in  SAKURA -1 and SAKURA -2 
trials  may be eligib le for treatment on the ir last visit as long as w ritten informed consent  for the SAKURA-
OLS trial is obtained before any trial -related procedures (including any screening procedures) are performed  
and subjects meet eligibility criteria. Final Evaluation visit procedures of the controlled trials from which they are rolling over  will serve as the baseline for this trial.  A subject may be i n SAKURA -OLS  trial for a 
maximum of 86 weeks, inclusive of a two week screening period . The number of trial visits will vary per 
subject depending upon response to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. A subject may not be re -enrolled in 
the SAKURA -OLS trial after the Final Evaluation Visit (or after early discontinuation).

at Weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36  or until the retreatment. Post the second treatment follow -up (for the subjects 
who are re treated) at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12, then at Week s 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36 or until the 
retreatment.  Post the third treatment follow -up (for the subjects who receive the third treatment) at Weeks 1,  
2, 4, 8, and 12.  
Safety Evaluations:   
• Clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry,  prothrombin time  [PT], urinalysis )  
   
   
• Injection Site Evaluation  
  
  
• Concomitant medications  
• Collection of adverse events ( AEs) 
  
• Vital Signs   
• Physical Examination  
Effectiveness  Evaluations:   
• Investigator Global Assessment Frown  Wrinkle Severity (IGA -FWS)  
• Patient F rown  Wrinkle Severity (PFWS)   
• Investigator and Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)  
Other Evaluations:  
  
Diagnosis and Main Abbreviated Eligibility Criteria:   
Outpatient, male or non -pregnant, non- nursing females,  18 years of age or older , and in good general health 
with moderate (2) or severe (3) glabellar lines during maximum frown based on the IGA -FWS  and PFWS . 
(Refer to Protocol Section 3.4  “Eligibility Criteria”).  
Test Article, Dose and Mode of Administration:  
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection, 40 U , intramuscular injection , 0.5 mL 
Statistical Analyses:  
The trial subjects are eligible  to receive up to three treatments.  For analysis purpose s, the corresponding  
summary period will be defined for each  treatment.  For the trial- overall summary, all available data observed 
during the trial will be included. For analyses associated with a specific treatment, the summary will include 
all data observed since the treatment until the next treatment, or until the last visit of the trial when there is no 
subsequent treatment. To account for varying subject follow -up duration, the total follow -up duration (i.e., 
patient -years) will be calculated for each summary period. 
For the trial- overall summary, the baseline will be the last available  value prior to the first treatment. For 
summaries associated with a specific treatment, the baseline will be the last available value prior to treatment 
(i.e., re -baselined). 
In addition to subjects who are directly enrolled, the trial also include s subjects rolling over from two pivotal 
phase 3 studies, SAKURA -1 and SAKURA -2.  For the roll over subjects who are in the active treatment 
group in the prior trial, the first daxibotulinumtoxinA treatment in this open -label safety trial will in fact be 
their second daxibotulinumtoxinA treatment.   Based on the subject’s prior exposure to DaxibotulinumtoxinA

for Injection,  the following two summary groups will be defi ned for the analysis: Group A  and Group B . The 
former group will include all subjects who have received DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection  in either 
protocol SAKURA- 1 or SAKURA -2, and the latter  group will include the remaining trial subjects.  
Safety Analyses:  
All treatment -emergent adverse events (AEs) occurring during the trial will be recorded and classified on the 
basis of MedDRA terminology. All reported treatment -emergent  adverse events will be summarized, in terms 
of the number of subjects repor ting events, system organ class, preferred term, severity, relationship to trial 
drug and seriousness. When summarizing events by causality and severity, each subject will be counted only 
once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the ev ent with the greatest relationship and 
highest severity within each classification.  A list of AEs that lead to the subject ’s premature discontinu ation 
of the trial will be provided.  
Serious adverse events (S AEs) will be listed by subject. SAEs will be summarized  by severity and 
relationship to trial treatment . 
The summaries of AEs and SAEs will be performed for the trial overall, and for each of the three treatment  
periods. For SAEs and key AEs , rate -per-injection and rate -
per-patient -year will be calculated. A 95% confidence interval will also be provided for the rate.  
Effectiveness Analyses:  
Effectiveness outcome measures, such as the Investigator Global Assessment  Frown Wrinkle Severity (IGA -
FWS), Pat ient Frown Wrinkle Severity (PFWS), Investigator and Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement 
Scale (GAIS), are evaluated at maximum frown and at rest after maximum frown over time during the trial. Response  rates and duration of the response , defined based on  various definitions  (see Section 7.3 for 
details) , are calculated.  
Effectiveness data will be summarized as observed with no imputation for missing data. Descriptive statistics will be provided for all effectiveness variables at all timepoints for the su mmary group. 95% confidence 
intervals and/or p -values for comparing the difference between subgroups of interest (e.g., females vs. males, 
first treatment vs. second treatment, etc.) will be provided as appropriate. Kaplan -Meier curves will be 
plotted for the time -to-event endpoints.  
When comparisons (e.g., females vs. males, first treatment vs. second treatment, etc.) are performed, the tests 
will be done at a significant level of 0.05 with no adjustment for multiplicity.  
Sample Size Justification:  
This i s a safety trial with all subjects treated with the same investigational product. The sample size of 
approximately 2,100 is considered to be adequate in assessing safety based on several approaches.

Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 17 of 84 3 TRIAL  DESIGN  
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL D ESIGN  
3.1.1 STRUCTURE  
This is a phase 3, open label, multi- center trial to assess the safety of sing le and repeat 
administration of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection in subjects with moderate to severe 
glabellar lines.   
Approximately 1500 adult subjects will be enrolled  for a single treatment; all consenting 
subjects who have completed participation in either Revance protocol SAKURA-1 or 
SAKURA-2 may be eligible to roll over for repeat treatments  in this trial (SAKURA -
OLS)  on the last visit of the previous trial as long as written informed consent is  obtained 
from all subjects before any trial- related procedures (including any screening procedures) 
are performed  and subjects meet eligibility criteria .  Subjects , will have the opportunity 
of receiving up to one or two repeat treatments in this trial. Of all subjects enrolled in SAKURA-1, SAKURA-2 and SAKURA- OLS, i t is anticipated that approximately 400-
500 total subjects will be treated for up to three treatments of DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection at select centers at the end of the trial ; subjects  from SAKURA- 1 or SAKURA-
2 will have received one treatm ent in the parent trial and up to two treatments in 
SAKURA-OLS, and subjects who did not participate in either SAKURA- 1 or SAKURA-
2 will have received between one and three treatments in the SAKURA -OLS . 
3.1.2 DURATION 
The duration of subject participation in thi s trial (SAKURA- OLS) will vary depending on 
the number of treatments and duration of follow-up. Subjects who completed participation in SAKURA -1 and SAKURA- 2 trials may be eligible for participation in 
the SAKURA- OLS trial during  their last visit as long a s written informed consent for the 
SAKURA- OLS trial is  obtained before any trial -related procedures (including any 
screening procedures) are performed  and subjects meet eligibility criteria. Final 
Evaluation visit procedures of the controlled trials from which they are rolling over, end of trial PT ,  will serve as the baseline for this trial.  A 
subject may be in SAKURA- OLS  trial for a maximum of 86 weeks, inclusive of a two 
week screening period. The number of trial visits will vary per subject depending upon response to DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection. A subject may not be re-enrolled in the 
SAKURA- OLS trial  after th e Final Evaluation Visit (or after early discontinuation).

Not applicable. All subjects will be treated with DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection . 
3.1.4 DOSAGE/DOSE REGIMEN 
All treatments will be intramuscular injections administered by a trained physician.   
Injections must be performed only by the principal investigator contracted at the center. 
 
 
  
3.1.5 VISIT S CHEDULE  
A screening visit will be conducted up to two weeks prior to the first treatment.  
Following the first treatment  at Day 0, subjects will have on- site post- treatment visits at 
Week 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12, then thereafter, monthly up  to Week 36 or until both Patient 
Frown Wrinkle Severity ( PFWS ) and Investigator Global Assessment Frown  Wrinkle 
Severity (IGA-FWS ) scores at maximum frown return to baseline (or until the second 
treatment  for the subjects who will receive multiple treatments) .  Following the second 
treatment (if received), subjects will have on- site post -treatment visits at Week 1, 2, 4, 8 
and 12, then thereafter monthly up to Week 36 or until the third treatment.  Following the 
third treatment (if received), subjects will have on-site post- treatment visits at Week 1, 2, 
4, 8 and 12. Subjects who receive multiple  treatments will have a Final Evaluation Visit 
twelve  weeks after the final treatment.   
Starting  at the Week 12 visit following the first (or the second) treatment , and evaluated 
thereafter monthly up to Week 36, subjects at selected centers may be retreated if retrea tment criteria (see Section 3.4.4) are met .  Subjects at the selected center s will 
receive up to a total of up to three treatments (up to two treatments for roll over subjects) 
during SAKURA -OLS .

procedures (including any screening procedures) are performed. The Investigator may 
discuss the trial and the possibility for entry with a potential subject without first obtaining consent. However, a subject wishing to participate must give written informed consent prior to any trial-related procedures being conducted, including those performed solely for the purpose of determining eligibility for trial participation, and including withdrawal from current medication (if required prior to trial entry). The Investigator has both the ethical and legal responsibility to ensure that each subject being considered for inclusion in this trial has been given a full explanation of the procedures and expectations 
for trial participation.  
The site -specific informed consent must be forwarded to Revance for approval prior to 
submission to an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
that is registered with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or applicable health authority. Each subject will sign the consent form that has been approved by the same IRB/IEC that was responsible for protocol approval. Each informed consent document must adhere to the ethical principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and will include the elements required by FDA regulations in 21 CFR Part 50, as well as the elements required by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline, and applicable federal and local regulatory requirements. The consent form must also include a statement that Revance, their designees, and auditing regulatory agencies will have direct access to the subject’s 
records and medical history for trial related purposes.

Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 24 of 84 4 TRIAL  PROCEDURES  
4.1 SUBJECT ENTRY PROCEDURES  
Subject informed consent must be obtained prior to conducting screening procedures. 
At the screening visit, procedures including vital signs, physical examination, collection 
of samp les for hematology, chemistry, prothrombin time (PT),  
urinalysis, urine pregnancy test (UPT) for WOCBP, collection of concomitant medication and medical history information, examination of the treatment area, PFWS, and IGA-FWS must be completed. Results from clinical laboratory tests must be obtained and reviewed by the Investigator. Any WOCBP having a positive pregnancy test pre-treatment will not be treated.  The corresponding Final Evaluation Visit assessments may 
be used to determine eligibility for subjects rolling -over from Protocol SAKURA-1 or 
SAKURA 2 . The  end of trial PT  collected during 
studies SAKURA-1 or SAKURA-2, will serve as the baseline assessment for subjects 
rolling -over from these  two studies.   
After the required screening procedures are completed and trial eligibility is confirmed  as 
defined by the eligibility criteria in Sections 3.4.2 and 3.4.3, the subject will be enrolled in the trial and the investigational product will be prepared by the dose preparer and 
administered  by the Investigator. 
4.1.1 PREGNANCY  
WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course of the trial, such 
as the oral contraceptive pill, injection, implant, patch, vaginal ring, intrauterine coil, intrauterine device, tubal ligation, barrier method used WITH  an additional form of 
contraception (e.g., sponge, spermicide or condom), abstinence, no heterosexual intercourse, or has a vasectomized partner. A female is considered to be of childbearing potential UNLESS she is post-menopausal (no menses for 12 consecutive months) or 
without a uterus and/or both ovaries. 
Before enrolling WOCBP in this clinical trial, Investigators must review guidelines about trial participation for WOCBP. The topics should generally include: 
• Informed consent document 
• Pregnancy prevention information  
• Risks to unborn child(ren) 
• Any drug interactions with hormonal contraceptives 
• Contraceptives in current use 

Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 25 of 84 • Guidelines for the follow-up of a reported pregnancy 
Prior to trial enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during participation in this clinical trial and the potential risk factors for an 
unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign the informed consent document stating 
that the above-mentioned risk factors and the consequences were discussed with her. 
During the trial, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact the Investigator immediately 
(within 24 hours) if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual cycle). The Investigator must immediately notify Revance or designated  Contra ct 
Research Organization  (CRO ) of any female subject who becomes pregnant any time 
during trial participation, record the information on the Pregnancy Notification Form, and send the form to the CRO. The trial center  will be asked to follow  up with the subject 
periodically during the pregnancy for ongoing health and safety information through term, as applicable. Subjects will remain on the trial until the end of the trial’s follow-up 
period. Pregnant subjects will not be eligible for retreatment.  
4.2 SCHEDULE OF VISITS AND PROCEDURE S 
It is recommended that trial visits be scheduled at approximately the same time of day throughout the trial. 
The IGA -FWS and Investigator GAIS should be performed by the same evaluator 
throughout the trial whenever possible. If it is not possible to use the same evaluator to 
follow the subject throughout the trial, two evaluators should examine the subject together and discuss findings for at least one prior visit. A schedule of trial assessments is 
provided in Appendix F . 
The progression of a subject through the trial will be dependent upon the duration of the 
effect (response).  
4.2.1 SCREENING  VISIT  
The Screening Visit may  take place within 14 days prior to  investigational product 
administration  at Day 0  (Treatment Visit). Subjects who completed participation in 
SAKURA-1 or SAKURA-2 may be eligible for participation in the SAKURA -OLS trial 
on the last visit of the previous t rial as long as w ritten informed consent is  obtained from 
all subjects before any trial -related procedures (including any screening procedures) are 
performed  and subjects meet eligibility criteria. Final Evaluation visit procedures of the 
previous trial, end of trial PT,  will serve as the 
baseline for this trial.

Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 34 of 84 discontinuation, (i.e., prior to the Final Evaluation) and whenever possible , the subject 
should be asked to return to the trial center to complete the assessments specified in the 
Final Evaluation Visit. Subjects who w ithdraw from the trial will not be replaced.  
If at any time during the trial , the Investigator determines that it is not in the best interest 
of the subject to continue, the subject will be discontinued from participation. The 
Investigator can discontinue a subject from trial participation at any time if medically necessary or  if the subject has failed to follow trial  procedures or to keep follow -up 
appointments. Appropriate documentation in the subject’s trial record and CRF regarding the reason for discontinuation must be completed. Prior to discontinuing a subject from trial participation, the Investigator will discuss his/her intentions with the Medical 
Monitor or designee. 
All subjects who fail to return to the trial center for the required follow -up vi sits will be 
contacted by phone to determine the reason(s) why the subject failed to return for the 
necessary visit or elected to discontinue from the trial. If a subject is unreachable by telephone after a minimum of two documented attempts (one attempt on two different days), a registered letter will be sent requesting that contact be made with the 
Investigator. 
Revance has the right to terminate or to stop the trial  at any time. Should this be 
necessary, both Revance and the Investigator will ensure that  proper trial discontinuation 
procedures are completed.

It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they 
become available. For each laboratory test result outside the reference range, the 
Investigator must ascertain if the abnormal lab result is a clinically significant result for that individual subject. Likewise, if laboratory tests are taken at follow -up visits, the 
Investigator must ascertain if this is an abnormal and clinically sig nificant change from 
pretreatment for that individual subject. The Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test. The Investigator must sign and date all written laboratory results ( e.g., urinalysis, hematology, 
chemistry, PT,  and pregnancy tests ) and note Not Clinically Significant (NCS) or 
Clinically Significant (CS) for each out of range laboratory value.  If a laboratory value is 
determined to be a clinically significant result for that subject , this may be considered an 
AE. Refer to  Section 6.1.1 for further information.

Effectiveness  assessments will include Investigator assessment of glabellar line severity 
and glabellar line improvement, subject assessment of glabellar line severity and 
improvement. Effectiveness  assessments will be conducted  with the  subject in a sitting 
position. In order to have consistent eye positioning during the assessment, the Investigator should ask the subject to focus on a fixed point in the examination room. The assessment should be conducted in a room with good overhead lighting or natural light 
from a w indow (but not direct sunlight). 
4.6.1 PATIENT F ROWN WRINKLE SEVERITY (PF WS) 
At each clinic visit as designated in the Schedule of Trial  Assessments ( Appendix F ), the 
subje ct will assess the visual appearance (at maximum frown  and at rest after maximum 
frown ) of the glabellar lines using the following 4 point scale for subject’s assessment of 
Patient  Frown  Wrinkle Severity ( Appendix B , Table  8). The assessment form will be 
provided directly to the subject to complete while reviewing th e glabellar treatment area 
using the supplied handheld mirror as outlined in Appendix B . Subjects with contact 
lenses should view their glabellar lines with contacts. Subjects wearing glasses should be 
advised to view their glabellar lines without glasses if possible. If glasses are needed for the subject to see their  glabellar  lines , then glasses can be worn for the assessment. The 
subject assessment must be completed before the Investigator completes the IGA -FWS 
assessment.

Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 49 of 84 6 EVALUATION OF ADVERS E EVENTS  
6.1 DEFINITIONS  
For this protocol, an adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g., sign, 
symptom, disease, syndrome, intercurrent illness, clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, injury or accident) that emerges or worsens following administration of investigational product and until the end of trial participation that may not necessarily have a causal relationship to the administration of the investigational product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory result), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an  
investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product. 
A treatment -emergent AE is one that occurs after any period of exposure to treatment.  
Pre-exist ing conditions,  which increase in frequency or severity or a change in nature as a 
consequence of an investigational product use will also be considered  an adverse event.  
An unexpected AE is an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consi stent 
with the applicable product information (e.g., Investigator’s Brochure for an unapproved 
investigational product or package insert/summary of product characteristics for an 
approved product). 
Any clinically significant change  in the trial safety eval uations, (e.g., vital signs, injection 
site evaluation,  
) post -treatment must be reported as an AE.  
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that results i n any of 
the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening, (i.e., the subject was, in the opinion of the Investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not apply to an AE 
that hypothetically might have caused death if it were  more severe)  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongs hospitalization (i.e., a prolonged 
hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay; hospitalizations for elective 
medical/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check -ups are not 
SAEs by this criterion)  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a 
subject ex posed to the molecule or investigational product before conception or 
during pregnancy) 

Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 50 of 84 • Does not meet any of the above serious criteria but based upon appropriate 
medical judgement may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above (i.e., is a significant or important medical event)  
6.1.1 CLINICAL LABORATORY CHANGES  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review the results of all laboratory tests as they 
become available. For each laboratory test result outside the reference range, the Investigator must ascertain if the abnormal lab result is a clinically significant result for that individual subject. This determination, however, does not necessarily need to be made the first time an abnormal value is observed; the Investigator may repeat the laboratory test or request additional tests to verify the results of the original laboratory test. If this laboratory value is determined to be a clinically significant result for that 
subject, this may b e considered an AE to be assessed  according to severity.  
The Investigator must sign and date all written laboratory reports (e.g., urinalysis, 
hematology, chemistry, PT, and pregnancy tests) and note Not Clinically Significant 
(NCS) or Clinically Significant (CS) for each out of range laboratory value. 
6.1.2 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT CAUSALITY AND SEVERITY  
Relationship of an AE to investigational product will be assessed as follows:  
• Definite:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between the onset  of 
the AE and the administration  of investigational product; when the event 
responds to withdrawal of investigational product and/or recurs with re -
administration of investigational product  
• Probable:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between t he onset of 
the AE and the administration  of investigational product; the AE is unlikely 
to be caused by the concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs or procedures  
• Possible:  There may or may not be a clinically plausible time sequence 
between the onset o f the AE and the administration  of investigational product 
and a cause cannot be ruled out  
• Unrelated:  There is not a temporal or causal relationship to investigational 
product administration 
The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs and determ ining the severity of the 
event. Severity will be categorized as mild, moderate or severe according  to the following 
definitions:  
• Mild : Event may be noticeable to subject; does not influence daily activities; 
usually does not require intervention 
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 84 • Moderate : Event may be of sufficient severity to make subject uncomfortable; 
performance of daily activities may be influenced; intervention may be needed  
• Severe: Event may cause severe discomfort; usually interferes with daily activities; subject may not be able to continue in the trial; treatment or other 
intervention usually needed  
6.2 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
The Investigator will assess subjects post -treatment and at each subsequent trial visit for 
the occurrence of AEs. In order to avoid bias in eliciting AEs, subjects should be asked 
the following non leading question: “How have you felt since your last visit?” All AEs (serious and non- serious) reported by the subject must be recorded on the source 
documents and CRFs.  
In addition, an Investigator must report an SAE to Revance within 24 hours of their awareness of the event according to the procedure outlined below. All fatal or life -
threatening SAEs should be telephoned to Revance or the authorized representative as 
soon as the investigator learns of the event . 
6.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE  EVENT S 
An Investigator must report an SAE to Revance or the designated CRO’s authorized representative within 24 hours of their awareness of the event:  
 Complete and return an SAE Form with all information known to date; including 
the investi gator’s assessment of causality  
 If the event is fatal or life -threatening, telephone Revance or the authorized 
representative as soon as the i nvestigator learns of the event  
 Obtain and maintain all pertinent medical records (discharge summary, autopsy report, etc.) and medical judgments of medical personnel who assisted in subject’s treatment and follow -up 
 Provide follow -up information to Revance or the authorized representative  
Regulatory authorities, IRBs/IEC, and Investigators will be notified of SAEs in 
accordance with applicable regulations and requirements (e.g., GCPs, ICH Guidelines, 
national regulations and local requirements).  
6.4 PROCEDURE FOR A CCESSING  THE  RANDOMIZATION C ODE  
Not Applicable: open label trial. 
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 84 6.5 FOLLOW -UP OF A DVERSE E VENTS  
6.5.1 FOLLOW -UP OF NON -SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
Non-serious AEs that are identified during the last scheduled trial visit (or early 
discontinuation, if applicable) must be recorded on the AE CRF as ongoing.  
Any clinically significant abnormal test results, ( e.g., laborat ory findings ), at the final 
assessment should be followed to resolution or until determined by the Investigator to be 
stabilized. Repeat tests may be indicated to establish this.  
If a subject has any clinically significant, trial related abnormalities at t he end of the trial, 
the Medical Monitor should be notified and every effort made by the Investigator to 
arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course of the 
abnormalities.  
6.5.2 FOLLOW -UP OF POST TRIAL  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS 
SAEs  that are identified on the last scheduled contact (or early discontinuation, if 
applicable) must be recorded on the AE CRF page and reported to the  CRO and Revance 
according to the reporting procedures outlined in Section 6.3. This may include unresolved previously reported SAEs, or new SAEs. The Investigator should follow these SAEs until the events are resolved, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The Investigator 
should continue to report any significant follow -up information to the  Medical Monitor, 
Revance and the IRB/IEC up to the point the event has been resolved. Resolution means the subject has returned to the baseline state of health, or the Investigator does not expect 
any further improvement or worsening of the subject’s condition.  
Any new SAEs reported by the subject to the Investigator that occur after the last 
scheduled contact and are determined by the Investigator to be reasonably associated with the administration of investigational product should be reported to Revance and the 
IRB/IEC .

Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 53 of 84 7 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
7.1 GENERAL C ONSIDERATIONS  
The analysis of data from the trial will be performed when all subjects have completed 
the trial or discontinued prematurely, and all data are in the database and have been cleaned and verified. All statistical programming will be performed using statistical 
analysis system (SAS) version 9.4 or higher.   
The trial has up to three treatments. Dependin g on the analysis purpose, the 
corresponding summary period will be defined for each treatment. For the trial -overall 
summary, all available data observed during the trial will be included. For analyses 
associated with a specific treatment, the summary will include all data observed since the treatment until the next treatment, or until the last visit of the trial when there is no subsequent treatment. To account for varying subject follow -up duration, the total follow -
up duration (i.e., patient -years) will  be calculated for each summary period.  
For the trial- overall summary, the baseline will be the last available value prior to the first 
treatment. For summaries associated with a specific treatment, the baseline will be the 
last available value prior to tr eatment (i.e., re- baselined). 
7.2 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The Safety -Evaluable population will include all subjects who a re exposed to the 
investigational product and who provide any post -treatment safety information.  
Analyses specifically associated with each of  the three treatment  periods will be 
performed on a subset of the safety -evaluable population, including only those subjects 
who receive trial treatment and have post -treatment safety information for the specific 
treatment.  These safety -evaluable sub -populations will be respectively identified as 
Treatment -1-Evaluable, Treatment -2-Evaluable, or Treatment -3-Evaluable. 
In addition to s ubjects who are directly enroll ed, the trial also include s subjects rolling 
over from two pivotal phase 3 studies, SAKURA- 1 and SAKURA- 2.  For the roll  over 
subjects who are in the active treatment group in the prior trial, the first 
daxibotulinumtoxinA treatment in this open -label safety trial will in fact be their second 
daxibotulinumtoxinA treatment.   Based on the subject’s prior exposure to 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA, the following two summary groups will be defined for the 
analysis:  
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 84 • Group A : all subjects who have received DaxibotulinumtoxinA for injection in 
SAKURA- 1 or SAKURA- 2 
• Group B : all subjects in the  trial who are not in Group A   
7.3 TRIAL ENDPOINTS  
Safety Endpoints:  
• Incidence, severity and relationship to trial drug of treatment -emergent adverse 
events during each treatment and the trial overall  
• Incidence, severity and relationship to trial drug of treat ment -emergent serious 
adverse events during each treatment and the trial  overall  
Effectiveness Endpoints:  
Unless specified otherwise, all endpoints associated with IGA -FWS, PFWS or GAIS 
henceforth will be based on assessments at maximum frown.  When applic able, similar 
endpoints based on assessments at rest after maximum frown will also be summarized.  
For the endpoints that are derived from a comparison with the baseline, two derivation 
rules using different reference timepoints as the baseline (i.e., trial baseline or treatment 
baseline) will be applied separately.  
• Time to retreatment since the first trial treatment (on Treatment -1-Evaluable only)  
• Time to retreatment since the second trial  treatment (on Treatment -2-Evaluable 
only)  
• Time to return to, or wors e than, baseline on both IGA -FWS and PFWS 
• Time to return to 2 or 3 (moderate or severe) on both IGA -FWS and PFWS  
• Proportion of subjects with a ≥2 point improvement from baseline on both IGA -
FWS and PFWS at each visit over time  
• Proportion of subjects with a  score of 0 or 1 (none or mild) on IGA -FWS at each 
visit over time   
• Proportion of subjects with a score of 0 or 1 (none or mild) on PFWS at each visit 
over time   
• Proportion of subjects with a ≥1 point improvement from baseline on both IGA -
FWS and PFWS at e ach visit over time  
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 55 of 84 • Proportion of subjects with a ≥1 point improvement (i.e., improved, much 
improved, or very much improved) on GAIS at each visit over time (with 
investigator’s assessment and subject’s self -assessment summarized separately)  
• Proportion of  subjects with a ≥2 point improvement (i.e., much improved, or very 
much improved) on GAIS at each visit over time (with investigator’s assessment and subject’s self -assessment summarized separately)   
• Proportion of subjects with a ≥3 point improvement (i.e., very much improved) on 
GAIS at each visit over time (with investigator’s assessment and subject’s self -
assessment summarized separately)  
• Mean GAIS score at each visit over time (with investigator’s assessment and 
subject’s self -assessment summarized  separately)  
7.4 SAFETY  ANALYSES  
Safety data collected for the overall trial period will be summarized for  the Safety -
Evaluable  population. Summaries associated with each of the three treatment periods will 
be performed on the corresponding sub- population (i.e., Treatment -1-Evaluable, 
Treatment -2-Evaluable or Treatment -3-Evaluable).  To account for varying subject 
follow -up duration, the total follow -up duration (i.e., patient -years) will be calculated for 
each summary period.  
Descriptive statistics will be  presented to summarize the safety data.  
7.4.1 ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs will be recorded and classified on the basis of MedDRA terminology. 
Treatment -emergent AEs are those AEs with an onset on or after the date and time of trial 
treatment. All treatment- emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class, 
preferred term, severity, relationship, and seriousness. When summarizing events by causality and severity, each subject will be counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term by using the event with the greatest relationship and highest severity 
within each classification.  
All information pertaining to AEs noted during the trial will be listed by subject, detailing 
the verbatim description given by the Investigator, preferred term, system organ class, start date, stop date, severity, action taken regarding trial drug, corrective treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset relative (in number of days) to the date of first trial treatment administration , as well as to the date of l ast trial treatment 
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 56 of 84 administration prior to the event, will be provided. In addition, a list of adverse events 
that lead to the subject’s premature discontinuation of the trial will also be provided. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be listed by subject.  SAEs will be summarized by 
severity and relationship to trial treatment.  Each subject will be counted only once within 
a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest relationship and 
greatest severity.  
The summaries of AEs and SAEs will be performed for the trial overall, and for each of 
the three treatment  period s.  For SAEs and key AEs  
, rate -per-injection and rate- per-patient -year will be 
calculated.  A 95% confidence interval will also be provided for the rate. 
7.4.2 LABORATORY TESTS  
Laboratory test results will be summarized with descriptive statistics by  visit. Change 
from Screening to Final Evaluation Visit will be summarized for continuous test results.  
Shift tables will be presented to summarize laboratory test results at Screening and Final 
Evaluation Visit. Normal ranges established by the central laboratory will be used to determine shifts. A listing of all out-of- range laboratory test results at any evaluation will 
also be provided. Determination of clinical significance for all out-of- range laboratory 
values will be mad e by each investigator and included in the listing. In addition, a listing 
of all clinically significant laboratory test results will be provided.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
UPTs will  be summarized for all treated subjects in the category of WOCBP and 
presented in the data listings.  
7.4.3 VITAL SIGNS  AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION  
Vital signs and abnormal findings from the physical examination will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics by visi t.

Outcomes of the injection site evaluations will be tabulated by visit for each treatment . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.4.7 CONCOMITANT THERAPIES/MEDICATIONS  
Concomitant therapies/medications used at Screening and during the trial  will be coded 
using the World Health Organization (WHO) drug dictionary and summarized by 
treatment group, Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) second level term, and 
preferred name for the Safety -Evaluable population. 
 
 
 
  
7.4.9 EFFECTIVENESS ANALYS IS 
Effectiveness data will be summarized as observed with no imputation for missing data.  
Descriptive statistics will be provided for all effectiveness variables at all timepoints by the summary group.  95% confidence intervals and/or p-values for comparing the difference between subgroups of interest (e.g., females vs males) will be provided as appropriate.  Kaplan- Meier curves will be plotted for the time -to-event endpoints defined 
in Section  7.3.   
When comparisons (e.g., females vs males, Treatment  1 vs Treatment  2, etc.) are 
performed, the tests will be done at a significant level of 0.05 with no adjustment for 
multiplicity.  
7.4.10 SAMPLE S IZE AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a safety trial with all subjects treated with the same investigational product.  The 
sample size of approximately 2, 100 is considered to be adequate in assessing the safety 
based on several approaches.

9.1 DATA COLLECTION  
For this trial, all protocol -specified data will be recorded in the source documents, and 
data will be entered on the CRF s from the source documents. In addition to signature 
confirmation that a subject meets the trial eligibility criteria, upon each subject’s 
completion of the trial, the Investigator will sign a statement indicating that all pages of the subject’s case repo rt have been reviewed. Signature stamps and “per signatures” are 
not acceptable.  
It is Revance’s policy that the trial data be verifiable with the source data that necessitates access to all original recordings, laboratory reports, and other records for e ach subject. 
The Investigator must therefore agree to allow access to subjects’ records, and source data must be made available for all trial data. Subjects (or their legal representatives) must also allow access to their medical records. Subjects will be informed of the importance of increased record access and permission granted by signature on the 
informed consent document prior to Screening.  
Checks will be performed to ensure the quality, consistency, and completeness of the 
data. Instances of missing or un -interpretable data will be resolved with the Investigator 
or Trial  Coordinator. Data queries will be sent to the trial center . Trial  center  personnel 
will be responsible for providing resolutions to the data queries and for correcting the CRFs, as app ropriate. All unused Revance source documents and binders must be 
returned to Revance upon completion of the trial. 
The Investigator must keep written or electronic source documents for every subject 
participating in the clinical trial. The subject file that identifies the trial in which the subject is participating must include the subject’s available demographic and medical 
information including:  
• Name  
• Contact information  
• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Medical history  
• Concomitant diseases  
• Concomitant therapies/medication  
• Trial  visit dates  
• Performed examinations, evaluations, and clinical findings  
Protocol 1620303  
Version: Amendment 1, 20 March 2017  
 
Revance Therapeutics  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 62 of 84 • Investigational product administration  
• AEs, SAEs, or pregnancy (as applicable)  
Additionally, any other documents with source data, especially orig inal printouts of data 
that were generated by technical equipment must be included in the subject’s source 
document (e.g., laboratory value listings). All these documents must have at least the 
subject’s initials, trial number, and the date of the evaluati on.  
The data recorded during the course of the trial will be documented in the CRF and/or the 
trial- specific forms. Before or at trial termination, all data must be forwarded to Revance. 
The data will then be recorded, evaluated, and stored in anonymous f orm in accordance 
with data -protection regulations. 
Subjects will authorize the use of their protected health information during the informed consent process in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements. Subjects who deny permission to use and di sclose protected health information will not be eligible to 
participate in the trial. The Investigator will ensure that the trial documents forwarded to 
Revance, and any other documents, contain no mention of subject names.  
Any amendments and corrections n ecessary will be undertaken in both the source 
documents and CRFs (as appropriate) and countersigned by the Investigator, or

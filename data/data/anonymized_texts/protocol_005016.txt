Investigators will asse ss and document the occurrence of HAE attacks 
based on data reported by subjects in an eDiary. Safety and 
pharmacokinetic (P K) /  parameters, and use 
of on-demand HAE medication will also be assessed.  
The first 32 subjects with C1 -INH HAE who are eligible to 
participate in Treatment Period 1 will be randomly assigned to receive 
treatment with investigationa l product in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
( mg CSL312 administered every 4 weeks [q4wk] subcutaneously 
[SC];  mg CSL312 q4wk SC;  mg CSL312 q4wk SC; placebo 
q4wk SC) during Treatment Period 1. Treatment in each of these arms 
will begin with an intravenous (IV) loading dose of CSL312 or 
placebo. For these C1 -INH HAE subjects, Treatment Period 1 will be 
conducted in a blinded manner.  
After the first 32 subjects with C1 -INH HAE are randomly assigned 
to treatment, up to an additional 8 subjects will be assigned to receive 
 mg CSL312 administered every 2 weeks (q2wk) SC.  
. For 
these C1-INH HAE subjects, Treatment Period 1 will be conducted in 
an open-label manner.  
Up to 10 eligible subjects with FXII/PLG HAE will be assigned to 
receive  mg CSL312 q4wk SC. Treatment in this arm will begin 
with an IV loading dose of CSL312. For these FXII/PLG HAE 
subjects, Treatment Period 1 will be conducted in an open -label 
manner.  
Treatment Period 2  
C1-INH HAE s ubjects who continue to participate in Treatmen t 
Period 2 will be receiving  CSL312  mg or  mg q4wk SC  at the 
beginning of T reatment Period 2 . Effective with Amendment 2, a ll 
C1-INH HAE subjects receiving the  mg dose will have their do se 
reduced to  mg q4wk SC at their next scheduled study visit.

Overall, up to 50 subje cts will be assigned to treatment in Treatment 
Period 1. 
•Seven subjects assigned to placebo, and  mg and  mg 
CSL312 q4wk are needed to reach power of ~82% for the 
comparisons of  mg CSL312 q4wk versus placebo q4wk and 
 mg CSL312 q4wk versus pla cebo q4wk in Treatment Period  1. 
An additional subject will be added to each of these treatment arms 
to account for drop outs during Treatment Peri od 1, resulting in 
8 subjects in each of these treatment arms (ie, 24 subjects total).  
•Seven subjects will b e assigned to receive  mg CSL312 q4wk. 
The sample size for this arm is not driven by an efficacy 
comparison, but instead, by consistency with oth er treatment arms 
and for maintenance of blinding of the study. No testing for 
efficacy of  mg CSL312 again st placebo will be performed and 
no power calculation has been done. An additional subject will be 
added to the treatment arm to account for drop o uts during 
Treatment Period 1, resulting in 8 subjects in the treatment arm.  
•Up to 7 subjects with C1 -INH HAE  will be assigned to receive
 mg CSL312 q2wk. This arm is included for informational 
purposes, and therefore no testing against placebo is plann ed and 
no power calculation has been done. An additional subject may be 
added to the treatment arm to account  for drop outs during 
Treatment Period 1, resulting in up to 8 subjects in the treatment 
arm. 
•Up to 10 subjects with FXII/PLG HAE will take part in  the study.
Data Analysis
The data from Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 will be 
analyzed separately. In addition, Treatment Period 1 and Treatment

Confidential  Subjects with C1 -INH HAE who are treated with placebo or  mg, 
 mg, or  mg CSL312 q4wk will be analyzed separately from 
subjects with C1 -INH HAE who are treated with  mg CSL 312 
q2wk. Subjects with FX II/PLG HAE will be analyzed separately from 
subjects with C1 -INH HAE.  
Continuous variables will be described by using mean values with 
their respective 95% confidence intervals; standard deviation; range; 
25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles; and coun ts of missing and 
non-missing values. The geometric coefficient of variation will be 
expressed as a percentage for PK and  data. The geometric mean 
and its respective 90% confidence interval will be calculated for PK 
and  data . Categorical values will be described using counts and 
percentages.  
All data will be displayed in by -subject listings. The listings will be 
sorted by treatment, study site, subject, time point, and item number 
(if applicable).  
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
For subjects with C1 -INH HAE who were treated with placebo, or 
 mg,  mg, or  mg CSL312 q4wk during Treatment Period 1: 
To test for a difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between  
mg CSL312 q4wk or   mg CSL312 q4wk and placebo, pairwise 
comparisons will be perform ed by testing the hypotheses using a two -
sided Mann -Whitney Test. To account for multiple testing, the alpha 
level of 5% will be evenly split between the hypotheses tested. 
Therefore, the  mg CSL312 q4wk or   mg CSL312 q4wk 
CSL312 doses (in subjects w ith C1-INH HAE) will each be evaluated 
against placebo at alpha = 0.025 for each test. The time -normalized 
number of HAE attacks will be summarized descriptively by 
treatment. There will be no testing of the  mg CSL312 q4wk dose  
against placebo. The time -normalized number of HAE attacks will be 
presented descriptively (only).  
For all other subjects: There will be no testing of the of  mg 
CSL312 q2wk dose against placebo for subjects with C1 -INH HAE 
or the  mg CSL312 q4wk do se against placebo for sub jects with 
FXII/PLG HAE.

a Subjects must part icipate in the Run -in Period for at least 4 wee ks (see Section 8.5.1.2.2). Subjects may stop participation in the Run -in Period and begin 
Treatment Period 1 when they have met the criteria speci fied in Section 4.1.3, including:  
•For subjects with C1-INH HAE , subjects must have experienced ≥ 2 HAE attacks within a consecutive 4 -week period d uring the Run -in Period.
•For subjects with FXII/PLG HAE , subjects must have experienced ≥ 1 HAE attacks during the Run -in Period.
b Subjects should enter Treatment Period 1 no later than 14 days after the Week 9 (Day 57) Telephone Contact. If a subject is unable to enter Treatment Period 1 
within the 14  days after the Week 9 (Day 57) Telephone Contact, then CSL approval is required for the subject to enter into Treatment Pe riod 1. The Week 9 
(Day 57) Telephone Contact will conclude the Run -in Period for a s ubject who has entered the Run -in Period and is subsequently not eligible to be assigned to 
treatment with investigational product in Treatment Period 1.  
c Screening may occur on the same day as the first day of the Run -in Period.  
d Written informed cons ent must be provided before any study -specific assessments or procedures are performed.  
e A physical examination will be conducted per the investigator’s standard procedur e, and will also include assessment of unilateral pain and / or swelling of the 
lower extremities for the purpose of screening for deep vein thrombosis.  
g The test for beta -human chorionic gonadotropin will be performed for women of childbearing potential (only). A serum or urine pregnancy test ma y be used. A 
serum pregnancy test will be  performed  by the site if urine result is inconclusive.  
h Confirmation of the FXII or PLG gene mutation will be based on the subject’s medical record.  
i An individual acute action plan is developed by the investigator to e nsure that participating subjects are capable of managing their HAE attacks during the 
study. The action plan will be reviewed with subjects.  
j Subjects may use the on -demand medication of their choice to treat HAE attacks experienced during the study if t hat medication has previously been shown to 
be effective (see Section 7.2).

Confidential  1 Introduction  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1 Factor XII  
Factor XII (Hageman factor, FXII) is produced in the liver and is secreted into the plasma; 
the glycosylated 80  kilodalton (kDa) zymogen circulates with a concentration of ~30 µg / mL 
and a half -life of 50 to 70 hours [ Björkqvist et al, 2014 ].  
Factor XII is the principal initiator of the plasma contact system [ Renné et al, 2012 ]. The 
contact system i s a protease cascade involving the proteins FXII, factor XI (FXI), plasma 
prekallikrein, and the nonenzymatic cofactor  ( ). 
Upon contact with a negatively -charged surface FXII is converted to activated FXII ( FXIIa). 
Several biologic substances have been shown to support FXII activation in vivo, including 
heparin released from mast cells, misfolded protein aggregates, ribonucleic acid, and platelet 
polyphosphates [ Kenne et al, 2015 ]. FXIIa triggers fibrin forma tion through activation of 
FXI, and also leads to the production of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin (BK) through 
the kallikrein -kinin pathway. Further cleavage of FXIIa releases the 30 kDa light chain 
containing the catalytic domain (βFXIIa), which ca n activate th e classical complement 
pathway. Thus, activated forms of FXII have proinflammatory and procoagulant activities.  
1.1.2 Factor XII and the Kallikrein -kinin Pathway  
Activation of FXII (to FXIIa) also leads to the production of BK through the kallikrein -kinin 
pathway. In this pathway prekallikrein is converted to kallikrein by FXIIa. Kallikrein plays a 
number of roles. First, it activates FXII zymogens by a positive feedback mechanism to 
amplify the cascade. Second, kallikrein cleaves  to release the  potent infla mmatory 
mediator BK. The binding of BK to BK type 2 (B2) receptors activates various intracellular 
signaling pathways that dilate vessels, induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, and increase 
vascular permeability and fluid efflux [ Björkqvist  et al, 2013 ]. Bradykinin production is 
increased during acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks and is the mediator of swelling 
in HAE [Nussberger et al, 1998 ; Nussberger et al, 1999 ].  
1.1.3 Hereditary Angioedema  
Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disor der classified into 3 disease types [ Rosen et al, 
1965; Bork et al, 2000 ], including HAE type 1, HAE type 2, and HAE with normal 
C1-esterase inhibitor (nC1 -INH).

Confidential  HAE type 1 and type 2 are caused by mutations of the SERPING1 gene, and are 
characterized by a  quantitative decrea se in C1-esterase inhibitor (C1 -INH) plasma 
concentrations (type 1) and dysfunctional C1 -INH present in normal plasma concentrations 
(type 2) [Zuraw, 2010 ; Cicardi, 2014 ]. Together, HAE type 1 and type 2 are grouped as HAE 
with C1-INH deficiency (C1 -INH HAE). 
A large number of different SERPING1 mutations have been associated with HAE type 1, 
including missense, nonsense, frameshift, deletion, and insertion mutations [ Kalmar et al, 
2005]. In general, HAE type 1 is caused by mutations in the C1-INH gene that  results in 
either truncated or misfolded proteins that cannot be secreted [ Verpy et al, 1995 ]. In HAE 
type 1, an impaired synthesis of normal and functionally active C1 -INH occurs, causing a 
reduction in the availability of functionall y active C1 -INH levels to as low as between 5% 
and 30% of normal [ Rosen et al, 1965 ]. Approximately 85% of subjects with C1 -INH HAE 
have HAE type 1 [ Longhurst and Bork, 2006 ].  
Most SERPING1 m utations associated with HAE type 2 involve residues at or near the active 
site on the reactive mobile loop of the C1 -INH protein that result in a protein that is secreted 
but is dysfunctional [ Wagenaar -Bos et al, 2006 ]. In HAE type 2, normal levels of a 
functionally impaired  C1-INH molecule are synthesized, but the normal form of C1 -INH is 
considerably reduced in the circulation [ Rosen et al, 1965 ]. Approximately 15% of subjects 
with C1-INH HAE have HAE type 2 [ Longhurst and Bork, 2006 ].  
C1-esterase inhibitor is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates the generation of BK by the 
plasma contact system, and is the major inhibitor of a number of plasma contact system 
proteases including FXII a nd kallikrein [ Davis et al, 2010 ]. Excessive BK formation due to 
pathological activation of the factor XII (FXII) -driven plasma contact system is a consistent 
finding in acute episodes of HAE [ Björkqvist, 2013 ].  
HAE with normal C1 -INH (nC1 -INH) is an inhe rited disorder not a ssociated with C1 -INH 
deficiency but  missense mutations, deletions or insertions of base pairs of the FXII gene 
[Cicardi et al, 2014], a missense mutation of the plasminogen gene [ Bork et al, 2018 ], 
[Dewald, 2018 ], or caused by an unknown genetic defect [ Cicardi, 2014 ]. A defective mucin -
type Thr309 -linked glycosylation may lead to increased contact-mediated autoactivation of 
zymogen FXII, resulting in excessive activation of the BK -forming kallikrein -kinin pathway 
[Björkqvist, 2015 ]. A Lys311Glu substitution is a disease -causing plasminogen mutation 
which may cause an irregular cleavage by ac tivated factor XII and kallikrein, the  serine

Confidential  proteases of the kinin -forming cascade [ Dewald, 2018 ]. For other forms of HAE with nC1 -
INH, the underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood [ Bork et al, 2000 ].  
Clinically, HAE attacks occurring in patients with C1 -INH HAE and HAE with nC1 -INH are 
characterized by local swelling of the skin (ie, edema of the extremities, facial edema, and 
edema of the genitals), abdominal pain, and, occasionally, life -threatening attacks of 
laryngeal edema [ Bork, 2008]. The estimated prevalence of C1 -INH HAE is commonly 
reported as 1:50,000, while the prevalence of nC1 -INH HAE is unknown [ Cicardi et al, 
2010b; Nasr et al, 2016 ]. 
1.1.4 Treatment of Hereditary Angioedema  
Current treatm ent options for HAE can be subdivided into the acute treatment of attacks and 
prophylaxis. The treatment of choice in the event of an acute HAE attack is the rapid 
intravenous (IV) administration of C1 -INH concentrate [ Bork 2008 ; Gompels et al, 2005 ; 
Longhurst 2005 ]. Recently, compounds includ ing a kallikrein inhibitor and a BK receptor 
antagonist have been added to the spectrum of medications available to treat acute HAE 
attacks [Cicardi et al, 2010a; Cicardi et al, 2010b ].  
Despite a number of treatment o ptions for acute HAE attacks, the prop hylactic treatment of 
HAE remains an area of unmet medical need. Limitations of current prophylactic therapies 
are an unfavorable side effect profile (androgens), a lack of effect (antifibrinolytics), or the 
frequency of administration (IV or subcutaneous [SC] C1-INH). Although emerging therapies 
are providing improved prophylactic clinical outcomes, there is a need for further modalities 
in the prophylactic management of HAE, especially those targeting novel pharmacolo gical 
pathways.  
Acute and prophylactic  treatments for HAE are based on blocking BK production through 
targeting different proteins in the kallikrein -kinin pathway. Plasma levels of FXIIa have been 
shown to increase in patients during acute HAE attacks comp ared to during remission 
[Csuka et al, 2015; Cugno et al, 1996 ]. Given the importance of FXIIa in the initiation of the 
plasma contact system it is a novel target for the inhibition of the kallikrein -kinin pathway 
and the excessive production of BK detecte d during HAE attacks.

Confidential  1.2 Background Infor mation on CSL312  
1.2.1 Overview  
CSL312 (factor XIIa antagonist monoclonal antibody) is a fully human IgG4 / lambda 
recombinant monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the catalytic domain of FXIIa 
and potently inhibi ts its catalytic activity. CSL312 is a n affinity-matured variant of the 
parental antibody 3F7, which was isolated following screening against the active catalytic 
fragment of FXII (βFXIIa). CSL312 is produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells that have 
been characterized according to applicable i nternational guidelines.  
1.2.2 Nonclinical Evaluation  
The non-clinical program conducted to support development of CSL312 included 
pharmacological, pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicological studies performed in 
pharmacological ly relevant species that are described  in the CSL312 investigator ’s brochure.  
1.2.3 Clinical Experience  
1.2.3.1  Healthy Subjects  
Previous clinical experience with CSL312 is limited to a single, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo-controlled, single ascending dose, phase 1 study. During this study, the safety and 
tolerability, and PK of escalating doses of CSL312 were assessed after single IV or SC 
injections of up to 10 mg / kg in healthy male subjects. CSL312 had an acceptable safety and 
tolerability profile. Durin g the study there were no serious adverse eve nts (SAEs); no 
withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs); no thromboembolic events (TEEs), bleeding 
events, or cases of anaphylaxis; no clinically significant abnormal trends in hematology or 
clinical chemistry as sessments. The majority of all AEs were of mi ld intensity. Injection site 
reactions (ISRs) were more common with SC CSL312 than SC placebo, but there was no 
apparent dose dependence. Additionally, CSL312 exhibited linear PK behavior with a half -
life ~19 da ys. The study results are described in greate r detail in the CSL312 investigator ’s 
brochure.  
1.2.3.2  Subjects with Hereditary Angioedema  
No clinical studies with CSL312 have been conducted in subjects with HAE.

Confidential  1.3 Study Overview  
This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -arm, phase 2 study to 
investigate the clinical efficacy, PK, and safety of CSL312 as prophylaxis to prevent HAE 
attacks in subjects with C1 -INH HAE or FXII/PLG HAE. Section 3.1 presents a detailed 
overview of the study.  
1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits 
CSL312 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits factor XIIa activity. CSL312 is 
being developed for ro utine prophylaxis to prevent angioedema attacks in patients with 
C1-INH HAE or FXII/PLG HAE. In the current study, CSL312 wi ll be administered to 
subjects experiencing recurrent HAE attacks for the first time.  
CSL312 is currently only administered in the clinical trial setting in accordance with the 
study protocol. The maximum dose and the predicted corresponding maximum conce ntration 
(Cmax) in this study is lower than the highest administered dose and its corresponding C max 
observed in the phase 1 study C SL312_1001 (Study 1001). Each subject who participated in 
Study 1001 received a single dose of CSL312 as a part of Study 100 1; however, each subject 
who participates in the current study will receive multiple doses of CSL312 to produce target 
trough levels  for up to 12 weeks or longer.  
Benefits 
A potential benefit of this study is the prevention of attacks in subjects with HAE type 1 and 
2 or normal C1 -INH with known mutation in the FXII or Plasminogen gene by inhibiting the 
attack-causing defective pathway s. CSL312 acts as an antagonist to FXIIa, affecting the 
regulation of BK formation via the kallikrein -kinin pathway. In Stud y 1001, a dose -
dependent inhibition of  was observed after single -dose IV 
or SC administration of CSL312 with near complete inhibition at the 3 and 10 mg / kg IV and 
SC Cohorts. Because FXIIa is an inherent part in the kal likrein-kinin cascade, its inhibition is 
expected to prevent the excessive BK generation, and with that, the occurrence of HAE 
attacks. This is supported by preclinical data in disease related models and the understanding 
that the major inhibitor of FXIIa is C1-INH. 
The lack of sufficient functional C1 -INH leads to recurring HAE attacks in HAE type 1 and 2 
patients, and the administrat ion of C1 -INH prevents HAE attacks almost completely. In 
contrast, patients with normal C1 -INH but mutations in the FXII or plasminogen gene are 
symptomatic despite the presence of sufficient C1 -INH protein. Mutated FXII may be

a dysregulation between the plasminogen / plasmin system an d the kinin pathway, both 
resulting in an over activated kallikrein -kinin pathway. There is currently no licensed 
treatment availabl e for HAE subjects with a known mutation in the FXII or Plasminogen 
gene.  
Risks 
The following risks were not observed in th e phase 1 Study 1001, but are potential risks 
based on the drug class and mechanism of action of CSL312:  
•Hypersensitivity / Anaphyla ctic-type Reactions:  Administration of therapeutic proteins
including monoclonal antibodies such as CSL312 is associated wit h the risk of
hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, some of which can be serious and life -
threatening. Appropriate precaution s will be taken when CSL312 is administered at the
study site, with vigilant monitoring for potential anaphylactic reactions . The initial
administrations of CSL312 will be performed under medical supervision with immediate
access to emergency equipment and  medication for treatment of adverse reactions.
Subjects who self -administer CSL312 outside of the study site will be inform ed of the
early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness
of the chest, wheezing, hypote nsion, and anaphylaxis. Patients should be advised to
discontinue use of CSL312 if hypersensitivity reactions occur and to s eek immediate
medical assistance.
•Thromboembolic Events and Bleeding:  By blocking FXIIa with CSL312, there may be
a potential risk of bleeding or TEEs due to altered haemostasis, unstable clot formation,
or impaired clot breakdown. Subjects will be monito red carefully for signs of thrombosis
or bleeding during the study. Also, because of the pharmacological action of CSL312, a
prolonged of  is expected to be observed in a
concentration -dependent manner. However, no effect on prothrombin time (PT) was seen
in the phase 1 Study 1001. This is consistent with the observation that patients who hav e
congenital deficiency of FXII do not exhibit a bleeding phenotype, despite having a

the development of anti -drug antibodies throughout the study.  
During Study 1001, CSL312 was administered as a single IV or SC dose up to 10 mg / kg to 
healthy male subjects, it was safe and well tolerated. No dose dependent trends were seen in 
treatment emer gent AE frequency or severity. No deaths, SAEs, or AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported. The majority of all treatment emerg ent AEs were mild. There 
were no TEEs, bleeding, or anaphylaxis events. No clinically relevant changes in laboratory 
parameters, vital signs, or electrocardiograms were observed. No anti -CSL312 antibodies 
were detected in any subject at baseline or at any time point during the study.  
Subjects randomized to placebo, and not participating in an optional open -label extension 
period, will have no benefits.  
Given the potential benefit of CSL312 for HAE patients, the acceptable safety data for 
CSL312 from Study 1 001, and the implementation of study procedures in the current study 
(Study 2001) that will closely monitor the safety of st udy subjects, the associated benefit -risk

3.3 Scientific Rationale  
3.3.1 Study Design Rationale  
The present phase 2 study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK profile of 
multiple subcutaneous administrations of CSL312 across a range of doses in subjects with 
C1-INH HAE or FXII/PLG HAE. The study consists of a Screening Period to assess subject 
eligibility, a Run -in Period to assess underlying disease activity, and 2 treatment pe riods to 
assess initial and long -term (respectively) safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The data from this 
study will be used to select dose(s) for a potential phase 3 study.  
3.3.2 Dose Rationale  
Dose selection was based on the safety, PK and  data obtained i n the phase 1 single 
ascending dose study (Study 1001) after administration of single IV and SC doses ranging 
from 0.1 to 10 mg / kg (7.75 to 1015 mg) in healthy volunteers. The key  endpoint used

Confidential  for dose selection was  It is hypothesized that inhibiting 
 consistently to a particular % target inhibition is expected 
to provide protection from HAE attacks. The exact % target 
 to prevent HAE at tacks is unknown and will be evaluated in this study in HAE 
patients. 
A PK /  model was developed to quantify the relationship between CSL312 plasma 
concentrations and  from the IV and SC cohorts in 
Study 1001. The model ed relationship showed an increase in inhibition of 
 with increasing concentrations of CSL312. The IC50 was estimated to be 
14.9 µg / mL.  
Based on the relationship between CSL312 plasma concentration and 
 the % target inhibition levels that were chosen included ≥ 30, ≥ 50, and 
≥ 90% (corresponding to doses that would result in inhibition below the IC50, at the 
inflection point and at the maximum effect of the curve), which would provide in formation 
along the entire spectrum of the curve allowing for a robust assessment of doses in this study. 
Simulations using the final PK /  model determined that fixed doses of  mg,  mg, 
and  mg administered every 4 weeks would result in at least  75% of th e patients reaching 
a % target inhibition of  of ≥ 30, ≥ 50, and ≥ 90%, 
respectively. 
The dosing interval of every 4 weeks was selected based on the calculated half -life of 
CSL312 of ~19 days in the phase 1 sing le ascendi ng dose study (Study 1001). The interval 
between the IV loading dose and the SC maintenance doses was chosen such that the CSL312 
plasma trough concentration after the IV loading dose would be within 20% of the trough 
concentration at steady -state after SC  doses given every 4 weeks. The IV route of 
administration was selected for the loading dose as CSL312 plasma concentrations higher 
than the trough concentrations observed at steady state after SC doses given every 4 weeks 
are expected to be achi eved insta ntaneously. The IV loading doses selected for this study are 
expected to result in exposures that are similar to the exposures after SC doses given the 
~50% bioavailability of CSL312 when administered SC based on the results from phase 1 
single ascending d ose study (Study 1001).  
A dose of  mg q2wk for subjects with C1 -INH HAE in the open -label arm of the study 
was selected to explore a dosing interval of 2 weeks. This dosing regimen was chosen to 
target a % inhibition of ≥ 90% of the

3.4 Planned Study Duration  
The duration of  the study for an individual subjec t who participates in Treatment Period 1 
and Treatment Period 2 is up to approximately 83 weeks if the duration of Treatment Period 2 
is not extended (see Section 8.5.4.14). 
This estimation is based on:  
•A Screening Period of up to 4 weeks.
•A Run-in Period of up to 8 weeks.
•A treatment period of ~13 weeks (Treatment Period 1).
•A treatment period of at least ~44 weeks (Treatment Period 2).
•A Follow -up Period of ~14 weeks.
The overall study duration (ie, first subje ct’s Screening Visit to last subject ’s final visit) is 
estimated to be 119 weeks, if Treatment Period 2 is not extended (see Section 8.5.4.14). 
Treatment Period 2 will extend until another CSL312 study is opened  for subjects to join, or 
until the current study is discontinued.

9 Adverse Events  
9.1 Definitions  
9.1.1 Adverse Event  
As per the ICH guidelines, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharm aceutical product and which does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be  any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (in vestigational) product.  
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time the subject gives informed consent 
until the end of st udy (see Section 9.4 for further details).  
 Adverse events may include:  
• Exacerbation (ie, an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre -existing condition. 
Illness present before study entry should be recor ded in the medical history section of the 
eCRF and only b e reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or severity of 
the condition during the study.  
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before investigational product administration . 
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administrati on of investigational product . 
Adverse events do not include:  
• Events identified at Screening that meet exclusion criteria.

Date: 20 March 2020   Template: CS-SOP-04-T02 Version 1.0  
Confidential  • Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is  the AE). 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence  has not taken place.  
• Planned hospitalizations due to pre -existing conditions, which have not worsened.  
• Hospitalizations that occur for procedures not due to an AE (eg, cosmetic surgery).  
• Hospitaliz ations for a diagnostic procedure where the hospital stay  is less than 24  hours in 
duration or for normal management procedures (eg, chemotherapy).  
• Overdose of investigational product or any concomitant therapy that does not result in 
any adverse signs or symptoms.  
9.1.2 Adverse Event of Special Interest  
There are se veral AEs that will be monitored as AEs of special interest to enable an adequate 
risk-benefit evaluation of CSL312.  
The following events will be considered AEs of special interest:  
• Disorders of coa gulation: 
o Thromboembolic events (TEEs).  
▪ Any systemic TEE is considered an SAE and should be reported as such. 
Additionally, any non -systemic TEE (eg, a TEE associated with vascular access) 
that meets the serious criteria must be reported as an SAE.  
▪ Any non-serious access -related thrombosis should be entered as an AE on the 
eCRF and will be part of the regular review of AEs of special interest by the 
IDMC. 
o Bleeding events.  
▪ All bleeding events that are abnormal in the opinion of the investigator are 
considered SAEs and should be reported as such. Addit ionally, any bleeding event 
not considered abnormal that meets the criteria for an SAE must be reported as an 
SAE. 
• Anaphylaxis.  
o All events of anaphylaxis are considered SAEs and should be reported as such.  
9.1.3 Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SA E) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any 
dose:

Protocol version:  Amendment  2 Final  Page 98 of 126 
Date: 20 March 2020   Template: CS-SOP-04-T02 Version 1.0  
Confidential  • Results in death  – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this serious 
criterion. 
• Is life-threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the subject 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.  
• Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existi ng hospitalization  – CSL 
considers “hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization” for at least 
24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospital admissions for planned surgery or 
for normal disease management p rocedures (eg, chemothera py) are not considered as 
defining criteria for SAEs.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect . 
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as a n event that does 
not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician to 
potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 
of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion.  
Adverse even ts that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs.  
9.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE (ie, non -serious and serious AEs) is to be assessed by the 
investigator as follows:  
Severity Definition  
Mild A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere 
with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeut ic 
intervention. The event int erferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the 
subject. 
Severe A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may req uire intensive therapeutic intervention.

Confidential  9.3 Causality of Adverse Events  
The causal relationship of an AE to investigational product must always be assessed by the 
investigator. All AE s will be classified as either related or not related  to investigational 
product. If a causality assessment is not provided  for an AE (including an SAE), that AE will 
be considered related  to the investigati onal product .  
The degree of certainty with which  an AE is attributed to the investigational product or an 
alternative cause (eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be 
determined by how well the event can be understood in terms of:  
• Known pharmacology of the investigation al product.  
• Clinically and / or pathophysiologically plausible context.  
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the 
literature for similar product s as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, 
pallor). 
• Plausibility supported by the temporal relationship (eg, the event being related by time to 
administration or termination of treatment with the investigational product, drug 
withdrawal or reproduced on rechallenge).  
9.4 Observation Period for Adverse Even ts 
The observation period for AE (and SAE) reporting for an individual subject will start at the 
time of giving written informed consent for participation in the current study and  finish at the 
subject’s final study visit:  
• The Week 9 Telephone Contact for any subject who enters the Run -in Period and does 
not participate in Treatment Period 1.  
• Follow-up at the Week 26 (Day 186) Visit for C1 -INH HAE subjects who are assigned to 
receive placebo,  mg,  mg, or  mg CSL312 q4wk during Treatment Period 1.  
• Follow-up at the Week 26 (Day 186) Visit for FXII/PLG HAE subjects who take part in 
Treatment Period 1.  
• Follow-up at the Week 25 (Day 180) Visit for C1 -INH HAE subjects who are ass igned to 
receive  mg CSL312 q2wk during Treatment Period 1.  
• Follow-up at the Week 70 (Day 494) Visit for subjects taking part in Treatment Period 1 
and Treatment Period 2, if Treatment Period 2 is not extended.

Confidential  • Follow-up at the Treatment Period 2 Follow -up Visit taking place ~14 weeks (ie, 95 days 
[± 3 days]) after each subject’ s final Treatment Period 2 study visit for subjects taking 
part in Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2, if Treatment Period 2 is extended.  
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has started after the observation period has 
finished, and the re is at least a possible causal relationship to the investigational product, the 
event must be reported to CSL (see Section 9.6.3). 
9.5 Follow-up of Adverse Events  
Every effort should be made to follow AEs until re solution or stabilization. Ongoing, 
non-serious AEs that have not resolved or stabilized will be followed until the  subject 
completes the study. Serious adverse events will be followed until the AE resolves, stabilizes, 
or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
9.6 Adverse Event Reporting  
9.6.1 Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs 
have occurred. AEs will be recorded in the AE page of the eCRF. If known, the medical 
diagnosis of an AE should be recorded i n preference to the listing of individual signs and 
symptoms. The investigator must follow up on the course of an A E until resolution or 
stabilization. If an AE is ongoing after the final study visit, the AE will continue to be 
followed up until resolution , stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If, during the study period, a subject presents with a preexi sting condition that was not noted 
at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical 
History eCRF.  
9.6.2 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
In order to guarantee the rapid communication of AESIs from investigator to CSL,  
information relating to any AESI must be entered into the eCRF within 24 hours.  
If an AESI is considered serious, the event must be reported  to CSL as described in 
Section 9.6.3 (Serious Adverse Event Reporting).

Confidential  9.6.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full 
requirements of  ICH Topic E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and 
Standards for Expedited Reporting).  
For SAEs occurring during the study, the investigator or delegate will enter all relevant 
information in the eCRF.  
All SAEs that occur during the course of  the study, whether or not causally r elated to 
the investigational product, must be entered into the eCRF immediately (within 
24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event). An assessment of causality to 
the investigational product must be inclu ded. 
Adverse events occurring in the period between the time the subject gave written informed 
consent and the first exposure to the investigational product that meet 1 or more of the 
seriousness criteria be entered into the eCRF in the same manner as othe r SAEs and will be 
included in the cl inical study database.  
Any SAE that occurs after the final study visit that is considered to be causally related to the 
investigational product must be reported immediately (ie, within 24 hours of the 
investigator beco ming aware of the event) to CSL . 
The minimum reporting requirements for reporting of SAEs include:  
• Subject identification number.  
• Suspected medicinal product and / or procedure.  
• Event term.  
• Reporting source identification (Note: the reporting source must b e medically qualified).  
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to 
receive additional information to fully document the event.  
In addition, the investigator must:  
• Report all SAEs to the relevant Institutio nal Review Board (IRB) / Independ ent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) during the timeframe specified by the IRB / IEC.  
• Enter follow -up information in the eCRF until the SAE has resolved, or, in the case of 
permanent impairment, until stabilized.

Confidential  • Ensure that the caus ality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF. 
In cases of death, the investigator should supply CSL and the IEC  / IRB (as applicable) with 
any additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical 
reports). 
9.6.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
During Scree ning, any laboratory values that deviate from the reference ranges and are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator must be documented on the medical 
history page of the eCRF.  
For laboratory safety parameters, any instances of absolute values being outside the reference 
range and/or changes at any visit after study start that are considered by the investigator as 
clinically significant must recorded in the eCRF as AEs. In addition, at the investigator ’s 
discretion, any changes or trends over ti me in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the 
eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the 
absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the foll owing cases:  
• Increases in  will not be classified as AEs because CSL312 is expected to cause 
increase in this parameter.  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at Screening, unless a further 
increase /  decrease can be considered an ex acerbation of a pre -existing condition.  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by mechanical or physical influences on the 
blood sample (eg, in vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by the laboratory in the 
laboratory report.  
• Abnormal parameters that are obv iously biologically implausible (eg, values that are 
incompatible with life or outside the measuring range).  
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analysis, preferably 
in the same laboratory (ie , the previous result could be marked as not valid and should not 
necessarily be reported as an AE).

Any overdose that occurs in association with an adverse sign or symptom must be entered 
into the eCRF as an AE; if the AE meets any seriousness cr iteria, the event must be repor ted 
as an SAE (see Section 9.6.3). 
Details (eg, volume, location of infusions, infusion rate) of overdose of the investigational 
product (defined in Section 7.5) must be recorded in the study treatment administration 
eCRF. Details of overdose of any concomitant therapy must be recorded in the Concomitant 
Medication eCRF.  
9.6.6 Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
A female subject or female partner of a  male subject who becomes pregnant while 
participating in the study must notify the investigator immediately and at any time during the 
study (see Section 9.4). 
If a female subject becomes pregn ant, she must dis continue treatment with the investigational 
product immediately, her participation will be discontinued, and the procedure for 
discontinuation of a subject will be followed, as described in Section 4.2. 
During the study, CSL must be notified within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of 
the pregnancy (by entry of appropriate data into the eCRF).  
Whenever possible, a pregnancy in  a subject or in a female partner of a male subject exposed 
to the investigation al product should be followed to term so as to assess any potential 
occurrence of congenital anomalies or birth defects. Any follow -up information, including 
premature terminat ion and the status of the mother and child after delivery, should be 
reported by  the investigator to CSL using a Pregnancy Reporting / Outcome Form.  
9.7 IRB / IEC Reporting Requirements  
The time frame within which an IRB / IEC must be notified of deaths and i nvestigational 
product-related unexpected SAEs is stipulated by each IRB / IEC. It is the investigator ’s 
responsibility to comply with the requirements for IRB / IEC notification. CSL will provide 
investigators with all details of all SAEs reported to regu latory authorities.

Confidential  10 Statistics  
10.1 Sample Size Estimation  
Subjects with C1 -INH HAE  
Seven subjects assigned to each treatment (Placebo, or  mg,  mg, or  mg CSL312 
q4wk) are needed to reach power of ~82% for the comparisons of  mg CSL312 q4wk 
versus placebo q4wk and  mg CSL312 q4wk versus placebo q4wk in Treatment Period 1. 
This is based on the following assumptions:  
• The time-normalized number of HAE attacks is 2.9 attacks per month during treatment 
with placebo. This number was derived from CSL study CSL830_3001, using the lower 
bound of the distribution -free 95% confidence in terval for the median of the first placebo 
treatment period.  
• The time-normalized number of HAE attacks is 0.6 attacks per month during treatment 
with  mg  CSL312 q4wk or   mg CSL312 q4wk. The number was derived from 
CSL study CSL830_3001, using the upp er bound of the distribution -free 95% confidence 
interval for the median of the combined active treatment periods.  
• Alpha is 2.5% for each of the 2 two -sided Mann -Whitney Tes ts of  mg CSL312 q4wk 
or  mg CSL312 q4wk against placebo.  
 
. The sample size of 7 subjects for this arm is not driven by an 
efficacy comparison , but instead, by consistency with other treatment arms and for 
maintenance of blin ding of the study. No testing for efficacy of the  mg CSL312 dose 
against placebo is planned and no power calculation has been done. An additional subject 
may be added to each of these 4 treatment arms to account for drop outs during Treatment 
Period 1, resulting in 8 subjects in each treatment arm.  
Up to 7 subjects with C1 -INH HAE will be assigned to receive  mg CSL312 q2wk. This 
arm is included for informational purpos es, and therefore no testing against placebo is 
planned and no power calculation ha s been done. An additional subject may be added to this 
arm to account for drop outs during Treatment Period 1, resulting in up to 8 subjects in this 
treatment arm.  
Overall, a total of up to 40 subjects with C1 -INH HAE will be assigned to treatment in 
Treatment Period  1.

Continuous variables will be d escribed by using mean values with their respective 95% 
confidence intervals (CI); standard deviation; range; 2 5th, 50th (median), and 75th 
percentiles; and counts of missing and non -missing values. The geometric coefficient of 
variation will be expressed as a percentage for PK and  data. The geometric mean and its 
respective 90% CI will be calculated for PK and  data. The 90% CI for the geometric 
mean will be calculated by log transforming the data, calculating the lower and upper limits 
of the 90% CI of the mean of the log -transformed data, and subsequently back transforming 
the lower and upper limits. Categor ical values will be described using counts and 
percentages.  
All data will be displayed in by -subject listings. The listings will be sorted by tre atment, 
study site, subject, time point, and item number (if applicable).

Reasons for discontinuations / withdrawals will be listed by subject.  
10.3.1.2  Subject Characteristics  
All demographic and subject characteristics will be summarized by treatment and overall for 
the ITT Population and Per Protocol Population . These will include:  
• Demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, body weight, body mass index ).

10.3.2.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
10.3.2.1.1  The Primary Analysis  
The primary endpoint (time -normalized number of HAE attacks) will be analyzed using the 
ITT and PP Populations. The ITT population will be used for the primary analysis and the PP 
will be used as the secondary analysis.  
The evaluation periods for efficacy, including for the time -normalized number of HAE 
attacks are specified in Section 10.3. For the primary analysis , only the efficacy period for 
Treatment Period 1 and subjects with q4wk dosing, as defined in  Section 10.3, is applicable.   
Subjects are to enter HAE symptoms into their eDiary. HAE attacks are based upon review of 
patient diaries and review of relevant interim medical history by the investigator, including 
hospital / medical records and any information provided by the subject. Using medical 
judgment, the investigator is to determine the occurrence of an HAE attack.  
The time-normalized number of HAE attacks per month during treatment is calculated per 
subject as: [the number of HAE attacks  / length of subject treatment in days] * 30.4375, 
where the l ength of subject treatment is calculated for Treatment Period 1 as: [the date / time 
of the first SC dose of investigational product in Treatment Period 2 – the date / time of the 
first SC dose of investigational product in Treatment Period 1].

Confidential  The time-normalized number of HAE attacks will be summarized descriptively by median 
(primary) and mean (secondary) with corresponding 95% CIs by treatment (ie, placebo, or  
mg,  mg, or  mg CSL312 q4wk).  
To test for a difference in the primary efficacy endpo int between  mg CSL312 q4wk 
or  mg CSL312 q4wk and placebo, pairwise comparisons will be performed by testing the 
hypotheses using a two -sided Mann -Whitney Test.  
To account for multiple t esting, the alpha level of 5% will be evenly split between the  
hypotheses tested. Therefore, the  mg CSL312 q4wk or   mg CSL312 q4wk CSL312 
doses (in subjects with C1 -INH HAE) will each be evaluated against placebo at alpha = 0.025 
for each test:  
H01: a1 = 0 vs H11: a1 ≠ 0  
and  
H02: a2 = 0 vs H12: a2 ≠ 0  
In the above hypotheses, the term “a1” is the shift between the 2 distributions of  mg 
CSL312 q4wk and placebo and the term “a2” is the shift between the distributions of  mg 
CSL312 q4wk and p lacebo, respectively.  
There will be no testing of the  mg CSL312 q4wk dose against placebo. The time -
normalized number of HAE attacks will be presented descriptively (only).  
There will be no testing of the of  mg CSL312 q2wk dose against placebo for s ubjects 
with C1-INH HAE or the   mg CSL312 q4wk dose against placebo for subjects with 
FXII/PLG HAE.  
10.3.2.1.2  Supportive Analyses  
The primary endpoint (the time -normalized number of HAE attacks) will also be summarized 
descriptively for the  mg CSL312 q2wk reg imen (for subjects with C1 -INH HAE) and the 
 mg CSL312 q4wk regimen (for subjects with FXII/PLG HAE) for the evaluation period 
of Treatment Period 1.  
The primary endpoint will also be summarized descriptively for the CSL312 q4wk regimens 
for the followi ng (see Section 10.3): 
• Treatment Period 2 evaluation period (alone).  
• Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 evaluation periods (combined).

Secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed for Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 
separately. In addition, Treatmen t Period 1 and Treatment Period 2 will be a nalyzed together 
for subjects who are being continuously administered  the same dose of CSL312 during both 
treatment periods.  For C1-INH subject s having a dose reduction from  mg to  mg in 
Treatment Period 2,  only data until the date and time of the d ose reduction will be included.  
Subjects with C1 -INH HAE who are treated with placebo or  mg,  mg, or  mg 
CSL312 q4wk, will be analyzed separately from subject with C1 -INH HAE who are treated 
with  mg q 2wk. Subjects with FXII/PLG HAE will be ana lyzed separately from subjects

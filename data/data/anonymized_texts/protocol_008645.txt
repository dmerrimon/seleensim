 1. Purpose of study:  This is a research study  to better understand the impact of exercise training on 
changes in the heart as well as functional capacity .  Participating in exercise for patients with heart 
failure has been shown to be beneficial at decreas ing symptoms of heart failure however the mechanisms 
that create  that change are still unclear. This study will look specifically at ho w exercise creates changes 
within the hearts filling ability, the heart’s  pumping strength as  well as the hearts ability to rebuild.  
 
This study is a compl ementary study to the approved protocol “Exercise Therapy to Reduce Heart 
Failure Symptoms; sorting mechanisms of benefit ” by (Exercise Therapy) Site-PI Daniel Gottlieb, 
Prime -PI Daniel Forman which is focused primarily on  peripheral mechanisms of exercise intolerance in 
older patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and the related benefits of exercise 
training on skeletal muscle gene expression . This study builds on what will be collected as part of that 
study and adds to it by looking at the mechanic s of the heart.  
 
You have been asked to be a part of this study because you have been told by your doctor that you have 
a diagnosis of heart failure  and are currently enrolled in the approved exercise interven tion protocol 
“Exercise Therapy ”. The length of your participation within this study will be approximately  17 weeks. 
Study visits will take place at the West Roxbury campus of the VA Boston Healthcare System  
(VABHS) . Before starting the intervention for th e Exercise Therapy study and after the completion of 
the Exercise Therapy study you will complete a visit to the West Roxbury campus  where you will have 
an echocardiogram performed as part of this study .   
 
Please note that several assessments that you wil l have completed as part of the Exercise Therapy 
protocol will be shared with the current study staff as part of  the  project to reduce your burden of having 
to repeat those tests. The assessments that will be shared are 1) cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, 2) 
6minute walk test, 3) Breathing tests, 4) questionnaires looking at quality of life, and 5) the intervention 
group you have been assigned to as well as your adherence to the exercise intervention group (number of 
sessions you complete).  
 
We will recruit  approximately 60 subjects  to this study that are taking part in Exercise Therapy study . 
We will also recruit  15 patients  who will only undergo assessment s pre and post 12 -weeks of standard 
clinical care . This study is being sponsored by the Veterans  Health Administration Rehabilitation 
research and Development.

 2. Description of the study, procedures to be used, and how long it will last:   
Your participation in this st udy will involve a total of 2  (1 baseline and 1  post) assessment visit s over a 
17 week period of time the baseline and posts tests are exactly the same.  
 
Baseline and post testing will involve one  visit to the West Roxbury campus where you will have an 
echocardiogram done which will take about 90 minute s.  
 
Echocardiogram:  An echocardiogram  uses sound  waves  to produce  images  of your heart.  This 
commonly  used test allows  us to see how well your heart  is pumping  blood.  During  the test, you will 
be given  a hospital  gown  to wear.  You will be asked  to remove  your clothing  from  the waist up.  A 
cardiac  sonographer  will place  three  electrodes  (small,  flat, sticky patches)  on your chest.  The 
electrodes  are attached  to an electrocardiograph  monitor  (ECG  or EKG)  that charts your heart 's 
electrical  activity.  The sonogra pher will ask you to lie on your left side on an exam  table.  He or she 
will place  a wand  (called  a "sound -wave  transducer")  on several  areas  of your chest.  The wand  will 
have  a small  amount  of gel on the end, which  will not harm  your skin. The gel is used to help produce  
clearer  pictures.  You may be asked  to change  positions  several  times  during  the exam  in order  for the 
sonographer  to take pictures  of different  areas  of your heart.  You may also be asked  to hold your 
breath  at times  during  the exam.  You should  feel no major discomfort  during the test, although  you 
may feel cooln ess from  the gel on the transducer  and a slight  pressure  of the transducer on your chest.  
The test will take about  60 minutes.   
 
In the small chance the echocardiography  technician  is unable to g et a clear image of the heart which is 
in less than 10% of people a contrast agent call ed Definity may be use d that allows for better imaging of 
the heart. For the contrast to be administered an IV may be placed in your arm.  
 
If the echocardiogram indicat es that you have any unexpected medical concerns, your doctor will be 
immediately notified, and you may not be able to continue in the study.   
Please note that all other testing and exercise interventions you will complete are part of the Exercise 
Therapy  study and were outlined in the IFC’s you signed as part of that study.  If you have questions on 
that study please contact study staff at 857 -364-5811 or the site -PI Dr. Gottlieb at 857 -203-6375 .  
 
Please note that discomforts, inconveniences and risks are  covered in the following sections.

 a. Difficulty completing the 1 assessment visits pre and post .   
b.  During the echocardiogram there  is a small chance that the pressure of the tran sducer and heat generated by 
the ultrasound may create some discomfort.  Precautions will be taken to minimize these possibilities.   
c. In the instance that you require contrast during the echo a n IV line will be used during the echo 
contrast administrati on and it will be maintained for the 30 minutes of recovery to insure access in the 
small chance of reaction.  Any time an IV is placed there is a small chance of bruising and infection. 
Standard precautions will be followed in cleaning and sterilizing the  area.  
 
4. Reasonably foreseeable risks of study:  
a. There is a rare chance (1:10,000) that patients may be allergic to the microscopic bubble contrast 
(lipid shell and gas), thus allergies will be confirmed via patient medical charts and verbally with th e 
patient prior to the injection of the contrast agent.  Allergic reactions are most likely to occur within 
30 minutes of the injection of the contrast. These reactions can include breathing problems (shortness 
of breath), heart problems (changes in rhythm ), chest pain, jaw tightness, feeling of faintness, 
seizures, and headaches. Special efforts will be taken to reduce risks by watching each subject for 30 
minutes after the echo contrast agent  additionally patients will be instructed to let staff know if t hey 
begin to experience any of these symptoms . 
The treatment or procedure may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.  
 
 In addition to the risks listed above, you may experience a previously unknown risk or side effect.  
 
 If you are or became pregn ant, the particular treatment or procedure might involve risks to the embryo 
or fetus, which are currently unforeseeable . 
 
5. Expected benefits of study:  There are no known direct benefits to you for being in this study.  
 
6. Other treatment available:   This is not a treatment study and therefore, will not alter any treatment 
you are receiving at the VA.  
 
7. Use of research results and Confidentiality:   Information collected for the purpose of this research 
study will be kept confidential as required by law .  The results of this study may be published for 
scientific purposes, but your records or identity will not be revealed unless required by law.

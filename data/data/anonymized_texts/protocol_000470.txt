1. RESEARCH BACKGROUND 
 Please describe the purpose of your research.  Pro vide relevant background information 
and briefly state your research question(s).  You m ay provide relevant citations as 
necessary. (300 Word Max.)  
Lesbian, bisexual, and queer-identified (LBQ) women in the United States ar e more likely to drink 
alcohol, engage in heavy alcohol use, experience alcohol-related problem s and become dependent on 
alcohol than are heterosexual women. Although web-based PNF interventio ns have become popular 
strategies to correct misperceived norms and reduce alcohol use in other populat ions, lesbian and queer 
women constitute a hidden population not easily reached by traditional interv ention efforts. This 
NIAAA-funded project implements and evaluates a novel, gamified, web-based PNF al cohol 
intervention format culturally tailored to appeal to members of the local Los Ange les lesbian and queer 
female community. Packaged as a digital social game about LBQ stereotypes, LezParl ay features 
established game mechanics including co-presence, a system of points, chance-based uncertainty, and 
multiple feedback topics to increase appeal and remedy many of the limitations (i.e ., defensiveness, 
reactance, and lack of attention) associated with standard web-based PNF interventions. Uniquely, to 
confront both social and coping antecedents of lesbians’ drinking, LezParlay  seeks to reduce drinking 
among LBQ women by providing PNF on both alcohol use and coping behaviors u tilized by peers to 
navigate sexual minority stigma stressors.  
Multiple strategies will be employed to recruit approximately 12 00 lesbian, bisexual, and queer 
identified women residing in the United States to take part in the online LezParla y competition. Topics 
in the game will change from month to month and will feature stigma-coping behaviors  and alcohol use, 
among other topics related to familiar lesbian and queer stereotypes (e .g., relationships, sex, identity, 
money, stress, and future plans) . Over 8 monthly rounds of play, players will receive PNF on different 
topics and compete for cash prizes as they test the accuracy of their peer perc eptions and discover how 
their own attitudes and behaviors compare to actual group norms. Importantly, i n Round 3, when 
alcohol use is first assessed as a topic, a sub-sample of 500 players who report moderate drinking will 
be invited to participate in a LezParlay evaluation study. Participants wh o elect to take part in the study 
will be randomized to receive either PNF on alcohol use + coping behavio rs, PNF on alcohol use + 
control topics, or PNF on control topics in subsequent rounds of the game. These study participants will 
be incentivized for playing remaining rounds and completing a follow- up survey about their 
experiences. Analysis of LezParlay efficacy will focus on longitudinal chan ges in alcohol use and coping 
behaviors associated with condition assignment and subsequent receipt of PNF among study 
participants. Analysis of feasibility associated with the gamified LezParlay for mat will focus on 
acceptability ratings and other feedback gathered from trial participants as well a s basic application 
usage among the pool of players who elect to take part in the compe tition but do not participate in the 
study, and thus, are not incentivized for their completion of rounds. 
 
2.  SUBJECT RECRUITMENT 
How will subjects be selected?  What is the sex and  age range of the subjects?  
Approximately how many subjects will be studied? 
How will subjects be contacted?  Who will make init ial contact with subjects?  
Specifically, what will subjects be told in initial  contact?  
Office for Research Compliance Page 3 of 40 7/26/2018  
 The LezParlay competition will be open to ALL lesbian and queer-identified wo men between 21 years of 
age and older who reside in the United States. Although there is no upper l imit on the number of 
women who can take part in the competition, we expect to recruit at least 1, 200 LBQ women (400 
women in each age-group; 20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s). 
The game will be promoted via 3 mechanisms. First, flyers will be distributed locally at Los Angel es 
events for LBQ women put on by collaborating partners LezDoBrunch and the Los Ange les LGBT 
Center a nd Los Angeles Women’s Network. Second, targeted social media advertisements will promote 
LezParlay on Facebook, Instagram, and HER social media platforms to lesbian a nd queer identified 
female users residing in different regions of the United States.  Thi rd, promotional emails describing 
the game will be sent to the email list of Autostraddle, a popular online blog for qu eer women . 
Registered players can earn bonus points in initial rounds of the game by inviting frie nds to play. All 
recruitment materials will link to the LezParlay website which provides infor mation about the game and 
invites participants to register online (www.lezparlayla.com) . APPENDIX A includes recruitment ads 
and flyers.  
If subjects will be screened, describe criteria and  procedures. 
Two different levels of “participants”  will take part in LezParlay: “Evaluation Study Participants”  
(N=500) among whom we will assess efficacy of LezParlay in reducing alcohol use; and, “Non -
Evaluation Study Participants ” (N=800+) among whom we will assess feasibility and engagement with 
the LezParlay web app .  
 
LezParlay Participant Inclusion Criteria (Applies to all players ): 
To take part in the LezParlay competition individuals must: 
1) Self-identify as a lesbian, bisexual, or queer woman 
2) Be 21 years of age or older 
3) Reside in the United States 
4) Accept LezParlay Terms of Service & Privacy Policy 
 
LezParlay Evaluation Study Participant Inclusion Criteria 
To take part in the Evaluation Study, LezParlay Participants must: 
1) Report having had 3+ drinks on one occasion during the past 2 months OR drinking alcohol 
3+ times per week during the past 2 months in response to a Round 3 Alcohol use ques tions 
2) Review and Accept the Evaluation Study Informed Consent page 
3) Have taken part in at least 1 previous round of the competition 
 
Two questions about alcohol use in the third round of the game will act as  a screening item for the 
Evaluation study. Specifically, participants will be quota sampled by Qualtrics in response to a Round 2 
question about the maximum number of drinks consumed on one occasion during the pa st month. The 
first 150 drinkers in each age-group (i.e., 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s) who provide an  answer equal to or above 3 
drinks in response to this question will be invited to become an official tester in  a study evaluating 
LezParlay. On screen text will explain that as a participant in this study they can he lp evaluate 
LezParlay by playing the next 5 rounds of the game and completing a follow-up surv ey about their 
experiences when the game is over. Further, study participants will be emailed a $40  electronic gift card 
to compensate them for their time and they will still be eligible to compete for performance-based cash 
prizes awarded to the top scorers. 
 “Non-Evaluation Study participants” refer to players who register for LezParlay but  either do not 
screen into the study or choose not to participate in the study. Non-Evaluat ion Study participants are 
not incentivized for round completion but may compete for several performance- based cash prizes 
awarded to the top scorers in each age-group. For these participants, LezPar lay web app data analyzed 
for research purposes is limited to aggregated demographic data provided a t registration, the number of 
Office for Research Compliance Page 4 of 40 7/26/2018  
 rounds played, number of logins, and number of screen views. Collection a nd analysis of this data is 
outlined in the web app’s Terms of Service & Privacy Policy which ALL participants must review and 
accept at registration. 
 
3. PROCEDURES 
Summarize fully all procedures to be conducted with  human subjects. 
All contact wit h participants will occur digitally via emails, text messages, and Qualtrics survey s 
embedded within the LezParlay web app. All recruitment materials will link to the LezParlay website 
which provides information about the game and button to register. The r egistration survey will verify 
participants’ geolocation in the United States, prompt participants to review and accept the LezParlay’s 
Terms of Service & Privacy Policy, and create a unique username and password wh ich they will use to 
login to the LezParlay web app. Additional registration items will ask participants to select their sexual 
identity (i.e., lesbian or queer) , and provide their mobile phone number, email address, relationship 
status, birthdate and age-group . The registration survey will also present participants with the option of  
uploading a photo avatar to represent them within the web-app. Descriptive te xt will explain that if they 
elect to provide one, their custom avatar will be visible within the app to oth er logged in players. If they 
choose not to upload an avatar they will be represented within the app by a de fault blank avatar (as is 
done across popular social media sites and apps in the absence of a custom user avatar) . 
Submitting the registration form will trigger a verification text message to be sen t to the mobile 
phone number provided by the participant. Upon receiving the text an d clicking on the unique url 
delivered, the participant’s avatar will be updated with a blue check mark and they will receive 100 
Parlay Points to place bets with in Round 1. Simultaneously, verification loc ks the phone number so that 
it cannot be associated with any future LezParlay registrations and assigns a unique PIN to the 
participant in the registration database. As most individual’ s only own a single mobile phone (or 2 at 
the most), this protocol helps ensure that players cannot try to chea t the LezParlay system by creating 
multiple accounts in order to place wagers on all possible combinations of guesses. F urther, the unique 
PIN assigned to each verified account then acts as the piece of data used by LezParla y to link 
participants’ gues ses, bets, responses, and scores across rounds of play.   
Round Play - upon verification, players will be redirected to a series of instructional screens (See 
Appendix C) that reviews how LezParlay works and explain that points are won a nd lost by placing bets 
on your perceptions of the behaviors and attitudes of the typical LBQ woman  in your age-group. In each 
round there will be between 1 and 3 question topics and each topic will contain app roximately 8 
questions. Four questions will ask you to report your own topic-specific behavior s or attitudes and the 
other four will ask you to guess about how other players in your age-group answered the  same 
questions. For each guess you will be prompted to select the number of points y ou would like to bet on 
your guess being correct based on the average responses of other pl ayers . Screens will also inform 
participants that there is a variable cash prize between $100 and $500 in each  round that will be 
awarded to the player who accumulates the largest number of points in that round. There a re also grand 
prizes ($1000, $500, and $250) that will be awarded to the top 3 scorers in each  age-group who 
accumulate the largest numbers of points across rounds of play. A final screen will explain t hat a fter a 
critical mass (N=300+) in each age-group has played a round, LezParlay will text and email all players 
with a private link to an overview of the points won and lost along with detailed results on one topic. 
Detailed results are intended to help players improve the accuracy of their per ceptions and place 
smarter bets in future rounds, as question topics may be repeated. Following this overview, a button 
will allow players to begin round 1. 
The first screen in the round will reveal 2-3 question topics and the amount of th e cash prize for the 
round’s top scorer.  Players will report their own answers to the questions then  guess and bet points  
Office for Research Compliance Page 5 of 40 7/26/2018  
 (i.e., 10, 25, or 50 points) on how other players will answer. Upon placing their bets, a final screen will 
reiterate that results will be sent out when a critical mass has played in their  age-group .  Additionally, 
they will be informed that they can help speed this along by inviting friends to pla y by sharing their 
personalized referral link, displayed below and also available in their acco unt tab. When a critical mass 
has played ( >300 in each age-group which we expect to take approximately 3 weeks), aver age responses 
to questions have been computed, and points won and lost have been calculate d, links to view detailed 
results will be sent to players via text message and email. Clicking the private u rl will take the player to 
a spinner screen which displays their total score and reveals their detailed results  topic  initial 
“RESULTS LOADING”  screen which summarizes the number of players in the users’ age -group who 
played the round to generate the correct answers (i.e., actual norms). Consis tent with co-presence 
features in popular social media and digital apps, this summary consists of an animated that collage 
displays the thumbnail avatars of all the players who completed the round. Rece nt studies in our lab 
have established that showing participants the peers on whom actual norms are based through such a 
collage increases the believability and credibility of the actual norms to be pres ented on subsequent 
feedback screens. The next screen encountered when viewing one’s deta iled results will feature 3 animated 
graphical doors and instructions to select (tap or click) 2 of the doors in order to reveal either bon us points or 
topics on which detailed results will delivered. Fo r each question topic revealed by the door selectio n 
mechanic, personalized normative feedback (PNF) for each question will follow. PNF consists of bar 
charts with bars respectively representing 1) the participant’s guess about how other players answered 
(i.e., perceived peer norm); 2) the participant’s own answer to the ques tion; and, 3) the actual average 
answer submitted by other players (i.e., actual peer norm). Text on each PN F screen will highlight an 
interesting statistic related to the actual norm and detail the number of points won/l ost based on the 
accuracy of the pl ayer’s guess.  Following PNF screens, participants will be presented with their total 
score and their age- group’ s leaderboard which also crowns the winner of the round’s cash prize. The 
round winner will also be notified by email and text message and have the option of receiving their Visa 
gift card electronically or through the mail. See Appendix B for mockups of app scre ens. 
After viewing these results screens, participants have the option of beginnin g the next round or 
being reminded to complete it later. The participant experience  and sequence of screens encountered in all 
rounds are the same as detailed above with 2 except ions: Rounds 3 and 4, which are intervention rounds  and 
Rounds 7 & 8 which include REPLAY BONUSES. 
Intervention Rounds 3 and 4 . We aim to recruit a minimum of 1200 LBQ women to si gn up during the 
first 2 monthly rounds to ensure that meaningful an d stable sexual identity – and age group –specific actual 
norms for drinking and coping behaviors c an be delivered in intervention rounds 3 and 4. From this larger 
pool of players, 500 will be recruited to participa te in a LezParlay evaluation study (RCT) during Rou nd 3 . 
Acting as baseline (T1) for the RCT, Round 3 will f eature questions about alcohol use, stigma experien ces, 
and a group of nonhealth-related control questions submitted by players. Upon submitting answers to 
alcohol-related questions in Round 3, players will be covertly screened for evaluation study eligibili ty based 
on their answers (i.e., number of drinking days per  week and peak drinks on a single day during the pa st 2 
months) as well as their geolocation and the number  of previous rounds played. Those who have played a t 
least one previous round, are in the United States,  and report drinking alcohol on 3 or more days per week or 
having 3 or more drinks on their peak drinking occa sion will be invited to take part in an evaluation study at 
the end of the round. Interested potential particip ants will advance to an informed consent screen tha t 
explains that the goal of the study is to evaluate the impact and format of detailed resu lts received in 
LezParlay and gather player feedback to inform the next version of the competition. The information fu rther 
detailed that participation in the evaluation study  simply involves playing and viewing detailed resul ts in 
subsequent rounds and completing a brief feedback s urvey at the end of the competition. Participants c an 
earn up to US $40 in electronic gift cards of their  choice to play subsequent rounds and complete the 
feedback survey. Those who check a box indicating t hat they understood what the study participation en tails 
and would like to participate will be welcomed into  the study.  
Office for Research Compliance Page 6 of 40 7/26/2018  
 Qualtrics Research Suite’s automated randomizer will be used to randomize evaluation study 
participants to a PNF condition at the point of study enrollment in round 3. Randomi zation will 
determine the sequence of topics on which participants will receive detailed r esults across intervention 
rounds 3 and 4: alcohol+coping, alcohol+control, or control only. Members of t he research team will be 
blinded to participant condition assignment, and the study participants will not be  aware that any sort 
of randomization was taking place. Rather, like in other rounds, when detailed resul ts are sent players 
will be prompted to choose among 3 animated, graphical doors to determine the topic s on which they 
will view detailed results. Although the results topics will be truly determined via chan ce in most rounds 
of the competition, the doors of evaluation study participants will be fixed to open to thei r randomly 
assigned feedback topics regardless of the door they selected in rounds 3 and 4. Upon com pleting the 
feedback survey at the end of the competition, participants will be debriefed re garding the st udy’s 
research questions and the fixed sequences of health or control feedback th ey were randomized to 
receive in rounds 3 and 4. See Appendix D for the Debriefing Statement. 
Replay Bonus Rounds 7 and 8. 
The last 2 rounds of the competition, 7 & 8, will feature new question to pics as well as previously 
assessed REPLAY BONUS topics which will allow all players to boost th eir scores by placing very large 
bets on a topic they already received feedback on and very small bets for topic o n which feedback has 
not yet been delivered. PNF will be delivered for the new topics assessed in each round but will not be 
repeated for REPLAY BONUS topics. Instead a single screen will reveal the points earned fr om REPLAY 
BONUSES. Importantly, answers to REPLAY BONUS questions in Round 7 amon g intervention study 
participants’ will act as the 2 month post-intervention follow-up for the purpose o f the evaluation study 
RCT. 
 
Competition Conclusion 
Following the announcement of winners after Round 8, the LezParlay competition will be over. A 
special sequence of screens follow for Evaluation Study Participants. Study participants will be provided 
the opportunity to complete the follow-up survey for the evaluation study on  screen or have the link to 
emailed/texted to them so that they can complete it later. Upon submitting the sh ort follow-up survey, 
participants will be prompted to select a $40 electronic gift card (Amazon, Tar get, Starbucks, etc.) to 
receive via email. A final screen will thank them for their time and debrief them about the fixed nature 
of the spinners that selected their detailed results topics in Rounds 3 and 4. Text will reveal that this 
was necessary in order to examine the perceptual and behavioral impacts of different c ombinations of 
detailed results delivered in these rounds. Questions to be featured in Interventio n and Replay Bonus 
Rounds are presented in Appendix C. A list of potential control/filler stereotype rela ted questions to 
comprise other rounds of play also follow in Appendix C. APPENDIX D also provides  the Evaluation 
study follow-up survey and debriefing statement. 
 
4. RISKS / BENEFITS 
What are the potential benefits to subjects and/or to others? 
What are the reasonably foreseeable risks to the su bjects?  (Risks may include 
discomfort, embarrassment, nervousness, invasion of  privacy, etc.)  If there are 
potential risks to subjects, how will they be minim ized in advance?  How will problems 
be handled if they occur? 
 Participants will benefit from LezParlay through the ir receipt of detailed feedback revealing actual 
LBQ community norms and how they compare to LBQ peers on a wide range of beha viors and attitudes 
of interest to this population. Feedback on alcohol use and coping behaviors are a nticipated to show 
participants that their peers consume less alcohol and drink to cope with negati ve affect less than they 
thought. This information is anticipated to have a protective effect on participant s’ own alcohol u se. For 
Office for Research Compliance Page 7 of 40 7/26/2018  
 some, participation in LezParlay may also satisfy curiosities about the LBQ community or help to 
diminish harmful stereotypes. For others, learning about health and relationship behav iors of LBQ 
peers may benefit their own health behaviors and relationships. Ot hers may simply find entertainment 
in the wagers, scoring and feedback. Participants’ responses to LezParlay questions, in aggregate may 
also help shape future programming by our community partners, which in turn, may benefit their 
future well-being. In addition, participants in the evaluation study may enjoy th e opportunity to share 
what they liked about LezParlay, what they hated, and any ideas they have for improveme nts with the 
game’s founders.  
Psychological risks posed by the research are primarily related to the sensitiv ity of some of the 
questions. Participants will be prompted to report their alcohol use, coping beh aviors, health behaviors, 
future plans, relationship and sexual behaviors, information that may be private. These questions may 
make subjects uncomfortable or be perceived as an intrusion on their privacy. To m itigate these risks, 
all LezParlay question responses will be linked to unidentifiable PIN numbers and pa rticipants will be 
able to skip questions they do not feel comfortable answering without penalty. Pa rticipants may also 
experience discomfort upon receipt of personalized normative feedback. F or example, it may be 
distressing for a participant to learn that other lesbians the same age are  drinking much less but 
exercising much more than you. Although igniting such dissonance, or discomfort, is th e primary goal 
of PNF interventions in that these feelings motivate healthy behavior change, participants will be 
provided an opportunity to skip the detailed results screens that provide PNF and advan ce to the next 
round if they wish to do so. 
5. CONFIDENTIALITY 
Will subjects be identifiable by name or other mean s?  If subjects will be identifiable, 
explain the procedures that will be used for collec ting, processing, and storing data.  
Who will have access to data?  What will be done wi th the data when the study is 
completed? If you are collecting visual images of y our subjects please justify this. 
Participants will not provide their full names and identifiable data will only be col lected in the 
initial registration survey (their initials or a nickname, email address, m obile phone number, birthdate, 
relationship status, sexual identity, and a profile picture if they wish to upl oad one) .  The app’s terms of 
Service and Privacy Policy clarify that displaying a profile photo, describing oneself via  descriptive text, 
and entering all profile information with the exception of sexual identity and age group (required for 
round formatting) is optional and not required to take part in the LezParlay competition. It will also be 
clear that player’s contact information  entered at registration (email, phone) will not be visible to other 
players. It is important to emphasize that although participants will be able  to browse one another’s 
player profiles, no distinction will be made as to who is playing as an intervention study par ticipant 
versus a non-study participant. Thus, while players may recognize one another wh en viewing profiles , 
participation in the evaluation study entirely remains confidential. 
Submitting the registration form will trigger a verification text message to be sent to  the mobile 
phone number provided by the participant. Upon receiving the text and cli cking on the unique url 
delivered, the user will be updated with a verification checkmark in the registrat ion database. 
Simultaneously, verification locks the phone number so that it cannot be associa ted with any future 
LezParlay registrations and assigns a unique PIN to the user in the registration da tabase. As most 
individual’s only own  a single mobile phone (or 2 at the most), this protoco l reduces players’ ability to  
cheat in LezParlay by creating multiple accounts in order to place wagers on all possib le combinations 
of guesses. Further, the unique PIN assigned to each verified account then acts as the  piece of data used 
by LezParlay to link participants’ guesses, bets, responses and scores acros s rounds of play.   
As the LezParlay collects all round data through styled Qualtrics surveys f ully embedded into the 
app, all data is protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption ( also known as HTTPS), which 
is a protocol that ensures privacy between communicating applications and their  users on the Internet. 
Also used to secure bank and credit card transactions online, TLS ensures that no thi rd party may 
Office for Research Compliance Page 8 of 40 7/26/2018  
 eavesdrop or tamper with submitted data. Further, after data collection concludes and al l personalized 
feedback, scores, and incentives, have been received by participants, user photos and identifying 
information will be destroyed. Only datasets containing de-identified LezParlay Round data will be 
downloaded from Qualtrics for analysis, password protected, and stored securely on HeadsUp’s 
internal, further password protected server. Thus, these double password pro tected files will only be 
accessible to the PI (Joseph LaBrie) and Project Director (Sarah Boyle) . 
6. INFORMED CONSENT 
Attach an informed consent form or a written reques t for waiver of an informed consent 
form.  Include waiver of written consent if appropr iate.  If your research is being 
conducted in another language, please include copie s of the translated “Informed 
Cons ent” or “Waiver of Written Consent” forms.  
This research requires 2 levels of consent. First, the LezParlay Terms of Servi ce and Privacy Policy must 
be accepted by ALL players at sign-up. Second, players who meet Evaluation Study cr iteria during 
Round 3 and express interest in taking part in the study will be directed to review and complete  the 
Evaluation S tudy’s informed consent form . These documents are separately attached. 
7. STUDENT RESEARCH 
 When a student acts as principal investigator, a f aculty sponsor signature is required on the 
application form. 
N/A 
8.  RENEWAL APPLICATIONS 
 When the submission is a Renewal Application, incl ude a summary of the research activities during 
the previous granting period specifically addressin g:  number of subjects studied and any adverse 
reactions encountered, benefits which have been der ived, any difficulty in obtaining subjects or in 
obtaining informed consent, and approximate number of subjects required to complete the study. 
N/A 
9. PAYMENTS  
If subjects are to be paid in cash, services, or be nefits, include the specific amount, 
degree, and basis of remuneration. 
All participants will have the opportunity to compete for a cash prize in each r ound (one prize 
ranging from $100 to $500) as well as cumulative cash prizes to be awarded to top scor ers in each age-
group (1st place=$1000; 2nd place=$500, 3rd place=$250) at the end of the game. These prizes will take 
the form of Visa gift cards. Winners will be notified via text message and email and will be ask ed 
whether they prefer to have an electronic Visa gift card emailed to them or have a physical version 
mailed to them. Those who elect to have a physical version mailed will be aske d to provide their postal 
address.  
Evaluation study participants (N=500) who play the majority of rounds and comple te the follow-
up survey will receive $40 in e-gift cards of their choice (iTunes, Amazon, Target or Starbucks). 
Consistent with other university and NIH sponsored research conducted by our  team, giftcards will be 
sent via GiftBit. Players will receive a $20 giftcard for completion of rounds and a $20 giftca rd for 
completion of the post-competition feedback survey. 
Office for Research Compliance Page 9 of 40 7/26/2018  
 10. PSYCHOLOGY SUBJECT POOL  
When students from the Psychology Subject Pool (PSP ) are to be involved as subjects, permission 
must be obtained from the PSP prior to running subj ects.   
Forms are available from the Psychology Office in 4700 University Hall.  It is not necessary to 
inform the IRB of approval from the PSP, however th e PSP requires IRB approval prior to 
permission for using the pool being granted. 
N/A  
11. QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING  
Describe the qualifications of, or method of traini ng and supervision afforded student 
experimenters. This includes past experience, type and frequency of student/sponsor interactions 
during the experiment, and Human Subjects Protectio ns Training. 
N/A 
12. RANDOMIZATION 
Describe criteria for assigning subjects to sub-gro ups such as “control ” and “experimental. ” 
As described previously, Q ualtrics Research Suite’s automated randomize r will be used to randomize 
evaluation study participants to a PNF condition at the point of study enrollment in r ound 3. 
Randomization determined the sequence of topics on which participants received d etailed results 
across intervention rounds 3 and 4: alcohol+coping, alcohol+control, or co ntrol only. Members of the 
research team will be blinded to participant condition assignment, and the study participants will not 
be aware that any sort of randomization was taking place. Rather, when detailed results  were sent at the 
end of each round, players will be prompted to choose among 3 animated, graphical do ors to determine 
the 1 to 2 round topics on which they would view detailed results. Although the results topic s will be 
truly determined via chance in most rounds of the competition, the doors of evaluati on study 
participants will be fixed to open to their randomly assigned feedback topics regardless of th e door they 
selected in rounds 3 and 4. Upon completing the feedback survey at the end of the comp etition, 
parti cipants will be debriefed regarding the study’s research questions and the fixed sequenc es of health 
or control feedback they were randomized to receive in rounds 3 and 4. 
13. USE OF DECEPTION  
If the project involves deception, describe the deb riefing procedures that will be used.   
Include, verbatim, the following statement in the c onsent form: "Some of the information with 
which I will be provided may be ambiguous or inaccu rate.  The investigator will, however, inform 
me of any inaccuracies following my participation i n this study." 
Although none “of the information which participants will  be provided will be ambiguous or inaccurate” 
under any circumstances,  the fixed nature of the feedback selection mechanism encountered by 
Evaluation Study participants in Rounds 3 and 4 may be considered minor deception. Thus, upon  
completion of the follow-up survey intervention study participants will  be debriefed regarding the non-
random nature of these mechanisms. (See APPENDIX D for debriefing statement) 
Office for Research Compliance Page 10 of 40 7/26/2018  
 14. QUESTIONNAIRES AND SURVEYS  
Include copies of questionnaires or survey instrume nts with the application (draft form is

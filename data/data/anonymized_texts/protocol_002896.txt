    Is this work part of a larger collaborative research project where more than one institution is participating in the research?  (In collaborative projects, data/specimens/results are often shared between researchers at the participating institutions, and they will publish together.) ☐ No   ☒ Yes If yes, please explain. We are collaborating with the University of Southern California, where the intervention is being administered as a part of a social service program for caregivers (USC Family Caregiver Support Program). USC may participate in publication of findings, but is not involved in data collection procedures.    1.0 Funding If this study is grant funded, is the money coming directly to CWRU from the study sponsor? ☐  Yes ☒  No ☐  N/A, not grant funded  2.0 Objectives Directions: Describe the purpose, specific aims or objectives. Be sure to also include the hypothesis being tested. The overall objective of this project is to test the preliminary efficacy that participation in the CONFIDENCE intervention improves caregiver learned resourcefulness and self-efficacy, as well as distal outcomes including monthly out-of-pocket costs of caregiving and financial anxiety/worry. The central hypothesis is that caregivers who participate in the CONFIDENCE intervention will report higher levels of learned resourcefulness and self-efficacy following participation in the CONFIDENCE intervention in follow up surveys as compared to levels found at baseline.   A secondary objective of this research (sub-study, modification submitted 8/2023) is to characterize out-of-pocket spending by Latino family caregivers to persons living with dementia on care-related expenses.       3.0 Background Directions: Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps in current knowledge describing how this study will add to existing knowledge. Include any relevant preliminary data. Family caregivers to people living with dementia encounter high out-of-pocket caregiving costs that exert long-term material and psychological consequences.  A 2016 report by AARP found that caregivers to people living with dementia spend an average of $10,697 per year on out-of-pocket costs related to caregiving (Rainville, Skufca, & Mehegan, 2016). This is nearly double the out-of-pocket costs experienced by caregivers to individuals who are not living with dementia. Another study found similar levels of out-of-pocket spending by caregivers ($6,194), and also calculated the costs of caregivers’ forgone wages each year ($13,188) (Hurd, Martorell, Delavande, Mullen, & Langa, 2013). The effects of disrupted employment related to caregiving accumulate over time, making it still more difficult to pay for caregiving expenses out-of-pocket. A study by the Metlife Mature Market Institute found that women ages 50 and older who provide care to a parent lose an average of $324,000 in wages, pension earnings, and Security in their lifetime (2011). Caregiving can prompt a “vicious cycle of poverty”—women who live below the poverty threshold are more likely to become caregivers, and caregivers are more likely to become impoverished (Lee, Tang, Kim, & Albert, 2015). Further, it is increasingly recognized that financial hardship is

comprised not only of material strain, but also psychological strain (Tucker-Seeley & Thorpe, 2019). Perceived financial strain from caregiving is associated with role overload and burden (Andren & Elmstahl, 2007; Lai, 2012; Liu, Dokos, Fauth, Lee, & Zarit, 2019). For low-income caregivers, out-of-pocket spending on caregiving, combined with periodic or permanent lost wages, can compound financial strain over a lifetime. Hispanic caregivers have higher out-of-pocket caregiving costs relative to their income than non- Hispanic caregivers. Whereas out-of-pocket expenditures on caregiving—regardless of the care recipient’s cognitive status— consumes 20% of caregivers’ annual income and costs $6,954 per year on average, these costs comprise nearly half (47%) the income of Hispanic women who provide care and total $10,704 annually (Rainville et al., 2016). Relative to the average caregiver (i.e., caregiver of any race/ethnicity), Hispanic women who provide care spend $1,849 more on household items (e.g. home modifications for safety, home repairs) and $1,849 on education, legal, and travel expenses (e.g., retrofitting vehicles to accommodate wheelchairs) per year. Higher caregiving costs are in-part due to a preference among Hispanic families for older family members to receive care in the community, rather than in skilled nursing facilities, and often within a shared household (Angel & Berlinger, 2018; Scharlach et al., 2006). A growing number of Hispanic families are likely to care for someone living with dementia. Hispanics are 50% more likely to experience dementia and current projections suggest there will be an 832% grown in the number of Hispanics who live with dementia by 2060 (Alzheimer’s Association, 2019; Wu, Vega, Resendez, & Jin, 2016). Given the anticipated growth in the number of Hispanic families living with dementia, financial disadvantages that are already experienced by U.S. Hispanics, and the high costs from caregiving, dementia has been described as “the perfect storm” for financial hardship among U.S. Hispanics (Wu et al., 2016).  Caregivers struggle to access community-based resources and benefits that could be used to displace out-of-pocket expenditures related to caregiving. Community-based (social support) systems that serve family caregivers and older adults are de- centralized and difficult to navigate (Funk, Dansereau, & Novek, 2019; Meyer, 2017). Although most service-seeking caregivers need at least some assistance with legal and financial matters (e.g., seeking health and non-health benefits), Hispanic caregivers are less likely to use social supports for themselves than non-Hispanic caregivers (Martindale-Adams, Nichols, Zuber, Burns, & Graney, 2016; Shrestha et al., 2011). Qualitative research reveals that Hispanic caregivers know that community-based services exist to support caregivers, but perceive accessing these resources overly burdensome relative to their perceived value (Scharlach et al., 2006). Hispanic caregivers also identify a need for more culturally- relevant services, especially those based on Mexican cultural norms. As such, compared to non- Hispanics, Hispanic caregivers may face more barriers to accessing services and supports like those provided through the National Family Caregiver Support Program that could be used to off-set some of the out-of-pocket costs of caregiving (Lepore, Splaine, Bangerter, & Dawson, 2020).  There is an unmet need for programs to alleviate financial hardship among family caregivers. On April 15th, 2020 the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine held a workshop on intervention programs to better support family caregivers. Implementation science expert Melissa Simon, MD, PhD recommended that the caregiving field develop interventions to address financial hardship using approaches from other fields (2020). In line with this recommendation, the Confidently Navigating Financial Decisions and Enhancing Financial Wellbeing in Dementia Caregiving (CONFIDENCE) program draws on successful intervention approaches identified within nursing and gerontological research to lower out-of-pocket caregiving costs and prevent financial hardship among low-income family caregivers.  Given prior research we propose to evaluate an educational program to encourage reduced out-of-pocket spending on caregiving that is developed to be culturally relevant and tailored to the needs of Latino Caregivers. This program will be delivered as a regular service program at the University of Southern California Family Caregiver Support Program. This project is supported by an AARP Foundation grant. Case Western will lead the evaluation of the program to test its preliminary efficacy and feasibility.    Background for sub-study (8/2023 modification). In addition to attempting to intervene to reduce out-of-pocket care costs, the authors further wish to deepen current understanding as to what these costs are. In an article published in The Gerontologist, the PI collaborated with researchers from the University of Southern California to understand how Latino caregivers manage high out-of-pocket care costs (Mage at al., 2023). We learned about how caregivers described how purchasing everyday items, such as hygiene products accumulated over time. Caregivers also found themselves compromising their own financial wellbeing to cover their family members’ costs, such as paying more for high quality items as a show of love for their family member. Prior survey research by AARP demonstrates variation in how much caregivers pay on caregiving that varied by race and ethnicity (Skufca et al., 2021). For example, Hispanic caregivers $225 more annually on household expenses relative to non-Hispanic white caregivers. This research suggests that it is highly likely that sociocultural factors affect purchase decisions, needs, and, ultimately, out-of-pocket costs of caregiving. Still, there is more to be learned about spending patterns among Latino family caregivers related to caregiving. Doing so could partially uncover reasons for financial strain in this population (e.g., paying for household items to avoid residential care), as well as inform culturally relevant measurement and intervention approaches. The purpose of the proposed sub-study study is, thus, to characterize the out-of-pocket costs of family caregivers among Latino family members to persons living with dementia.

8.0 Recruitment Methods Note: Attach all applicable recruitment materials to the last section of the Smart form under “Recruitment Materials.” 1. Which of the following methods will be used to recruit research participants? – Select all that apply ☒  Email ☒  Phone call ☒  Letter ☒  Advertisement (e.g., poster, flyer, etc.) ☒  I attest that advertisements will only be placed with permission  ☒  Social media • Indicate the platform(s): Facebook ☒  I attest that recruitment information will only be posted with permission  ☒  Other. Please specify: The research assistant or PI will contact participants who enroll in the Eventbrite page to register for the program with the USC Family Caregiver Support Program. Participants are asked about their interest in participating in a research study when they sign up to attend CONFIDENCE. Those who indicate an interest in the study will receive a follow up phone call and/or email from the study team to tell them more about the study and check eligibility if interested. Participants who began participation at UT Health San Antonio will also be contacted to ask about continuing their participation in the study at Case Western. We will reconsent these participants prior to their continuing to engage in study activities. ADDITIONAL METHODS OF RECRUITMENT SUBMITTED 10/2022: To hasten the pace of recruitment, the study team is also requesting to submit an article to La Presna, a Spanish/English newspaper in the northern Ohio and southeast Michigan regions that describes the program and study. We also prepared talking points that USC FCSC family care navigators can share about the program and the study if they wish to. Lastly, the PI, with permission of the USC FCSC will also send an individual email and/or phone call to likely eligible participants (50+, Latino). The USC FCSC will send a password-protected file with caregivers’ name, email, and phone number to the PI, who will contact caregivers directly to learn if they may be interested in participating in the program and/or the study. ADDINTIONAL METHODS OF RECRUITMENT SUBMITTED 11/2022: We will also work with Banner Health Institute’s Alzheimer’s Prevention Registry to identify potential participants. Individuals identifying as a caregiver sign up to receive email blasts from Banner Health and may review information about studies they may be interested in a website. Persons who are interested then indicate their interest, and provide the study team their name, email, and phone number to reach them. This information is made available in a portal where the study team will whether they contacted the participant.  2. Describe when, where, how and by whom potential research participants will be recruited. Individuals involved in recruitment should be identified by role and not by name (e.g. study coordinator, co-investigator, research assistant). See above. Participants will also be able to contact the study team directly, such as by calling or emailing the research assistant after seeing a study flyer or social media post. If this occurs, the study team member will not only complete study eligibility procedures,

but register participants in the Eventbrite system to reserve a CONFIDENCE spot for them. For those caregivers who receive a letter or phone call from the PI or who sign up on the Banner Health Institute site, the PI will contact the participant by telephone and/or email up to 3 times to share more information about the study and/or enroll the participant.   3. Describe the feasibility of recruiting the required number of suitable research participants within the agreed recruitment period. For example, how many potential research participants do you have access to?  USC will complete 12 cohorts of the CONFIDENCE intervention from September 2022 to June 2023, where cohorts will be held monthly except for 3 months where USC will run 2 cohorts simultaneously. We expect to enroll N=5 caregivers per cohort, or about 1/3 of caregivers who sign up to attend the program, to reach our recruitment goal N=60 caregivers.  9.0 Setting Directions: Describe the sites and locations where your research team will conduct the research.  All research will be conducted at Case Western Reserve University where the study team has lab space to collect data by telephone, REDCap, and Zoom in a private space.  10.0 Consent Process Indicate whether you will be obtaining consent: ☒  Yes  ☐  No If yes, answer the following questions: 1. Describe who will consent the subjects and where the consent process will take place: Consent processes will be completed by the PI and research assistant over the phone in a private space.    2. The time that will be devoted to the consent discussion: We anticipate that the consent process will take no more than 10 minutes to complete  3. Any waiting period available between informing the prospective subject and obtaining the consent: There is no waiting period between informing the participant of their eligibility and the consenting process.  4. Steps that will be taken to ensure the research participants’ understanding: Participants will be asked whether they have any questions about what is involved in the study. We will also send a copy of the study information reviewed by phone by email to participant.  5. Any process to ensure ongoing consent: We will assume ongoing consent if the participant chooses to complete surveys. At the top of each survey, participants will be reminded that participation is voluntary. Participants whose data is being transferred from UT Health San Antonio will be reconsented using the approved

Case Western document to ensure they remain aware of changes in the study location and how this affects study risks and benefits.  6. Steps that will be taken to minimize the possibility of coercion or undue influence to the subjects: While consenting participants, we will remind them that participation is voluntary, and that they are welcome to participate in CONFIDENCE regardless of their choice to participate in the research study  For Adult Participants Indicate if you will be asking for a waiver or alteration of consent process or documentation (consent will not be obtained, or written consent will not be documented) ☒  Yes  ☐  No  If yes, explain how the research involves no more than minimal risk. Likely risks involved in this research include psychological burden, such as due to the added time to participate in the program and stress in response to discussion about financial wellbeing topics. Other possible but unlikely risks include break of confidentiality. We minimize this risk by collecting as few identifiers as possible and using protocols to limit the likelihood of a breach, such as collecting data using the secure REDCap portal and separating the collection of identifiers in the eligibility survey with study data    Indicate which part of the consent process you are requesting be waived or altered and the rationale for requesting the waiver or alteration: ☒   I will obtain consent, but not participant’s signature.  1. Give the rationale for the request of a waiver of signed consent. Rational for requesting an alteration of consent to exclude the signature component is due to feasibility concerns. Participants will be recruited nationally, and will only interact with the researchers by phone, email, or Zoom.    2. Please describe how you will be documenting that a participant has consented. Verbal consent from the participant will be marked in the participant’s REDCap eligibility survey  3. Indicate if the subjects will be provided with written information about the study, and provide justification if you will not be providing a written explanation of the research. Participants will be emailed written information described during the telephone consent process    ☐    I will obtain consent, but request a waiver of some of the elements of consent                        (e.g. use of deception).  ☐    I will not obtain any consent, and I am requesting a full waiver of consent.

Click here to enter text.  12.0 Study Design/Procedures Directions:  1) Describe the overall study design (e.g.: single visit, single-blind, double-blind, non-randomized, randomized, blood draw, investigational drug, device etc.). 2) Provide a description of all study-related research procedures being performed, including the length of time involved.  3) Include procedures being performed to monitor research participants for safety or minimize risks.  4) Describe the source records including medical or educational records, which will be used to collect data about subjects. 5) Include a description of any device being used to collect data (e.g., eye tracker, step counter).  If the device itself is being studied, include additional information in Section 29. Overall. This study uses a single arm pre- and post-test design with three data collection points (baseline and two follow up) to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, acceptability, and feasibility of delivering an intervention to lower the out-of-pocket spending on caregiving for Latino caregivers to persons living with dementia. Data will be primarily collected using survey research methods, including “daily diary” methods (N=60). We also plan to collect qualitative semi-structured interviews with participants (N=15), as well as fidelity information about the delivery of the intervention. Participation will take approximately 10 weeks from baseline to completion.   Enrollment. Participants will enroll in the CONFIDENCE program using an Eventbrite link that will be shared as a part of regular services offered by the University of Southern California Family Caregiver Support Center. When a participant registers for the CONFIDENCE program, they will be asked if they are interested in participating in the research study. Participation in the research study is optional; caregivers do not need to enroll in the study to attend the program. If a caregiver indicated interest in this research, the research assistant or PI will reach out by phone and email (up to 4 contacts) to tell the caregiver more about the study and determine eligibility. The participant may choose to complete the eligibility form online or by phone. Even if the participant completes the eligibility form online, they will receive a follow up call to ensure they understand the study activities and verbally consent to participate.  Intervention. Enrolled participants will be asked to attend once weekly group-based sessions for the CONFIDENCE program by Zoom for 5 weeks. Each session will last approximately 1.5 hours each and will require participants to complete up to 1 hour of take-home activities per week. Each session will focus on a different topic (e.g., seeking community resources to displace out-of-pocket spending) meant to help caregivers displace out-of-pocket care costs and reduce financial strain. There are five sessions (5 weeks) total to the CONFIDENCE program. Sessions will be led by 2 facilitators with experience in caregiver intervention or else trained by someone with this experience. Up to 15 caregivers may register for each sessions, though we anticipate no more than 10 caregivers to attend each session due to absences.  Survey Administration. Enrolled study participants will receive a baseline survey up to 2 weeks prior to the first intervention session and will be asked to complete the survey within 7 days. The baseline survey will ask about spending on out-of-pocket care costs, financial strain, resourcefulness, self-efficacy, as well as information about the caregiving context and use of supports. It is anticipated this survey will take no more than 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Once the baseline survey is complete, participants will begin to receive daily surveys by phone or email, depending on their preferences. Daily surveys will ask about spending on caregiving that day and are to be completed from 7 pm to 11 pm each consecutive day for 5 days. These surveys will serve two purposes: 1) daily spending habits reported in surveys will be summarized and shared with back with participants as a part of the intervention and 2) data from surveys will be used to determine average daily spending, our primary outcome of interest. Daily spending surveys will take no more than 10 minutes to complete. We anticipate some participants will not meet the requested

timeline for the Baseline survey. If so, we will continue to allow them to participate in the study without complete they daily spending surveys, so long as the Baseline survey is completed prior to the first intervention session. This will enable us to still collect data about outcomes besides out-of-pocket costs of care. A follow up survey will be sent immediately after the participant completes the intervention (within 48 hours) and will also ask about participant satisfaction with CONFIDENCE. A second follow up survey will be sent 8 weeks after the intervention is complete. After the participant completes the second follow up survey, they will receive a second set of daily spending diaries administered in the same way as the first set of diaries. Follow up surveys are expected to take approximately 20 to 30 minutes to complete. Participants will receive up to 5 reminders to complete the baseline and follow up surveys, include 3 emails prompts and up to 2 phone calls. Participants will receive a text message reminder, if they choose, reminding them to complete daily spending surveys each night.  Qualitative interviews. Up to 15 participants will also be asked to participate in a one-on-one qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interview as well about their experiences with the program, which is expected to take approximately 45 minutes depending on how much the participant would like to share. Selection of interview participants will be based on purposeful sampling, with the goal of recruiting a qualitative sample that includes a range of care experiences according to participant gender, age, employment status, and kin relationship to the person to whom care is provided. Interviews will be completed over Zoom and recorded and later transcribed. Participants will be invited to complete this interview after completing the CONFIDENCE program. If the participant agrees to participate, they will receive a study information sheet by email prior to attending the interview and will review this information sheet before completing the interview.  Payment for surveys and qualitative interviews. Amazon gift cards will be sent to participants by email for each study activity (surveys and interviews). We will pay participants for the baseline and first set of diaries surveys within a week of when the first set of diaries are due. A second payment will be administered within a week of the first follow up survey being completed. The remaining payments will be sent the week of the second set of diary surveys are due/completed. Payment for interviews will be sent within 1 week of completing the interview. Participants may earn up to $125 for participating, or $150 if they complete the qualitative interview. Participants may earn $25 for each study activity.  Fidelity. Fidelity will be monitored by an observer (PI or research assistant) and the CONFIDENCE program facilitators. We will monitor one randomly selected CONFIDENCE lesson for each cohort. The selected lesson will be based on Stata’s random number generator. The facilitators will know in advance of each lesson if selected for monitoring so they may record lesson. The facilitator will be sent a survey within 24 hours of completing selected sessions to self-monitor delivery. Fidelity surveys will be sent by the PI using REDCap. Session recordings will be stored in the USC CONFIDENCE Office 365 Shared folder and deleted once fidelity forms are completed. The research assistant or PI will watch the recording and complete the fidelity survey within 2 weeks of the lesson taking place.  Attendance. The USC facilitator will monitor attendance at CONFIDENCE sessions and will store this information in a shared Office 365 folder. The study team will extract information about attendance from study participants from Excel files where attendance is marked and enter it into REDCap for study participants.  Comparison of registrant demographics and study participants. In addition to data collected from surveys, we will compare the demographic characteristics of individuals who register for CONCIDENCE to participate in the educational program alone with those of study participants. This information can help to inform future recruitment methods by helping the study team understand differences in the characteristics of those who choose to participate in research and those who do not. As a part of their funder’s requirements, USC must report on demographic characteristics of program participants to the sponsor. They currently collect this information using the Eventbrite registration page. The Case Western investigators will already have access to the Eventbrite form information to identify participants who are interested in participating in the research study. To compare the characteristics of study participants to non-study participants, we will download Excel files directly from Eventbrite onto an encrypted university Box folder, and add an indicator variable to indicate whether or not individual registrants were in the research study. Once this occurs, all identifiable information will be removed from Excel files and the file will be saved so we can conduct analyses and compare characteristics of study and non-study participants.  Participant safety and monitoring adverse events. Adverse events. Adverse events and protocol deviations will be recorded on an adverse event form by the study team member (PI or RA) who first observes this event. Adverse events pertaining to participant safety and confidentiality will be promptly reported by the PI by phone. Where the RA or PI suspects risk of harm to self or others, this will be reported to USC PI Donna Benton, PhD, who is a licensed clinical psychologist with extensive experience working with caregivers. Dr. Benton is the director of the USC Family Caregiver Support Program where CONFIDENCE is being administered. She will reach out to the participant by phone to conduct further assessment and a safety plan. All protocol deviations and adverse events will be promptly reported to the Institutional Review Board by the PI. Serious adverse events will be reported within 24-hours. Data and Safety Monitoring.  The PI will complete a Data Safety Monitoring Report every 6 months of the study. The Data Safety Monitoring Report will include the following core elements: a) Progress towards enrollment and participant retention; b) Participant characteristics for enrolled and retained participants (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, gender, aspects of the caregiving situation) according to intervention status; and c) Documentation of adverse events, serious adverse events, and unanticipated problems, as defined below, including resolution of these events and study protocol modifications. This report will not contain any participant identifiers. This report will be shared with the USC PI for review.

 Sub-study (8/2023 Modification): To complete the sub-study objective, the research team will draw upon existing de-identified qualitative interview data from N=14 family caregivers collected by collaborators at USC. (An Exempt approval, information sheet, interview guide, and notice indicating no need for a DUA are attached.) We will conduct a content analysis of the types of expenditures covered by participants, wherein we will report the frequency with which each expense was described. This will be reported alongside baseline data that asks about out-of-pocket spending on caregiving collected in the parent study, including frequencies and estimated costs. These survey data were informed by responses collected during qualitative interviews, which helped the researchers to generate ideas about what to ask about in surveys. By reporting out on these data in tandem using a mixed methods approach, we can provide a holistic picture of what out-of-pocket spending on care looks like for Latino family caregivers.      13.0 Study Timeline (optional)

If applicable, provide a power analysis, and study/safety endpoints. Directions: Describe the data analysis plan, including any statistical procedures. If applicable, provide a power analysis, and study/safety endpoints Participant Demographic Characteristics Participant characteristics, including age, gender, race, ethnicity, educational attainment, income, employment status, kin relationship to recipient, length of time caregiving, hours of caregiving, and whether the care recipient and caregiver live together will be reported using frequencies, percentages, means, and standards of deviation. Comparison of Study and non-study participants. Demographic characteristics of study and non-study participants collected from Eventbrite will be compared using t-test and chi-squared bivariate analyses, as well as frequencies and percentages.  Outcome Measures Self-Efficacy (primary outcome). Self-efficacy is measured using the Caregiver Self-Efficacy Scale. This 8-item scale combines domains of self-efficacy (e.g., managing behavioral symptoms, accessing respite, and controlling upsetting thoughts. It demonstrates high reliability (alpha=0.89) and good test-retest reliability (0.73). Participants rate the extent to which they are “Not confident at all” (1) to “Totally confident” (10). Scores range from 8 (lowest) to 80 (highest).35  Resourcefulness (primary outcome). Resourcefulness is measured using the 19-item learned resourcefulness scale designed for family caregivers (alpha=0.81). This scale has two factors: one focused on help-seeking and another on self-help. Caregivers are asked the frequency at which they use different strategies to manage challenges, and may respond:  . Items are added together to create a total score. Scores range from 0 to 24. Permission was received by the scale’s author to use this tool on April 21, 2022.  Psychological Financial Strain (secondary outcome). Our measure for psychological financial strain is derived from multiple scales, which were selected according to relevance to our caregiving population. Items 1 to 11 ask about financial anxiety and is based on the 10-item scale from Shapiro & Burchell (2012).36  Item 1 is modified such that the question asks about feeling overwhelmed instead of bored. We also added an item based on another related to caregiving (i.e., “I find planning for my caregiving expenses to be unpleasant”). Items 12 to 14 are based on those used by Novilitis et al., (2003), and address additional components of financial anxiety than those items introduced by Shapiro (e.g., arguments with others; alpha=0.74).37 Lastly, we included the 1-item question from Shim et al. (2010) that asks about financial worry (“I worry constantly about money”; CFA factor loading was 0.79 for this item).38   Monthly Spending Report (out-of-pocket costs of caregiving, secondary outcome). Our measure for monthly out-of-pocket costs of caregiving is based on the tool used by the AARP Public Policy Institute in their 2016 report on the out-of-pocket costs of caregiving. We will calculate estimated daily costs using both period survey and daily survey. Period surveys (i.e., baseline and the second follow up surveys) ask about spending: in the last month (30 days) and in the last 12 months but not the last month. When a caregiver indicates paying for an item in the last month, they are asked to provide an estimated cost. (We do not ask about cost in the last year given the likelihood the participant will not be able to accurately recall this cost and may forget some expenses.) The costs for yearly/monthly item are those believed to occur irregularly, such as purchase of devices and rent payments. Daily costs are those anticipated to occur regularly, and are asked about on daily surveys, such as groceries and recreation items for the care recipient. To calculate monthly spending, we will multiply daily spending by 6 to approximate 30

days in a month and add all monthly expenses. While the measure is subject to recall bias and fluctuations in spending, it balances 1) the need to efficiently collect data and 2) reduces recall bias by relying on monthly recall alone.  Analysis of Baseline and Follow Up Measures We will used two sets of paired t-tests to examine changes in scores between baseline and follow up surveys. If we discover a p-value of <0.05 after running tests, this will indicate there was a statistically significant difference between scores. We will compare scores from baseline until the first follow up survey and from baseline until the second follow up survey. In addition, we will examine mean scores at each time point, as well as the standard of deviation for all summed scores on each scaled.   Handling of Missing Data Missing daily surveys. If participants miss a survey, we will adjust the monthly formula such that we will multiply according to the number of days for which surveys are completed to reach 30. For example, if a participant completed 4/5 surveys, we will multiply by 7.5 instead of 6. We will exclude participants who miss more than 2 daily surveys from analyses when examining monthly costs.   Missing data on follow up surveys. Although data from all participants will be reported in sample descriptives, for all analyses using t-tests, we will use a complete case analysis such that participants with any missing data will be removed from the analytic sample. Although this approach risks missing data bias, multiple imputation and maximum likelihood estimation are not feasible to conduct with bivariate analyses. We will conduct bivariate analyses using a “dummy” variable to identify potential differences between those with complete and incomplete data and will also report the extent of missingness using frequencies and percentages.  Satisfaction Surveys Satisfaction surveys, included in the first follow up survey sent to participants, will be used to examine participant satisfaction with the CONFIDENCE intervention. Participants will be asked about the program’s relevance to their care situation, quality of information presented, satisfaction delivery, and enjoyment of the program overall. Each question is asked as a statement to which participants can indicate the extent to which they agree on a 5-point Likert scale. To analyze scale items, we will provide a percentage of each response (e.g., 80% of caregivers “Agreed” or “Strongly Agreed” with this statement).  Fidelity Reports Fidelity reports will be evaluated using total scores averaged across all CONFIDENCE Lessons observed. We will be report these in aggregate and separated by facilitator and observer reports. We will divide reports by scores for adherence and quality. Scores will be reported using a percentage, as prior reports indicate 80% or more on fidelity scores indicates acceptable levels of fidelity. In addition—to examine variability in scores—we will also report this information using means and standards of deviation.  Qualitative Interviews Qualitative interviews will be transcribed verbatim and identifying information removed. For interviews conducted in Spanish, interviews will be translated by a native speaker. To conduct our thematic analysis, at least two members of the research team will read at least 2 transcripts and will decide on a preliminary codebook.39 The codebook will be applied to an interview and refined further prior to applying codes to the remaining interviews. At least two coders will analyze each transcript independently and will meet to compare codes and discuss differences in coding until agreements met. A second round of coding will be conducted to integrate new codes added during coding.  Statistical Power and Same Size Our goal is to recruit at least N=60 of these caregivers into a research study to test preliminary efficacy. This N supports our ability to detect a small to moderate effect size in a two-tailed t-test at alpha=0.05 at 80% power.    Sub-study (8/2023 Modification): To analyze data in the sub-study, we will conduct a content analysis of the types of expenditures covered by participants, wherein we will report the frequency with which each expense was described. At least two coders will independently review codes in NVivo 12; when there are disagreements over coding, an agreement will be reached through discussion. Data on out-of-pocket spending will be analyzed using frequencies

There is small risk that data confidentiality could be breached so that others outside the research team view private study information (e.g., participants’ income), though the study team will follow all study protocols to prevent this from occurring. It is also possible that other caregivers could share information they learn about others during the CONFIDENCE program. We will ask all participants to keep information shared during the program private.  Psychological discomfort. There is some risk of psychological discomfort, such as from discussing challenging with caregiving and the high costs of caregiving. The risk and impact of psychological discomfort will vary among participants. It is no more than what might be expected in caregiver education programs conducted outside of research.    2.

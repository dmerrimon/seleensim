Planned Sample 
Size 70 consecutive subjects at least 1-year post-index procedure 
Study Population Consecutive cohort of patients who have undergone a hiatal hernia repair between 1 Jul 2015 and 1 June 2016 
•A minimum  of three attempts to reach each subject in the cohort shall
be made 
Study Objectives Primary Objective 
Characterize the procedural and early post-operative safety profile of 
MIROMESH when used as reinforcement in hiatal hernia repair.   
Secondary Objectives 
Identify a consecutive cohort who may be tracked long term to identify survival 
of repair. Identify a consecutive cohort who may be  tracked long term to characterize 
mid- and long-term clinical outcomes. 
Identify a consecutive cohort who may be tracked long term to further 
characterize the safety profile over time. 
Study Design This will be a retrospective chart review to identify the appropriate cohort with 
a prospective follow-up survey to acquire  safety and outcome information.

Informed Consent All subjects will be required to give verbal consent, via the telephone interview, for participation in this study.  Subjects will be informed that they were chosen 
   
15 Mar 2017 Page 3 of 3 CONFIDENTIAL based on the procedure and mesh they received. They will be informed that 
historical data regarding their pathology and procedure will be gathered and 
that they will be asked several questions about their current health.  They will be informed that, except for, informat ion used to determine age and date of 
surgery, no protected health information will be used.  Subjects that elect to 
participate will be informed that they will receive a copy of the verbal informed consent.  Investigator will mail a copy of the cons ent script to all subjects who elect to 
participate in this study. 
Ethical 
Considerations This Study Proposal Summary will be revi ewed by an accredited institutional 
review board and will not be initiated until written approval has been received. 
Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics including but not limited to mean, standard deviation, 
frequency and percentages will be used  to describe demographics, medical 
history, and characterize baseline variable as appropriate. Inferential statistics will be used to describe changes in variable over time.

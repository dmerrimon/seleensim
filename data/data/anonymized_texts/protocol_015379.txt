Sneller, MD Sample Size: N= 30  Accrual Ceiling: 45 Study Population:  HIV-infected adults 18-65 years of age on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with suppressed viremia Accrual Period:  18 months Study Design:  An exploratory, open-label, single-arm study of VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01) in subjects with chronic HIV infection undergoing analytical treatment interruption  Study Duration:  2 years (June 2015 to June 2017) Study Agent/    Intervention Description: HIVMAB060-00-AB (VRC01), 40 mg/kg  Primary Objective:  To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01 in study subjects following discontinuation of cART  Secondary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of VRC01 as determined by its effect on plasma viral rebound following discontinuation of cART  Exploratory Objectives: • To examine the capacity of other antibodies (i.e., 3BNC117) that bind to CD4 binding site on gp120 to neutralize VRC01-escape mutants ex vivo; • To investigate whether VRC01-mediated suppression of HIV replication in the absence of cART allows the development of anti-HIV immunity (i.e., cytotoxic T lymphocyte response) in infected individuals who began therapy during the chronic phase of infection; • To evaluate B cell responses to rebounding HIV upon discontinuation of cART; • To examine the relationship between the size of persistent HIV

 10 PRÉCIS Recent advances in antibody cloning technologies have led to the discovery of a number of highly potent, HIV-specific, broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies from B cells of HIV-infected individuals. It has been shown that certain broadly neutralizing HIV-specific antibodies can prevent acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, delay and/or prevent plasma viral rebound following treatment interruption in Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected animals and block cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro. However, it is unclear what in vivo effects these antibodies might have on plasma viral rebound in HIV-infected individuals following discontinuation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).   In this regard, it has been shown that virtually all infected individuals who initiated cART during the chronic phase of infection experience plasma viral rebound upon cessation of therapy. Current research on the treatment of HIV-infected individuals has been heavily focused on developing strategies aimed at achieving sustained virologic remission in the absence of cART. Thus, it is of great interest to investigate whether a potent HIV-specific monoclonal antibody, such as VRC01, can prevent plasma viral rebound in infected individuals upon discontinuation of cART. We propose to examine the effect of VRC01 on plasma viral rebound in HIV-infected individuals following analytical treatment interruption (ATI).  
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 11 1  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  1.1 Background Information Prolonged suppression of plasma viremia is now achievable in the majority of HIV-infected individuals receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Consequently, cART has dramatically improved the clinical outcome of infected individuals. However, complete eradication of HIV has not been possible using cART alone and plasma viremia rapidly rebounds in virtually all chronically HIV-infected individuals upon cessation of therapy(1). Multiple studies have demonstrated that HIV persists in latently infected, resting CD4+ T cells of virtually all infected individuals receiving clinically effective doses of cART(2-4). The inability of cART to eradicate HIV is likely due to the persistence of infectious virus in CD4+ T cells and possibly, other cell types(1).  Despite the success of cART in suppressing HIV replication and plasma viremia, the burden of taking daily medication for life, long-term toxicity of cART regimens, and resistance to antiretroviral drugs, necessitates a continued search for effective alternatives for the control of HIV infection. Consequently, a major thrust of HIV research over the past several years has been to develop therapeutic strategies that can control HIV replication in the absence of cART. One such strategy is passive immunization with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against HIV.  Research directed at potential pathways towards the development of an effective HIV vaccine has provided insights into the nature of the immune response to HIV infection(5, 6). Recent advances in antibody cloning technologies and B cell biology have led to the discovery of several highly potent and broadly neutralizing mAbs against HIV produced by B cells of some HIV-infected individuals(7-9). Several studies have demonstrated that certain broadly neutralizing HIV-specific mAbs can prevent acquisition of the virus, suppress viral replication, prevent plasma viral rebound following treatment interruption in infected animals(10-12), and block cell-to-cell transmission of laboratory-adapted HIV in vitro(13). However, it is unclear what in vivo effects these antibodies might have on HIV-infected humans.   The rebound of HIV plasma viremia observed in infected individuals following withdrawal of suppressive cART occurs as a result of at least two phenomenon: the emergence of virus from the persistent viral reservoir and the spread of virus to neighboring bystander CD4+ T cells. Broadly neutralizing mAbs such as VRC01 can potentially inhibit these events by several mechanisms including: directly binding and neutralizing infectivity of emerging HIV; blocking cell-to-cell spread of HIV; facilitating the clearance of plasma virus via formation of immune complexes; and clearance of HIV-infected cells through initiation of cellular effector responses. Of note, a recent study has demonstrated that several HIV-specific mAbs (including VRC01) inhibited entry into CD4+ T cells of HIV isolated from the latent viral reservoir of infected individuals whose plasma viremia was well controlled by cART(14). Based on these observations, and considering the possibility of biochemical modification to extend serum half-lives of HIV-specific antibodies, it is conceivable that infrequent administration of one or more of such mAbs could result in the maintenance of suppressed plasma viremia in the absence of cART. Thus, it is of interest to investigate whether a potent HIV-specific mAb, such as VRC01, can prevent plasma viral rebound in infected individuals upon discontinuation of cART.

 13 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on Day 9. By Day 30, AST values had returned to normal, and ALP values were returning to normal.      Other than red discoloration of the administration site in one male in the SC group on Day 9, there were no other gross necropsy observations attributable to VRC01 administration. There were no histopathology findings that were considered related to IV administration of VRC01. However, histopathology evaluation revealed subacute inflammation at the SC injection site on Day 9, one day after injection, in all 10 SC administered rats; dermal inflammation was usually minimal or mild while SC inflammation was usually mild, moderate, or marked. By Day 30, this inflammation had completely resolved, and the SC dose site was normal in all rats.    A “no observed effect level” (NOEL) was not determined in this study because transient elevations of AST and ALP were observed on Day 9 after IV administration and transient inflammation at the dose site was observed on Day 9 after SC administration. Because the elevated AST and ALP levels were transient and minor and did not correlate with histopathology findings, the “no observed adverse effect level” (NOAEL) for VRC01 by the IV route of administration in rats was 400 mg/kg, the highest dose used in this study. The systemic NOAEL for the SC route of administration of VRC01 in rats was 40 mg/kg, the only SC dose level examined in this study.  For the PK analysis, a separate cohort of rats received VRC01 on Day 1 at 4 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg by the IV route of administration and at 40 mg/kg by the SC route of administration.  VRC01 levels in serum were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). VRC01 administration by the IV route resulted in dose-proportional exposure.  The terminal elimination phase half-life (t1/2) was about 10 days, with clearance of approximately 20 ml/day/kg and volume of distribution that was about 0.28 l/kg.   Nonhuman Primate Studies of VRC01 Several non-GLP studies of VRC01 have been completed in nonhuman primates (NHP) as pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies for prevention or treatment of HIV infection. Table 1 is a brief summary of the studies performed and supports the plan to evaluate up to 40 mg/kg dose administered IV as a dose range of potential interest.  Refer to the IB for additional information about these studies.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 15 All three studies followed their respective dose escalation plans and reached the 40 mg/kg IV administration dose level without the occurrence of any safety pauses or SAEs.  As of January 9, 2015, 87 subjects received one or more study product administrations, including 21 in VRC 601; 28 in VRC 602; and, 38 in HVTN 104. Of the 87 subjects who began study product administration, the schedule completion status is as follows:  • 9 subjects, on a one dose schedule, completed one dose; • 40 subjects, on a two dose schedule: 37 received two doses, 3 discontinued after one dose; and, • 38 subjects in HVTN 104, on multi-dose schedules: 36 continuing, 2 discontinued after two doses.  • Of the 5 subjects discontinued from study product administration, reasons were as follows: o 1 lost to follow-up; o 1 unable to comply with the study schedule; o 1 unrelated adverse event (Streptococcal pharyngitis) that precluded timely administration; and, o Related adverse events (mild generalized rash; mild chest discomfort).  Cumulatively, across VRC 601 and VRC 602 studies, there were 86 product administrations as follows: • 6 administrations at 1 mg/kg IV; • 16 administrations at 5 mg/kg IV; • 19 administrations at 20 mg/kg IV; • 21 administrations at 40 mg/kg IV; • 15 administrations at 5 mg/kg SC; and • 9 administrations of placebo SC.  Cumulatively, in the HVTN 104 study, there were 138 product administrations as follows: • 17 administrations at 20 mg/kg IV (Group 1: 10 as 2nd dose; 5 as 3rd dose; 2 as 4th dose); • 29 administrations at 40 mg/kg IV (Group 1: 12 as 1st dose; Group 2: 11 as 1st dose and 6 as 2nd dose); • 15 administrations of either VRC01 at 40 mg/kg IV or placebo IV (Group 3 1st dose); and, • 77 administrations of either VRC01 at 5 mg/kg SC or placebo SC (Group 3: 15 as 2nd dose; 13 as 3rd dose; 13 as 4th dose; 13 as 5th dose; 12 as 6th dose; 7 as 7th dose; 4 as 8th dose).  The PK parameters of passively administered VRC01 to date have been evaluated in a limited number of healthy adults and in HIV-infected adults. The PK results as of May 2014 with these two populations of adults are provided in the IB and are preliminary. The results indicate that PK parameters are comparable in these two adult populations. When administered IV at 20 mg/kg (n=5) or 40 mg/kg (n=4), the mean (+ SD) maximum serum concentration were 870 + 197 and 1611 + 258 mg/L following the first dose, respectively. The elimination half-life was similar in healthy and HIV-infected adults with an overall mean value of 14.6 + 4.8 days following 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg doses. In healthy adults at 20 mg/kg IV (n=3) and 40 mg/kg IV (n=4), mean 
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 16 28 day trough serum concentrations were approximately 32.7 + 9.1 and 60.6 + 20.1 mg/L, respectively, after the first administration.  At 28 days after the second IV administration, the mean VRC01 serum levels were 40.6 + 10.7 and 102.6 + 48.8 mg/L. The clearance of VRC01 in healthy adults is estimated to be 466 + 118 mL per day following IV administration of 5-40 mg/kg (n=11) on the basis of these interim data.  An interim analysis of the VRC 601 viral load data obtained from 7 viremic adults through March 18, 2015 shows that VRC01 has a statistically significant in vivo virological effect on HIV viral load when administered as a single 40 mg/kg IV dose.  None of these adults were taking cART when enrolled into the study and had not started cART through the time periods used in this viral load analysis.  Five of the seven adult subjects had ≥1 log10 copies/mL decrease in viral load, while two subjects had viral load decreases of 0.26 and 0.18 log10 copies/mL, respectively. These interim data indicate the following for a single dose of VRC01 at 40 mg/kg IV: • A statistically significant change from baseline viral load post-infusion days 5 through 9 and on day 14;  • The median time to reach ≥0.5 log10 decrease in viral load is 5 days; and, • The median time to greatest decrease in viral load is 7 days. A 0.5 log10 copies/mL or greater decrease in viral load is considered to be a positive response to ART.  To have clinical benefit, such a change would need to be sustained.  In VRC 601, subjects were administered only one dose of VRC01 at 40 mg/kg and, thus, a sustained effect on viral load was not expected.  However, the interim data indicate that the established benchmarks can be obtained and support the hypothesis that a schedule with repetitive dosing may have a beneficial clinical effect.   1.2 Rationale The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01 in study subjects following discontinuation of cART, and to evaluate the efficacy of VRC01 as determined by its effect on plasma viral rebound following discontinuation of cART. Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this open-label, single-arm study. Only study participants on cART with documented suppression of viremia for ≥ 3 years are eligible to participate.   The rationale for using the proposed dose of VRC01 is based on the safety and pharmacokinetic data generated from VRC 601 and 602 as well as pre-clinical NHP studies (Table 1).    Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI) Various assays measuring HIV-specific immune responses and the frequency of CD4 cells carrying infectious HIV have been used to assess efficacy of immune-based therapies. To date, none of the assays are clinically validated to predict actual antiviral efficacy. Thus, ATI has been used to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of immune-based therapies by testing the ability of these interventions to blunt or prevent the viral rebound that occurs following interruption of cART. The use of ATI in the design of this study is the only way to determine if administration of VRC01 results in clinically significant antiviral activity, as evidenced by a blunted or absent plasma viral rebound following ATI. We feel that a 24-week ATI, with frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring along with strict criteria for re-initiation of cART, is a safe and acceptable strategy to evaluate the efficacy of VRC01 in this population of HIV-infected adults. This is supported by the results from current and prior therapeutic vaccine studies using ATI (15-18), as well as a recent subgroup analysis of the SMART study (19).  Given that essentially all HIV-infected individuals 
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 17 treated during the chronic phase of HIV infection will experience rebound in plasma viremia following cessation of cART (20, 21), a placebo control group is not necessary to evaluate the potential antiviral efficacy of VRC01 in this early phase study.   2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  2.1 Primary Objective To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01 in study subjects following discontinuation of cART.  2.2 Secondary Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of VRC01 as determined by its effect on plasma viral rebound following discontinuation of cART. 2.3 Exploratory Objectives • To investigate whether plasma viral rebound can be prevented or delayed by VRC01 in infected individuals carrying HIV/viral reservoir that does not react to VRC01. • To examine the capacity of other antibodies (i.e., 3BNC117) that bind to CD4 binding site on gp120 to neutralize VRC01-escape mutants ex vivo. • To investigate whether VRC01-mediated suppression of HIV replication in the absence of cART allows the development of anti-HIV immunity (i.e., CTL response) in infected individuals who began therapy during the chronic phase of infection. • To evaluate B cell responses to rebounding HIV upon discontinuation of cART. • To examine the relationship between the size of persistent HIV reservoir and kinetics and timing of plasma viral rebound following ATI.  3 STUDY DESIGN  3.1 Description of the Study Design The proposed trial will be a single-arm, open-label study to examine the effect of VRC01 on plasma viral rebound in HIV-infected individuals following an analytical treatment interruption (ATI). Thirty HIV-infected individuals who initiated cART during the chronic phase of infection will be studied. All study participants will receive infusions of VRC01 (40mg/kg) at study days 0, Week 2, Week 4, and every four weeks thereafter for up to 24 weeks (Figure 1).   Analytical treatment interruption After study day 3, all subjects will undergo an ATI to determine if treatment with VRC01 can prevent rebound of plasma viremia. Individuals taking non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) will switch to a protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor-based regimen 2 weeks prior to enrollment to ensure that the washout period of antiretroviral agents is roughly equal.     All subjects with detectable viremia at Week 28 will be instructed to restart cART. Subjects will also be instructed to restart cART if they meet any of the following criteria during the ATI:  • A confirmed >30% decline in baseline CD4 cell count or an absolute CD4 cell count <350 cells/mm3 that is associated with a HIV RNA level >40 copies/ml.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 19 1. Age 18-65 years old. 2. HIV-1 infection and clinically stable. 3. In general good health and with an identified primary health care provider for medical management of HIV infection and willing to maintain a relationship with a primary health care provider for medical management of HIV infection while participating in the study. 4. CD4+ cell count >450 cells/mm3 at screening. 5. Documentation of continuous cART treatment with suppression of plasma viral level below the limit of detection for ≥3 years. Subjects with “blips” (i.e., detectable viral levels on cART) prior to screening may be included provided they satisfy the following criteria:  a. The blips are <400 copies/mL, and  b. Succeeding viral levels return to levels below the limit of detection on subsequent testing. 6. Willingness to undergo ATI. 7. Laboratory values within pre-defined limits at screening:  a. Absolute neutrophil count >1,000/mm3. b. Hemoglobin levels >10.0 g/dL for men and >9.0 g/dL for women. c. Platelet count >100,000/mm3.  d. Prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) <1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN). e. Estimated or a measured creatinine clearance rate of ≥50 mL/min as determined by the NIH Clinical Center laboratory.  f. AST and ALT levels of <2.5 x ULN. 8. Willingness to have samples stored for future research.   Reproductive Risks   Contraception: The effects of VRC01 on the developing human fetus are unknown.  For this reason, men and women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate pregnancy prevention per the investigator.  This includes highly reliable established lifestyle of complete abstinence of potentially reproductive sexual activity, or use of BOTH a long term hormonal or barrier (e.g. implant, depot injection, IUD in female participant or female partner of participant) method of contraception that is fully effective prior to dosing, COMBINED WITH a barrier method (male or female condom) for all potentially reproductive sexual activity.  Pregnancy prevention must be maintained as effective and practiced continuously for the duration of study participation.  Females of childbearing-age must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to receiving VRC01.  During the course of the study, if a female participant, or the partner of a male participant suspects or in fact becomes pregnant, the effected participant should inform the study staff immediately, as well as the woman’s primary care physician.  Subjects must use safe sex practices during the trial, and particularly during the ATI phase, when risk of transmission of HIV may be increased. 4.3 Subject Exclusion Criteria

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 21 VRC01 vials are filled at 2.25± 0.1 mL/vial in 3 mL glass vials at a concentration of 100 (±10) mg/mL. Vials contain a clear, colorless to yellow liquid with no visible particles, which is an isotonic, sterile solution.  The formulation buffer is composed of 25 mM sodium citrate, 50 mM sodium chloride, and 150 mM L-arginine hydrochloride at pH 5.8.  Vials are intended for single use only and thus do not contain a preservative.   In calculating the dose to administer and number of vials to thaw, it should be assumed that the concentration is 100 mg/mL and that a volume of about 2 mL can be withdrawn from a vial.  Preparation of VRC01 for IV administration will require a 100 mL bag of 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP (normal saline).  Note that the normal saline bags referred to as “100 mL bags” in the IV administration instructions will typically have 103 mL volume before any VRC01 is added and this is acceptable in the context of the instructions below.   Study agent vials will be individually labeled with the name of the material, volume, lot number, concentration, storage instructions, Investigational Use Statement (“Limited by Federal Law to Investigational Use”), and manufacturer information.  5.2 Study Agent Storage and Stability  The product label designates the long-term storage temperature as -35°C to -15°C. Clinical site storage in a qualified, continuously monitored, temperature-controlled freezer at -45°C to -10°C is acceptable.    The site pharmacist must promptly report any storage temperature deviations outside of the normal allowance for the storage device to the PI and the IND Sponsor. The product must be quarantined in a separate area.  The IND Sponsor’s authorized representative will notify the site pharmacist if continued clinical use of the product is acceptable.  5.3 Preparation, Administration, and Dosage of Study Agent Results from a stability study conducted with VRC01 show that the product is stable in the vial for 8 hours at refrigerated and room temperature.  The following instructions apply to preparing the product for infusion: • Thaw the vial(s) containing VRC01 at ambient temperature (15°C to 25°C). • Keep the material at refrigerated or room temperature during the entire preparation period until use.  Preparation is to be done in a clean preparation unit with limited access.  Assure that only the required vials are present in the preparation unit during dilution, and medication labels are strictly segregated to avoid mix-ups.  It is expected that each vial will be used for about 2 mL withdrawal volume (200 mg VRC01); however, more may be withdrawn if it is possible to do so.  For each IV infusion order, the subject’s weight and dose level will be included in the pharmacy order.  The IV bag prepared by the pharmacy will include information regarding the total amount (mg) of VRC01 added to the 103 mL normal saline bag and the final volume of the bag.  The nurse responsible for administration and another clinician will each check the bag label and confirm that the identifier is correct and that the correct total milligrams to be administered is shown based on subject weight and dosage level before beginning the IV administration.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 23 5.5 Prohibited Medications and Procedures  Treatment with immunosuppressive medications during the study is prohibited. Prohibited immunosuppressive medications do not include [1] corticosteroid nasal spray or inhaler; [2] topical corticosteroids for mild, uncomplicated dermatitis; or [3] oral/parenteral corticosteroids given for non-chronic conditions not expected to recur ̵length of therapy ≤10 days.  6 STUDY SCHEDULE For all the study visits, unless otherwise specified, subjects will come to the NIH Clinical Center to undergo the procedures. Unless otherwise specified, the visit window for the post-entry study visits is ± 5 days.  6.1 Screening  Screening may occur over the course of several contacts/visits. All inclusion and exclusion criteria must be assessed within 8 weeks before enrollment, unless otherwise specified in the eligibility criteria.   After signing informed consent, subjects will undergo the following procedures: • Medical history and a targeted physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a symptom-directed evaluation based on symptoms or complaints reported by each participant • Assessment of concomitant medications  • Blood collection for:  o HBsAg and Hepatitis C antibody serology o Anti-HIV antibody test. Subjects with previous confirmed Anti-HIV serology from the NIH will not have this repeated. o Complete blood count (CBC) with differential, PT, activated PTT o Chemistry panel to include: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, total and direct bilirubin, and serum albumin levels o Flow cytometry panel (includes CD4+ cell count) o Plasma HIV and HCV viral RNA levels • Storage of serum and plasma (if needed for repeat HIV antibody testing or viral RNA levels) • Urinalysis • Serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential   • Electrocardiogram (ECG)   6.2 Enrollment/Baseline The enrollment visit may take place over 2 visits to accommodate the baseline pre-treatment apheresis procedure. The first dose of VRC01 will be administered at this visit, and enrollment is defined as the day of receipt of the first dose of VRC01.   Subjects will undergo the following procedures (prior to the first dose of study drug): • Medical history and a targeted physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a symptom-directed evaluation based on symptoms or complaints reported by each participant • Assessment of concomitant medications  • HIV transmission risk behavior assessment and counseling 
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 24 • Leukapheresis for research studies  • Blood collection for: o Flow cytometry panel (includes CD4+ cell count) o Plasma HIV viral RNA levels o HLA typing (if not already on file)  o Storage of plasma, serum and PBMCs o CBC with differential o Chemistry panels, to include: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, total and direct bilirubin, and serum albumin levels • Serum or urine pregnancy test (for women of child-bearing potential-obtained within 24 hours prior to infusion)  6.3 Study Phase Treatment Phase Subjects will be administered VRC01 on study day 0. All subjects will discontinue their cART regimen after study day 3. Subsequent infusions of VRC01 will occur at study Week 2, 4, and every four weeks thereafter until study Week 24 for a total of 8 doses (see Figure 1).    Storage of plasma, cells, and plasma HIV viremia will be done at study day 3, Week 1, 2, 3, and 4 and every 2 weeks thereafter for the duration of the ATI. Flow cytometry with CD4 count will be done every 2 weeks for the duration of the ATI.  At infusion visits (study Week 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24), the following will be done in addition to the plasma HIV viral load: • Medical history and a targeted physical examination, including weight, vital signs, and a symptom-directed evaluation based on symptoms or complaints reported by each participant • Assessment of concomitant medications  • Assessment of any new or unresolved AEs/intercurrent illnesses • Blood collection (Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24): o CBC with differential o Chemistry panels, to include: ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, CPK, total and direct bilirubin, and serum albumin levels • Serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (results must be reviewed prior to infusion)   • Serum for storage (except for Week 2) • Optional leukapheresis for research studies will be done within 14 days after the week 24 infusion  • HIV transmission risk behavior assessment and counseling  If a subject develops one or more criteria for ending ATI prior to Week 24, he/she will be asked to return for assessment and confirmation of the laboratory/clinical abnormality. If the criteria for ending ATI are met, no further VRC01 infusions will be given; the subject will be instructed to restart cART and continue to be followed for 24 weeks after the last VRC01 infusion. He/she will undergo the schedule of procedures described in Section 6.4.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 26 Other research evaluations measuring the effect of VRC01 on the HIV pathogenesis may include: • Frequency of CD4+ T cells carrying HIV proviral DNA and cell-associated HIV RNA •  Frequency of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells • T-cell activation and soluble markers of inflammation • Residual (1-40 copies/mL) plasma viremia   8 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 8.1 Potential Risks General Risks of MAb Treatment  Administration of mAb may have a risk of immune reactions such as acute anaphylaxis, serum sickness and the generation of antibodies; however, these reactions are rare and more often associated with mAb targeted to human proteins or with the use of chimeric murine monoclonal antibodies, which would have a risk of human anti-mouse antibodies.  In this regard, as VRC01 is targeted to a viral antigen and is a human monoclonal antibody, it is expected to have a low risk of such side effects.   Typically, the side effects of mAbs are mild but may include fever, chills, rigors, nausea, vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, bronchospasm, hypotension, hypertension, pruritus, rash, urticaria, angioedema, diarrhea, tachycardia or chest pain. Most infusion-related events occur within the first 24 hours after beginning administration.  Severe reactions, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and hypoxia, are infrequent and more often associated with mAbs targeted to human proteins or when a nonhuman mAb, such as a chimeric murine mAb, is used.   Delayed allergic reactions to a mAb may include a serum sickness type of reaction, which is characterized by urticaria, fever, lymph node enlargement, and joint pains. These symptoms may not appear until several days after the exposure to the mAb and is noted to be more common with chimeric types of mAbs.  As indicated in Section 1.1.3, no signficant (>Grade 1) adverse events related to VRCO1 have been seen to date in the two ongoing human trials.  Analytical treatment interruption  The risks from a 24-week ATI performed under close virologic and immunological monitoring are minimal in this subject population. There is a theoretical risk that ATI could lead to the development of HIV drug resistance. This may be a particular concern for individuals taking NNRTIs. However, this potential risk with NNRTIs is essentially eliminated by undertaking the procedures described in Section 3.1(22).  Given the study population, the short duration of the ATI, the frequency of immunological and virologic monitoring, and strict criteria for restarting cART, it is extremely unlikely that the ATI will lead to the development of any opportunistic infections or AIDS-defining conditions.  During the ATI phase, subjects may transmit HIV infection if they do not adhere to safe sex practices. 
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 27  Phlebotomy/Insertion of IV Catheter  This may be associated with discomfort, bruising, local hematoma formation and, on rare occasions, infections, lightheadedness, and fainting.   The amount of blood drawn for research purposes will be within the limits allowed for adult subjects by the NIH Clinical Center (Medical Administrative Policy 95-9: Guidelines for Limits of Blood Drawn for Research Purposes in the Clinical Center: http://cc-internal.cc.nih.gov/policies/PDF/M95-9.pdf).  HLA typing Some HLA types have been associated with an increased risk of certain diseases like arthritis and other rheumatologic disorders, or a faster progression to AIDS. HLA typing will be performed on samples collected from all the enrolled subjects. Results from the HLA typing will become part of each subject’s medical record at NIH. Medical records containing this information are maintained in a secure place.  8.2 Potential Benefits Study subjects will not receive direct health benefit from study participation or study infusions. Others may benefit from knowledge gained in this study that may aid in the development better HIV treatments.  9 RESEARCH USE OF STORED HUMAN SAMPLES, SPECIMENS OR DATA • Intended Use: Stored blood samples and data collected under this protocol may be used to study the effect of VRC01 on the virologic and immunologic parameters listed in Section 7.2.1.  Samples may also be used to study other aspects of the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection or measure serum levels of antiretroviral agents during ATI.  • Storage:  Access to stored samples will be limited using a locked room or a locked freezer. Samples and data will be stored using codes assigned by the investigators. Data will be kept in password-protected computers. Only investigators will have access to the samples and data. • Tracking: Samples will be tracked utilizing the repository operated by Leidos Biomedical, Inc. Data will be stored and maintained in the NIAID CRIMSON database. • Disposition at the Completion of the Protocol: At the completion of the protocol (termination), samples and data will either be destroyed, or after Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, transferred to another existing protocol.  • Reporting the Loss or Destruction of Samples/Specimens/Data to the IRB: o Any loss or unanticipated destruction of samples or data (for example, due to freezer malfunction) that meets the definition of Protocol Deviation and/or compromises the scientific integrity of the data collected for the study, will be reported to the NIAID IRB.  o Additionally, subjects may decide at any point not to have their samples stored.  In this case, the principal investigator will destroy all known remaining samples and report what was done to both the subject and to the IRB.  This decision will not affect the subject’s participation in this protocol or any other protocols at NIH. 
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 28 10 REMUNERATION PLAN FOR SUBJECTS  Eligible subjects will be compensated for travel according to the NIAID/NIH travel policy. Subjects will receive financial compensation for time and inconvenience according to the NIH Clinical Center volunteer guidelines: screening ($50), leukapheresis ($200 for a 2-pass leukapheresis procedure), research blood draw ($40), clinic visits ($30), VRC01 infusion ($80).  If subject does not qualify or declines leukapheresis, an additional 80 mL research blood will be drawn and subject may be compensated an additional $25 for inconvenience.  11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 11.1 Definitions  Adverse event (AE)  An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (e.g., abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not considered related to the research.  Adverse reaction (AR)   An adverse reaction is an AE that is caused by an investigational agent (drug or biologic).  Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) An adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the investigational agent caused the adverse event. ‘Reasonable possibility’ means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction which implies a high degree of certainty  Serious adverse event (SAE) A Serious Adverse Event is an AE that results in one or more of the following outcomes: • death • a life-threatening (i.e., an immediate threat to life) event • an inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization • a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions • a congenital anomaly/birth defect • a medically important event* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but they may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.   Unexpected adverse event An AE is unexpected if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package  Insert (for marketed products), or it is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed. It is the responsibility of the IND sponsor to make this determination.  Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction (SUSAR)  A SUSAR is a Suspected Adverse Reaction that is both Serious and Unexpected.   
Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 29  Unanticipated problem (UP)  An unanticipated problem is an event, incident, experience, or outcome that is   1. unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency in relation to a. the research risks that are described in the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; Investigator’s Brochure, or other study documents; and b. the characteristics of the subject population being studied; and 2. possibly, probably, or definitely related to participation in the research; and 3. places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized (per the IND sponsor, an AE with a serious outcome will be considered increased risk).  Unanticipated problem that is not an adverse event (UPnonAE)  An unanticipated problem that does not fit the definition of an adverse event, but which may, in the opinion of the investigator, involve risk to the subject, affect others in the research study, or significantly impact the integrity of research data. Such events would be considered a non-serious UP. For example, we will report occurrences of breaches of confidentiality, accidental destruction of study records, or unaccounted-for study drug. 11.2 Documenting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events All AEs occurring from the time of first dose of VRC01 through the specified study follow-up period (24 weeks after final VRC01 dose) will be documented, recorded, and reported.  At each contact with the subject, information regarding AEs will be elicited by appropriate questioning and examinations and will be: • immediately documented in the subject’s medical record/source document, • recorded in Crimson, and • reported as outlined below (e.g., IND Sponsor, Institutional Review Board [IRB], and Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  If a diagnosis is clinically evident (or subsequently determined), the diagnosis rather than the individual signs and symptoms or lab abnormalities will be recorded as the AE.   All abnormal laboratory findings will be reviewed on a routine bases by the PI to identify potential safety signals. An abnormal lab not included on the toxicity table should be assessed in a similar fashion to the criteria above. 11.3 Investigator Assessment of Adverse Events The Investigator will assess all AEs with respect to Seriousness (criteria listed above), Severity (intensity or grade), and Causality (relationship to study agent and relationship to research) according to the following guidelines.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 37  Table 3: Chance of AE of Given Probability 0.025 0.050 0.075 0.100 0.125 0.150 0.532 0.785 0.904 0.958 0.982 0.992  The second row is the probability of observing at least one adverse event of probability given in the first row.  With 30 patients, the approximate width of a 95% confidence interval for the probability of rebound is ±0.18.  For example, if half of the 30 patients rebound, the approximate confidence interval will be 0.50±0.18=(0.32,0.68). Exact 95% confidence intervals for different observed numbers of rebounders among 30 patients are shown in Table 4.  For example, if 10 out of 30 patients rebound, the exact 95% confidence interval for the rebound probability will be (0.173,0.528).    Table 4: Confidence Intervals For Rebound Probability 0 5 10 15 20 0-0.116 0.056-0.347 0.173-0.528 0.313-0.687 0.472-0.827  The second row gives exact 95% confidence intervals for rebound probability given the observed number of rebounders in row 1 among the 30 patients.  Futility guidelines (Table 5) are based on the numbers of patients meeting virologic criteria to restart cART within the first 12 weeks of the study. We use Bayesian methodology whereby we quantify our prior opinion about the 42 day probability with monoclonal antibodies as roughly equivalent to having observed 4 people, 2 of whom meet virologic criteria to restart cART by 12 weeks . This translates to a beta (2,2) prior distribution for p, the probability of meeting virologic critera of failure by 12 weeks. Futility is declared if the posterior probability that p exceeds 0.70, given the observed results, is 90% or greater.         Table 5: Futility Guidelines 10 12 16 19 22 10 13 18 22 26  Row 2 shows the number of patients evaluated; futility is declared if the number meeting virologic criteria to restart by 12 weeks is at least as large as the number shown in row 1. That is, the futility boundary is crossed if the first 10 patients rebound by 12 weeks, or at least 12 of the first 13 meet virologic criteria by 12 weeks or at least 16 of the first 18 rebound by 12 weeks , etc.    The probabilities of crossing this futility boundary are shown in Table 6 for different true 12 week probabilities.

Protocol Version 4.0 3-Feb-2017   
 39 The investigator obtaining consent will document the consent process in the participant’s medical record (CRIMSON), including the name of the interpreter. Further, all instances of use of the CC Short Written Consent Form will be reported to the IRB at the time of annual review. If the CC Short Written Consent Form is used three times or more for the same language, this will be reported to the IRB immediately.  Illiterate English Speaking Participants As the majority of the patient populations from which the study participants are drawn are literate, written consent will typically be provided.  However, this population does have a small rate of illiteracy, and oral consent will be obtained for illiterate participants as consistent with NIH MAS Policy M77-2 without separate IRB approval for each specific use. At Continuing Reviews, the NIAID IRB will be informed of the number of illiterate participants who provided consent verbally. 14.2 Subject Confidentiality All records will be kept confidential to the extent provided by federal, state and local law. The study monitors and other authorized representatives of the Sponsor may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the Investigator, including but not limited to, medical records.  Records will be kept locked and all computer entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers only.  Clinical information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by IRB, NIAID, OHRP, or the sponsor’s designee.  15 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 15.1 Data Capture and Management  Study data will be maintained in CRIMSON and collected directly from subjects during study visits and telephone calls, or will be abstracted from subjects’ medical records. Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and records necessary to confirm the data abstracted for this study. Data entry into CRIMSON will be performed by authorized individuals.  Corrections to CRIMSON shall be tracked electronically with time, date, individual making the correction, and what was changed.  The investigator is responsible for assuring that the data collected are complete, accurate, and recorded in a timely manner. 15.2 Record Retention The investigator is responsible for retaining all essential documents listed in the International Conference for Harmonization Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.  Study records will be maintained by the PI for a minimum of 3 years and in compliance with institutional, IRB, state, and federal medical records retention requirements, whichever is longest.  All stored records will be kept confidential to the extent required by federal, state, and local law. The FDA requires study records to be retained for up to two years after marketing approval or disapproval (21 CFR 312.62), or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational agent for a specific indication.  Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party and/or move them to another location, the investigator will provide written notification of such intent to

 40 OCRPRO/NIAID with the name of the person who will accept responsibility for the transferred records and/or their new location. Destruction or relocation of research records will not proceed without written permission from NIAID/OCRPRO.

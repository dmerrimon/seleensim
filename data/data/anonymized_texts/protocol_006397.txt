Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 3 • The tolerability and safety of SC icatibant as assessed by injection site reactions, 
adverse events (AEs), vital signs, phys ical examination, clinical laboratory 
parameters (serum chemistry [includi ng liver function tests], hematology, 
urinalysis), and immunogenicity  (anti-icatibant antibodies). 
The secondary endpoints of this study are: 
• The time to onset of relief of symptoms, measured using investigator-reported and 
subject-reported outcomes, defined as  the earliest time at which a 20% 
improvement is seen in the average post-t reatment score with no worsening of any 
single component score). 
o For all subjects (2 to 17 years of age) :  investigator assessment and scoring 
of cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal symptoms of acute HAE attacks by an investigator-rated symptom score. 
o For subjects ≥4 years of age only:  subject self-assessment of HAE-related 
pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R). 
• The time to minimal symptoms, defined as all symptoms mild or absent based on 
the investigator-rated symptom score. 
• The incidence of rescue medication use. 
• The proportion of subjects with worsened intensity of clinical HAE 
symptoms between 2 and 4 hours after treatment with SC icatibant using 
investigator-rated symptom scores. 
• The levels of reproductive hormones (f ollicle stimulating hormone [FSH], 
luteinizing hormone [LH], estradiol, progesterone in females and FSH, LH, and 
testosterone in males). 
Study Population:  
The study will enroll approximately 36 pediat ric subjects from 2 through 17 years of age 
who present with cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal attacks of  acute HAE after a 
qualifying screening period.   
Subject enrollment will be stratified into 2 groups based on Tanner Staging:  a prepubertal 
group (defined as Tanner stage I) and a pube rtal/postpubertal group (defined as Tanner 
stages II to V).  A subject’s cl assification as prepubertal or pubertal/postpubertal will be 
determined at the time of the subject’s first attack.  
Study Design: 
This is an open-label, non-randomized, single- arm study to evaluate the PK, tolerability, 
and safety, including reproductive hormone asse ssments, of a single SC administration of 
icatibant in up to approximat ely 36 pediatric subjects with HAE during an initial acute 
attack.  The study is planned to enroll  up to approximately 16 prepubertal and 
20 pubertal/postpubertal subjects who are from  2 through 17 years of age and who present 
with an acute cutaneous, abdomin al, or laryngeal HAE attack.  
After treatment for an initial attack, further open-label treatment w ith icatibant will be 
offered to pubertal/postpubertal subjects contingent upon having been treated previously 
and presenting with a subsequent acute cutaneous, abdominal, or laryngeal attack of HAE 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 4 at least 7 days after initial treatment.  Open -label treatment will continue until at least 
15 pubertal/postpubertal subjects have been treat ed with icatibant for a total of 3 attacks 
each.  Tolerability and safety evaluations, including reproductive hormone assessments, 
will be performed at each subsequent icatibant-treated attack in a manner similar to that performed for the initial treated attack. 
Study Duration: 
Once subject eligibility is established at screening, the minimal planned duration of 
participation for subjects who present with an initial attack of acute HAE will be 
approximately 90 days and will consist of tr eatment with a single SC administration of 
icatibant on Day 1 and a 90-day follow-up period after treatment.  
Subjects will be closely monitored in the hospital/study center for at  least 6-8 hours after 
administration.  Follow-up to assess the s ubject’s condition at 24 hours and 48 hours after 
discharge will be conducted in person or via a telephone call by study personnel. 
After receiving treatment for an  initial attack, at least 15 pubertal/postpubertal subjects 
who present with subsequent attacks of acute HAE may continue to receive treatment with 
icatibant for a total of 3 attacks each.   
Once the sixteenth prepubertal subject and the twentieth pubertal/ postpubertal subject 
have completed the Day 90 follow-up after treatme nt for an initial attack, and the fifteenth 
pubertal/postpubertal subject has completed th e Day 90 follow-up after the third and final 
treatment, the study will be closed.   
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: 
Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be considered eligible for enrollment: 
1. Two through 17 years of age, inclusive (ie,  from the second birthday through the day 
prior to the eighteenth birthday) at the time of the subject’s first attack. 
2. Documented diagnosis of HAE type I or II.  Diagnosis must be confirmed by 
documented immunogenic and/or functional C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency results 
(<50% of normal levels).  Diagnosis may be  on the basis of historic data or by 
diagnostic testing conducted at the time of screening. 
3. Informed consent (and subject assent as appr opriate) signed by the subject’s parent or 
legal guardian. 
 Subjects will be excluded from the study if  there is evidence of  any of the following 
criteria at screening or at any time prior to the time of the first attack: 
1. Diagnosis of angioedema other than HAE. 
2. Participation in another clinical study during the 30 days prior to treatment.  
3. Any known factor/disease that might interfere with the treatment compliance, study 
conduct, or result interpretation. 
4. Congenital or acquired cardiac anomalies th at interfere significantly with cardiac 
function. 
5. Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors within 7 days prior to 
treatment. 
6. Use of hormonal contraception within the 90 days prior to treatment. 
7. Androgen use (eg, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, methyltestoste rone, testosterone) 
within the 90 days prior to treatment).

Pharmacokinetic Variables: 
PK variables will be determined by full sampling and noncompartmental methods where 
possible, and elsewhere by spar se sampling (at least 4 to 7 time points) and a population 
PK approach using non-linear mixed effects modeling software.   
PK parameter estimates will include, where appropriate:  actual icatibant and metabolite 
concentrations at each sampling tim e, time to peak concentration (T max), actual peak 
(Cmax) and minimum (C min) concentrations, clearance (CL/ F), actual area under the plasma 
concentration-time curve (AUC 0-last and AUC 0-inf), mean residence time (MRT), volume of 
distribution at steady state (V ss/F) and elimination half-life (t 1/2). 
Safety Assessments: 
Safety will be assessed by standard criteria  including physical examination, vital signs, 
clinical laboratory evaluations (clinical chemistry [including liver function tests], 
hematology, urinalysis), and immunogenicity  (presence of anti-i catibant antibodies), 
recording of concomitant medications, and monito ring of AEs.  Local tolerability will be 
assessed by evaluation of reactions at the site of study drug administration (injection site).  
Efficacy Assessments:   
Efficacy will be assessed using both inves tigator- and subject-reported outcomes, 
depending on the subject’s age.  Investigators will assess and score symptoms of acute 
cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal atta cks of HAE for all subjects using an 
investigator-rated symptom score.  Subjects who are 4 years of age or older will perform a self-assessment of HAE-related pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).  
Subjects who are below 4 years of age will ha ve symptoms assessed by the investigator 
only.  The time of initial symptom relief as assessed by the investigator will be recorded for all subjects.  
Reproductive Hormone Assessments: 
Levels of reproductive hormones will be assessed in female (FSH, LH, estradiol, 
progesterone) and male (FSH, LH, and testosterone) subjects.  
Statistical Methods:  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the nu mber of subjects, the mean, 
median, standard deviation, and range.  For PK parameters, the coefficient of variation 
and geometric mean also will be provided.  For categorical data, summaries will include counts and percentages.  For time-to-event data, the median time to event and other summary statistics will be estima ted using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
The following populations will be used in the analysis: 
• The Initial Non-laryngeal Tr eatment Population will cons ist of those subjects who 
were treated with icatibant for their initi al attack and whose primary symptom was 
either cutaneous or abdominal.  
• The Second Non-laryngeal Treatment Popul ation will consist of those subjects 
who had a second icatibant- treated attack for which the primary symptom was 
either cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 6 • The Third Non-laryngeal Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who 
had a third icatibant-treated attack, for which the primary symptom was either 
cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Laryngeal Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with 
icatibant for any attack for which the primary symptom was laryngeal.  
• The PK Population will consist of those s ubjects who were treated with icatibant 
for their initial attack and who had at least 1 post-treatment icatibant concentration recorded.   
• The Initial Treatment Population will cons ist of those subjects who were treated 
with icatibant for the initial attack.  Safe ty and tolerability analyses will use this 
population. 
• The Additional Treatment Population will c onsist of those pubertal/post-pubertal 
subjects who were treated with icatibant for more than 1 attack.  Safety and tolerability analyses will use this population.  
Subject disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, medical history, and use of 
concomitant medications will be summarized for each analysis population.   
Efficacy endpoints, including change from base line when appropriate, will be summarized 
descriptively for the Initial, Second, and Thir d Non-laryngeal Treatment Populations.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint is the time to onset of symptom relief measured using the 
investigator-rated symptom score.  Time of symptom relief is defined as the earliest time 
post-treatment at which there is a 20% im provement in the average post-treatment 
symptom score with no worsening of any si ngle component score.  The efficacy data 
associated with the laryngeal attacks will be provided in data listings for the Laryngeal 
Population. 
Plasma concentrations of icatibant by time point and the PK parameters will be 
summarized descriptively. 
The assessment of safety will be based mainly on the frequency of AEs.  AEs will be 
summarized by presenting the number and perc entage of subjects having any adverse 
event (AE), having an AE in each body system, and having each individual AE using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activity (M edDRA).  The total number of AEs within 
each of these categories will be  reported.  AEs also will be  tabulated by severity and 
relationship to treatment. 
Local tolerability will include symptoms at the injection site and will be assessed 
separately from general reports of AEs.  Local tolerability will be tabulated and 
summarized according to the type and severity of attack. 
The change from baseline in the secretion of reproductive hormones and the change from 
baseline in HAE symptoms (as reported by the investigator or subject) will be summarized 
descriptively.

Shire Confidential 13 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Disease Background 
Bradykinin is responsible for the clinical symp toms of hereditary angioedema (HAE), causing 
increased vascular permeability, vasodilation, and cont raction of visceral smooth muscle.  HAE 
is a rare autosomal dominant disorder charact erized clinically by recurrent and self-limiting 
attacks of edema of the skin, gastrointestinal tr act, and larynx.  Its prevalence is estimated at 
1:10,000 to 1:50,000.1   
The disease is generally caused by either a qu antitative (Type I) or qualitative (Type II) 
deficiency of C1 inhibitor.  The functions of C1 inhibitor include the prevention of C1 
complement auto-activation, inactivation of coagul ation factors XIIa, XIIf, XIa, and inhibition of 
activated kallikrein.  After a tri ggering event, the deficiency in C1  inhibitor results in accelerated 
release of bradykinin, the principal mediator of the increased va scular permeability characteristic 
of HAE, by its cleavage from high molecular weight kininogen by dysregulated, activated 
kallikrein.  There is a third, more rare type of HAE (Type  III) which is of unknown etiology and 
pathophysiology and thus will not be considered further here. 
Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide with a structure similar to bradykinin that acts as an 
antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor.2, 3  It is highly specific for the B2 receptor, and is 
characterized by high potency in vitro and in vivo, and sufficient biological half-life to allow systemic administration by s ubcutaneous (SC) injection.
4, 5  Inhibition of bradykinin action 
through use of a B2 receptor antagonist is a th erapeutic strategy for treatment of clinical 
symptoms of HAE, and represents the rationale fo r use of icatibant in treatment of acute attacks 
of angioedema in HAE patients.  In adults, SC icatibant 30 mg has been shown to produce a 
rapid and durable response in th e treatment of cutaneous, abdomi nal, and laryngeal attacks of 
acute HAE.  A single SC injection is generally su fficient for accelerated relief of symptoms of 
acute HAE attacks irrespective of edema locati on.  Repeated use of icatibant over time for 
treatment of multiple acute HAE a ttacks in adults produces a consistent response at each attack, 
with no diminution of efficacy.  When self-administered by adult subjects experiencing an acute 
HAE attack, icatibant also produces a rapid and safe treatment response. 
The management of HAE in pediatric patients is complex.  The age at onset, the frequency and 
duration of symptoms, as well as the severity of  attacks all exhibit substantial inter-individual 
variation.  Although acute episodes of HAE may occur at any age, the mean age at disease onset 
ranges from approximately 4 to 11 years.  Subcutaneous edema of the extremities, face, neck, torso and genitals is the most common, and usua lly the earliest, manifestation of HAE seen in 
children.  Analyses of the time of  onset of disease symptoms have  indicated an increase in the 
frequency and severity of mani festations between 3 and 6 years of age, as well as at around 
puberty, most likely related to the many physiological (endocrine, mental, and somatic) changes occurring during these periods of development.  In the gastrointestinal tract, submucosal edema may be associated with colicky abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Though 
infrequent compared to cutaneous and abdominal manifestations, attacks of acute HAE involving 
the larynx may result in submucosal edema of the upper airways and risk of death by asphyxiation if undiagnosed and/or untreated.  In  comparison to adults asphyxia may ensue more 
rapidly in children because of smaller airway diameter.

Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 14 Prompt control of attacks, short-term prophylaxis, and intermittent therapy are recommended for 
the management of pediatric HAE.6  Treatment options for children with HAE according to 
current guidelines include antifibrinolytics, atte nuated androgens, and C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) 
replacement therapy.  Antifibrinolytics are ge nerally preferred (eg, tranexamic acid) for 
long-term prophylaxis because of their comparatively favorable safety profile relative to attenuated androgens; though their efficacy may be limited.  C1-INH replacement therapy has been used successfully for management of acute attacks of HAE in children; however, its use in 
children is associated with the same drawbacks (ie, requirement for intravenous [IV] administration, potential to elic it hypersensitivity reactions, po ssible transmission of blood-borne 
infectious agents) as in adults. 
1.2 Previous Clinical Studies 
1.2.1 Pharmacokinetics of Icatibant 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of icatibant have been charac terized extensively in studies 
using both IV and SC administration to healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with HAE.  The 
PK profile of icatibant in adu lts with HAE (JE049-2101 Clinical Study Report) is similar to that 
in healthy adults. 
After SC administration of a single 30 mg dose of  icatibant to healthy adult subjects (N=96), a 
mean (± standard deviation) maximum plasma concentration (C max) of 974 ± 280 ng/mL was 
observed after approximately 0.75 hours.  The mean area under the concentration-time curve 
(AUC 0-∞) after a single 30 mg dose was 2165 ± 568 ng• hr/mL, with no evidence of accumulation 
of icatibant afte r three 30 mg doses administered 6 hours apart.   
Plasma clearance after SC administration of icatibant was 245 ± 58 mL/min with a mean 
elimination half-life of 1.4 ± 0.4 hours a nd volume of distribution at steady state (V ss) of 
29.0 ± 8.7 L.  The information obtained from Phas e III clinical studies clearly demonstrated that 
SC icatibant 30 mg is a clinically safe and effective treatment for attacks of acute angioedema across a wide range of subject demographics, including age, sex, and body weight.  
Icatibant is extensively metabolized by proteo lytic enzymes to inactive metabolites that are 
primarily excreted in the urine, with less than 10% of the dose eliminated as unchanged drug.  
Icatibant is not degraded by oxidative metabolic pathways, and is not an  inhibitor of major 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes (CYP 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 
3A4) and is not an inducer of CYP 1A2 and 3A4. 
Clinical PK studies demonstrate that for mild to moderate impairment of renal or hepatic 
function no dose adjustment is necessary.  In 10 subjects with hepatorenal syndrome (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 30 to 60 mL/min), clearance of icatibant was not dependent on renal function.  Icatibant cl earance in subjects with a wide range  of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
score ≥7 and ≤15) was similar to that in healthy subjects. 
1.2.2 Phase III Investigation of SC Icatibant 
Despite the rarity of HAE, a comprehensive da ta set supports the efficacy and safety of SC 
icatibant.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 15 In Phase I, II, and III clinical studies, SC ica tibant 30 mg has been administered to 129 healthy 
adult subjects and to 236 adult subjects with HAE .  A total of 999 acute  attacks of HAE have 
been treated with icatibant administered by a hea lth care provider, and an  additional 56 attacks 
have been treated with icatibant when self administered by patients (Integrated Summary of 
Safety 11 January 2011).  
In integrated analyses of pooled data from  3 controlled Phase III studies (HGT-FIR-054, 
JE049-2102, and JE049-2103), icatibant significantly decreased the time to onset of symptom 
relief for cutaneous and abdominal attacks relativ e to comparator agents (placebo, tranexamic 
acid) as demonstrated by the primary and key secondary endpoint analyses in subjects with 
non-laryngeal symptoms randomized to double-blind treatment.  Moreover, the median time to onset of symptom relief after icatibant treatment was consistent across all of the controlled Phase III studies and across the 2 endpoints, rangi ng from 1.5 to 2.3 hours.  Likewise, icatibant 
showed effectiveness in the treatment of laryngeal attacks.   
The recommended dose of icatibant in adults is 1 SC injection of 3 mL (3 0 mg) administered in 
the abdominal area for the treatment of acute atta cks of HAE.  In case of insufficient relief or 
recurrence of symptoms, a second   injection of i catibant can be administered after 6 hours.  No 
more than 3 injections of icatib ant should be administered in a 24 hour period.  In clinical trials, 
a single SC injection of icatiban t was generally sufficient to treat an acute HAE attack.  No 
differences in the efficacy or safety of icatiban t in clinical trials ha ve been observed between 
sexes; therefore, dose adjustments for adult male s or females are not considered necessary.  
Beyond exposure in clinical studies , it is estimated that over 8000 patient exposures to Firazyr
® 
have occurred cumulatively in the postmarketing setting from the time of European Union 
regulatory approval in July 2008 through January 2011. 
Please refer to the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure for further information 
concerning the safety and clinical development of icatibant. 
1.2.3 Investigations of Potential Effects of Bradykinin Inhibition on Reproductive 
Function 
In nonclinical studies performed in rat and dog, high repeated doses of icatibant have been 
associated with effects on sexual organs and sexual maturation.  These findings are consistent 
with published data showing a role of bradykini n action through B2 recept ors in the control of 
reproductive hormone release.  Potential effects of icatibant on sexual organs and sexual maturation are being investigated further in studies in juvenile rats.  These are a SC administration local tolerance study, and a 7-week  toxicity study with assessment of fertility 
before and after recovery.  The local tolerance st udy in juvenile rats esta blished the doses for the 
7-week toxicity study.  The results will be reported in the final study reports.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 16 A retrospective analysis, prompted by nonclinical observations, of serum levels of gonadotrophic 
hormone levels (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH ] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) in male and 
female healthy volunteers in an Phase I st udy (JE049-1103) showed no clinically important 
changes from baseline in levels of follicle-st imulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone 
[LH] after administration of 3 SC doses (30 mg each) of icatibant 6 hours apart on Day 1 
followed by single SC doses (30 mg) on Day 8 and Day 15.  
Phase 1 study (HGT-FIR-062) is a double-bli nd, randomized, placebo-controlled, single center 
study to assess the effect of i catibant on serum reproductive hormone levels in male and 
premenopausal female healthy adult subjects and seminal fluid analysis in healthy male adult 
subjects.  This study is intended to definitively de termine the effect of repeated administration of 
3 SC doses of icatibant 30 mg on reproductive  hormone levels in adults prior to any 
investigational use in pediatric subjects per the recomme ndation of the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA).  Subjects are randomized to receiv e icatibant or placebo as a single SC injection 
at 6 hour intervals 3 times daily on Days 1, 4, a nd 7 of the treatment week (total 9 doses/week) 
with an approximately 8 week follow-up phase.  Thirty-nine subjects have been enrolled and 
treated; 38 subjects have comple ted the study (1 subject did not return for follow-up).  The 
results will be reported in the final clinical study report.   
1.3 Rationale for Dose Selection 
Icatibant has not been evaluated in clinical trial subjects below the age of 18 years.  The 
proposed study will be the first in which icatiban t is administered to pediatric subjects for 
treatment of acute HAE attacks.  All subject s in the proposed study will receive a single, 
weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg per attack as a SC injection up to a maximum dose of 30 mg.  
This dose regimen was selected  to target an exposure (C max and area under the curve [AUC]) 
comparable to that observed in adults treated w ith icatibant.  Only 1 dose of icatibant will be 
permitted for treatment of a single attack.    
The 0.4 mg/kg dose was derived from pharmaco kinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling of 
data from a study (JE049-1001) which investigated th e inhibitory potential of icatibant at various 
IV infusion doses and regimens after bradykinin ch allenge in healthy male subjects.  The PK and 
PD data sets were used to model the PK/PD relationship of icatibant using a sigmoidal E max 
model.  A high degree of concordance of half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) values was 
obtained for each of the PD parameters studie d (heart rate, blood pressure, and cutaneous blood 
flow) with the majority of values being between 8.54 and 9.77 ng/mL.  Thus, a mean EC 50 value 
of 9.5 ng/mL (7.3 nM) was used for subse quent PK/PD simulation.  Based on the PK/PD 
modeling, IV icatibant doses of 0.4 mg/kg and 0. 8 mg/kg were predicted to provide duration of 
therapeutic effect of as much as 9 or 13 hours, respectively, when infused over 0.5 to 1 hour.  
These results supported a minimum e ffective dose of 0.4 mg/kg to treat acute attacks of HAE.  
This corresponds to a dose of 30 mg  of icatibant in a 75 kg subject.   
A subsequent Phase II (JE049-2101) dose-rangi ng proof of concept efficacy study in HAE 
subjects was then conducted that examined the ef ficacy of doses ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg 
IV (ie, 30 to 60 mg in a 75 kg person) and 30 to 45 mg SC.  The results of  this study indicated 
that SC administration of icatibant 30 mg produced a rapid onset of symptom relief and that 
45 mg SC showed no improvement in efficacy over 30 mg SC.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 17 As a result of clinical exploration of the e fficacy, safety and exposure-response relationship of 
icatibant, a single SC administration of 30 mg icatibant (10 mg /mL formulation) was selected 
and consistently employed in the Phase III studies in adult HAE subjects.  The totality of 
available efficacy information obtained from the Phase III clinical studies demonstrates that a 
single SC 30 mg dose of icatibant provides a sufficient magnitude and duration of effect to 
clinically manage the majority of acute attacks in adult HAE s ubjects across a wide range of 
demographics.  Therefore, 0.4 mg/kg SC is considered an appropriate dose to study the tolerability, safety and PK of icatibant in the pediatric population.

Shire Confidential 20 4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is an open-label, non-randomized, single-arm study to evaluate the PK, tolerability, and 
safety, including reproductive hormone assessments, of a single SC administration of icatibant in approximately 36 pediatric subject s with hereditary angioedema (HAE) during an initial acute 
attack.  The study is planned to enroll approximately 16 prepuber tal and 20 pubertal/postpubertal 
subjects who are from 2 through 17 years of age and who present with a cutaneous, abdominal, 
or laryngeal attack of acute HAE.  
After treatment for an initial attack, further open-l abel treatment with icat ibant will be offered to 
pubertal/postpubertal subjects c ontingent upon having been treated  previously and presenting 
with a subsequent acute cutane ous, abdominal, or laryngeal at tack of HAE at least 7 days 
after initial treatment.  Open-label treatment w ill continue until at least 15 pubertal/postpubertal 
subjects have been treated with icatibant for a total of 3 attacks each.  Tolerability and safety 
evaluations, including reproductive hormone assessm ents, will be performed at each subsequent 
icatibant-treated attack in a manner similar to that performed for the initial treated attack. 
The study will consist of the following periods ( Table 4-1 ).

evaluated after the subjects’ pare nt(s)/legal guardian(s) and the subject (if applicable) provide 
informed consent/assent.  Study activities at scr eening will include confirmation of diagnosis of 
HAE type I or II by review of the subject’s me dical history and documentation of immunogenic 
and/or functional C1-INH deficiency (<50% of normal levels) indicative of HAE Type I or II.  
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 21 Diagnosis may be supported by family history, characteristic attack manifestations, and 
recurrence of attacks.  Assessments performed at screening will include demography, medical 
history, history of HAE, concomitant medication us e, physical examination (including height and 
weight), vital signs, urine pre gnancy test in female pubertal/p ostpubertal subjects, and blood 
sample collection for C1-INH testing.  
In previously screened, eligible subjects who present with an attack of acute HAE, baseline 
clinical assessments for PK, safety, and efficacy  will be performed on Day 1 at pretreatment.  
The initial severity and type of attack (ie, cu taneous, abdominal, or laryngeal) will be determined 
by the investigator.  The investigator will complete  baseline assessments at pretreatment of the 
symptoms of the acute HAE attack, and adhere nce to inclusion/exclusion criteria will be 
re-confirmed.  Subjects who are 4 years of ag e or older will perform a self-assessment of 
HAE-related pain.  Other baseline assessments pe rformed at pretreatment will include physical 
examination, height and weight, vital signs, coll ection of samples for clinical laboratory tests 
(serum chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, and urinalysis), urine pregnancy 
test for pubertal/postpubertal females, baseline PK and immunogenicity evaluations, and baseline 
assessment of reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, es tradiol, progesterone in  females and FSH, 
LH, and testosterone in males).   
On Day 1, subjects will be administered a single dose of icatibant administered as a SC injection 
within 12 hours after the onset of the acute atta ck.  Subjects will be monitored closely at the 
hospital/study center for approximately 6 hours (prepubertal subjects) or 8 hours 
(pubertal/postpubertal subjects) af ter treatment.  Subj ects will be discharged after completion of 
scheduled assessments and when, according to th e investigator’s judgment, they are deemed 
medically stable.  Follow-up to assess the su bject’s condition at 24 hours (±4 hours) and 48 
hours (±4 hours) after discharg e will be conducted in person or  via a telephone call by study 
personnel. The time of study drug administration on Day 1 will be  designated as Time 0.  All post-treatment 
assessments will be calculated from the time of study drug administration.  Blood samples for 
PK evaluation in pubertal/postpubertal subjects  will be collected on Day 1 at pretreatment, 
15 (±5) minutes, 30 (±5) minutes, 45 (± 5) minutes, 1 (±0.17) hour, 2 (±0.17) 
hours, 4 (±0.5) hours, 6 (±0.5), and 8 (±0.5) hours after treatment with study drug.  In 
prepubertal subjects, blood samples for PK evalua tion will be collected on Day 1 at pretreatment, 
15 (±5) minutes, 30 (±5) minutes, 2 (±0.5) hour s, 4 (±0.5) hours, and 6 (±0.5) hours.  
Safety and efficacy assessments will be performe d on Day 1 up to 6 hours after treatment.  These 
assessments will include physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry [including liver function tests], hematology, and urinalysis), and assessment of reproductive hormones (FSH, LH, estradiol, and progesterone in females and FSH, LH, and testosterone in males) in all subjects.  Injec tion site reactions will be evaluated on Day 1 at 1 
hour and at 6 hours after treatment.  
The investigator will complete an assessment of symptoms of the acute attack of HAE for all 
subjects on Day 1 at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after trea tment.  Subject who are 4 years of age or older 
will also complete a self-assessment of HAE-related pain at these time points. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 22 Rescue medication use will be assessed through 48 hours after treatment, either in person or by 
telephone at the discretio n of the investigator. 
Subjects will undergo safety assessments, including physical examination, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hema tology, and urinalysis), evaluation of injection 
site reactions, immunogenicity, and measurem ent of reproductive hormones, as well as 
investigator assessments and subj ect self assessments (subjects ≥4 years of age only) of HAE 
symptoms on Day 8 after treatment. 
Subjects will be followed over a 90-day (±7 days) period after initial treatment.  All subjects will 
provide blood samples for immunogenicity tes ting and determination of reproductive hormone 
levels at the Day 90 visit and undergo safety assessments includi ng physical examination, vital 
signs, and clinical laboratory tests (serum chemis try, hematology, and urinalysis).  Additionally, 
pubertal/postpubertal females will undergo urine pregnancy testing. 
Pubertal/postpubertal subjects may receive further treatment with icatibant for up to 2 additional 
attacks of acute HAE.  Safety, reproductive hormone, and other a ssessments in association with 
subsequent attacks of acute HAE will be performed 90 days (±7 days) after treatment.  Each treatment for a subsequent attack will require a Day 90 follow up visit.  If a subsequent attack 
occurs within 7 days of the Day 90 follow-up vi sit for the previous attack, the assessments on 
Day 8 and Day 90 will be combined.   
Adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medication will be collected throughout the study.   All assessments are outlined in full in the Schedule of Events in Appendix 1, Initial 
Icatibant-treated Attack and Appendix 2, Subsequent Icatibant-tr eated Attacks.     
4.2 Rationale for Study Design 
This study has an open-label, single arm design.   The study is intended to determine the PK profile of SC icatibant when administered to children 
and adolescents being treated for an acute attack of HAE and to identify an optimal pediatric 
dosing regimen.  In addition, the study is intende d to establish the tolerability and safety of 
icatibant in children, particular ly with respect to potential e ffects on reproductive development, 
and to demonstrate the effectiveness of icatib ant in relieving the symptoms of acute HAE 
attacks.  Therefore, this study will help dete rmine whether icatibant can address an unmet 
medical need for a safe and effective treatment fo r acute attacks of HAE in pediatric patients.   
Furthermore, this study is designed to fulfill a regulatory commitment to the European Medicines 
Agency according to the approved pediatri c investigational pl an (EMEA-000408-PIP01-08-
M02) for icatibant of 05 May 2010. 
4.3 Study Duration 
The approximate overall duration of the study will be 36 months.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 23 Once subject eligibility is established at screenin g, the minimal planned duration of participation 
for individual subjects who present with an initi al attack of acute HAE will be approximately 
90 days, and will consist of a single SC dose of icatibant on Day 1 and a 90-day follow-up period 
after treatment.   
Pubertal/postpubertal subjects, who may receive treatment for up to 2 additional attacks of acute 
HAE, will have a longer duration of participation.  Due to the unpredictable nature of HAE attacks, the actual expected dura tion of these subjects is unknown.  After receiving treatment for 
an initial attack, pubertal/post pubertal subjects who pr esent with subsequent  attacks of acute 
HAE may continue to receive treatm ent with icatibant up to a total of 3 icatibant-treated attacks. 
Once the sixteenth prepubertal subject and th e twentieth pubertal/postpubertal subject has 
completed Day 90 follow-up after treatment for an initial attack, and the fifteenth pubertal/postpubertal subject has completed th e Day 90 follow-up after the third and final 
treatment, the study will be closed.

weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg up to a maximu m of 30 mg administered as a SC injection. 
Subsequent treatment with icatibant for up to 2 ad ditional attacks of acute HAE will be offered to 
pubertal/postpubertal subjects who pres ent with a new attack at least 7 days after prior treatment.  
The dosing regimen for treatment of subsequent atta cks will be the same as that for treatment of 
the initial attack (ie, a single weight-adjusted dose of 0.4 mg/kg up to a maximum of 30 mg per 
attack administered as a SC injection).  Thus, no more than 3 doses of icatibant will be 
administered to any subject during the study. 
6.3 Selection and Timing of  Dose for Each Subject 
Each subject will be administered a single dose of  icatibant as a SC injection within 12 hours 
after the onset of an acute HAE attack.  Subsequent treatment with icatibant for up to 2 additional attacks of acute HAE for a total of 3 attacks will be  offered to pubertal/postpubertal 
subjects who have been previously treated and w ho present with another attack at least 7 days 
post-treatment with study drug.   
6.4 Method of Assigning Sub jects to Treatment Groups 
Not applicable to this study.  All subjects will be administered study drug at a weight-adjusted 
dose of 0.4 mg/kg SC up to a maximum of 30 mg per treatment.

Shire Confidential 26 6.6 Concomitant Medications 
Use of the following concomitant medica tions is allowed during the study: 
• All chronically administered medications, except for treatments of HAE, are allowed, but the 
dose and regimen must have been stable for at  least 1 month before the first dose of study 
drug. 
• Prophylactic therapies for HAE (eg, anti-fibri nolytics or C1-INH) other than attenuated 
androgens will be allowed, but therapies known to attenuate an acute HAE attack (eg, 
C1-INH concentrate, fresh-frozen plasma [FFP]) must not be used during the attack being 
treated with icatibant unless these are required as  rescue medications (see Section 6.7).  An 
exception is that fibrinolysis inhibitors may be given in a subject’s usual, stable prophylactic 
regimen.  
 Use of the following concomitant medica tions is forbidden during the study: 
• ACE inhibitors. 
• Androgens or attenuated androgens (e g, stanozolol, danazol, oxandrolone, 
methyltestosterone, testosterone). 
• Hormonal contraceptives (acceptable cont raception during the study for sexually active 
females will consist of abstinence or a doubl e barrier method such as condom plus 
diaphragm, condom or diaphragm plus spermici de, condom or diaphragm plus intrauterine 
device). 
 
6.7 Rescue Therapy 
For the purposes of this protocol, rescue thera py is any medication used after the administration 
of icatibant which, in the opinion of the investig ator, is immediately nece ssary to alleviate acute 
symptoms which are judged by the investigator as resultant from the current HAE attack.  Repeat 
administration of icatibant for a single at tack is not allowed in this study.   
The determination of the necessity for pain medication or other rescue therapy will be at the discretion of the investigator.  If pain medication is required, the investigator may administer 
morphine sulfate at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg or an equivalent low dose narcotic.  Antiemetics may 
also be prescribed as necessary  to treat nausea.  Other accepta ble rescue therapies include FFP, 
epinephrine, C1-INH if available and intrav enous or prescription- strength non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).  Medications provided for rescue therapy will be denoted as rescue medications on the appropriate case report form (CRF). 
Antihistamines (diphenhydramine, loratadine, cetiriz ine, etc) and glucocor ticoids are considered 
ineffective for the alleviation of an acute HAE att ack.  If administered during an acute attack that 
occurs during the study, they s hould be recorded as concomitant  medications but will not be 
considered as rescue medications.   If rescue medication is provided, the investig ator will document the drug name, amount, time, 
route of administration, freque ncy, and duration administered.

7.9.3 Bioanalytical Method 
Plasma samples will be assayed for concentrations of icatibant and its metabolites (M1 and M2) 
using a validated method (see Section 7.19 ). 
7.10 Efficacy Assessments 
7.10.1  Investigator Symptom Score  
The investigator will use a symptom score to assess the severities of symptoms of acute 
cutaneous, abdominal, and laryngeal attacks of HAE using th e following 5-point scale.  
Symptom scores will be recorded on Day 1 at pretreatment and at predetermined time points 
after treatment.  Results will be recorded on the CRF. 
Investigator-rated Symptom Score  
0 = none; absence of symptoms 
1 = mild (no to mild interference with daily activities) 2 = moderate (moderate interference with daily activities) 3 = severe (severe interference with daily activities) 4 = very severe (very severe interference with daily activities) 
 For attacks classified as cutaneous and/or abdom inal, investigator-rated symptom scores will be 
collected for 8 symptoms:  abdominal tendern ess, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, 
erythema, skin irritation, and skin swelling.   
For attacks classified as laryngeal, investigator-assessed symptom scores will be collected for 
13 symptoms:  abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, skin swelling, dysphagia, voice chan ge, breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia.   
7.10.2  Subject Self Assessment of Pain  
Subjects who are at least 4 years of age will self assess HAE-related pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (FPS-R).  A copy of the FPS-R is provided in Appendix 3 . 
Self-assessment results will be recorded in th e diary.  The self-assessment diaries will be 
provided to these subjects on Da y 1 at pretreatment and at pr edetermined time points after 
treatment while at the hospital/study center and af ter their discharge.  Subjects will return the 
diary at the next scheduled visi t on Day 8.  Subjects will receive detailed instructions on when 
and how to complete the diaries by the inve stigator and/or clinical site personnel.

7.15 Adverse Events Assessments   
7.15.1  Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
7.15.1.1 Adverse Event 
An AE is any noxious, pathologic, or uninte nded change in anatomical, physiologic, or 
metabolic function as indicated by physical signs , symptoms, or laboratory changes occurring in 
any phase of a clinical study, whether or not co nsidered investigational product-related.  This 
includes an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition.   
AEs include: 
• Worsening (change in nature, severity, or freque ncy) of conditions presen t at the onset of the 
study. 
• Intercurrent illnesses. 
• Drug interactions. 
• Events related to or possibly related to concomitant medications. 
• Abnormal laboratory values (this includes significa nt shifts from baselin e within the range of 
normal that the investigator considers to be clinically important). 
• Clinically significant abnormalities in physical examination, vital signs, and weight. 
 
Throughout the study, the investigat or must record all AEs on the AE CRF, regardless of the 
severity or relationship to inve stigational product.  The investig ator should treat subjects with 
AEs appropriately and observe them at suitable in tervals until the events st abilize or resolve.  
Adverse events may be discovered through observation or examination of the subject, questioning of the subject, complaint by the subjec t, or by abnormal clinical laboratory values. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 35 In addition, AEs may also include  laboratory values that become significantly out of range.  In 
the event of an out-of-range value, the laborator y test should be repeated until it returns to 
normal or can be explained and the subject’s safety is not at risk. 
Additional illnesses present at the time when informed consent is given are regarded as 
concomitant illnesses and will be documented on the appropriate pages of the CRF.  Illnesses 
first occurring or detected dur ing the study, and worsening of a concomitant illness during the 
study, are to be regarded as AEs and mu st be documented as such in the CRF. 
The treated HAE attack is defined as any sympto ms occurring in treated subjects within 48 hours 
of the onset of symptoms.  Any clinically relevant worsening of the signs and symptoms of a treated attack is considered to be related to the underlying disease of HAE and will be collected separately from general reports of AEs.  Symp toms reoccurring more than 48 hours after an 
initial attack will be considered a new attack, and will also not be reported as AEs.  Attacks not 
treated with icatibant will be documented in de tail in the CRF.  They are considered to be 
pre-existing disease and will not be documented as AEs. 
Local tolerability will include symptoms at th e site of study drug admini stration (injection site) 
and will be assessed separately from general repo rts of AEs.  Local tolerability will include 
symptoms at the site of study dr ug administration (injection site) a nd will be assessed separately 
from general reports of AEs.  Injection site reactions will be documented in the "local 
tolerability" page (or form) of the CRF.  Inject ion site reactions that have been reported 
previously with icatibant included erythema, swelling, burning sensation, itching, warmth and pain and were generally, mild to moderate, transient, and resolved without sequelae.  Injection site reactions that do not meet the criteria of  a serious adverse event will not need to be 
additionally reported as AEs. 
Though AEs will be collected throughout the study, due to the acute nature of HAE attacks and 
the half-life of icatibant, it is particularly im portant to focus on AEs which have a temporal 
association with treatment.  Treatment-emerge nt AEs will be collected over a 48-hour window 
after the time of study drug administration.   
7.15.1.2 Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death. 
• Is life-threatening. 
• Requires hospitalization. 
• Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity.  
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
  
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 36 Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-thre atening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered  an SAE when, based upon appropr iate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  A life-threaten ing AE is defined as an AE that placed the 
subject, in the view of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred 
(ie, it does not include an AE that, had it occurr ed in a more severe form, might have caused 
death). 
7.15.2  Classification of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
The severity of AEs will be assessed by the investigator using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTCAE) Vers ion 4.0 grading scale.  If an AE is not 
described in the NCI CTCAE, the severity s hould be recorded based on the scale below (see 
Table 7-2).  The severity of a ll AEs/SAEs should be recorded on the appropriate CRF page as 
Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 corresponding, respectivel y, to a severity of mild, moderate, severe, 
life-threatening, or fatal.  
Table 7-2  Adverse Event Severity   
Severity Definition 
Grade 1 (Mild) No limitation of usual activities. 
Grade 2 (Moderate) Some limitation of usual activities. 
Grade 3 (Severe) Inability to carry out usual activities. 
Grade 4 (Life-threatening) Immediate risk of death. 
Grade 5 (Fatal) Death 
 7.15.2.1 Clarification between Serious and Severe 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (eg, severe headache).  This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on 
the outcome or action criteria usually associated  with events that pose a threat to life or 
functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) and causa lity serve as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations. 
7.15.3  Relatedness of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
Relationship of an AE or SAE to investigational product is to be determin ed by the investigator 
based on the following definitions (See Table 7-3). Table 7-3  Adverse Event Relatedness 
Relationship to Product(s) Definition 
Not Related Unrelated to investigational product 
Possibly Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable

Relationship to Product(s) Definition 
time sequence to administration of investigational product, but 
which could also be explained by concurrent disease or other 
drugs or chemicals. 
Probably Related A clinical event or laboratory abnormality with a reasonable 
time sequence to administration of investigational product, unlikely to be attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs and chemicals and which follows a clinically reasonable response on de-challenge.  The association of the clinical event 
or laboratory abnormality must also have some biologic 
plausibility, at least on theoretical grounds. 
Definitely related The event follow s a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product, follows a known or suspected response pattern to the investigational product, is 
confirmed by improvement upon stopping the investigational 
product (de-challenge), and r eappears upon repeated exposure 
(re-challenge).  Note that this is  not to be construed as requiring 
re-exposure of the subject to i nvestigational product; however, 
the determination of definitely related can only be used when 
recurrence of event is observed. 
 
7.15.4  Procedures for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events 
7.15.4.1 Adverse Event Monitoring and Period of Observation 
AEs will be monitored continuously throughout the study.  For the purposes of this study, the 
period of observation extends from the time of  informed consent until the subject’s final 
evaluation of the study.  For safety purposes, the final evaluation will be defined as the follow-up 
evaluation performed approximately 90 days after the last dose for subjects who complete the 
study. 
If the investigator considers it necessary to report an AE in a subject after the end of the safety 
observation period, he or she should contact th e sponsor to determine how the AE should be 
documented and reported. 
7.15.4.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE, regardless of relationship to investigat ional product, which occurs in a subject after 
informed consent, should be recorded by the clin ical site on an SAE form.  The SAE must be 
completely described on the subject’s CRF, includi ng the judgment of the investigator as to the 
relationship of the SAE to the investigational product.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 39 The investigator or sponsor must ensure that the IRB/IEC receives a copy of the report and that a 
copy is also filed with in their study files. 
7.16 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusio n criteria for this study.  The sponsor must be notified in the 
event of a pregnancy occurring during the cour se of the study and through 90 days after the 
subject’s last dose of investiga tional product.  Pregnancy is not to be reported as an AE; the 
pregnancy reporting form should be used to re port the pregnancy.  The pregnancy will be 
followed up through delivery or final outcome. 
7.17 Abuse, Overdose, and Medication Error 
• Abuse  – Persistent or sporadic intentional inta ke of investigational medicinal product at a 
dose higher than prescribed per protocol (but below the dose defined for overdose) or when 
used for non-medical purpose (eg, altering one’s state of consciousness). 
• Misuse  – Intentional or unintentiona l use of investigational medi cinal product other than as 
directed or indicated at any dose, which is at  or below the dose defined for overdose (Note:  
this includes a situation where the test article is  not used as directed at the dose prescribed by 
the protocol). 
• Overdose – No clinical information on overdose is available.  A dose of 3.2 mg/kg 
(approximately 8 times the therapeutic dose)  caused transient erythema, itching or 
hypotension in healthy subjects.  No therapeutic intervention was necessary. 
• Medication Error – A mistake made in prescribing, di spensing, administration and/or use of 
the investigational medicinal product. 
 
All investigational medicinal pr oduct provided to pediat ric subjects should be supervised by the 
parent(s)/legal guardian(s)/caregiver(s). 
7.18 Removal of Subjects from the Trial or Investigational Product 
A subject’s participation in the study may be di scontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator.  The following may be justifiable re asons for the investigator to remove a subject 
from the study: 
• Non-compliance, including failure to a ppear at one or more study visits. 
• The subject was erroneously included in the study. 
• The subject develops an  exclusion criterion.  
• The subject suffers an intolerable adverse event. 
• The study is terminated by the sponsor. 
• The study is closed prior to the subject’s first eligible attack. 
 The subject, the subject’s parent (s), or the subject’s legal guar dian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subject is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time without 
prejudice to further treatment. 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 40 If a subject or the subject’s pa rent(s) or the subject’s legal gu ardian(s) acting on behalf of the 
subject, discontinues participati on in the study, or the subject is  discontinued by the investigator, 
the Subject Completion/Discontinuation Case Report Form (CRF) describing the reason for 
discontinuation must be completed.  Any AEs ex perienced up to the po int of discontinuation 
must be documented on the AE CRF.  If AEs are present when the subject withdraws from the 
study, the subject will be re-evaluated within 30 days of withdrawal.  All ongoing SAEs at the 
time of withdrawal will be followed until resolution. 
7.18.1  Safety-Related Study Stopping Rules   
This study will be stopped and safety data review ed if any subject experiences a life-threatening 
(Grade 4) AE or a death occurs, if either is cons idered possibly, probably or  definitely related to 
the investigati onal product.  
Following the review of safety data, the study will be either: 
• Resumed unchanged. 
• Resumed with modifications to the protocol.  
• Terminated. 
 
Subject safety will be monitored on a continuou s basis during this study until the last subject 
completes his or her last sche duled study visit/assessment.   
Additional information on safety monitoring can be found in Section 11.8, Data and Safety 
Monitoring Board. 
7.19 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The safety assessments used here are standard and will provide a detailed measure of the safety of icatibant in the pediatric population.  
The measures of serum reproductive hormone con centration used in th is study are standard 
validated measures for assessing the function of reproductive organs.   
Plasma samples will be assaye d for concentrations of icatib ant and its 2 major metabolites 
(M1 and M2) using a validated high-perfor mance liquid chromatography/tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method with a lower limit of quantification of  1 ng/mL and a range 
from 1 to 1000 ng/mL (Analytical Report SHR10-002). 
The symptom score used in efficacy assessments in this study is an investigator-rated measure of 
symptom severity based on a standard 5-point sc oring system (0-absence of symptoms, 1-mild, 
2-moderate, 3-severe, 4-very severe)  capturing symptoms of acute attacks of HAE that have 
been identified and validated to assess efficacy in adults.  For attacks classified as abdominal or 
cutaneous, investigator-rated symptom scores  are collected for 8 symptoms:  abdominal 
tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin irritation, and skin swelling.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 41 For attacks classified as laryngeal, investigat or-assessed symptom scores are collected for 
13 symptoms:  abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, skin pain, erythema, skin 
irritation, skin swelling, dysphagia, voice change , breathing difficulties, stridor, and asphyxia.  In 
all pediatric subjects in the pr esent study, irrespective of age, the investigator-rated symptom 
score will provide an appropriate means to measure the severity of primary symptoms (eg, cutaneous and/or abdominal pain, cutaneous swelling, or laryngeal symptoms) of acute attacks of HAE at pretreatment and the change in symptom seve rity, if any, after treatment with icatibant.  
Though subject-reported outcomes such as the sy mptom score and visual analog scale (VAS) 
have been employed successfully as efficacy measur es in clinical studies of icatibant in adults, 
the use of these subject-reported outcomes in chil dren poses special challenges.  The Faces Pain 
Scale is a validated, self-reported measure used to assess the intensity of children's pain in a wide 
variety of clinical contexts.
9  The Faces Pain Scale-Revise d (FPS-R) was adapted from the 
original FPS in order to make it possible to sc ore pain on a widely accepted 0-to-10 metric.10  
The scales are suitable for use in assessment of the intensity of children's acute pain from age 
4 onward, are simple to administer, and requi re no specialized equipment other than the 
standardized images of faces.  Use of the FPS-R is planned for this study, and will provide an 
appropriate means to measure pain associated wi th acute attacks of HAE in pediatric subjects 
who are at least 4 years of age.

Shire Confidential 46 10 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
10.1 General Considerations 
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® statistical software (SAS Institute, NC, 
USA).  Data will be summarized with respect to disposition, demographic, pretreatment 
characteristics, PK variables, safety variables, and efficacy variables.  Unless stated otherwise, 
tabular summaries will be presented by the subj ect’s stratification group at enrollment (ie, 
prepubertal group, pubertal/ postpubertal group, and th e overall subjects group.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the nu mber of subjects, the mean, 
median, standard deviation, and range.  For PK parameters, the coefficient of variation and 
geometric mean also will be provided.  For cat egorical data, summaries will include counts and 
percentages.  For time to event data, the median time to event and other summary statistics will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier. 
10.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Enrollment of approximately 16 prepubertal and 20 pubertal/postpubertal subjects, who are from 2 through 17 years of age and who present with a cutaneous, abdominal, or  laryngeal attack of 
acute HAE, is planned.  This sample size is empirically derived and not based on a formal 
sample size calculation.  However, the inclusi on of approximately 36 subjects will provide basic 
information for safety, tolerability, PK, and efficacy. 
10.3 Analysis Populations 
The following populations will be used in the analysis: 
• The Initial Non-laryngeal Trea tment Population will consist of those subjects who were 
treated with icatibant for th eir initial attack and whose primary symptom was either 
cutaneous or abdominal.  
• The Second Non-laryngeal Treatment Populati on will consist of thos e subjects who had a 
second icatibant-treated attack for which the primary symptom was either cutaneous or abdominal, regardless of the primar y symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Third Non-laryngeal Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who had a third 
icatibant-treated attack, for which the primary symptom was either cutaneous or abdominal, 
regardless of the primary symptom for the initial attack. 
• The Laryngeal Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with icatibant for 
any attack for which the primary symptom was laryngeal.  
• The PK Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with icatibant for their initial attack and who had at least 1 post-tre atment icatibant concentration recorded.   
• The Initial Treatment Population will consist of those subjects who were treated with 
icatibant for the initial attack. 
• The Additional Treatment Population will consis t of those pubertal/post-pubertal subjects 
who were treated with icatibant for more than 1 attack.   
 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 47 All efficacy analysis will be performed on the In itial Non-laryngeal Treatment Population, the 
Second Non-laryngeal Treatment Population,  and the Third Non- laryngeal Treatment 
Population.  The PK analyses will be based on the PK population.  Safety and tolerability 
analyses will be based on the Initial Treat ment Population and the Additional Treatment 
Population.  The Laryngeal Population will be used to explore the efficacy of icatibant for the 
treatment of laryngeal attacks.  All analyses conducted with this population will be limited to 
data corresponding to the subjec t’s first laryngeal attack. 
10.4 Demographics and Ba seline Characteristics 
Demographic data and pretreatment characteristics will be summarized for each analysis population.  
10.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
A primary objective of the study is to investigate the PK of a single SC in jection of icatibant in 
pediatric subjects treated for acute  attacks of HAE.  All PK analyses will use the PK population. 
Plasma concentrations of icatibant and metabol ites (ie, M1 and M2) and actual blood sampling 
times will be listed by subject and sampling time.  Plasma concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number, mean and sta ndard deviation).  PK parameters for icatibant 
and metabolites will be listed by subject and will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
(number, mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, geometric mean, minimum, median, 
maximum).  Individual and mean plasma concentrations of icatibant and metabolites versus time 
will be displayed on linear and semi-logarithmic axes. 
10.5.1  Estimation of PK Parameters 
Noncompartmental modeling:  for subjects in whom the number of samples is sufficient to 
permit noncompartmental modeling, individual and mean PK parameters will be computed for 
icatibant and metabolites (M1 and M2) usi ng standard noncompartmental methods, where 
possible, using the WinNonLin software packag e (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA).  For 
descriptive statistical tabulation of mean plasma  concentrations and graphical displays, nominal 
collection times will be used, wh ile all PK analysis and parameter calculations will use actual 
collection times.  Plasma concentrations <LOQ w ill be treated as 0 for the calculation of the 
descriptive statistics for plasma concentrations  at each sampling time.  For the pharmacokinetic 
analysis, plasma concentrations <LOQ that occu rred from pre-dose to the first concentration 
≥LOQ will be treated as 0 and those that occur thereafter will be treated as missing. 
PK parameter estimates will include, where appropr iate:  icatibant and metabolite concentrations 
at each sampling time, time to peak concentration (T
max), actual peak (C max) and minimum (C min) 
concentrations, clearance (C L/F), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC 0-last and 
AUC 0-inf), mean residence time (MRT), volum e of distribution at steady state (V ss/F) and 
elimination half-life (t 1/2). 
 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 48 The distribution of continuous data  will be evaluated using parametr ic tests.  A transformation, 
such as logs, will be used where appropriate.  Multiple regression analysis, with an appropriate 
transformation on the dependent vari able, will be used to assess the contribution of potential PK 
covariates while controlling for demographic covariates (eg, subject’s age and gender) to the 
inter-subject variability of icatibant PK parameters.  The multivariable analysis will be considered the primary statistical analysis.  A p-value of 0.05 will be considered statistically significant for all analyses. 
Compartmental modeling using population methods:  nonlinear mixed effects modeling will be 
used to define individual subject profiles and if possible, parameter estimates.  The structural PK 
model will be developed and validated using PK information obtained from adult subjects and will enable delineation of the impact of age- dependent changes on icatibant disposition.  
Development of this model will allow for characterization and better prediction of the dose-concentration-e xposure relationship for icatibant in pediatric subjects.  Population PK 
modeling will be performed w ith nonlinear mixed effect modeling software (eg, NONMEM, 
Globomax LLC or WinNonMix, Pharsight Corp.).  The program will estimate the inter- and intra-individual variability of PK parameter estim ates.  Both weight-normalization and allometric 
scaling principles will be evaluated.  For selec ting preliminary meaningful covariates the general 
additive model (GAM) analysis will be used.  Va riables to be considered will include (but are 
not limited to):  age, sex, ethnicity, total and lean bodyweight (T BW, LBW), body mass index 
(BMI), and body surface area (BSA). 
Monte Carlo simulation experiments based on the model(s) developed above may be performed 
by a validated simulation software program (eg, Trial Simulator, Pharsight Corp.) to assess the 
response patterns for various dosage regimens of icatibant treatments in the pediatric population. 
10.6 Safety and Tolerability Analysis 
Another primary objective of the study is to inves tigate the safety and tolerability of a single SC 
dose of icatibant in pediatric subjects with HAE during an acute HAE attack.  The corresponding analyses will be based on th e Initial Treatment Population. 
The safety and tolerability parameters include AEs,  vital signs, local tolerability at the injection 
site, immunogenicity, standard hematol ogy, serum chemistry, and urinalysis. 
AEs will be categorized using MedDRA Version 8.1 or  higher.  The assessment of safety will be 
based mainly on the frequency of treatment emergent AEs.  AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term.  The num ber and proportion of subjects experiencing an 
AE will be tabulated by the subject stratification group and for the ove rall subject group.  AEs by 
SOC and preferred term also will be tabulated by severity and by relationship to treatment.  In 
the case of multiple occurrences of the same AEs (at the preferred term level) in an individual 
subject, the AE that is classified as the most severe (ie, maximum severity) will be identified for 
the analysis by severity and the AE that has the highest relationship to study drug will be 
identified for the analysis by relationship.  SAEs will be provided in a data listing. 
 
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 49 Laboratory data will be listed by subject and stratification group.  Subjects with newly occurring 
abnormalities outside the normal range will be flagge d and listed separately.  Actual values and 
mean change from pretreatment values will be summarized by the stratification group.  Shift 
tables will also be tabulated by stratification group and time point. 
Vital signs data will be listed by subject and stra tification group.  Furthermore, actual values and 
mean changes from baseline will be summarized for each stratification group as well as the 
overall subject group.  Shift tables may be presented, utilizing reference ranges.  Subjects with 
notably abnormal values will be identified a nd listed separately al ong with their values. 
Local tolerability will be tabulated and summarized  according to the type and severity of attack 
Data from other tests (eg, immunogenicity) wi ll be listed and summarized as appropriate. 
The assessment of safety and tolerability after re peated treatment with icatibant is also of 
interest.  The analyses described above will be repeated using the Additional Treatment 
Population.  The summary tables and listings will be presented by attack number (ie, Attack 1, 
Attack 2, and Attack 3). 
10.7 Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the time to onset of symptom relief measured using the 
investigator-reported symptom score.  The i nvestigator will report symptom scores at 
pretreatment and 1, 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 hours pos t-treatment.  Eight symptoms will be assessed 
for abdominal and cutaneous attacks, and 13 symptoms will be assessed for laryngeal attacks.  Time of symptom relief is defined as the earlie st time post-treatment at which there is a 20% 
improvement in the average post-treatment sy mptom score with no worsening of any single 
component score.  The median time and the 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the 
Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
A tabular summary of the average investigator -reported symptom score and the change from 
baseline in the average investigator-reported symptom score will be presented by the 
stratification group and the overall subjects group.  An a lternative anal ysis of time to onset of 
symptom relief will focus on the time to minimal symptoms.  In this case, symptom relief is defined as the earliest time post-treatment when all symptoms are either absent or mild.  
For individual investigator-reported symptom sc ores, a shift table from baseline will be 
presented for each post-treatment time point.  The analysis will be repeated to assess shift in the 
individual symptom scores from the 2 hour time-point.  Also, for individual symptoms that are moderate or worse at pretreatment, the median a nd 95% confidence interval will be presented for 
the time to the symptom being mild or absent.  
A subset of subjects, 4 years of age or older, will assess pain using the Faces Pain Scale-Revised 
(FPS-R).  Time to onset of symp tom relief will be computed in a manner similar to that for the 
average investigator-reported symptom scores.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 50 All efficacy analysis will be performed on the in itial treatment population, the second treatment 
population, and the third treatment population.  The efficacy data for subjects with laryngeal 
attacks will be listed.  If ther e are at least 5 subjects with la ryngeal attacks, then the average 
investigator-reported symptom scores and th e change from baseline in the average 
investigator-reported symptom score will be su mmarized.  Additionally, time to symptom relief 
analysis will be performed on the investigator-reported symptom scores. 
10.8 Analysis of Reproduc tive Hormone Levels 
The impact of icatibant on the reproductive hormone levels will be assessed by presenting 
tabular summaries for FSH, LH, estradiol, a nd progesterone for females, and FSH, LH, and 
testosterone for males.  The change from baseline values will also be summarized.  Subjects with 
newly occurring abnormalities outside the normal range will be flagged and listed separately. 
10.9 Other Analyses 
The number and percentage of subjects who recei ved rescue medications before the onset of 
symptom relief will be summarized by the stratification group.  Time to first use of rescue medication prior to symptom relief will be calcul ated from the time of study drug administration 
to the first use of rescue medication prior to symptom relief.  The median time and the 95% confidence interval will be calcul ated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. 
10.10  Data Monitoring an d Interim Analysis 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be set up to review the safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy data on an ongoing basis.  The goal of the DSMB will be to assess the risk/benefit of icatibant treatment in this pediatric population.  An analysis of the data for DSMB review is 
planned after the first 4 subject s in the pubertal/ postpubertal gr oup have been treated.  Because 
no formal hypothesis testing is planned, multiplic ity concerns regarding repeated analyses are 
not an issue.  
10.11  Handling of Missing Data 
Individual pretreatment symptom scores and FPS-R scores will be assigned a value of zero.  For 
missing post-treatment scores, imputation will be employed using the Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF) approach.  The pretreatment values may also be used in the imputation.  For missing or partial rescue medication dates, the imput ation will be performed such that the earliest 
possible time post-treatment will be assigned to th e rescue medication use.  Similar approach 
will be followed in case of missing or partial AE dates.

sub-investigators liste d on Form FDA 1572. 
The investigator should ensure that all persons assist ing with the study are adequately informed 
about the protocol, any amendments to the protocol, the study treatments , and their study related 
duties and functions.  The investigator must ma intain a list of sub-investigators and other 
appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has delegated significant study related duties. 
11.2 Institutional Review Board or I ndependent Ethics Committee Approval 
Before initiation of the study, the investigator must provide the sponsor with a copy of the written IRB/IEC approval of the protocol and the informed consent form.  This approval must refer to the informed consent form and to the st udy title, study number, a nd version and date of 
issue of the study protocol, as given by the sponsor on the cover page of the protocol. 
Status reports must be submitted to the IRB/IEC at least once per year.  The IRB/IEC must be 
notified of completion of the study.  Within 3 months of study completion or termination, a final 
report must be provided to the IRB/ IEC.  A copy of these reports will be sent to the study clinical 
monitor.  The investigators must maintain an accurate and complete record of all submissions 
made to the IRB/IEC, including a list of all reports and documents submitted.  AEs which are reported to the US Food and Drug Administra tion (FDA) or other Regulatory agencies 
(Investigational New Drug [IND] Safety Reports) must be submitted promptly to the IRB/IEC. 
11.3 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The procedures set out in this study protocol , pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and 
documentation of this study, are designed to ensu re that the sponsor and investigators abide by 
good clinical practice (GCP) as described in  the 21 CFR Parts 50, 56, and 312 and the 
International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH)  GCP Guidelines Compliance with these 
regulations and guidelines also constitutes complian ce with the ethical principles described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. 
11.4 Subject Information and Consent/Assent 
Before enrolling in the clinical study, the s ubject and/or the subject ’s parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) as appropriate must consent to pa rticipate after the nature, scope, and possible 
consequences of the clinical study have been e xplained in a form understandable to him or her. 
An informed consent form (assent form if applicable) that includes information about the study will be prepared and given to the subject or the subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s).   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 52 This document will contain all FDA and ICH-required elements, as well as other elements 
required by ethics committees, if ap plicable, or as per country legal requirements.  The informed 
consent (or assent form, if app licable) form must be in a lan guage understandable to the subject 
or the subject’s parent(s) or le gal guardian(s) and must specify who informed the subject, the 
subject’s parent(s), or the subject’s legal guardian(s). 
After reading the informed consent document, th e subject or the subject ’s parent(s) or legal 
guardian(s) must give consent in writing.  Cons ent must be confirmed at the time of consent by 
the personally dated signature of  the subject, the subject’s parent(s) or the subject’s legal 
guardian(s) and by the personally dated signatur e of the person conducting the informed consent 
discussions. 
If the subject or the subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) is unable to read, oral presentation 
and explanation of the written informed consent form and information to be supplied must take 
place in the presence of an impartial witness.  Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent 
orally and by the personally dated signature of  the subject or by a local legally recognized 
alternative (eg, the subject’s thumbprint or ma rk) or by the personally dated signature of the 
subject’s parent(s) or th e subject’s legal guardian(s).  The witness and the person conducting the 
informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the informed consent document.  
It should also be recorded and dated in th e source document that consent was given. 
A copy of the signed and dated consent document(s) must be given to the s ubject or the subject’s 
parent(s) or the subject’s legal guardian(s).  The original signed and dated consent document will 
be retained by the investigator. The investigator will not undertak e any measures specifically requi red solely for the clinical 
study until valid consent has been obtained. A model of the informed consent form to be used  in this study will be provided to the sites 
separately from this protocol. 
11.5 Subject Confidentiality 
Subject names will not be supplied to the sponsor.  Only the subject number and subject initials 
will be recorded in the CRF, if applicable acco rding to local laws and regulation, and if the 
subject name appears on any other document, it must be obliterated before a copy of the 
document is supplied to the sponsor.  Study findi ngs stored on a computer will be stored in 
accordance with local data protection laws.  The subjects will be told that representatives of the sponsor, a designated CRO, the IRB/IEC, or regulatory authorities may inspect their medical 
records to verify the information collected, and th at all personal information made available for 
inspection will be handled in strictest confiden ce and in accordance with local data protection 
laws.  The investigator will maintain a personal subject identification list (subject numbers with 
the corresponding subject names) to enable records to be identified.

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 53 11.6 Study Monitoring 
Monitoring procedures that comply with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will be 
followed.  Review of the CRFs for complete ness and clarity, cross-checking with source 
documents, and clarification of administ rative matters will be performed. 
The study will be monitored by the sponsor or it s designee.  Monitoring will be performed by a 
representative of the sponsor (Clinical Study Monitor) who will review the CRFs and source 
documents.  The site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to 
protocol design and regulatory requirements by fr equent site visits and communications (letter, 
email, telephone, and facsimile). 
11.7 Case Report Forms and Study Records 
Case report forms (paper or electronic) are provided for each subject.  All forms must be filled out by authorized study personnel.  All corrections to the origin al CRF entry must indicate the 
reason for change.  The investigator is required to sign the CRF after all data have been captured 
for each subject.  If corrections ar e made after review and signature by the investigator, he or she 
must be made aware of the changes, and his or  her awareness documented by resigning the CRF.  
11.7.1  Critical Documents 
Before Shire HGT initiates the trial (ie, obtains in formed consent from the first subject), it is the 
responsibility of the investigator  to ensure that the following doc uments are available to Shire 
HGT or their designee: 
• Completed FDA Form 1572 (Statement of Inve stigator), signed, dated, and accurate. 
• Curricula vitae of investigator and sub-inve stigator(s) (current, da ted and signed within 
12 months of study initiation). 
• Copy of investigator(s) and s ub-investigator(s) current medi cal license (indicating license 
number and expiration date). 
• Signed and dated agreement of the final protocol. 
• Signed and dated agreement of a ny amendment(s), if applicable. 
• Approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC cl early identifying the documents reviewed by 
name, number and date of approval or re ap proval:  protocol, any amendments, Subject 
Information/Informed Consent Form, and any other written information to be provided 
regarding subjects recruitment procedures. 
• Copy of IRB/IEC approved Subject Informati on/Informed Consent Form/any other written 
information/advertisement (with IRB a pproval stamp and date of approval).

Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 54 Regulatory approval and notifica tion as required must also be  available; these are the 
responsibility of Shire HGT. 
11.8 Data and Safety Mo nitoring Board 
In view of the role of bradykinin and B2 recep tors in reproductive development, the study will 
use an external Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  The DSMB will provide an 
ongoing, independent review and assessment of the sa fety data to protect th e interests and safety 
of subjects participating in th e study.  The DSMB will adhere to a prospectively determined 
charter which will be proposed by Shire HGT and approved by the DSMB.  The charter will define the membership of the DSMB, the responsi bilities of the DSMB and Shire HGT, describe 
the conduct of meetings, and define  the data to be reviewed.   
Enrollment of pediatric subjects in the proposed st udy will be stratified into  2 groups (2 years of 
age to the older prepubertal ch ildren, and pubertal/postpubertal children to those 17 years of 
age).  It is planned that subjects in both groups  will receive an icatibant dose (0.4 mg/kg to a 
maximum dose of 30 mg) selected to target an exposure comparable to th at observed in adults 
treated with icatibant.  Initially, enrollment and dosing of  pubertal/postpubertal subjects will 
precede that of prepubertal subjects.  After the first 4 subjects in the pubertal/postpubertal group 
have been treated, icatibant concentration measurem ents and PK analysis, safety, and tolerability 
data will be reviewed and assessed by the DSMB .  This review must be completed prior to 
initiating enrollment of subjects in the prepubertal group.  As the outcome of its review, the 
DSMB may make a recommendation to continue en rolling subjects in th e pubertal/postpubertal 
group, to initiate dosing of  subjects in the prepubertal group, or to administer a different dose, or 
to terminate the study.  
11.9 Protocol Violations/Deviations 
The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol.  The protocol will not be initiated until the IRB/IEC and the appropr iate regulatory authorities have given 
approval/favorable opinion.  Modifications to the prot ocol will not be made without agreement 
of the sponsor.  Changes to the protocol will require written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion 
prior to implementation, except when the modifi cation is needed to eliminate an immediate 
hazard(s) to subjects.  The IRB/IEC may provide , if applicable regulatory authorities permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opinion  for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that 
have the approval/favorable opinion of the IRB/ IEC.  The sponsor will submit all protocol 
modifications to the regulatory authoritie s in accordance with the governing regulations. 
A record of subjects screened, but  not entered into the study, is al so to be maintained.  For any 
subject who does not meet the inclusion or ex clusion criteria a protocol exemption may be 
requested by the investigator.  This exempti on may be approved by the Shire Medical Monitor 
prior to enrollment and the protocol exception must be fully documented in the source documents and on the appropriate page of the CRF. 
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
subjects, the investigator will contact the sponsor  or its designee, if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action.   
Icatibant (Firazyr®) 
Clinical Trial Protocol: HGT-FIR-086 14 June 2011 
Shire Confidential 55 Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented as a protocol  deviation.  Protocol 
deviations will need to be reviewed by the me dical monitor and may also be required to be 
submitted to the IRB/IEC. 
Protocol modifications will only be initiated by the sponsor and must be approved by the 
IRB/IEC and submitted to the FDA or other applicab le international regulatory authority before 
initiation. 
11.10  Premature Closure of the Study 
If the sponsor, investigator, or regulatory authorities  discover conditions ar ising during the study 
which indicate that the clinical investigation sh ould be halted due to an unacceptable risk to 
subjects, the study may be terminated after appr opriate consultation betw een the sponsor and the 
investigator.  In addition, a decision on the pa rt of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue 
development of the investigational product may be made at any time.  Conditions that may 
warrant termination of the study or s ite include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or  unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study. 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent global regulations. 
• Submission of knowingly false information from  the study site to the sponsor or other 
pertinent regulatory authorities. 
• Insufficient adherence by the Invest igator to protocol requirements. 
 
11.11  Access to Source Documentation 
Regulatory authorities, the IRB/IEC, or the spons or may request access to all source documents, 
CRFs, and other study documentation for on-site a udit or inspection.  Di rect access to these 
documents must be guaranteed by the investigat or, who must provide support at all times for 
these activities.  Monitoring and auditing proced ures that comply with current GCP guidelines 
will be followed.  On-site review of the CRFs for completeness and clarity, cross-checking with source documents, and clarification of ad ministrative matters may be performed. 
11.12  Data Generation and Analysis 
The clinical database will be developed and main tained by a contract rese arch organization or an 
electronic data capture technol ogy provider as designated by Shire HGT.  Shire HGT or its 
designee will be responsible for performing study data management activities.  
AEs will be coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 8.1 or 
higher.  Concomitant medication will be code d using WHO-Drug Dictionary (2004, Q4).  
Centralized laboratories will be employed as desc ribed in the study manual to aid in consistent 
measurement of efficacy and safety parameters.

Shire Confidential 56 11.13  Retention of Data 
Essential documents should be retained until at  least 2 years after th e last approval of a 
marketing application and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications or 
at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinic al development of the 
investigational product.  The s ponsor will notify the investigator if these documents must be 
retained for a longer period of tim e.  It is the resp onsibility of the sponsor to inform the 
Investigator or institu tion as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. 
11.14  Financial Disclosure 
The investigator should disclose  any financial interests in the sponsor as described in 21 CFR 
Part 54 prior to beginning this study.  The approp riate form will be provided to the investigator 
by the sponsor, which will be signed and dated by th e investigator, pr ior to the start of the study, 
at the end of the study, and one y ear post-study (or site) closure.  
11.15  Publication and Disclosure Policy 
All information concerning the study material, such as patent applications, manufacturing 
processes, basic scientific data, and formula tion information supplied by the sponsor and not 
previously published are considered confidential and will remain the sole property of the sponsor.  The investigator agrees to use this information only in accomplishing this study and will not use it for other purposes. 
It is understood by the investigator that the information developed in the clinical study may be 
disclosed as required to the authorized regulatory authorities and govern mental agencies.  In 
order to allow for the use of the information deri ved from the clinical st udies, it is understood 
that there is an obligatio n to provide the sponsor with complete  test results and all data developed 
in the study in a timely manner. The investigator and any other clinical personnel associated with this study will not publish the 
results of the study, in whole or in part, at a ny time, unless they have consulted with Shire HGT, 
provided Shire HGT a copy of the draft document intended for publication, and obtained Shire 
HGT’s written consent for such publication.  All information obtained during the conduct of this 
study will be regarded as confidential.  Shir e HGT will use the information for registration 
purposes and for the general development of the drug.

Submitter's commentary: 
The Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R) was adapted from th e 
Faces Pain Scale (Bieri et al, 1990) in order to make it possibl e 
to score on the widely accepted 0-to-10 metric. It shows a clos e 
linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the ag e 
range 4 through 16 years. It is easy to administer and require s 
no equipment except for the photocopied faces. The absence of 
smiles and tears in this faces scale may be advantageous. Th e 
FPS-R is recommended for use with younger children in parallel with numerical self-rating scales (0-to-10) for older children an d 
behavioural observation scales for those unable to provide self -
report.

Faces Pain Scale – Revised  (FPS-R)  From Pediatric Pain Sourcebook , www.painsourcebook.ca  
Version: 7 Aug 2007  CL von Baeyer 
In the following instructions, say "hurt" or "pain," whichever seem s right for a particular child.  
"These faces show how much so mething can hurt. This face  [point to left-most face]  shows no pain. The faces show 
more and more pain [point to each from left 
to right]  up to this one [point to right-most face]  – it shows very much pain. 
Point to the face that shows how much you hurt  [right now] ." 
Score the chosen face 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so '0' = 'no pain' and '10' = 'very much pain.'  Do not use  words 
like 'happy' and 
'sad'. This scale is intended to measure how children feel inside, not how their face looks.

"Ces visages montrent combien on peut avoir mal. Ce visage (montrer celui de gauche)  montre quelqu’un qui n’a pas 
mal du tout. Ces visages (les montrer un à un de gauche à droite)  montrent quelqu’un qui a de plus en plus mal, jusqu’à 
celui-ci (montrer celui de droite) , qui montre quelqu’un qui a tr ès très mal. Montre-moi le visage qui montre combien tu 
as mal en ce moment."  
Les scores sont de gauche à droite : 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. 0 correspond donc à “pas mal du tout” et 10 correspond à “très très mal ”.  
Exprimez c

Title of Study:  A Phase 3,  Randomized, Double -blind, Parallel -group, Placebo -controlled, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of KarXT in Acutely 
Psychotic Hospitalized Adults with DSM -5 Schizophrenia  
Protocol Number:  KAR -009 
Study Sites:  Approximately 10 sites in the United States  and 10 sites in Ukraine  
Phase of Development:  Phase  3 
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride [ xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in reducing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia.  
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
 To evaluate the reduction of PANSS positive score in subject s 
treated with KarXT versus placebo  
 To evaluate the improvement in Clinical Global Impression -Severity 
(CGI -S) results in subject s treated with KarXT versus placebo  
 To evaluate the reduction of PANSS negative score in  subject s 
treated with KarXT versus placebo  
 To evaluate the reduction of PANSS Marder Factor negative 
symptoms score in subject s treated with KarXT versus placebo  
 To evaluate the safety and tolera bility of KarXT  
 To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of xanomeline and trospium 
after administration of KarXT in adults who are acutely psychotic 
with a DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia  
Exploratory Objective:  
The exploratory objective of the study is to  evaluate the single nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) regarding schizophrenia subtypes and SNPs related to 
drug metabolism .

Study Design:  This is a Phase 3  randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter inpatient study in adults who are 
acutely psychotic with a DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subject s 
will be randomized  (1:1 ratio)  to receive either KarXT or placebo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Subjects will start o n a lead -in dos e of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50  mg/trospium 20 mg) BID  for the first 
2 days (Days  1 and 2) followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 
100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week  1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards t o KarXT 125/30 BID 
unless the subject  is continuing to experience AEs from the previous 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subject s who were increased 
to KarXT 125/30  BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, 
will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20  BID for the remainder 
of the treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) 
of the study and may be decreased for tolerability reasons no more than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 
BID may  not occur outside of the p ermitted visit window for 
Visit  5/Day  8. 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed 
for all those subjects who d o not ro llover in to the long -term open -label 
study KAR -008.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  7 of 92 The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophreni a subjects with acute psychosis will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and 
secondary endpoints at Week 5 from  baseline compared with placebo. 
The endpoints are set up as a hierarchical list and step down through 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marde r Factor score, CGI -S, 
and percentage of PANSS responders will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is sign ificant at the 0.05 alpha level (P  ≤ 0.05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key secondary 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, then formal statistical 
testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Treatment Duration:  Total study duration is up to 8 weeks, including a 7 -day screening phase (up 
to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is  allowed, if necessary) , a 
5-week treatment period , and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR -008 study) . Subjects completing this study will have 
the opti on of rolling over into a long -term open -label study (KAR -008) in 
which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy  Assessments : PANSS total score, PANSS positive score , PANSS negative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score,  and CGI -S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits . 
Safety  Assessments : Spontaneous AEs, cholinergic symptoms,  SAS, BARS , AIMS, body weight, 
body mass index , waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical 
laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, 
urinalysis, and drug screen), prolactin levels, physical examination, and 
C-SSRS will be evaluated throughout the study as scheduled.  
Pharmacokinetic  Assessments : AUC , Cmax, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population : All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population.  
Modified ITT (mITT) population : All subjects who are randomized, received 
at least 1 dose of study drug,  have a baseline PANSS assessment , and at least 
1 postbaseline PANSS  assessment will be included in the mITT population 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis.  
Safety population : All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in the safety 
analysis.  
PK population : All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will b e 
included in the PK population and will be used in the PK analysis. Subjects 
must have  received at least 1 dose of active study drug and have at least 
1 measurable plasma  concentration  of study drug .  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 
PANSS total score at Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo  
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures.  The key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in PA NSS 
positive score, PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor 
score , CGI-S score , and percentage of PANSS responders at Week  5. The 
statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will 
account for multiplicity by using a f ixed sequence testing procedure. This 
testing procedure will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested.  
Assuming the treatment difference in the change from baseline in PANSS 
total score at Week 5 is 8 points betwee n KarXT and placebo (standard 
deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 172 subjects  (86 evaluable 
subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  20 of 92 5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long -term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive abilit y[1]. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United States  (US)  population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5.1  per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs) [5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. First-
generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with  these agents is marked 
by high rates of parkinsonian extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia , and they 
consequently have limited use today. The second -generation agents that include risperidone, 
olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasi done, aripiprazol e, and lumateperone tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD class. However, 
the second -generation drugs also have problematic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic dis turbances, sedation , and akathisia [6, 7, 8]. These side effects contribute to 
poor medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospitalizations [9, 10]. Thus there 
is a need for medications for schizophrenia which  act through alternative mechanisms.  
Central m uscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1 -M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to 
the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease  [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by the occ urrence of AEs associated with peripheral cholinergic side effects 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on  KarXT  (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospium  Chloride)  
Xanomeline tartrate  is a muscarinic -cholinergic receptor agon ist. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M 1 and M 4 receptors  and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects 
(Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very potent M 4 muscarinic Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  21 of 92 agonist in vivo, measured by various second messenger assays [14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapidly achieving a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate [15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action  is unrelated to direct dopamine invo lvement.  
Previous double -blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy.  In a multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) a nd placebo were assessed for 
26 weeks [16, 17]. Significant dose -dependent improvement s in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placeb o were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapidly in subject s who 
were symptomatic at baseline and a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive imp rovement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive 
enhancement [16, 17]. In a subsequent small (N  = 20) double -blind, placebo -controlled inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relati vely rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed [18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “ pro-cholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by 
xanomeline’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic  treatment. 
Trospium chloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes [19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and by European authorities to treat 
overactive bladder and is generally well tolerated [19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospium does not appreciably cross the blood brain barrier, consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure [20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospium chloride. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of trospium would mitigate peripheral procholinergic s ide effects 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating and hyper -salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers o f this combination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone [21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AE s were generally mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature, 
often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single -episode. In general, Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  22 of 92 KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These encouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia and potentially other CNS 
disorders.  
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well -controlled, randomized, multi -center 
Phase  2, placebo -controlled, inpatient clinical trial of acute psyc hosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subject s (KAR -004). KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001), with statistical separation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4 , and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability.  
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy o f KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg) administered twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnosis of schizophrenia . A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.  
Xanomeline is currently not approved or m arketed in any country. Trospium is marketed in the 
US and other regions of the world for the treatment of overactive bladder.  
 Nonclinical Studies  
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB).  
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice and rats. All animals w ere 
observed for 2 weeks for mortality and clinical signs of intolerance, and then necropsied for 
gross examinations. In -life findings attributed to the test articl e included excessive 
muscarinic -mediated pharmacology, such as excessive salivation, hypoact ivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typically 
appearing normal by Day s 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy were generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous -filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing).  
KarXT -301 was a 14 -day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats where relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospium were given, with either xanomeline alone or in combination with 
trospium. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were a dministered either vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (split into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospium combination dosages  of 150/200 mg/kg/day or 
225/400  mg/kg/day, respectively (split into BID  doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma after the first and last doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in support of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target -organ toxicity revealed by clinical pathology or by gross or microscopic 
assessments. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  23 of 92 No dose -related ophthalmic observations were noted. Findings were not indicative of speci fic 
target organ toxicity. In short, no new hazard was identified.  
Clinical observations noted in most animals  administered 300 mg/kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral discharge, dilated pupils, irregular or labored respiration, and rough h air 
coat, among other observations. These findings are generally consistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three  TK animals in the low -dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combinati on treatment effects versus the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed to these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), then they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no microscopic evidence of toxicity was seen in any toxicity animals  
in this group or in the higher -dose combination group.  
Three  toxicology and 3 TK animal  deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high -dose combination 
group. Two toxicology animals h ad evidence of gavage accidents. For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined , and a test article -related effect cannot be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of esophageal muscular  is indicated some dosing -related trauma. If 
gavage accidents we re involved, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ microscopic findings in GI tract or any other tissue of any animal, 
including the early death toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics -mediated re duction in GI  motil ity is consistent with the anti -muscarinic 
effects of trospium on intestinal musculature. Fecal retention, malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deterioration followed with continued dosing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose c ombination animals that survived led to rapid recovery, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics -related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any 
xanomeline -alone group. The lack of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any earl y death or 
surviving animal implies that the adverse effects were pharmacologically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity.  
Twenty -eight Day Repeat -Dose Studies with Xanomeline in Rats and Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0 %, 0.05 %, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monkeys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body weight in the high dose group, increases in gamma -glutamyl -
transferase, chole sterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), and lower serum globulin (females). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrhe a, hypoactiv ity, 
weight loss, and treatment -related tachycardia in the high -dose animals.  
Forty -Day Repeat Dose Study of KarXT in R ats (KarXT -302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were given vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 m g/kg/day, trospium alone at 100  mg/kg/day, 
or xanomeline/trospium combination at doses of 75/50 mg/kg/day or 150/100 mg/kg/day, with Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  24 of 92 all doses split into BID doses. Satellite rats (TK animals) were included for collection of plasma 
after the first and last doses to determine conce ntrations of each drug. Dosing was initially 
planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxicity was seen. Safety findings included pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the t rospium alone and combination groups and mild biliary hyperplasia in the 
high-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4 unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high -dose xanomeline alone group (150 g/kg/d ay) and 2 in the high -dose 
combi nation group (150  mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospium). Both 
xanomeline -only animals had necropsy gross findings of a gavage accident , and cause of death 
could not be determined. All toxicology animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. Sp onsor 
considers that the volume depletion and trauma of multiple bleeds (3 per animal) , followed by 
reduced absorption of fluids and nutrients secondary to reduced GI motility with continued BID 
dosing explains the greater demise of TK animals relative to toxicity animals.  
Based on the results of the 90 -day rat toxicology study, oral administration of trospium chloride 
and xanomeline tartrate alone or in combination to Crl:CD  (SD) rats BID (12 hours ±  60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 and 50 mg/kg/d ose trospium chloride, 37 and 75  mg/kg/dose 
xanomeline tartrate , and a combination of 37/25, 75/25 , and 75/50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospium chloride for a minimum of 90 days resulted in minimal to moderate bile duct 
hyperplasia in the livers of t he xanomeline tartrate and combination (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospium chloride) group males. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when comparing the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combination group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50  mg/kg/dose

terminal euthanasia. The bile duct hyperplasia was considered adverse in the h igh-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group males and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no -observed -adverse -effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 37 mg/kg /dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25  mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospium chloride. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium, 146,000 
pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg •hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day  91. At these dosages  for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 9230 
pg•hr/mL for trospium ; 267,000 pg •hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 16,700 + 171,000  pg•hr/mL for 
trospium  + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in females 
cannot be explained from differences in drug exposure. At the recovery euthanasia, bile duct 
hyperplasia was still present but was limited to minimal severity , and there was a decreased 
incidence in b oth the xanomeline tartrate and combination group males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combination groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased incidence/severity, in combination with the improved histolog ic 
appearance of bile ducts at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smaller/flattened epithelium, 
noninflammatory, and an absence of portal bridging), changes at the recovery euthanasia were Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

liver enzyme elevations, bile acid alterations or hepatocellular degeneration, necrosis or 
regeneration, and with the apparent reversibility after cessation of treatment, these findings 
appear to have been tolerable by the affe cted animals. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose 
was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 75  mg/kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospium chloride. For 
males, corresponding  mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium ; 
822,000  pg•hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For females, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230  pg•hr/mL for trospium ; 2,090,000  pg•hr/mL for xanomeline ; and 17,600 + 
950,000  pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91.  
In summary, no new  findings on the  “combination” of xanomeline and trospium (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerations of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomeline or trospium at high doses. 
Target organ findings with xanomeline alone were limited to biliary hyperplasia in the 28 -day rat 
study but not the 2 8-day or 12 -month  monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT, biliary hyperplasia was not observed in the 14 -day rat 
study but was reported in the 40 -day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre -neoplastic lesions, because they were  of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary -related 
serum chemi stry.  
 Completed Clinical Studies  
Refer to the IB for complete information regarding previous clinical studies conducted with 
xanomeline by Eli Lilly, and studies KAR -001, KAR -002, KAR -003, and KAR -004 conducted 
by Karuna Therapeutics  using xanomeline with  trospium . 
To date, more than 750 subjects or volunteers have been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospium, or as the combination drug KarXT ) in 
18 completed clinical studies conducted either by Eli Lilly or Karuna Therapeutics , some for as 
long as 3  years.  In those studies, significant improvements in cognition and reduced psychotic 
symptoms were observed.  
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pilot study, the effects of xanomeline were examined in 20  subjects with  schizophrenia 
utilizing a double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4 -week study design. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly better than subjects in the placebo group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24 -point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group showed improvements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domains of verbal learning and short -term memory function. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

cognition across multiple subject populations.  
Study H2Q -EW-E001, conducted by Lilly, had 36 male healthy volunteers in 4  groups of 9, who 
were administered escalating single doses of xanomeline tart rate in increments of 1, 5, 10, 25, 
50, 75, 100 mg , and 150 mg. Each group took 2 ascending doses of xanomeline tartrate and 
1 dose of placebo in a single subject blind manner. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). AEs 
included watery diarrhea, nausea, dizzine ss, sweating, shivering, mild disorientation, increased 
blood pressure (BP), increase in sitting and standing heart rate, slight increase in supine systolic 
BP, and postural hypotension.  
The clinical experience with KarXT initiated by Karuna Therapeutics t o date includes 
3 completed Phase 1, clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (KAR -001, KAR -002, 
and KAR -003) and one completed  Phase 2 study (KAR -004) in adult  inpatients with DSM -5 
schizophrenia.  
The first study conducted b y Karuna, KAR -001 wa s “A Phase 1 , double -blind, randomized , 
multiple -dose, pilot s tudy comparing  xanomeline  administered alone to xanomeline a dministered  
in combination with trospium chloride in n ormal healthy v olunte ers.” This study consisted of 
2 arms, in which xanomeline w as administered TID, alone, at a total daily dose of 225 mg in one 
arm, and the second arm received the same dose of xanomeline in combination with trospium 
chloride 20 mg administered BID, a total daily dose of 40 mg. Subjects were treated for 7 days. 
The goal was to determine whether this dosing regimen would reduce the cholinergic side effects 
of xanomeline by co -administration of the muscarinic antagonist, trospium.  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 m g daily + trospium 40 mg daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and well tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (although not statistically significant) in visual analog scale ( VAS ) 
scores for cholin ergic events for the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the 
xanomeline alone treatment arm. Specifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm was observed for the supportive endpoints of 
maximum weekly individual VAS scores and mean daily maximum composite VAS scores.  
Results of the clinician -administered scales were supportive of a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and sweating that interfered with daily activiti es in the 
xanomeline  + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm.  
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in heart rate , resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment a rms had transient increases in heart rate  and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone arm) experienced syn cope. The incidence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one -half that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  27 of 92 The most commonly reported treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) in KAR -001 ( ≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were hyperh idrosis, salivary hypersecretion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences of these 5 TEAEs was higher in the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with x anomeline 225 mg combined with trospium chloride 40  mg 
administered over 7 days was considered safe and well -tolerated. The observed side effect profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospium chloride. The incidence 
of TEAE s and cholinergic TEAEs was lower in the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm 
compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm.  
Study KAR -002 was a Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, multiple -dose adaptive design pilot 
study to evaluate the safety and tolerab ility of KarXT in normal healthy volunteers. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID or placebo. The first cohort of this 
study was stopped after 1.5 days when the US FDA put the program on hold due to a preliminary 
rat finding in t he 14 -day study. This study used a new formulation of KarXT in which 
xanomeline and trospium were combined into a single dose form and given BID. Safety findings 
included an increase in orthostatic complaints. Caution should be used in drawing conclusions 
from this study, as subjects did not have time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as 
only 3  doses were given.  
Study KAR -003 was a Phase 1, double -blind, randomized, multiple -dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT in normal healthy 
volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarXT at various dose combinations, administered BID . Subjects 
received either KarXT or placebo (3:1 ratio). All subjects on KarXT received 2 days of 50 mg 
xanomeline + 20  mg trospium  BID, and then increased to different  doses for Days 3 to 7. This 
study also used the new formulation of KarXT in which xanomeline and trospium were 
combined into a single dosage  form and given BID.  
There was a relatively high degree of variability in xanomeline and trospium exposures between 
individuals in all cohorts, which is consistent with previous results with KarXT, 
xanomeline -alone, and trospium -alone.  Peak plasma concentrations were observed at a median 
time of 2.0  hours for xanomeline and 1.0 hour for trospium across all treatment groups and study 
days.  
Although there was insufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of 
trospium on the pharmacokinetics  (PK)  and bioavailability of xanomeline, or the impact of 
xanomeline on the PK and bioavailability of trospium, the PK results suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK behavior of the other drug.  
During th e 2-day lead -in phase, the most common AEs (≥20% of subjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that 
completed dosing, although the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the KarXT 100/20 BID Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  28 of 92 (66.7%) group compared to KarXT 125/40 group (88.9%) , the incidence of cholinergic TEAEs 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) was similar between the 2 groups . 
The most commonly reported TEAEs (20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, dyspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria.  For the treatment groups that did not complete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were generally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing.  
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur primarily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospium BID (KarXT 150/40  BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID , suggesting to consider slightly lowering 
the trospium dose from 40 mg BID in future studies . All TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs or deat hs. T reatment -emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few anticholinergic). Doses of 100 mg and 125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospium, respectively. The safety and 
tolerability p rofile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID was acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar doses in future studies. Doses of KarXT 150/20 BID and 
150/40  BID were not well tolerated in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg 
trospium appeared to be better tolerated than 150/20, but some subjects still experienced 
tolerability issues.  
Study KAR -004 was a Phase 2 randomized, double -blinded study to assess the safety 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM -5 schizophr enia, hospitalized with acute 
psychosis. The primary objective of the study was to assess the ef ficacy of KarXT 125 /30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS total scores in adult inpatients with a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either K arXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/20 BID for the first 2 days 
followed by KarXT 100/20 BID on Days  3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30  BID unle ss the subject was continuing to experience AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/20  BID. The clinical portion of this study was completed and clinical study 
report is in progress. No new safety concerns have arisen during this study . 
The KAR -004 trial re sults are unambiguous regarding efficacy, where not only the primary 
outcome measure showed a robust separation from placebo, but the additional sensitivity and 
secondary outcome measures were consistently robust as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction s in total 
PANSS score s at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001) in the modified intent -to-treat 
(mITT ) population. The KarXT group showed a n adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to a n adjusted  mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS  score  (Figure 1). Substantia l significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; moreover, the difference appears 
to be widening with each successive timepoint. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the primary Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Another Phase 3 study (KAR -007) is planned  at approximately 20 study sites in the US. 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT  and Study Rationale  
The risks and benefits of KarXT in humans are not fully known . KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trospium.  The available clinical trial data indicate that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs . Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful  EPS 
changes . In contrast, these serious side  effects pose a significant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead to discontinuation of treatment and sig nificant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration quality pivotal trial in 182 subjects met the primary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo ( -17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 placebo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reduction in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points ( Weeks 2, 4 , and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0. 75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demonstrated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive symptom subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores , and CGI-S scores.  
More tha n 750 subjects or volunteers have been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
formulation , either alone, in combination with trospium, or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revealed any specific contraindications to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic related effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sweating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The addition of trospium decreases 
the peripheral cho linergic effect of xanomeline creating a better tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT.  
Trospium chloride has been marketed in the US for 12 years. The most frequently reported AEs 
reported in pivotal tri als were dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, urinary Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

In a Phase 2 (K AR-004) c linical study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophren ia in subjects with acute psychosis  after treatment for 28  days. KarXT 
also showed an acceptable safety profile with the  most  common TEAEs being constipation, 
nausea,  dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic disorder) was reported by a single subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study.  KarXT was generally well -tolerated and found to be safe in this patient 
population.  
KarXT represents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningful alternative to current therapies. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population  by advancing to Phase 3 trials . 
Subjects assigned to active study drug may benefit by improvement in schizophreni a symptoms.  
Since subjects will be having an acute psychotic event, subjects will be hospitalized where the 
clinical staff is available to help them 24 hours a day. In addition, the inpatient setting represents 
an important venue for research , examining the effects o f KarXT and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible, subjectivity and bias. Furthermore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adherence.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan  
This Phase  3, randomized, double -blind , parallel -group, placebo -controlled, multicenter,  
inpatient clinical study in adults who are  acutely psychotic with  a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and secondary endpoints at 
Week 5 from baseline compared with placebo. Total study durati on is up to 8 weeks, including a 
7-day screening phase (up to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to 
KAR -008 study). Subjects com pleting this study will have the opt ion of rolling over into a 
long-term open -label study (KAR -008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Screening Period :  
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a  
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US  and 10 sites in Ukraine . Subjects will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1  ratio to receive either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5  weeks.  
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all subjects assigned to KarXT will start on a lead -in dose of 
KarXT  50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg /trospium 20 mg) BID for th e first 2 days  (Days 1 and 2)  
followed by KarXT  100/20  (xanomeline 100 mg /trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless 
the subject is continuing to experience AEs from t he previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All 
subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and 
tolerability, will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of the 
treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerability reasons no more than once during the study. In addition, dose 
escalation to KarXT  125/30 BID may not occur outside of the p ermitted visit window for 
Visit  5/Day 8.   
All randomized  subjects will have structured diagnostic interview sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study  (see Schedule of Assessments Table  2). Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed.  
Efficacy assessments (PANSS score s and CGI -S score) will be assessed at scheduled visits. 
Refer to Section 11 for more details.  
Safety will be assessed through spontaneous AEs, cholinergic symptoms, cognition testing, S AS, 
BARS , AIMS, body weight, BMI, waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Details on PK assessments  are provided  in Section 13. 
Safety Follow -up Period : 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed for all those subjects who 
do not rollover into the long -term open -label study KAR -008. 
An Inde pendent Safety Monitoring Committee (ISMC) will be responsible for reviewing on a

 Page  40 of 92 7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
A randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study design is suitable for 
conductin g any interventional studies. This design will minimize bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safety parameters of the investigational drug.  
Schizophrenia is a long -term mental disorder which requires a chronic therapy.  A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered an acceptable treatment duration to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint can be achieved) . The 5 -week treatment duration is substantiated 
by the statistically significant outcome of the KAR -004 study of the same duration.  
7.3 End of Study  
A subject  will have fulfilled the requi rements for study completion when the  subject  has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study  visit (Visit 10/Day 35  (End of 
Treatment)  for subject s who roll over into KAR -008 or Visit 11/ Day 42 (Follow -up) for subject s 
who do not roll over into the KAR -008 study ) as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2) in accordance with the protocol . 
Subject s completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a long -term open -label 
study (KAR -008) in which every subject  will receive KarXT.  
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for subjects 
who d o not rollover in to the long -term open -label study.  
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety data from the clinical study. This 
committee will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new toxicities that might be 
involv ed with KarXT.  
The reviews will be of unblinded data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important safety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the details of the types of data to be  reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no triggers), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  44 of 92 8.3 Rescreening  
Individuals who sign the  informed consent form  (ICF) to participate in the study  but who do not 
subsequently meet all the requirements for safety laboratory assessments  and therefore do not 
enroll  (screen failures)  may be rescreened , upon approval of the medical monitor on a case by 
case basis . Such individual s may be allowed to rescreen up to 1 time.  When re -testing within the 
same screening procedure, only the exclusio nary laboratory tests will be repeated once in case 
the exclusionary laboratory result was not due to a pathological condition and was occasional 
(except for individuals who have positive serology results).  
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects  
If a subject  discontinues study treatment and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report form (e CRF ). Subject s who 
complete or discontinue early from the study will be discharged  from  the study site , if clinically 
warranted  after completing all the Visit 10/early termination  assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). 
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for those 
subjects who d o not roll over into the long -term open -label study KAR -008. 
In the event that a subject  discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or 
baseline  values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clinically 
significant.  
Once a subject  is withdrawn from the study, the subject  will not re -enter the study.  
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study  at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following:  
 progressive disease  
 unacceptable toxicity or AE  
 subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a  subject ’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request or on the basis o f the investigator’s clinical judgment.  The 
reason for  subject  withdrawal will be noted on the eCRF.  
 intercurrent illness:  a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study  
 general or specific changes in the  subject ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject  has need for a 
medication prohibited by the protocol)  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  45 of 92  subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance  [if a study 
subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row] )  
 violation of entry criteria; ie, subject s who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria  
 development of suicidal or assaultive behavior  
 alcohol or illegal drug use  
 pregnancy, as indicated in Section  12.7.7 . Any study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study treatment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term.  
 Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study.  
Subject s wit hdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subject s who completed the stud y. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subject s who leave the unit or are lost to follow -up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of 
study will be followed until the AE is resolved  (regardless of w hether they enroll in the 
long-term open -label study KAR -008) or the subject  is considered to be in stable condition.  
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making further treatment of subject s 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination.  
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospium chloride have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despite the risk (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C).  
Therefore, women of childbearing potential in this study must be willing to use a highly effective 
method of birth control  (see APPENDIX 1  for a list of acceptable highly effective methods of 
contraception) during the study and for 7 days after the last dose of study drug . Females of 
childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at screening and a urine pregnancy test 
on Day 1 (before receiving KarXT) and Day 35.   
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on the developing 
human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient ef fects.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  46 of 92 Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment 
of the mother with KarXT , women who are breastfeeding must not be enrolled in the study.  
The effects of study drug on sperm are unknown. Men who are wil ling to participate  in the study 
must agree to use a highly effective  method of birth control ( see APPENDIX 1  for a list of 
acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) and must not impregnate a sexual  partner 
during or for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. They must also agree to refrain from 
sperm donation for 90 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Female subject s of child -bearing potential will be instructed that known or suspected pregn ancy 
occurring during the study should be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a female 
subject  becomes pregnant, the investigator must withdraw her from the study without delay. The 
subject  must not receive any further doses of the study drug . Upon discontinuation  from the 
study , only those procedures that would not expose the pregnant female subject  to undue risk 
will be performed . See Section 12.7.7  for further reporting and monitoring details.  
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form) of the eCRF, or 
a pregnancy  report will be completed if the subject has completed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted on the  Pregnancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using 
the same procedure as described for reporting SAE (Section 12.7.4 ). 
8.5 Completion of the Study or Lost to Follow -up 
The study will be completed when all subject s have completed their study -related procedures in 
accordance w ith the protocol.  
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact subject s who leave the facility and are lost to 
follow -up to obtain end of study information. Details regarding follow -up efforts are to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records/source  documentation.  
8.6 Study Termination  
The availability of any new adverse safety information related to KarXT may result in stopping 
the study. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent E thics Committee (IEC) /Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take such actio ns. If the study is terminated for safety reasons, subjects 
will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow -up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subject s, and IEC/ IRB will be 
informed about the reason for such action. Similarly, if the Sponsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the IEC/ IRB, and the subject s of the reason for such an action. Similar 
notifications will be sent by the IEC/ IRB if it  takes such an action.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

9.1 Details of Study Treatments  
KarXT is formulated as hard hydroxypropyl methylcellulose oral capsules containing 2 distinct 
populations of drug beads, one of which is loaded with xanomeline tartrate and the other of 
which is  loaded with trospium chloride. Each capsule contains the freebase equivalent of 
xanomeline and trospium according to the desired dose strength. In addition to the active 
ingredients, the drug beads contain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The beads are n ot coated 
and are formulated for immediate release of the active ingredients.  
 Identity of Study Treatments  
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish orange -white, opaque, and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be prepared in matching capsules ; 
therefore , an unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense study agent at each day of 
dosing. For the 2 -day lead -in period (Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will 
receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 B ID, followed by 2 capsules of KarXT 50/10 mg  BID or a

Further details on l abelling of investigational products will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 Study Drug Storage  
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature  15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel.  
 Study Drug Retention  
Study drug  not used in KAR -009 may be used for the long -term extension study (KAR -008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study  must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program , and written authorization from the Sponso r has been 
received. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified 
by Sponsor. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, an d that appropriate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully 
accounted for by the study monitor.  
9.2 Dose  Schedule  
The first dose of the study drug will be administered in the morning of Day  1. For subjects who 
roll over to Study KAR -008, the last dose will be administered in the evening of Visit 10 
(Day  35 -2 days). Subjects who do not rollover to Study KAR -008 study  will have the last dose 
of the study drug administered in the evening before  Visit 10 (Day 35  -2 days ). The study drug 
should be administered daily BID on an empty stomach  (ie, at least 1 hour before a meal)  or 2 to 
3 hours after a meal. Some considerations for dosing and PK blood withdrawals are provided in 
the subsections below.  
 Visit 2 b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing  
 The first dose will be administered in the morning , and the evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose .  
 All subject s must be administered 4 dosages  of the KarXT 50/20  or placebo before dose 
escalation  to KarXT 100/20  BID. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  49 of 92 
 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays  
 When Day 3 occurs on a weekend, it is expected that the complete Visit 3 will be 
performed , and the subject ’s dose will be escalated on Day 3 . 
 If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated  until the study visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20  or placebo before escalating  
to KarXT  100/20 or placebo.  
 This may res ult in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo dose at Visit  5/Day 8, 
which is acceptable.  
 All subject s must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20  or placebo before dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID . 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK Considerations and Visit 8 /Day 28  PK 
Considerations  
 If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is confirmed by investigator 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for serial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table  2, 
Footnote  p). 
 Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must  accompan y the 
actual day of dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
 For Visit 8 , serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject ’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses ; there fore, Visit 8 should 
occur at least 7 days after Visit 7 is completed , and there  must be  no changes in dose for 
at least 7 days leading up to Visit 8. PK sampling  must accompany the actual day of 
Visit 8  if a window is used . 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing  
 Subjects willing to rollover in to Study KAR -008 will continued to be dosed at 
Visit  10/Day 35 , and their last dose will be the evening of Visit 10.  These subjects will 
start their at-home dosing on Day 1 of Study KAR -008. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject 
identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  50 of 92 associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject  who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Subject Number. This 9-digit 
number will consist of a  t3-digit study code and a 3-digit site identification  followed by a 3 -digit 
number assigned sequentially wi thin each site, starting at .  
On Day -1, all eligible subject s will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either KarXT or 
placebo groups. Subject s will be assigned a randomization number through the IWRS, in 
accordance with the randomization code gener ated by the authorized personnel at  VERISTAT . 
At the study site, the randomization schedule will only be accessible to authorized unblinded 
pharmacy personnel or designee. Once a randomization number is allocated to one subject , it 
may not be assigned to another subject  even if the former discontinued the study.  
 Blinding  
An IWRS will allocate treatment based on a prespecified randomization list generated by  
VERISTAT . Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each  site participating in 
the study . For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance  (see Section 9.1.2 ). No other study site personnel  (except the pharmacist or other 
designated unblinded individual) , subject s, informants /caregiver s, Sponsor personnel , or Sponsor 
designees  (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor)  will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study  unless unblinding is required . Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the sub ject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject ’s study treatment, that  subject  will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be 
discontinued; approval from  the Sponsor /medical monitor must be obtained in such instances.  
VERISTAT  will generate and maintain the security of the randomization code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject ’s safety  or wellbeing,  the investigator may break the randomization code for just that 
subject  via the IWRS , by which system the unblinding will be captured  after consultation and 
agreement with the medical monitor/Sponsor . The unblinding and its cause will  also be 
documented in the eCRF.  Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study.  
If an AE is thought to be related to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investigational t reatment and/or treat the subject . Subject  withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject has an AE that requires that the investigator be unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study 
medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in the subject ’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: I n most circumstances , it is not necessary to unblind a Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

appropriate course of action is to stop the inv estigational drug and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE.  
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the safety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose  Modification  
Subject s will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  2). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous preclinical and 
clinical studies (see Section  5.2). Per the protocol , subject s will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and 7 and at unscheduled visits. No dose adjustments are allowed after 
Visit 7. No other dose modifications are permissible in this study except those specified in this 
protocol.  
9.5 Treatment A ccountability and Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated unblinded individual will maintain records of study treatment 
delivered to the study site , the inventory at the study site, the distribution to each subject , and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor  or designee  for storage or disposal.  These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subject s. 
Administration of study drug will be supervised by study site personnel to ensure compliance.  
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subject s were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply  and reconcile the products  received from the drug  
dispensing center.  Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor  or designee  until 
accountability has been fully monitored  through the end of the study . Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by the as signed unblinded study monitor.  
9.6 Prior and Concomitant  Therapy  
 Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Subject s will be asked for all prior medications he/she were taking up to 6 months before the 
study, up to the time of the first dose of study medication on Day  1. All prior medications will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Restricted prior therapies  are provided  in Section  8.2.  
All medications and other treatments taken by the subject  during the study, including those 
treatments initiated before  the start of the study, must be recorded on the eCRF.  
During the stud y (ie, from the time of enrollment at the screening visit until study completion), 
subject s will refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without the specific prior Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

could not hav e taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibitors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or any other 
psychoactive  medications except for anxiolytics that were taken on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
 Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could not have received a dose of 
medication for a t least 12 weeks ( 24 weeks for INVEGA TRIN ZA®).  
Note:  Please direct questions relating to prohibited medications to the Medical Monitor.  
 Concomitant  Medication s for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid  
Subject s are allowed to take benzodiazepines (up to 6  mg lorazepam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitatio n, and insomnia. Subject s may also use non -benzodiazepine medications 
(eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) as a sleep aid. Study sites must record the use of rescue medications in

d. A National Institute on Drug Abuse -5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be 
performed at screening and at Visit 2a (baseline) . If a subject leaves the study site , he/she should have  a urine drug screen and test for alcohol 
(breathalyzer or blood alcohol level) upon returning to the  study site .  
e. A complete physical examination includes body temperature (°C), general appearance, head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examination o f thorax and 
abdomen, assessment of cardiac, musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited neurolo gical  
examination.

subjects where it seems warranted, but this should  not be done  automatically.  
h. ECG on Day 1 will be done at 2 hours + 15 minutes post morning dose. ECGs  at all other scheduled visits will be performed before blood withdrawal for 
any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and QTcF  (msec)  
measurements should be obtained .  
i. Refer t o Table  3 for individual laboratory  tests.  
j. Optional COVID -19 test  may be performed at unscheduled visit s based on the Investigator’s discretion.  
k. Blood sample for prolactin must  be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug  at scheduled visits  (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests completed at Screening: anti -HCV antibody, HBV surface antigen, HBV c ore antibody, 
HIV-1 antibody, and HIV -2 antibody. If the subject tests positive for anti -HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain reaction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection.  
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subject s will be asked whether they have experienced constipation (per the ROME III criteria  and 
Bristol Stool Form scale ; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject  answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subject s to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant  
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not already an inpatient, the subject should be admitted to the inpatient  unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID  (first dose of study will be administered in the morning of Day 1, and evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose and after last PK sampling  [for Visits 5 and 8 ] is completed ), on an empty stomach  (ie, at least 
1 hour before a meal)  or 2 to 3 hours after a meal by the study staff, with the last dose admin istered on the evening before  Visit 10 for subjects who do 
not enter Study KAR -008. For  subjects rolling over to Study KAR -008, the last dose will be administered on the evening of Visit 10 . All subject s must 
receive at least 4 dos ages of the 50 /20 BID before dose escalation to  KarXT  100/20  BID.  
p. For Visit 5/Day 8 and Visit 8/Day 28, 7 PK blood draws are required: before the morning dose, and at 0.5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 5 minutes, 
2 hours  ± 10 m inutes, 4  hours ± 10 minutes, 8 hours ± 10 minutes , and 12 hours ± 10 minutes after the morning dose  (Note: The 12 -hour samples must 
be collected before administration of the evening dose ). PK blood draws at Visit 5 must be drawn in relation to the first dose of KarXT 125/30  for 
subject s who are escalated  in the morning of Visit 5 /Day 8 ±  2 days . PK blood must also be drawn in relation to the morning dose for subjects who are 
not escalated  at Visit 5 /Day 8 ±  2 days . For Visit 10/ET, a single PK blood sample should be drawn before  discharge (preferably in t he morning) for 
completed (and early termination) subjects. One PK blood sample may also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported d uring a scheduled visit 
or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reported during an unschedule d visit (no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to 
an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and should be drawn before  discharge.  
q. It should be performed before PANSS assessment.

any study -related procedures, the investigator (or designee) will obtain written informed consent 
from the subject .  
10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing s are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Asse ssments 
(Table  2). Section  12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatmen t unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table  2). 
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include  PANSS and CGI -S scores . 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs ; cholinergic 
symptoms ; cognition testing  (CANTAB) ; SAS; BARS ; AIMS ; body weight ; BMI; waist 
circumference ; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory assess ments (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen) ; prolactin levels ; physical examination ; and 
C-SSRS . 
PK assessments are described in Section 13 and include estimation of AUC , Cmax, and T max. 
The invest igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject  to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require  follow  up or are considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to the use of study drug.  The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  The assessments and procedures that may be  performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table  2). Additional assessments 
can be performed as needed, at the  discretion of the investigator , and after discussion with the

The Schedule of Assessments (Table  2) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing . 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale  
The PANSS is a clinician -administered scale used for measuring s ymptom severity of subject s 
with schizophrenia and is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy [23]. The PANSS 
rating form contains 7 positiv e symptom scales, 7  negative system scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. Subject s are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approximately 45 to 50  minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is the sum of all scales  with a minimum score of  30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Mard er Factor.  
It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments for all visits at which it is performed.   
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity  
The CGI -S is a rating scale  completed independently by a clinician  that is  used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subject s with mental disorders . It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of asse ssment. The modified CGI-S asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7 -point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline  
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating i s based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 
7 days.  As symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week , the score should reflect the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Safety assessments ( spontaneous AEs ; cholinergic symptoms ; cognition testing  [CANTAB ]; 
SAS; BARS ; AIMS ; body weight ; BMI ; waist circumference ; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; 
clinical laboratory assessments [hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, 
prolactin , and drug screen] ; physical examination ; and C -SSRS ) are to be performed at 
protocol -specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical  and Psychiatric  History  
Demographic data will be collected for all subject s at Screening.  The information to be captured 
include s date of birth (alternatively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity , which  will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be rec orded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the  subject ’s preexisting conditions , including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history  at screening. Medical 
history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within 1 year 
before  Screening . 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be documented as AEs on the eCRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically note worthy must be recorded as AEs.  
12.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic v ital signs ( systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). All vital signs will be measured 
supine and standing after 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study.  During treatment, beginning with Day 1 , orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning  dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator ’s discre tion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out -of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measu rements must be recorded as 
AEs.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

A complete physical examination ( body temperature, general appearance, 
head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examination of thorax and abdomen, assessment of cardiac, 
musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, pal pations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination ) will be performed at visits as specified in Table  2. Physical 
examinations will be performed by a physician.  
12.4 Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference  
Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table  2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
12.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table  2). During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained.  ECG at Day 1 will be  performed 2 hours (+ 
15 minutes ) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis.  
All the ECGs obtained will be interpreted by experienced independent blind ed reader (s) at the 
central laboratory.  
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject  from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.

analyzed by dipstick, and a microscopic analysis will be performed if the results of dipstick 
indicate abnormalities to be further investigated. All laboratory  reports must be reviewed, signed, 
and dated by the investigator. A legible copy of all reports must be filed with both the subject ’s 
eCRF and medical record (source document) for that visit. Any laboratory test result considered 
by the investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE (clinically significant 
AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant abnormal values occurring 
during the study will be followed up  with until repeat test results return to normal , stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant.   
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug -induced liver toxicity , detailed in 
Section  12.7.5 , during  the study.  
Other Laboratory Assessments : 
 A National Institute on Drug Abuse -5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be performed at screening and at 
Visit 2a (baseline) .  
 Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or blood alcohol test.  
 If a subject leaves the study site , he/she should have a urine drug screen test and test for 
alcohol (breathalyzer or blood alcohol test) upon returning to the study site . 
 Blood Sam pling for Pharmacogenetics  
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central laboratory facilit y, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The 
collection, storage, shipping, processing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be 
used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.  
The gene tic variants  to be analyzed may include SNPs and any other variants as deemed 
necessary by the Sponsor.

12.7 Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those relat ed to the indication under study) Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  65 of 92 present at screening will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinica lly significant laboratory abnormalities should also be 
recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject  enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical 
condition should  be reported in the subject ’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period , and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs will be elicited by asking the subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed  symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of  the study as soon as the results of the final lab oratory  tests 
are available.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of ev ent, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from th e 
time immediately after the administration of study drug on Day 1  until the End of Study (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over and Visit 11 for subjects who d o not roll over to Study KAR -008 
study)  or early termination . Follow  up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the ev ent should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events, version  5.0 (Grades 1 through 5).  
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug are given in 
Table  4 and Table  5. 
Table  4. Classification of Adverse Events by Int ensity  
MILD : An event that is easily tolerated by the  subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test  drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by the subject  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administ ered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could n ot readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those  AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of th e drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pat tern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy adminis tered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the test drug.

 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AEs of special interest will be monitored. AE of special interest is orthostasis . 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate.  
 Serious Adverse Events  
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor , 
that: 
 results in death,  
 is life -threatening , 
 results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization

 results in persistent or significant disability/ incapacity , and/or  
 is a cong enital anomaly/birth defect . 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs  if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject  and/o r require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting.  
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug  is administered , during the study , or 
within 1 week of stopping the treatment must be reported to the Catalyst Clinical Research  
Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor . Any such SAE due to any 
cause, wh ether or not related to the study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence 
or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made using email . 
Catalyst Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance email address  is:  
The event s must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and oth er documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug.  
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. The investigator must report all additional follow -up evaluations to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of becoming aware of the additional 
information or as soon as  is practicable . All SAEs will be followed up until the investigator and 
Sponsor  agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the  subject ’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilize s, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures.

Warnings and Precautions  
Risk of Urinary Retention : 
Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution to subjects with clinically 
significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention.  
Angioedema : 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with trospium chloride, the 
active ingredient in trospium chloride tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life 
threatening. If involvement of the  tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, trospium chloride 
should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided.  
Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility : 
Trospium should be admin istered with caution to subjects with GI obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastric retention. Trospium chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with conditions such as ulcer ative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis.  
Controlled Narrow -angle Glaucoma : 
In subjects being treated for narrow -angle glaucoma, trospium chloride should only be used if 
the potential benefits outweigh the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring.  
Central Nervous System Effects : 
Trospium chloride is associated with anticholinergic CNS effects. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects  should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

machinery until they know how trospium chloride affects them. If a subject experienc es 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered.  
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Renal Impairment : 
Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impai rment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in su bjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
 Pregnancy  
WOCBP  must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. After  administration of study drug, 
any known cases of pregnancy in female subject s will be reported until the subject  completes or 
withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by faxing/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor  (or designee) within 24  hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however , the investigator will follow up 
with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and must assess the outcome in the shortest 
possible time but not more than 30  days after completion of the pregnancy. The investigator 
should notify the Sponsor  (or desig nee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow -up 
pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved  spontaneous or therapeutic abortion 
(any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented ), stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or  congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the event by faxing /emailing  a 
completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor  (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event.  This event is considered a n SAE.  
Upon discontinuation from the study, o nly those procedures that would not expose the subject  to 
undue risk will be performed. The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring 
during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a subject is 
subsequentl y found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any pregnancy will be followed to 
term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor  after delivery.  
 Overdose  
The investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study 
drug.  Overdos e should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care.

The AIMS is a rating scale that is used to measure involuntary movements know as tardive 
dyskinesia, which can sometimes develop as a side effect of long-term treatment with 
antipsychotic medications. It is a 12 -item scale to assess orofacial, extremity, and truncal 
movements as well as the overall severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s level of awareness of 
the movements. Items are scored from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more 
severe dyskinesia.  
12.12  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study [27]. The strength of this suicide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over  identificatio n 
of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5  minutes to administer. The C -SSRS will be 
administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C -SSRS. At the screening visit, the  “lifetime”  version 
will be complete d; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered.  
12.13  Functional Constipation Inquiry  
Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass [28]. The stool is 
often hard and dry [29]. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating,  and feeling as if 
one has not completely passed the bowel movement[ 30]. The normal frequency of bowel 
movements in adults is between 3 per day and 3 per week[ 28]. Constipation will be defined per 
the Rome III criteria, as less than 3 bowel movements per week,  APPENDIX 2  
(Longswreth,1486,C3) [31]. 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale has been correlated with a change in intestinal function, and had 
been shown to be a useful tool in clinical practice and research[ 32]. A sample Bristol Stool Form 
Scale is located in  APPENDIX 2 . 
As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit, subjects will be asked whether they have 
experienced constipation per the ROME III criteria since the last visit, and if yes, whether the 
constipation required intervention. If the subject answers yes, sites are instructed to ask subjects 
to provide event date and ensure event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as 
concomitant medication. Subjects will not be required to collect and present their stool sample 
nor will clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject assessment.  
Additional attention can be given to other comp laints as well including: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard stools and pain  with bowel 
movements secondary to straining, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and the sensation of 
incomplete bowel evacuation [30, 33]. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

As defi nitions of constipation are typically based on a history of at least a week, site physician 
discretion will be allowed for initiation of such treatments.  
12.14  Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Version 7.0.2  
The MINI is a short structured diagnostic interview developed for DSM -5 psychiatric disorders.

13.1 Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
 Blood Samples  
Blood samples for PK analysis of KarXT levels will be collected at the time  points indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table  2). Approximately 6 mL of blood to be collected at each 
scheduled time point. The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded.  
 Serial blood  samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanomeline and trospium will be 
obtained on Visit 5/Day 8 ±  2 days (first dose of fixed titration period) and Visit  8/Day 28 
± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time points on these days:  
 Before the morning dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours after the morning dose (Note: 
The 12 -hour sample must  be collected before administration of the evening dose) .  
 The 0.5 and 1 hour sample s should be collected within ±  5 minutes of the scheduled time. 
The 2, 4, 8, and 12 hour samples should be collected within ±  10 minutes of their scheduled 
times  and before the evening dose . It is very important that the exact time of each PK draw 
and dosing times are recorded in the eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the 
specified times of collection.  
 Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must  accompan y the 
actual day of potential dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
  For Visit 8 , serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If visit windows are used for 
Visit 8, the PK sampling should occur at least 7 days after Visit 7 is completed , and ther e 
must be no changes in dose for at least 7 days leading up to Visit 8. PK sampling must 
accompan y the actual day of Visit 8.  
Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before  discharge (preferably in the morning) at 
Visit  10/Day 35 -2 days or ET. In additi on, one PK sample may be drawn if a 
relevant/significant  AE is reported during a scheduled visit or if there is a dose adjustment 
or relevant/significant AE reported during an unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). For an 
ET Visit that is related to an AE,  the collection of a PK blood sample is not opti onal and 
should be drawn before  discharge.  
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures will be 
provided in a separate laboratory manual.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved.  This document will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives.  The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC).  All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  
Summary statistics wil l be presented by dose group.  For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of subject s (N), mean  and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by treatment group.  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the 
number  and proportion of subject s for each category by treatment group.  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of change from baseline in  PANSS total score  at Week 5 is  
8 points between drug and placebo  (standard deviation 1 6), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90 .3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05  
(P ≤ 0.05) . With a dropout rate of 30% , a total of 246 subject s are estimated to be enrolled . 
14.2 Analysis Populations  
Intent -to-Treat Population  
All subjects who are randomized to the study will be included in the intent -to-treat ( ITT) 
population.  
Modified ITT Population  
All subjects who are randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, have a baseline PANSS 
assessment , and at least 1 post-baseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT 
population and will be used in the efficacy analysis.  
Safety Population  
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safety population 
and will be used in the safety analysis.  
PK Population  
All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be included in the PK population and will be 
used in the PK analysis. Subjects must have received at least 1 dose of active study drug and 
have at least 1 measurable p lasma concentration of study drug.  Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  77 of 92 14.3 General Statistical Considerations  
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT population. The statistical analysis of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for multiplicity by using a fixed 
sequence testing procedure. The primary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS 
total score will be evaluated first. The endpoints are set up as a hierarchical list and step down 
through the statistical testing of each endpoint using an a lpha of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS negative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score , CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS responders  will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant a t the 0.05 alpha level  (P ≤ 0.05), and  testing would 
continue through a pre -ordered list of key secondary efficacy endpoints . If at any point P  > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested . Table 7 outlines the testing procedure.   
Table 7 Statistical Testing Procedure  
KarXT vs Placebo  
1. Change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5  
2. Change from baseline in PANSS positive score at Week 5  
3. Change from baseline in PANSS negative score at Week 5  
4. Change from baseline in PANSS Negative Marder Factor score at Week 5  
5. Change from baseline in CGI -S score at Week 5  
6. Percentage of PANSS responders (a 30% change in PANSS total score) at Week 5  
 
14.4 Efficacy Analysis  
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5  will be estimated using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM).  The model will include the  change from baseline 
PANSS t otal score s at Week 2, Week 3, Week 4 , and Week 5 as the response. The treatment 
difference at Week 5  will be estimated using contrasts. The MMRM will include the treatment 
group  (KarXT  or placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment group an d visit as 
fixed factors. Site, age, sex, and baseline PANSS total  score will be used as covariates in the 
model.  Low-enrolling sites will be pooled, if necessary, for modeling purposes. The algorithm 
for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP.  
Sensiti vity analys es of the primary efficacy endpoint may be performed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying treatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint will be specified in  the SAP. Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score , and CGI -S) will be analyzed in 
the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie , using MMRM).  
The categorical secondary endpoint (percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups ( KarXT  and placebo) using the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis o f the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for 
multiplicity by using a fixed sequence testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested . 
14.5 Safety Analysis  
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher . The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by S ystem Organ Class and 
Preferred Term . All AEs will be listed by subject , along with information regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome . 
Orthostatic vital signs, clin ical laboratory data, prolactin levels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, including observed  and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subject s with values outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by treatment group. Similar descriptive summaries will be provided for  
C-SSRS, S AS, BARS , change in cognition  (CANTAB) , AIMS, b ody weight, BMI, and waist 
circumference . 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Anal ysis 
 PK results will be listed for all subjects who received active treatment. The profiles or time 
points obtained with protocol deviations affecting PK results will be flagged and may be 
excluded from summaries and analyses.  
 The data will be presented gr aphically via individual plots and mean plots summarized by 
actual treatment, visit , and time point.  
 PK parameters for xanomeline and trospium will be derived from plasma concentration 
data using noncompartmental methods. Actual time elapsed from dosing w ill be used to 
estimate all individual PK parameters. The primary PK parameters of interest will include 
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC from 0 to 12 hours  (or from 0 to the last measurable concentration ). Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

14.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
14.8 Handling of Missing Data  
Several different methods to handle the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used.  
 For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood -based modeling approach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied.  
 Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoin t will be conducted using the last 
observation carried forward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by the previous visit PANSS total score carried forward.  
 Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by replacing each missing value with a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute ). Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Monitoring visits , on-site and remote (telephone)  or a combination  and contacts will be made at 
appropriate times during the study.  The Principal Inv estigator will assure him/her  and adequate 
site personnel are available throughout the study  to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical 
monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to check the completeness, 
clarity, and consisten cy of the data recorded in the eCRFs for each  subject . 
The invest igator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the invest igator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations , and GCP  
guidelines.  
15.6 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
The Sponsor  or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor  lies with the invest igator g enerating the data.  
The Sponsor  will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that 
the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP, and all applicable regulatory requiremen ts. Audits will be independent of and separate 
from the routine monitoring and quality control functions.  Quality assurance procedures will be 
performed at study sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data are 
adequate and well  documented.  
15.7 Protocol Amendment and Protocol Deviation  
 Protocol Amendment  
Amendments to the protocol that entail corrections of typographical errors, clarifications of 
confusing wording, changes in study personnel, and minor modifications that have no effect on 
the safety of  subject s or the conduct of the study will be classed as administrative amendments 
and will be submitted to the IEC/ IRB for information only.  Syneos Health  will ensure that 
acknowledgement is received and filed.  Amendments that are classed as substantial amendments Protocol_1.0_05 Aug 2020 |  | 1.0

Page  90 of 92 APPENDIX  1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) and men whose sexual partners are WOCBP must 
use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 7 days  after the 
last dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarche and until becomi ng 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cau se. A high 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a s ingle FSH measurement is 
insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently a nd correctly) and include:  
 combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)  
 progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibit ion of ovulation  
(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)  
 intrauterine device  
 intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
 bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion  
 vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)  
 sexual  abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk  in relation to the duration of the clinical trial , in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the  subject ) 
All subject s will be strongly advised that t hey (or the female partners of male subject s) should 
not become pregnant wh ile on study treatment or for 7 days  after the last dose. A female subject  
will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and 
appropriate management in the event that she  may be pregnant.

RE:  K AR-009 Protocol V1.0 -  05-Aug-2020/27-Aug-2020 
 
KAR-009 Protocol V1.0 had two versions, one dated 05-Aug-2020 and one dated 27-Aug-2020. There 
were minor changes made to the 05-Aug-2020 Protocol v1.0 to match the KAR-007 protocol that resulted 
in the 27-Aug-2020 Protocol v1.0 and it was decided by Karuna to keep the same version number.

Protocol Number: KAR-009 
Study Sites: Approximately 10 sites in the Un ited States and 10 sites in Ukr aine 
Phase of Development: Phase 3  
Objectives: Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to e valuate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride [xanomeli ne 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in red ucing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome S cale (PANSS) total scores in ad ult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual‒Fifth Editi on (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS positive score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the improvement in C linical Global Impression-Sever ity 
(CGI-S) results in subjects trea ted with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS negative score in subjects 
treated with KarXT  versus placebo 
• To evaluate the reduction of P ANSS Marder Factor negative 
symptoms score in subjects treat ed with KarXT versus placebo 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of xanomeline and trospium 
after administration of KarXT in adults who are acutely psychot ic 
with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia 
Exploratory Objective: 
The exploratory objective of the study is to evaluate the singl e nucleotide 
polymorphisms (SNPs) regarding schizophrenia subtypes and SNPs related to 
drug metabolism.

Study Design: This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter in patient study in adults who a re 
acutely psychotic with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subj ects 
will be randomized (1: 1 ratio) to receive either KarXT or place bo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Su bjects will start on a lead-in d ose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the first  
2 days (Days 1 and 2) followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 B ID 
unless the subject is continuing t o experience AEs from the pre vious 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID . All subjects who were increa sed 
to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and tolerab ility, 
will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the rema inder 
of the treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 ( Day 21) 
of the study and may be decrea sed for tolerability reasons no m ore than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 12 5/30 
BID may not occur outside of t he permitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8.

Page 7 of 92 A safety follow-up v isit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be pe rformed 
for all those subjects who do not rollover in to the long-term open-label 
study KAR-008.  
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophrenia subjects with acute psychosis will resul t in 
significantly greater reduction (i e, improvement) in the primar y and 
secondary endpoints at Week 5 fro m baseline compared with place bo. 
The endpoints are set up as a hi erarchical list and step down t hrough 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an  alpha of 0.05 . Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive sco re, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S , 
and percentage of PANSS responder s will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0. 05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key seconda ry 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.0 5, then formal stati stical 
testing would stop. This will c ontrol the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Page 10 of 92 Planned Sample Size: A total of approximately 246 adult subjects (aged 18 to 65 year s, inclusive) 
are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment grou ps, either 
KarXT or placebo. 
Investigational Therapy: 1. Fixed dose KarXT 50/20 BID (50 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospium), 
oral (Days 1 to 2) 
2. Fixed dose KarXT 100/20 BID (100 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospium), oral (Days 3 to 7) 
3. Fixed dose KarXT 125/30 BID (125 mg xanomeline/30 mg trospium), oral (Days 8 to 35, if tolerated) 
Reference Therapy: Matching placebo BID oral  
Treatment Duration: Total study duration is up to 8 w eeks, including a 7-day screen ing phase (up 
to a 7-day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if nece ssary), a 
5-week treatment period, and a 7- day follow-up period (only for  subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this stu dy will have 
the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label study (KAR-008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy Assessments: PANSS total score, PANSS positive score, PANSS ne gative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, and  CGI-S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits. 
Safety Assessments: Spontaneous AEs, cholinergic symptoms, SAS, BARS, AIMS, body we ight, 
body mass index, waist circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical 
laboratory assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagula tion, 
urinalysis, and drug screen), prolactin levels, physical examin ation, and 
C-SSRS will be evaluated through out the study as scheduled. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: AUC, C max, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits. 
Statistical Methods and Planned Analyses: Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population. 
Modified ITT (mITT) population: All subjects who are randomized , received 
at least 1 dose of study drug, h ave a baseline PANSS assessment , and at least 
1 postbaseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT po pulation 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis. Safety population: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of  study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in t he safety 
analysis. PK population: All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile wi ll be 
included in the PK population an d will be used in the PK analys is. Subjects 
must have received at least 1 dose of active study drug and hav e at least 
1 measurable plasma concentration of study drug.  The primary efficacy endpoint of t he study is the change from b aseline in 
PANSS total score at Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. Th e key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in P ANSS 
positive score, PANSS negative sc ore, PANSS Negative Marder Fac tor 
score, CGI-S score, and percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5. The 
statistical analysis of the pri mary and key secondary efficacy variables will 
account for multiplicity by using a fixed sequence testing proc edure. This 
testing procedure will control th e overall Type 1 error rate ac ross all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

5.1 Background on Schizophrenia 
Schizophrenia is a long-term men tal disorder involving a breakd own in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and pers onal relationships into fantasy  and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination , disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of sch izophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United Sta tes (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5 .1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, wit h males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schiz ophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs)[ 5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blocka ge of all or subsets of dopami ne receptors in the brain. First-
generation APDs include chlorpr omazine and haloperidol; treatme nt with these agents is marked 
by high rates of parkinsonian extra pyramidal symptoms (EPS) and  tardive dyskinesia, and they 
consequently have limited use t oday. The second-generation agen ts that include risperidone, 
olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasidone , aripiprazole, and lumateper one tend to have lower levels of 
EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are  currently the most commonly p rescribed APD class. However, 
the second-generation drugs also have problematic side effects that include significant weight 
gain, metabolic disturban ces, sedation, and akathisia[ 6, 7, 8]. These side effects contribute to 
poor medication adherence resulti ng in frequent relapses and ho spitalizations[ 9, 10]. Thus there 
is a need for medications for s chizophrenia which act through a lternative mechanisms. 
Central muscarinic receptors  have been hypothesized to be thera peutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarin ic receptors (M1-M5). The th erapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor a gonism is thought to be due to ago nism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous  system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric  binding sites that  the receptor s share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of t hese peripheral receptors. Thus , any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophren ia (or other indications such  as Alzheimer’s disease [AD]) has 
been outweighed by the occurrence of  AEs associated with peripheral cholinergic side effects 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospium Chloride)  
Xanomeline tartrate is a muscarinic-cholinergic receptor agonis t. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially s
timulates M 1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects 
(Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomelin e is a very potent M 4 muscarinic

Page 21 of 92 agonist in vivo, measured by vari ous second messenger assays[ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapidly achieving a brain to plasma ratio of greater than  10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate[ 15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any di rect binding activity on dopamin ergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action is unrel ated to direct dopamine involve ment. 
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relev ant antipsychotic efficacy. In a  multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo  were assessed for 
26 weeks[ 16, 17]. Significant dose-dependent imp rovements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placebo were observed. Moreover, p sychotic symptoms resolved qu ite rapidly in subjects who 
were symptomatic at baseline a nd a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analy sis, cognitive improvement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be nec essary for cognitive 
enhancement[ 16, 17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-control led inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant s ubjects with schizophrenia, xanom eline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid imp rovement in psychosis compared t o placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia t rials, as well as in previous  healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting , nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side e ffects were frequent and, at t he higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of disconti nuation in the AD studies. This “pro-cholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of  xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procho linergic AEs associated with xano meline are mediated by 
xanomeline’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically a menable to counteracting peripher al anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospium chloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonis t which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes[ 19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) and by European authorities to treat 
overactive bladder and is  generally well tolerated[ 19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospium does  not appreciably cross the blood  brain barrier, consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospium chloride. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of t rospium would mitigate perip heral procholinergic side effects 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweat ing and hyper-salivation) and  thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic re ceptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this co mbination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
rema
ining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in se verity and transient in nature, 
often lasting a few hours without  recurrence and were generally  single-episode. In general,

Page 22 of 92 KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These enc ouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for  the treatment of schizophrenia  and potentially other CNS 
disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well-controlled, randomized, multi-center 
Phase 2, placebo-controlled, inpa tient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subjects (KAR-004). KarXT demonstrated a statisticall y significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Nega tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), with statistical s eparation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4, and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg) administer ed twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophr enia. A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.  Xanomeline is currently not approved or marketed in any country . Trospium is marketed in the 
US and other regions of the world for the treatment of overacti ve bladder. 
Nonclinical Studies 
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice  and rats. All animals were 
observed for 2 weeks for mortalit y and clinical signs of intole rance, and then necropsied for 
gross examinations. In-life findings attributed to the test article included excessive 
muscarinic-mediated pharmacology, such as excessive salivation,  hypoactivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typically appearing normal by Days 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy wer e generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous-filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing). 
KarXT-301 was a 14-day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats wher e relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospium were given, with either xanomeline alon e or in combination with 
trospium. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were administered e ither vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (spli t into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospium combination dosages of 150/20 0 mg/kg/day or 
225/400 mg/kg/day, respectively (s plit into BID doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma af ter the first and la st doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in sup port of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target-organ toxic ity revealed by clinical patholo gy or by gross or microscopic 
assessments. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article.

Page 23 of 92 No dose-related ophthalmic observa tions were noted. Findings we re not indicative of specific 
target organ toxicity. In short, no new hazard was identified.  
Clinical observations noted in mos t animals administered 300 mg /kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral dischar ge, dilated pupils, irregular o r labored respiration, and rough hair 
coat, among other observations. The se findings are generally co nsistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three TK animals in the low-dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus  the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed t o these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), the n they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no mic roscopic evidence of toxicity w as seen in any toxicity animals 
in this group or i n the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination group. Two toxicology animals had evi dence of gavage accidents.  For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined, and a test article-related effect canno t be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of es ophageal muscular is indicated s ome dosing-related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involve d, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ micros copic findings in GI tract or an y other tissue of any animal, 
including the early deat h toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics-mediated reduction in GI motility is consist ent with the anti-muscarinic 
effects of trospium on intestinal  musculature. Fecal retention,  malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deteriora tion followed with continued do sing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose combination animals tha t survived led to rapid recove ry, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics-related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any xanomeline-alone group. The lac k of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or 
surviving animal implies that t he adverse effects were pharmaco logically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity. 
Twenty-eight Day Repeat-Dose St udies with Xanomeline in Rats an d Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0% , 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monke ys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived  until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body wei ght in the high dose group, incre ases in gamma-glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), a nd lower serum globulin (femal es). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of  intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrh ea, hypoactivity, 
weight loss, and treatment-relate d tachycardia in the high-dose animals. 
Forty-Day Repeat Dose Study of Kar XT in Rats (KarXT-302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were given vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day, tr ospium alone at 100 mg/kg/day,

Page 24 of 92 all doses split into BID doses. Satellite rats (TK animals) wer e included for col lection of plasma 
after the first and last doses to determine concentrations of e ach drug. Dosing was initially 
planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxic ity was seen. Safety findings inc luded pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the trospium alone and combination groups and m ild biliary hyperplasia in the 
high-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4  unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high-dose xa nomeline alone group (150 g/kg/da y) and 2 in the high-dose 
combination group (150 mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospium). Both 
xanomeline-only animals had necropsy gross findings of a gavage  accident, and cause of death 
could not be determined. All toxico logy animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. Sponsor 
considers that the volume deple tion and trauma of multiple blee ds (3 per animal), followed by 
reduced absorption of fluids and nutrients secondary to reduced  GI motility with continued BID 
dosing explains the greater demise  of TK animals relative to to xicity animals.  
Based on the results of the 90-day rat toxicology study, oral a dministration of tro spium chloride 
and xanomeline tartrate alone or in combination to Crl:CD (SD) rats BID (12 hours ± 60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 a nd 50 mg/kg/dose trospium chlori de, 37 and 75 mg/kg/dose 
xanomeline tartrate, and a combination of 37/25, 75/25, and 75/ 50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospium chloride for  a minimum of 90 days resulted in  minimal to moderate bile duct 
hyperplasia in the livers of the  xanomeline tartrate and combin ation (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospium chloride) group mal es. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when compa ring the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combin ation group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose 
combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the terminal euthanasia. The bile duc t hyperplasia was considered a dverse in the high-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group male s and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed-adverse-effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the comb ination of xanomeline tartrate /trospium chloride. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium, 146,000 
pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL for trospi um + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 9230 
pg•hr/mL for trospium; 267,000 pg• hr/mL for xanomeline; and 16, 700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL for 
trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in females 
cannot be explained from differe nces in drug exposure. At the r ecovery euthanasia, bile duct 
hyperplasia was still present but  was limited to minimal severi ty, and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomelin e tartrate and combination group  males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combinatio n groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased i ncidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts  at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smal ler/flattened epithelium, 
noninflammatory, and an absence of  portal bridging), changes at the recovery eut hanasia were

Page 25 of 92 consistent with a partial resolution of bile duct hyperplasia. With an absence of  correlating serum 
liver enzyme elevations, bile acid alterations or hepatocellula r degeneration, necrosis or 
regeneration, and with the appare nt reversibility after cessati on of treatment, these findings 
appear to have been tolerable by the affected animals. Therefor e, the maximum tolerated dose 
was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dos e for trospium chloride, 75 mg /kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomelin e tartrate/trospium chloride. For 
males, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL  for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For fem ales, corresponding mean plasma  AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 
950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Da y 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospium (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerati ons of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomelin e or trospium at high doses. 
Target organ findings with xanom eline alone were limited to bil iary hyperplasia in the 28-day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12- month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT , biliary hyperplasia was not o bserved in the 14-day rat 
study but was reported in the 40-day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre-neoplastic lesions, because they were of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary-related 
serum chemistry.  
Completed Clinical Studies 
Refer to the IB for complete information regarding previous clinical studies conducted with 
xanomeline by Eli Lilly, and studies KAR-001, KAR-002, KAR-003, a nd KAR-004 conducted 
by Karuna Therapeutics using xanomeline with trospium. 
To date, more than 750 subjects or volunteers have been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral formulation, either alone, in combination with trospium, or as the combination drug KarXT) in 
18 completed clinical studies c onducted either by Eli Lilly or Karuna Therapeutics, some for as 
long as 3 years. In those studies, significant improvements in cognition and red uced psychotic 
symptoms were observed.  
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pilot study, the effects of x anomeline were examined in 20  subjects with schizophrenia 
utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study desi gn. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly be tter than subjects in the placeb o group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24-point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group sh owed improvements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domains of verbal learning and  short-term memory function.

Page 26 of 92 These studies demonstrated the  potential for xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and 
cognition across multiple subject populations.  
Study H2Q-EW-E001, conducted by Lilly, had 36 male healthy volu nteers in 4 groups of 9, who 
were administered escalating sin gle doses of xanomeline tartrat e in increments of 1, 5, 10, 25, 
50, 75, 100 mg, and 150 mg. Each group took 2 ascending doses of xanomeline tartrate and 
1 dose of placebo in a single subject blind manner. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). AEs 
included watery diarrhea, nausea , dizziness, sweating, shiverin g, mild disorientation, increased 
blood pressure (BP), increase i n sitting and stand ing heart rat e, slight increase i n supine systolic 
BP, and postural hypotension. 
The clinical experience with Kar XT initiated by Karuna Therapeu tics to date includes 
3 completed Phase 1, clinical ph armacology studies in healthy v olunteers (KAR-001, KAR-002, 
and KAR-003) and one completed P hase 2 study (KAR-004) in adult  inpatients with DSM-5 
schizophrenia. The first study conducted by Kar una, KAR-001 was “A Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, 
multiple-dose, pilot study comparing xanomeline administered alone to xanomeline administered 
in combination with trospium chloride in normal healthy volunte ers.” This study consisted of 
2 arms, in which xanomeline was ad ministered TID, alone, at a total daily dose of 225 mg in one 
arm, and the second arm received the same dose of xanomeline in  combination with trospium 
chloride 20 mg administered BID , a total daily dose of 40 mg. S ubjects were treated for 7 days. 
The goal was to determine whet her this dosing regimen would red uce the cholinergic side effects 
of xanomeline by co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist, trospium.  
Overall, treatment with xanome line 225 mg daily + trospium 40 m g daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and w ell tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (a lthough not statistically signif icant) in visual analog scale (VAS) 
scores for cholinergic events for  the xanomeline + trospium tre atment arm compared to the 
xanomeline alone treatment arm. S pecifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospium treat ment arm was observed for the su pportive endpoints of 
maximum weekly individual VAS scores and mean daily maximum com posite VAS scores.  
Results of the clinician-administered scales were supportive of  a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and s weating that interfered with  daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm. 
There were no meaningful diffe rences between treatment groups i n heart rate, resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardi ogram (ECG) parameters includ ing QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment arms  had transient increases in hear t rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in  those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone a rm) experienced syncope. The inc idence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-h alf that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.

in either treatment arm) were  hyperhidrosis, salivary hypersecr etion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences  of these 5 TEAEs was higher in  the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm  (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospiu m chloride 40 mg 
administered over 7 days was consid ered safe and w ell-tolerated . The observed side effect profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospium chloride. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was  lower in the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm 
compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm. 
Study KAR-002 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple -dose adaptive design pilot 
study to evaluate the safety a nd tolerability of KarXT in norma l healthy volunteers. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID or place bo. The first cohort of this 
study was stopped after 1.5 days w hen the US FDA put the program on hold due to a preliminary 
rat finding in the 14-day study. T his study used a new formulation of KarXT in which 
xanomeline and trospium were com bined into a single dose form a nd given BID. Safety findings 
included an increase in orthosta tic complaints. Caution should be used in drawing conclusions 
from this study, as subjects did not have time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as 
only 3 doses were given. 
Study KAR-003 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple -dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability o f KarXT in normal healthy 
volunteers. The primary objective  of this study was to assess t he safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarX T at various dose combinations, administered BID. Subjects 
received either KarXT or place bo (3:1 ratio). A ll subjects on K arXT received 2 days of 50 mg 
xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID, and then increased to differen t doses for Days 3 to 7. This 
study also used the new formulation of KarXT in which xanomelin e and trospium were 
combined into a single dosage form and given BID.  
There was a relatively high degr ee of variability in xanomeline and trospium exposures between 
individuals in all c ohorts, which is consistent with previous results with KarXT, 
xanomeline-alone, and trospium-alone. Peak plasma concentration s were observed at a median 
time of 2.0 hours for xanomeline and 1.0 hour for trospium acro ss all treatment groups and study 
days.  
Although there was insufficient data to draw a definitive concl usion regarding the impact of 
trospium on the pharmacokinetics ( PK) and bioavailability of xa nomeline, or the impact of 
xanomeline on the PK and bioavail ability of trospium, the PK re sults suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK  behavior of the other drug. 
During the 2-day lead-in phase, t he most common AEs (≥20% of su bjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that 
completed dosing, although the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the KarXT 100/20 BID

Page 28 of 92 (66.7%) group compared to KarXT 125/40 group (88.9%), the incid ence of cholinergic TEAEs 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) w as similar between the 2 groups. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs ( 20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, d yspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria. For the t reatment groups that did not com plete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were g enerally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing.  
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur primarily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospium BID (KarXT 150/40 BID and KarXT 125/4 0 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID, suggesting  to consider slightly lowering 
the trospium dose from 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs w ere mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs  or deaths. Treatment-emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few antic holinergic). Doses of 100 mg and  125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospium , respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID w as acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar dos es in future studies. Doses of  KarXT 150/20 BID and 
150/40 BID were not well tolerate d in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg 
trospium appeared to be better tolerated than 150/20, but some subjects still experienced 
tolerability issues. 
Study KAR-004 was a Phase 2 ra ndomized, double-blinded study to  assess the safety 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM-5 schizophrenia, hospitaliz ed with acute 
psychosis. The primary objective of the study was to assess the  efficacy of KarXT 125/30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS to tal scores in adult inpatien ts with a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead-in dose of KarXT  50/20 BID for the first 2 days 
followed by KarXT 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing w as titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 BID unless the subject was continuing to experienc e AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/20 BID. The clinic al portion of this study was completed and clinical study 
report is in progress. No new safety concerns have arisen durin g this study. 
The KAR-004 trial results are  unambiguous regarding efficacy, w here not only the primary 
outcome measure showed a robust separation from placebo, but th e additional sensitivity and 
secondary outcome measures were  consistently robust as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically mea ningful mean reductions in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001) in the modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjuste d mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score (Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; more over, the difference appears 
to be widening with each succes sive timepoint. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the

The overall safety/tolerability data were also fairly unambiguo us; among the highlights:  
• The overall discontinuation rate on KarXT was 20%, similar to p lacebo (21%). The number

• Most common TEAEs were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. 
None of these TEAEs were rated as severe, and none led to disco ntinuations

Another Phase 3 study (KAR-007) i s planned at approximately 20 study sites in the US. 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT and Study Rationale 
The risks and benefits of KarXT  in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trosp ium. The available clinical trial data indica te that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs. Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these seri ous side effects pose a signifi cant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead t o discontinuation  of treatment and significant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration qualit y pivotal trial in 182 subjects met the pr imary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo  with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 place bo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reductio n in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (Weeks 2, 4,  and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0.75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demons trated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive sympto m subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores, and CGI-S scores. 
More than 750 subjects or volunt eers have been exposed to xanom eline tartrate (oral 
formulation, either alone, in c ombination with trospium, or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These  early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revea led any specific contraindica tions to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic relat ed effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sw eating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The  addition of trospium decreases 
the peripheral cholinergic effect of xanomeline creating a bett er tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT. 
Trospium chloride has been marketed in the US for 12 years. The most frequently reported AEs 
reported in pivotal trials we re dry mouth, constipation, abdomi nal pain, headache, urinary

insert for trospium chloride t ablets for oral use can be found in the IB. 
In a Phase 2 (KAR-004) clini cal study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30 ) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia in sub jects with acute psychosis afte r treatment for 28 days. KarXT 
also showed an acceptable safety profile with the most common T EAEs being constipation, 
nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TE AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic d isorder) was reported by a singl e subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study. KarXT was generally well-tolerated and f ound to be safe in this patient 
population. 
KarXT represents a novel appro ach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningf ul alternative t o current ther apies. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population by advancing to Phase 3 trials. 
Subjects assigned to active st udy drug may benefit by improveme nt in schizophrenia symptoms. 
Since subjects will be having an acute psychotic event, subject s will be hospitalized where the 
clinical staff is available to help them 24 hours a day. In add ition, the inpatient setting represents 
an important venue for research, examining the effects of KarXT  and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible , subjectivity and bias. Furthermore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adher ence.

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This Phase 3, randomized, double- blind, parallel-group, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 
inpatient clinical study in adults  who are acutely psychotic wi th a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment  with KarXT will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie,  improvement) in the primary and secondary endpoints at 
Week 5 from baseline compared with placebo. Total study duratio n is up to 8 weeks, including a 
7-day screening phase (up to a 7-day extension of the screening  phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7- day follow-up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to 
KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a 
long-term open-label study (KAR- 008) in which every subject will receive KarXT. 
Screening Period:  
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize app roximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US and 10 sites in Ukraine. Subje cts will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receiv e either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5 weeks. 
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all s ubjects assigned to KarXT will st art on a lead-in dose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the first  2 days (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless 
the subject is continuing to expe rience AEs from the previous d ose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All 
subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, will have the opti on to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of the 
treatment period. Dosing must not  change after Visit 7 (Day 21)  of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerab ility reasons no more t han once during the  study. In addition, dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID may not occur outside of the per mitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8.  
All randomized subjects will have structured diagnostic intervi ew sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study (see Schedule of Assessments Table 2 ). Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed. 
Efficacy assessments (PANSS scores and CGI-S score) will be ass essed at scheduled visits. 
Refer to Section 11 for more details. 
Safety will be assessed through spontaneous AEs, cholinergic sy mptoms, cognition testing, SAS, 
BARS, AIMS, body weight, BMI, waist c ircumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical

 Page 40 of 92 7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
A randomized, double-blind, parall el-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimiz e bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safet y parameters of the investigational drug. 
Schizophrenia is a long-term menta l disorder which requires a chronic therapy. A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered  an acceptable treatment durati on to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint ca n be achieved). The 5-week tre atment duration is substantiated 
by the statistically significan t outcome of the KAR-004 study of the same duration.  
7.3 End of Study 
A subject will have fulfilled the requirements for study comple tion when the subject has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit ( Visit 10/Day 35 (End of 
Treatment) for subjects who ro ll over into KAR-008 or Visit 11/Day 42 (Follow-up) for subjects 
who do not roll over into the KAR-008 study) as indicated in th e Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects completing this study wil l have the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label 
study (KAR-008) in which every sub ject will receive KarXT. 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for subjects 
who do not rollover in to the l ong-term open-label study. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee 
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group  of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a re gular basis accumulating safety data from the clinical study. This 
committee will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirm ing the safety of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for an y new toxicities that might be 
involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinde d data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important sa fety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the detail s of the types of data to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no trigger s), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.

12. Subject resides in a stable li ving situation and is anticipated  to return to that same stable 
living situation after discharge , in the opinion of the investigator. 
13. Subject has an identified reliab le informant/caregiver. An info rmant/caregiver is 
needed at the screening and base line visits as well as at the end of the study for 
relevant assessments (site staff may act as informant while the  subject is an inpatient). 
An informant/caregiver may not be necessary if the subject has been the patient of the 
investigator for ≥1 year. 
14. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP), or men whose sexual pa rtners are 
WOCBP, must be able and willing to use at least 1 highly effect ive method of 
contraception during the study a nd for 7 days after the last do se of study drug. Sperm 
donation is not allowed for 90 days after the final dose of stu dy drug. A female 
subject is considered to be a WOCBP after menarche and until sh e is in a 
postmenopausal state for 12 months or otherwise permanently ste rile (for which 
acceptable methods include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectom y, and bilateral 
oophorectomy)[ 22]. For the definition and list of highly effective methods of 
contraception, see APPENDIX 1 .

Page 44 of 92 8.3 Rescreening 
Individuals who sign the informe d consent form (ICF) to partici pate in the study but who do not 
subsequently meet all the require ments for safety laboratory as sessments and therefore do not 
enroll (screen failures) ma y be rescreened, upon approval of the medical monitor on a case by 
case basis. Such individuals may be allowed to rescreen up to 1  time. When re-testing within the 
same screening procedure, only the  exclusionary laboratory test s will be repeated once in case 
the exclusionary laboratory res ult was not due to a pathologica l condition and was occasional 
(except for individuals who have positive serology results).  
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects 
If a subject discontinues study t reatment and is withdrawn from  the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notif y the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorde d on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Subjects who 
complete or discontinue early f rom the study will be discharged  from the study site, if clinically 
warranted after completing all the Visit 10/early termination assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for those 
subjects who do not roll over int o the long-term open-label stu dy KAR-008. 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the s tudy because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEA E will be followed up until it res olves (returns to normal or 
baseline values) or stabilizes , or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clinically 
significant. 
Once a subject is withdrawn fro m the study, the subject will no t re-enter the study. 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the stu dy at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE 
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject’s partici pation in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request  or on the basis of the investigat or’s clinical judgment. The 
reason for subject withdrawa l will be noted on the eCRF. 
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated  to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatmen t and necessitated the subject’s  termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes i n the subject’s condition that ren ders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the  inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject has need for a 
medication prohibited by the protocol)

Page 45 of 92 • subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance [if a study 
subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row])  
• violation of entry criteria; ie,  subjects who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria 
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.7. Any study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study tre atment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term. 
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study. 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, pa rticularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who compl eted the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who leave t he unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of study will be followed until the AE is resolved (regardless of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open-label study KAR-008) or the subject is considere d to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in  case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making fu rther treatment of subjects 
impossible. In this event, the i nvestigator(s) will be informed  of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy 
No evidence of mutagenicity, o r treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animal s following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well-controlled studi es in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospium chloride have shown an adverse  effect on the fetus, but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despite the risk (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C). 
Therefore, women of childbearing potential in this study must b e willing to use a highly effective 
method of birth control (see APPENDIX 1  for a list of acceptable highly effective methods of 
contraception) during the study and for 7 days after the last d ose of study drug. Females of 
childbearing potential will have  a serum pregnancy test at scre ening and a urine pregnancy test 
on Day 1 (before receiving KarXT) and Day 35.  
Pregnant women are excluded fr om this study because the effects of KarXT on the developing 
human fetus are unknown with the p otential for teratogenic or a bortifacient effects.

Page 46 of 92 Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment 
of the mother with KarXT, women who are breastfeeding must not be enrolled in the study. 
The effects of study drug on sperm are unknown. Men who are wil ling to participate in the study 
must agree to use a highly eff ective method of birth control (s ee APPENDIX 1  for a list of 
acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) and must not impregnate a sexual partner 
during or for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. They m ust also agree to refrain from 
sperm donation for 90 days after t he last dose of study drug. 
Female subjects of child-beari ng potential will be instructed t hat known or suspected pregnancy 
occurring during the study should be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a female 
subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must withdraw her fr om the study without delay. The 
subject must not receive any fur ther doses of the study drug. U pon discontinuation from the 
study, only those procedures tha t would not expose the pregnant  female subject to undue risk 
will be performed. See Section 12.7.7  for further reporting and monitoring details. 
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawa l page (exit form) of the eCRF, or 
a pregnancy report will be completed if the subject has complet ed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted on the Pregnancy Reporting Form w ithin 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is no t to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using 
the same procedure as described for reporting SAE (Section 12.7.4). 
8.5 Completion of the Study or Lost to Follow-up 
The study will be completed when a ll subjects have completed th eir study-related procedures in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact subjects who le ave the facility and are lost to 
follow-up to obtain end of study information. Details regarding  follow-up efforts are to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records/source documentatio n. 
8.6 Study Termination 
The availability of any new advers e safety information related to KarXT may result in stopping 
the study. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent Ethics Comm ittee (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take su ch actions. If the study is termi nated for safety reasons, subjects 
will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow-up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subjects, and IEC/IRB will be 
informed about the reason for  such action. Similarly, if the Sp onsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the I EC/IRB, and the subjects of the reason for such an action. Similar 
notifications will be s ent by the IEC/IRB if it takes such an a ction.

9.1 Details of Study Treatments 
KarXT is formulated as hard hydroxypropyl methylcellulose oral capsules containing 2 distinct 
populations of drug beads, one of which is loaded with xanomeli ne tartrate and the other of 
which is loaded with trospium chloride. Each capsule contains t he freebase equivalent of 
xanomeline and trospium according to the desired dose strength.  In addition to the active 
ingredients, the drug beads cont ain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The beads are not coated 
and are formulated for immediate release of the active ingredie nts. 
 Identity of Study Treatments 
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish orange-white, opaque, and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be pr epared in matching capsules; 
therefore, an unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense  study agent at each day of 
dosing. For the 2-day lead-in period (Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will 
receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 BID, followed by 2 capsule s of KarXT 50/10 mg BID or a 
dosage of 100/20 BID for a total daily dosage of 200/40 mg xano meline/trospium chloride for 
the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week  2, dosing may be increased to 
2 capsules of KarXT 62.5/15 mg or a dosage of 125/30 BID for a total daily dosage of 
250/60 mg xanomeline/trospium chloride, depending on clinical r esponse and tolerability. 
Investigators have the option to return a subject to KarXT 100/ 20 BID for the remainder of the 
treatment period, but dosing must not change after Visit 7 of t he study.  
KarXT 50/10 mg is composed of 44.4% xanomeline tartrate, 5.8% t rospium chloride, excipients 
37.59% MCC, 11.5% lactose monohydrat e, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0 .5% talc in a size 0, 
Swedish orange, hydroxypropyl m ethylcellulose hard capsule. 
KarXT 50/20 mg is composed of 33.4% xanomeline tartrate, 8.7% t rospium chloride, excipients 
39.8% MCC, 17.3% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0. 5% talc in a size 0, Swedish 
orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsule. 
KarXT 62.5/15 mg is composed of 41.7% xanomeline tartrate, 6.5%  trospium chloride, 
excipients 38.1% MCC, 12.9% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0.5% talc in a 
size 0, Swedish orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard caps ule. 
Placebo is composed of sugar spheres pf011, 850/1000 suglets, 9 9.05% colorcon, and 10.05% 
talc in a size 0, Swedish orange, an opaque white hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose hard capsule. 
All investigational agents are to be stored according to requirements. 
 Packaging and Labelling 
The study packaging and labelling will be performed by Corealis Pharma, located in Laval, 
Quebec, Canada, Catalent Pharma Solutions, located in Wincheste r, Kentucky (labelling for the

Page 48 of 92 US sites), and Catalent Pharma S olutions, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (labelling for 
Ukrainian sites). All packaging and labelling operations will b e performed according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medici nal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements. 
Bulk supply bottles are labeled with the name of the drug, reco mmended storage conditions, the 
name and address of the manufacturer, and the Investigational U se Statement (“Caution: New 
Drug – Limited by Federal [US] Law to Investigational Use”). 
Further details on labelling of investigational products will b e provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 Study Drug Storage 
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature  15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel. 
 Study Drug Retention 
Study drug not used in KAR-009 may be used for the long-term ex tension study (KAR-008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program , and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at t he site or returned, as specified 
by Sponsor. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure t hat the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropri ate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully 
accounted for by the study monitor. 
9.2 Dose Schedule 
The first dose of the study drug will be administered in the mo rning of Day 1. For subjects who 
roll over to Study KAR-008, the last dose will be administered in the evening of Visit 10 
(Day 35 -2 days). Subjects who do not rollover to Study KAR-008 study will have the last dose 
of the study drug administered in the evening before Visit 10 ( Day 35 -2 days). The study drug 
should be administered daily BID on an empty stomach (ie, at le ast 1 hour before a meal) or 2 to 
3 hours after a meal. Some considerations for dosing and PK blo od withdrawals are provided in 
the subsections below. 
 Visit 2b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning, and the evening dose will be administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose.  
• All subjects must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 100/20 BID.

Page 49 of 92 
 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• When Day 3 occurs on a weekend, it is expected that the complete Visit 3 will be 
performed, and the subject’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day  visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated until the stud y visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20 or placebo before escalating to KarXT 100/20 or placebo. 
• This may result in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo d ose at Visit 5/Day 8, 
which is acceptable. 
• All subjects must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK Considerations and Visit 8/Day 28 P K 
Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is conf irmed by investigator 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for ser ial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2 , 
Footnote p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of dose escalation for Visit 5.  
• For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; there fore, Visit 8 should 
occur at least 7 days after Visit 7 is completed, and there mus t be no changes in dose for 
at least 7 days leading up to Vi sit 8. PK sampling must accompa ny the actual day of 
Visit 8 if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• Subjects willing to rollover in to Study KAR-008 will continued  to be dosed at 
Visit 10/Day 35, and their last dose will be the evening of Visit 10. These subjects will start their at-home dosing on Day 1 of Study KAR-008. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: S tudy Treatment Assignment 
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment 
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will a ssign a unique subject 
identification number to the s ubject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
Approved

KarXT Final 1.0 
This document is confidential. 
Page 50 of 92 associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject  who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obt ain a Subject Number. This 9-digit 
number will consist of a t3-digit study code and a 3-digit site  identification followed by a 3-digit 
number assigned sequentially with in each site, starting at .  
On Day -1, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a  1:1 ratio to either KarXT or 
placebo groups. Subjects will be assigned a randomization number through the IWRS, in 
accordance with the randomization code generated by the authori zed personnel at VERISTAT. 
At the study site, the randomization schedule will only be accessible to authorized unblinded pharmacy personnel or designee. Once a randomization number is allocated to one subject, it 
may not be assigned to another subject even if the former disco ntinued the study. 
 Blinding 
An IWRS will allocate treatment based on a prespecified randomi zation list generated by 
VERISTAT. Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or othe r 
designated unblinded individual) , subjects, informants/caregive rs, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study  treatment, that subject will be 
discontinued from the study unle ss there are ethical reasons fo r that subject not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be  obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT will generate and maintain the security of the randomi zation code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject’s safety or wellbeing, t he investigator may break the r andomization code for just that 
subject via the IWRS, by which system the unblinding will be ca ptured after consultation and 
agreement with the medical monitor/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be relat ed to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investig ational treatment and/or treat t he subject. Subject withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. I f discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever t he duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject has an AE that requires that the investigator be  unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study 
medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in  the subject’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: In most circumstances, it is  not necessary to unblind a

Page 51 of 92 subject, even if an SAE has occu rred. For many drugs there is n o specific therapy for AEs. The 
appropriate course of action is t o stop the investigational dru g and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE. 
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the sa fety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subjects will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous pre clinical and 
clinical studies (see Section 5.2). Per the protocol, subjects  will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and 7 and at unscheduled visits. No  dose adjustments are allowed after 
Visit 7. No other dose modifications are permissible in this st udy except those specified in this 
protocol. 
9.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance 
The pharmacist or other designated unblinded individual will ma intain records of study treatment 
delivered to the study site, the inventory at the study site, t he distribution to each subject, and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or d isposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects. 
Administration of study drug w ill be supervised by study site personnel to ensure compliance. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document th at the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigationa l product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by the assigned unblinded study m onitor. 
9.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects will be asked for all prior medications he/she were ta king up to 6 months before the 
study, up to the time of the first dose of study medication on Day 1. All prior medications will be 
recorded on the eCRF. Restricted prior therapies are provided in Section 8.2.  
All medications and other treatm ents taken by the subject durin g the study, including those 
treatments initiated before the start of the study, must be rec orded on the eCRF. 
During the study (ie, from the time of enrollment at the screen ing visit until study completion), 
subjects will refrain from the use of any new concomitant medic ations without the specific prior

study period is prohibited without  the prior approval of the in vestigator unless its use is deemed 
necessary in a medical emergency. Any medication or therapy tha t is taken by or administered to 
the subject during the course of the study must be recorded in the eCRF. The entry must include 
the dose, regimen, route, indi cation, and dates of use. 
After written informed consent is  obtained from the subject, th ose subjects who are taking the 
following medications must have the minimum washout periods spe cified below and not take the 
medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half-lives or 1 week, whichever is longer, before base line (Day -1), subjects 
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibi tors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tri cyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibito rs, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken  on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could no t have received a dose of 
medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRINZA®).  
Note: Please direct questions relating to prohibited medication s to the Medical Monitor. 
 Concomitant Medications for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subjects are allowed to take benzodiazepines (up to 6 mg loraze pam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation, and insomnia. Subjects may also use non-benzodiazepine medications 
(eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) as a sl eep aid. Study sites must record the use of rescue medications in 
the eCRF and subject’s source document. Note: Cognition testing  should not be done within 
8 hours of receiving a benzodiazep ine or sleep medication.

a. Up to a 7-day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if n eeded. 
b. Other assessments as needed. 
c. A serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential sh ould be done at screening, and urine pregnancy tests should be done at other visits. 
d. A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabi noids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and c ocaine) will be 
performed at screening and at Visit 2a (baseline). If a subject  leaves the study site, he/she s hould have a urin e drug screen and test for alcohol 
(breathalyzer or blood alcohol level) upon r eturning to the stu dy site.  
e. A complete physical examination includes body temperature (°C),  general appearance, head/eyes/ ears/nose/throat, examination of  thorax and

Page 58 of 92 allowed at the investigator’s discretion. It would be acceptabl e, for example, to do orthostatic vital signs BID after dosing increases for a  day or 2 for 
subjects where it seems warranted , but this should not be done automatically. 
h. ECG on Day 1 will be done at 2 h ours + 15 minutes post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed befo re blood withdrawal for 
any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. During the ECG,  ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and QTcF (msec) 
measurements should be obtained.  
i. Refer to  Table 3  for individual laboratory tests. 
j. Optional COVID-19 test may be per formed at unscheduled visits b ased on the Investigator’s discretion. 
k. Blood sample for prolactin must be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug at scheduled visits (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests compl eted at Screening: anti-HCV antib ody, HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibody, 
HIV-1 antibody, and HIV-2 antibody. If the subject tests positi ve for anti-HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain rea ction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection. 
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subjects will be asked whether they have  experienced constipation (per t he ROME III criteria and 
Bristol Stool Form scale; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes , whether the constipation required intervention. If th e subject answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subj ects to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is docume nted as concomitant 
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not al ready an inpatient, the subject  should be admitted to the inpatient unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID (first dose of study will be administere d in the morning of Day 1, and  evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose and after la st PK sampling [for Visits 5 and 8 ] is completed), on an empty stomach (ie, at least 
1 hour before a meal) or 2 to 3 hours after a meal by the study  staff, with the last dose admini stered on the evening before V isit 10 for subjects who do 
not enter Study KAR-008. For subjects rolling over to Study KAR -008, the last dose will be admin istered on the evening of Visit 10. All subjects must 
receive at least 4 dosa ges of the 50/20 BID before dose escalat ion to KarXT 100/20 BID. 
p. For Visit 5/Day 8 and Visit 8/Da y 28, 7 PK blood draws are requ ired: before the morning dose, and at 0.5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 5 minutes, 
2 hours ± 10 minutes, 4 hours ± 10 minutes, 8 hours ± 10 minute s, and 12 hours ± 10 minutes after the morning dose (Note: The 12-hour samples must 
be collected before administration of the evening dose). PK blo od draws at Visit 5 must be drawn in relation to the first dose  of KarXT 125/30 for 
subjects who are escalated in th e morning of Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days. PK blood must also be drawn in relation to the morning do se for subjects who are 
not escalated at Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days. For Visit 10/ET, a sin gle PK blood sample should be drawn before discharge (preferabl y in the morning) for 
completed (and early termination) subjects. One PK blood sample  may also be drawn if a relevan t/ significant AE is reported du ring a scheduled visit 
or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE r eported during an unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). For an  ET Visit that is related to 
an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and should be drawn be fore discharge. 
q. It should be performed before PANSS assessment. 
r. It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all the other scale assessments fo r all visits at 
which it is performed. The PANSS  assessment includes the Marder  Factor. 
s. C-SSRS first time use lifetime, other times use “Since Last Visit” version. At the Unscheduled visit, the C-SSRS should be per formed to monitor subjects 
for suicidality. 
t. During screening, subjects will complete each of the CANTAB tes ts for familiarization purposes. These same tests will then be administered on Visits 
2a, 7, and 9. Note: Cognition testing cannot be done within 8 h ours of receiving benzodiazep ine or sleep medications. 
u. Visit 8 must occur at least after 7 days after completion of Vi sit 7, and there must be no changes in dose for at least 7 days  leading up to Visit 8.  
v. Safety follow-up visit will be p erformed 1 week (Day 42 +5 days ) after the end of study visit fo r subjects who did not rollove r in to the long-term

Informed consent forms must be  approved for use by the reviewing IEC/IRB. Before performing 
any study-related procedures, the investigator (or designee) wi ll obtain written informed consent 
from the subject.  
10.2 Study Procedures 
Assessments and their timings a re to be performed as outlined i n the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). Section 12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures schedul ed at a visit where study dru g is administered should be 
performed before administration of  treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
Efficacy assessments are described in Section 11 and include PANSS and CGI-S scores. 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs; cholinergic 
symptoms; cognition testing (C ANTAB); SAS; BARS; AIMS; body wei ght; BMI; waist 
circumference; orthostatic vita l signs; ECG; clinical laborator y assessments (hematology, clinical 
chemistry, coagulation, urinalys is, and drug screen); prolactin  levels; physical examination; and 
C-SSRS. 
PK assessments are described in Section 13 and include estimation of AUC, C max, and T max. 
The investigator may, at his/he r discretion, arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow u p or are considered by the 
investigator to be possibly rel ated to the use of study drug. T he unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed. The assessments and procedures that may be performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined i n the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Additional assessments 
can be performed as needed, at th e discretion of the investigat or, and after discussion with the 
medical monitor.

Page 60 of 92 11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician-admini stered scale used for measuring symptom severity of subjects 
with schizophrenia and is widel y used in the study of antipsych otic therapy[ 23]. The PANSS 
rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative syst em scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. S ubjects are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion  of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approx imately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is  the sum of all scales with a m inimum score of 30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder Factor. 
It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments for  all visits at which it is performed.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI-S is a rating scale com pleted independently by a clinician that is used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subjects with mental disorders. It is u sed to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of  assessment. The modified CGI-S  asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical  experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 =  normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline 
mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating is based upon observe d and reported symptoms, behav ior, and function in the past 
7 days. As symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week, the  score should reflect the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

Safety assessments (spontaneous AEs; cholinergic symptoms; cogn ition testing [CANTAB]; 
SAS; BARS; AIMS; body weight; BMI; waist circumference; orthostatic vital signs; ECG; 
clinical laboratory assessments  [hematology, clinical chemistry , coagulation, urinalysis, 
prolactin, and drug screen]; physi cal examination; and C-SSRS) are to be performed at 
protocol-specified visits, as s pecified in the Schedule of Asse ssments ( Table 2 ).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical and Psychiatric History 
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screenin g. The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alterna tively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity, which will be  obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Medical and psychiatric history w ill be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms  of the subject’s preexisting co nditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surg ical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include his tory of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within 1 year 
before Screening. 
Illnesses first occurring or de tected during the study and/or w orsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be docum ented as AEs on the eCRF in acc ordance with Section 12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medica l history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic vital signs (systol ic and diastolic  BP and heart ra te measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the  Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supine and standing after 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During tre atment, beginning with Day 1, orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning dose of the specified vi sit days, but additional orthos tatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically signific ant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repea ted at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinica lly significant vital sign me asurements must be recorded as 
AEs.

head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examinati on of thorax and abdomen, assessment of cardiac, 
musculoskeletal, and circulator y systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination) will be performed at visits as specif ied in Table 2 . Physical 
examinations will be performed by a physician. 
12.4 Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference 
Height (screening only), weight, a nd waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table 2 . BMI should be calculated at these visits. All findings should  be recorded 
in the eCRF. 12.5 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). During the ECG, ventricular ra te (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained. ECG at Day 1 will be  performed 2 hours (+ 
15 minutes) post morning dose. ECG s at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety lab oratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be i nterpreted by experienced indepe ndent blinded reader(s) at the 
central laboratory. 
At screening, the investigator w ill examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed o r artifacts are present.

Page 64 of 92 Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laborator y facility. Urine samples will be 
analyzed by dipstick, and a microscopic analysis will be performed if the results of dipstick 
indicate abnormalities to be further investigated. All laborato ry reports must be reviewed, signed, 
and dated by the investigator. A  legible copy of all reports mu st be filed with both the subject’s 
eCRF and medical record (source document) for that visit. Any l aboratory test result considered 
by the investigator to be clinically significant should be cons idered an AE (clinically significant 
AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically sig nificant abnormal values occurring 
during the study will be followed up with until repeat test res ults return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant.  
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug-induc ed liver toxicity, detailed in 
Section 12.7.5 , during the study. 
Other Laboratory Assessments: 
• A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be perf ormed at screening and at 
Visit 2a (baseline).  
• Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or blood alco hol test.  
• If a subject leaves the study site, he/she should have a urine drug screen test and test for 
alcohol (breathalyzer or blood al cohol test) upon returning to the study site. 
 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics 
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for explor atory pharmacogenetic analysis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA  extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central lab oratory facility, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The 
collection, storage, shipping, p rocessing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be 
used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.  
The genetic variants to be analyzed may include SNPs and any ot her variants as deemed 
necessary by the Sponsor.  The details on the statistical analysis will be provided either  in the statistical analysis plan (SAP)

conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the st udy. Clinically significant labor atory abnormalities should also be 
recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before t he subject enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the c onditions were known before stud y inclusion; the medical 
condition should be reported in t he subject’s med ical history. 
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period,  and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. A Es will be elicited by asking th e subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the r esults of the final laboratory tests 
are available. 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study d rug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is t o be classifie d as being seri ous or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are  to be documented on the eCRF. 
For the purposes of this st udy, the period of observation for c ollection of AEs extends from the 
time immediately after the ad ministration of study drug on Day 1 until the End of Study (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over a nd Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR-008 
study) or early termination. Follo w up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists un til the event resolves or stab ilizes at a level acceptable to the 
investigator. When changes in the intensity of  an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event shoul d be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be rec orded separately (with distinct  onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be grade d according to the National Ca ncer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classify ing AEs by intensity and relati onship to study drug are given in 
Table 4  and Table 5 . 
Table 4. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity 
MILD : An event that is easily toler ated by the subject, causing min imal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities. 
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently  discomforting to interfere with  normal everyday activities. 
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

UNRELATED : This category applies to those  AEs that are clearly and incon trovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc). 
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unre lated to the test drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlik ely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteri a: (1) it does not follow a rea sonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could read ily have been produced by the subject clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject;  (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worse n when the drug is readministered. 
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection wit h the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ru led out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following cri teria: (1) it follows a reasonab le temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily h ave been produced  by the subjec t’s clinical state, environm ental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject; or (3) i t follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those  AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably rela ted if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follo ws a reasonable temporal sequence from ad ministration of the drug;  (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subjec t clinical state, environm ental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy adminis tered to the subject; (3) it d isappears or decreases o n cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not dis appear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists;  for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a  known pattern of response to t he test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those  AEs that the investigator feel s are incontrovertib ly related to test

 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The AEs of special interest will be monitored. AE of special in terest is orthostasis. 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate. 
 Serious Adverse Events 
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life-threatening, 
• results in inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existin g hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective t reatment of a pre-existing, nonworsening condition is not,

medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF), 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and /or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, are c onsidered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for  the identificati on of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into accoun t both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either t he Sponsor or the investigator  believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered, during the study, or 
within 1 week of stopping the tr eatment must be reported to the  Catalyst Clinical Research 
Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor . Any such SAE due to any 
cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be report ed within 24 hours of occurrence 
or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made using email. 
Catalyst Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance email address is:  
The events must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminar y reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports, consultant  reports, autopsy reports, and  other documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the inv estigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. The investigator must report all additional follow-up evaluations to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research Pharmacovigila nce group within 24 hours of be coming aware of the additional 
information or as soon as is practicable. All SAEs will be foll owed up until the investigator and 
Sponsor agree the event is s atisfactorily resolved. 
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon di scontinuation of the subject’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either  resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown  to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures.

they are increasing or decreasing. An inqui ry should be made about the symptoms 
(fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadr ant pain or tenderness, fever, and rash). 
• Close observation should be initiated with ALT or AST >3 × ULN: 
o Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. Frequency of 
retesting can decrease to once per week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued, and the subject is asymptomatic. 
o Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
o Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement prepara tions), alcohol use, recreational drug 
use, and special diets. 
o Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
o Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
o Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver f unction, as appropriate (eg, international 
normalized ratio, direct bilirubin). 
o Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
• Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
o ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
o ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
o ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubi n >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio >1.5) 
o ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>5%)

viral, autoimmune, alcohol, hepatobiliary disorders, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concomitant medications, etc. 
• Follow up to resolution of elevated liver enzymes. 
• Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase elevations alone should not prompt drug 
discontinuation. 
 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious

SUSARs must be reported to the r elevant regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Spons or (or their designee) first ha s knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor (or their designee) is responsible for reporting SU SARs and any other events 
required to be reported in an expe dited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable even ts, in compliance with applicab le regulatory requirements within

Warnings and Precautions 
Risk of Urinary Retention: 
Trospium chloride tablets s hould be administered with caution to subjects with clinically 
significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. 
Angioedema: 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tong ue, and/or larynx has been re ported with trospium chloride, the 
active ingredient in trospium ch loride tablets. In one case, an gioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper air way swelling may be life 
threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or lary nx occurs, trospium chloride 
should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided. Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: 
Trospium should be administered with caution to subjects with G I obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastri c retention. Trospium chloride, like other  antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with co nditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis. 
Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma:  
In subjects being treated for narro w-angle glaucoma, trospium chloride should only be used if 
the potential benefits outweigh t he risks and in that circumsta nce only with careful monitoring. 
Central Nervous System Effects:  
Trospium chloride is associate d with anticholinergic CNS effects. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have bee n reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects should be mon itored for signs of anticholi nergic CNS effects, particularly

Page 70 of 92 after beginning treatment or i ncreasing the dose. Advise subjects not to drive or operate heavy 
machinery until they know how trospium chloride affects them. I f a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinua tion should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Ren al Impairment:  
Trospium is substantially excrete d by the kidney. The effects o f moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely  increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment.  
 Pregnancy 
WOCBP must have a negative pregna ncy test at screening. After a dministration of study drug, 
any known cases of pregnancy in female subjects will be reported until the subject completes or 
withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported immediately by faxing/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the 
event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow up 
with the subject until completi on of the pregnancy and must ass ess the outcome in the shortest 
possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the  pregnancy. The investigator 
should notify the Sponsor (or de signee) of the pregnancy outcom e by submitting a follow-up 
pregnancy report. If the outcome  of the pregnancy involved spon taneous or therapeutic abortion 
(any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be d ocumented), stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the event by faxing/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) wi thin 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event. This event is considered an SAE. 
Upon discontinuation from the st udy, only those procedures that would not expose the subject to 
undue risk will be performed. The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring 
during the study but confirmed af ter completion of the study. In the event that a subject is 
subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study,  any pregnancy will be followed to 
term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to th e Sponsor after delivery. 
 Overdose 
The investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study drug. Overdose should be managed with symptomatic and supportiv e care.

The AIMS is a rating scale that is used to measure involuntary movements know as tardive 
dyskinesia, which can sometimes  develop as a side effect of lon g-term treatment with 
antipsychotic medications. It is a 12-item scale to assess orof acial, extremity, and truncal 
movements as well as the overa ll severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s level of awareness of 
the movements. Items are score d from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more 
severe dyskinesia. 
12.12 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and trac k suicidal AEs (sui cidal behavior 
and suicidal ideati on) throughout the study[ 27]. The strength of this su icide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensive ly identify suicidal events w hile limiting the ove r identification 
of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes t o administer. The C-SSRS will be 
administered by a trained rater at the site. 
This study will utilize 2 versions of the C-SSRS. At the screen ing visit, the “lifetime” version 
will be completed; for all subse quent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C-SSRS will be 
administered. 
12.13 Functional Constipation Inquiry 
Constipation refers to bowel move ments that are infrequent or h ard to pass[ 28]. The stool is 
often hard and dry[ 29]. Other symptoms may include  abdominal pain, bloating, and fee ling as if 
one has not completely passed the bowel movement[ 30]. The normal frequency of bowel 
movements in adults is between 3 per day and 3 per week[ 28]. Constipation will be defined per 
the Rome III criteria, as less than 3 bowel movements per week,  APPENDIX 2  
(Longswreth,1486,C3)[ 31]. 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale has been correlated with a change in intestinal function, and had 
been shown to be a useful tool in c linical practice and researc h[32]. A sample Bristol Stool Form 
Scale is located in APPENDIX 2 . 
As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit, subject s will be asked whether they have 
experienced constipation per the ROME III criteria since the la st visit, and if yes, whether the 
constipation required intervent ion. If the subject answers yes,  sites are instructed to ask subjects 
to provide event date and ensure event is documented as an AE a nd treatment is documented as 
concomitant medication. Subjects will not be required to collect and present their stool sample 
nor will clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject as sessment. 
Additional attention can be give n to other complaints as well i ncluding: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard  stools and pain with bowel 
movements secondary to strain ing, abdominal pain, abdominal blo ating, and the sensation of 
incomplete bowel evacuation[ 30, 33 ].

As definitions of constipation are typically based on a history  of at least a week, site physician 
discretion will be allowed for initiation of such treatments.

short but accurate structured psychiatric interview for multice nter clinical studies and 
epidemiology. 12.15 Change in Prolactin 
Blood samples to assess the change  in prolactin levels will be obtained on Visit 2a/Day -1, 
Visit 7/Day 21 ± 2 days, and Visit 10/Day 35 -2 days/Early Term ination (ET). At each of these 
visits (except Visit 2a), blood s ample must be collected before  the morning dose of the study

 Blood Samples 
Blood samples for PK analysis of  KarXT levels will be collected  at the time points indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Approximately 6 mL of blood to be collected at each 
scheduled time point. The actual date and time of each blood sa mple collection will be recorded. 
• Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanome line and trospium will be 
obtained on Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days  (first dose of fixed titrati on period) and Visit 8/Day 28 
± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time points on these days:  
• Before the morning dose and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 hours af ter the morning dose (Note: 
The 12-hour sample must be collected before administration of t he evening dose).  
• The 0.5 and 1 hour samples should be collected within ± 5 minut es of the scheduled time. 
The 2, 4, 8, and 12 hour samples should be collected within ± 1 0 minutes of their scheduled 
times and before the evening dose. It is very important that th e exact time of each PK draw 
and dosing times are recorded in the eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the 
specified times of collection. 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of potential dose escalation for Visit 5. 
•  For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If vi sit windows are used for 
Visit 8, the PK sampling should occur at least 7 days after Vis it 7 is completed, and there 
must be no changes in dose for at least 7 days leading up to Vi sit 8. PK sampling must 
accompany the actual day of Visit 8.  
Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before discharge (pref erably in the morning) at 
Visit 10/Day 35 -2 days or ET. In addition, one PK sample may b e drawn if a 
relevant/significant AE is repo rted during a scheduled visit or  if there is a dose adjustment 
or relevant/significant AE repor ted during an unscheduled visit  (no multiple draws). For an 
ET Visit that is related to an AE, the collection of a PK blood  sample is not optional and 
should be drawn before discharge. 
Details of PK blood sample collection, processing, storage, and  shipping procedures will be

regarding the definition of analy sis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences. 
The statistical evaluati on will be performed using SAS® software vers ion 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary  tables will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented by dose group. For continu ous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of s ubjects (N), mean and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by treatment group. For categorical variables, data  will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subjects for each category by treatmen t group. 
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of  change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 
8 points between drug and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 9 0.3% for a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects  are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
All subjects who are randomize d to the study will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population 
All subjects who are randomize d, received at least 1 dose of study drug, have a baseline PANSS 
assessment, and at least 1 post-baseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT 
population and will be used in the efficacy analysis. 
Safety Population 
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug will be  included in the safety population 
and will be used in the safety analysis. 
PK Population 
All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be included in the PK population and will be 
used in the PK analysis. Subject s must have received at least 1  dose of active study drug and 
have at least 1 measurable pl asma concentration of study drug.

Page 77 of 92 14.3 General Statistical Considerations 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT populati on. The statistical analysis of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for m ultiplicity by using a fixed 
sequence testing procedure. The  primary endpoint of change from  baseline to Week 5 in PANSS 
total score will be evaluated first. The endpoints are set up as a hierarchical list and step down 
through the statistical testi ng of each endpoint using an alpha  of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS n egative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS re sponders will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha l evel (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would 
continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy e ndpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control t he overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested. Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from b aseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5 will be estimated using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include the change from baseline 
PANSS total scores at Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, and Week 5 as the  response. The treatment 
difference at Week 5 will be estimated using contrasts. The MMRM will include the treatment 
group (KarXT or placebo), visit, a nd the interaction between th e treatment group and visit as 
fixed factors. Site, age, sex, a nd baseline PANSS total score w ill be used as covariates in the 
model. Low-enrolling sites will  be pooled, if necessary, for modeling purposes. The algorithm 
for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be pe rformed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying tr eatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. The sensitivity analy ses of the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP.

 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Wee k 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in 
the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMR M).  
The categorical secondary endpoint ( percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT and placebo) using  the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary effic acy variables will account for 
multiplicity by using a fixed sequence testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested. 
14.5 Safety Analysis 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for  Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher. The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by  System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term. All AEs will be listed by subject, along with i nformation regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome. 
Orthostatic vital signs, clinical laboratory data, prolactin levels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics, i ncluding observed and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with value s outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by treatment group. Similar descriptiv e summaries will be provided for 
C-SSRS, SAS, BARS, change in c ognition (CANTAB), AIMS, body wei ght, BMI, and waist 
circumference. 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
• PK results will be listed for all subjects who received active treatment. The profiles or time 
points obtained with protocol de viations affecting PK results w ill be flagged and may be 
excluded from summaries and analyses. 
• The data will be presented graphi cally via individual plots and  mean plots summarized by 
actual treatment, visit, and time point.  
• PK parameters for xanomeline and trospium will be derived from plasma concentration 
data using noncompartmental methods. Actual time elapsed from d osing will be used to 
estimate all individual PK parameters. The primary PK parameters of interest will include 
Cmax, Tmax, and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from 0 to the last measurable concentration).

clearance, and volume of distribution will be determined if the  data permit. 
• The effect of dose on PK and other inferential analyses for exp osure-response relationship 
may be performed. The details of the PK analysis will be descri bed in the SAP. The 
noncompartmental analysis will be  described as a part of final clinical study report. 
14.7 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis is  planned for this study. 
14.8 Handling of Missing Data 
Several different methods to handl e the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used. 
• For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling ap proach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied. 
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the last 
observation carried for ward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by the previous visit P ANSS total score carried forwar d.  
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by replacing each missing val ue with a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute).

For each study subject, written informed consent will be obtain ed before any protocol-related 
activities. As part of this procedure, the principal investigat or or designee must explain orally 
and in writing the nature of th e study, its purpose, procedures , expected duration, alternative 
therapy available, and the benefits and risks involved in study  participation. The subject should 
be informed that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time, and the subject will receive all 
information that is required by local regulations and guideline s for ICH. The principal 
investigator will provide the Sponsor or its representative with a copy of the IEC-/IRB-approved ICF before the start of the study. 
The ICF should be revised wheneve r there are substantial change s to procedures or when new 
information becomes available that may affect the willingness o f the subject to participate. 
Revisions to the consent form required during the study must be  approved by the Sponsor and 
IEC/IRB, and a copy of the revised consent form is provided to the Sponsor. For any updated or 
revised consent forms, the subjects must be re-consented for continued participation in the study.

Page 90 of 92 APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men whose sexual pa rtners are WOCBP must 
use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 7 days after the 
last dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarch e and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bila teral oophorecto my. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 mont hs without an alternative medic al cause. A high 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile aft er puberty unless permanently st erile by bilateral  orchidectomy. 
Highly effective methods of contr aception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contrac eption associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administ ration may be oral, intravagin al, or transdermal) 
• progestogen-only hormonal contrace ption associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(administration may be oral, injectable, or implantable) 
• intrauterine device 
• intrauterine horm one-releasing system 
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion 
• vasectomy (provided that the mal e has a medical assessment of surgical success) 
• sexual abstinence (defined as re fraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk in relation to the  duration of the clinical tria l, in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject) 
All subjects will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male subjects) should 
not become pregnant while on study treatment or for 7 days afte r the last dose. A  female subject 
will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and 
appropriate management in the e vent that she may be pregnant.

Study Sites: Approximately 10 sites in the Un ited States and 10 sites in Ukr aine 
Phase of Development: Phase 3  
Objectives: Primary Objective 
The primary objective of the study is to e valuate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride [xanomeli ne 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in red ucing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome S cale (PANSS) total scores in ad ult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and  Statistical Manual‒Fifth Editi on (DSM-5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To evaluate the reduction of PAN SS positive score in subjects

• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of xanomeline and trospium 
after administration of KarXT in adults who are acutely psychot ic 
with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia 
Exploratory Objectives : 
The exploratory objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the change in cognition measuring core domains of 
impairment in schizophrenia using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)

Study Design: This is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 
placebo-controlled, multicenter in patient study in adults who a re 
acutely psychotic with a DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subj ects 
will be randomized (1: 1 ratio) to receive either KarXT or place bo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Su bjects will start on a lead-in d ose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the first  
2 days (Days 1 and 2) followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 B ID 
unless the subject is continuing t o experience AEs from the pre vious 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID . All subjects who were increa sed 
to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and tolerab ility, 
will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the rema inder 
of the treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 ( Day 21) 
of the study and may be decrea sed for tolerability reasons no m ore than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 12 5/30

Page 7 of 96 BID may not occur outside of t he permitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8. 
A safety follow-up v isit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be pe rformed 
for all those subjects who do not rollover in to the long-term open-label 
study KAR-008.  The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophrenia subjects with acute psychosis will resul t in 
significantly greater reduction (i e, improvement) in the primar y and 
secondary endpoints at Week 5 fro m baseline compared with place bo. 
The endpoints are set up as a hi erarchical list and step down t hrough 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an  alpha of 0.05 . Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive sco re, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S , 
and percentage of PANSS responder s will be performed only if the 
primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0. 05), and 
testing would continue through a preordered list of key seconda ry 
efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.0 5, then formal stati stical 
testing would stop. This will c ontrol the overall Type 1 error rate across 
all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

19. Risk of violent or destructive behavior. 
20. Current involuntary hospitalization or incarceration. 
Planned Sample Size: A total of approximately 246 adult subjects (aged 18 to 65 year s, inclusive) 
are planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 treatment grou ps, either 
KarXT or placebo. 
Investigational Therapy: 1. Fixed dose KarXT 50/20 BID (50 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospium), 
oral (Days 1 to 2) 
2. Fixed dose KarXT 100/20 BID (100 mg xanomeline/20 mg trospium), oral (Days 3 to 7) 
3. Fixed dose KarXT 125/30 BID (125 mg xanomeline/30 mg trospium), oral (Days 8 to 35, if tolerated) 
Reference Therapy: Matching placebo BID oral  
Treatment Duration: Total study duration is up to 8 w eeks, including a 7-day screen ing phase (up 
to a 7-day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if nece ssary), a 
5-week treatment period, and a 7- day follow-up period (only for  subjects who 
do not rollover to KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this stu dy will have 
the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label study (KAR-008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  
Efficacy Assessments: PANSS total score, PANSS positive score, PANSS ne gative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, and  CGI-S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits. 
Safety Assessments: Spontaneous AEs including AESIs, procholinergic and anticholine rgic 
symptoms, SAS, BARS, AIMS, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, orthostatic vita l signs, ECG, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, clinical c hemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and d rug screen), 
prolactin levels, physical examination, and C-SSRS will be evaluated throughout the study as scheduled. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: AUC, C max, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits. 
Statistical Methods and Planned Analyses: Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population. 
Modified ITT (mITT) population: All subjects who are randomized , received 
at least 1 dose of study drug, h ave a baseline PANSS assessment , and at least 
1 postbaseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT po pulation 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis. 
Safety population: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of  study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in t he safety 
analysis. 
PK population: All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile wi ll be 
included in the PK population an d will be used in the PK analys is. Subjects 
must have received at least 1 dose of active study drug and hav e at least 
1 measurable plasma concentration of study drug.  The primary efficacy endpoint of t he study is the change from b aseline in 
PANSS total score at Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures. Th e key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in P ANSS 
positive score, PANSS negative sc ore, PANSS Negative Marder Fac tor 
score, CGI-S score, and percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5. The

Assuming the treatment difference in the change from baseline i n PANSS 
total score at Week 5 is 8 points  between KarXT and placebo (st andard 
deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 172 subjects (86 evaluable 
subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2-sided  alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With an anticipated dropout rate of 30%, a total of  246 subjects 
are estimated to be enrolled.

Page 20 of 96 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia 
Schizophrenia is a long-term men tal disorder involving a breakd own in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and pers onal relationships into fantasy  and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fragmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination , disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of sch izophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United Sta tes (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US is 5 .1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, wit h males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schiz ophrenia is antipsychotic drugs (APDs)[ 5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blocka ge of all or subsets of dopami ne receptors in the brain. 
First-generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; t reatment with these agents is 
marked by high rates of parkinsonia n extrapyramidal symptoms (E PS) and tardive dyskinesia, 
and they consequently have lim ited use today. The second-genera tion agents that include 
risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapi ne, lurasidone, aripiprazole, and lumateperone tend to have 
lower levels of EPS or tardive  dyskinesia and are currently the  most commonly prescribed APD 
class. However, the second-gene ration drugs also have problemat ic side effects that include 
significant weight gain, metabo lic disturbances, sedation, and akathisia[ 6,7,8]. These side effects 
contribute to poor medication adh erence resulting in frequent r elapses and hospitalizations[ 9,10]. 
Thus there is a need for medica tions for schizophrenia which ac t through alternative 
mechanisms. 
Central muscarinic receptors  have been hypothesized to be thera peutic treatments for 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human 
studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarin ic receptors (M1-M5). The th erapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor a gonism is thought to be due to ago nism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous  system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric  binding sites that  the receptor s share, leading to adverse events 
(AEs) related to activation of t hese peripheral receptors. Thus , any potential benefit of 
muscarinic agonists in schizophren ia (or other indications such  as Alzheimer’s disease [AD]) has 
been outweighed by the occurrence of  AEs associated with peripheral cholinergic side effects 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT (Xanomeline Tartrate and Trospium Chloride)  
Xanomeline tartrate is a muscarinic-cholinergic receptor agonis t. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M
1 and M 4 receptors and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects

Page 21 of 96 (Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomelin e is a very potent M 4 muscarinic 
agonist in vivo, measured by vari ous second messenger assays[ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapidly achieving a brain to plasma ratio of greater than  10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate[ 15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any di rect binding activity on dopamin ergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action is unrel ated to direct dopamine involve ment. 
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relev ant antipsychotic efficacy. In a  multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo  were assessed for 
26 weeks[ 16,17]. Significant dose-dependent imp rovements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placebo were observed. Moreover, p sychotic symptoms resolved qu ite rapidly in subjects who 
were symptomatic at baseline a nd a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analy sis, cognitive improvement 
was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be nec essary for cognitive 
enhancement[ 16,17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-control led inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant s ubjects with schizophrenia, xanom eline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid imp rovement in psychosis compared t o placebo. In addition, 
improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia t rials, as well as in previous  healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting , nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side e ffects were frequent and, at t he higher doses of xanomeline led 
to significant rates of disconti nuation in the AD studies. This “procholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of  xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procho linergic AEs associated with xano meline are mediated by 
xanomeline’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically a menable to counteracting peripher al anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospium chloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonis t which binds to and antagonizes 
all five muscarinic receptor subtypes[ 19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 years by the Food and Drug Adm inistration (FDA) and by European authorities to treat 
overactive bladder and is  generally well tolerated[ 19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospium does  not appreciably cross the blood  brain barrier, consistent with the 
drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospium chloride. Karuna 
hypothesized that the addition of t rospium would mitigate perip heral procholinergic side effects 
(vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweat ing and hyper-salivation) and  thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stim
ulate brain muscarinic re ceptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this co mbination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced these side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in se verity and transient in nature,

Page 22 of 96 often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single-episode. In general, 
KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These enc ouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for  the treatment of schizophrenia  and potentially other CNS 
disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well-controlled, randomized, multi-center 
Phase 2, placebo-controlled, inpa tient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subjects (KAR-004). KarXT demonstrated a statisticall y significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Nega tive Syndrome Scale (PANSS) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001), with statistical s eparation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4, and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg) administer ed twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnosis of schizophr enia. A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.  Xanomeline is currently not approved or marketed in any country . Trospium is marketed in the 
US and other regions of the world for the treatment of overacti ve bladder. 
Nonclinical Studies 
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. 
More detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of xanomeline tartrate was evaluated in mice  and rats. All animals were 
observed for 2 weeks for mortalit y and clinical signs of intole rance, and then necropsied for 
gross examinations. In-life findings attributed to the test article included excessive 
muscarinic-mediated pharmacology, such as excessive salivation,  hypoactivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors, and convulsions, with survivors typically appearing normal by Days 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy wer e generally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous-filled gastrointestinal [GI] tracts after oral dosing). 
KarXT-301 was a 14-day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats wher e relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospium were given, with either xanomeline alon e or in combination with 
trospium. Seven groups of 10 rats/sex/group were administered e ither vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (spli t into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospium combination dosages of 150/20 0 mg/kg/day or 
225/400 mg/kg/day, respectively (s plit into BID doses, every 12  hours).  
Satellite animals were included for the collection of plasma af ter the first and la st doses for the 
determination of drug concentrations of each parent drug in sup port of toxicokinetic (TK) 
assessments.  
There was no target-organ toxic ity revealed by clinical patholo gy or by gross or microscopic 
assessments. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article.

Page 23 of 96 No dose-related ophthalmic observa tions were noted. Findings we re not indicative of specific 
target organ toxicity. In short, no new hazard was identified.  
Clinical observations noted in mos t animals administered 300 mg /kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral dischar ge, dilated pupils, irregular o r labored respiration, and rough hair 
coat, among other observations. The se findings are generally co nsistent with the anticipated 
pharmacology of xanomeline.  
Three TK animals in the low-dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus  the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed t o these deaths. If gavage 
accidents were involved (as happened with some TK animals), the n they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no mic roscopic evidence of toxicity w as seen in any toxicity animals 
in this group or i n the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination group. Two toxicology animals had evi dence of gavage accidents.  For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined, and a test article-related effect canno t be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of es ophageal muscular is indicated s ome dosing-related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involve d, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no 
evidence of target organ micros copic findings in GI tract or an y other tissue of any animal, 
including the early deat h toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics-mediated reduction in GI motility is consist ent with the anti-muscarinic 
effects of trospium on intestinal  musculature. Fecal retention,  malabsorption, cessation of eating, 
dehydration, and rapid deteriora tion followed with continued do sing. Cessation of dosing in the 
high dose combination animals tha t survived led to rapid recove ry, implying the deleterious 
effects had been pharmacodynamics-related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any xanomeline-alone group. The lac k of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or 
surviving animal implies that t he adverse effects were pharmaco logically mediated rather than 
direct target organ toxicity. 
Twenty-eight Day Repeat-Dose St udies with Xanomeline in Rats an d Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0% , 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monke ys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived  until necropsy. Safety findings in 
rats included reduced body wei ght in the high dose group, incre ases in gamma-glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile  duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), a nd lower serum globulin (femal es). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of  intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrh ea, hypoactivity, 
weight loss, and treatment-relate d tachycardia in the high-dose animals. 
Forty-Day Repeat Dose Study of Kar XT in Rats (KarXT-302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were given vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day, tr ospium alone at 100 mg/kg/day, 
or xanomeline/trospium combination at doses of 75/50 mg/kg/day or 150/100 mg/kg/day, with

Page 24 of 96 all doses split into BID doses. Satellite rats (TK animals) wer e included for col lection of plasma 
after the first and last doses to determine concentrations of e ach drug. Dosing was initially 
planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxic ity was seen. Safety findings inc luded pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the trospium alone and combination groups and m ild biliary hyperplasia in the 
high-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4  unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high-dose xa nomeline alone group (150 g/kg/da y) and 2 in the high-dose 
combination group (150 mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospium). Both 
xanomeline-only animals had necropsy gross findings of a gavage  accident, and cause of death 
could not be determined. All toxico logy animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. Sponsor 
considers that the volume deple tion and trauma of multiple blee ds (3 per animal), followed by 
reduced absorption of fluids and nutrients secondary to reduced  GI motility with continued BID 
dosing explains the greater demise  of TK animals relative to to xicity animals.  
Based on the results of the 90-day rat toxicology study, oral a dministration of tro spium chloride 
and xanomeline tartrate alone or in combination to Crl:CD (SD) rats BID (12 hours ± 60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 a nd 50 mg/kg/dose trospium chlori de, 37 and 75 mg/kg/dose 
xanomeline tartrate, and a combination of 37/25, 75/25, and 75/ 50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospium chloride for  a minimum of 90 days resulted in  minimal to moderate bile duct 
hyperplasia in the livers of the  xanomeline tartrate and combin ation (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospium chloride) group mal es. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when compa ring the single vs combination groups, there was an increased 
severity observed in the combin ation group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose 
combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the terminal euthanasia. The bile duc t hyperplasia was considered a dverse in the high-dose 
xanomeline tartrate group male s and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group 
males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed-adverse-effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, 
and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the comb ination of xanomeline tartrate /trospium chloride. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium, 
146,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL fo r trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 267,000 pg• hr/mL for xanomeline; an d 16,700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL 
for trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence  of bile duct hyperplasia in 
females cannot be explained from  differences in drug exposure. At the recovery e uthanasia, bile 
duct hyperplasia was still pres ent but was limited to minimal s everity, and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomelin e tartrate and combination group  males. There was also no 
notable difference in severity between the single vs combinatio n groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased i ncidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts  at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smal ler/flattened epithelium, 
noninflammatory, and an absence of  portal bridging), changes at the recovery eut hanasia were

Page 25 of 96 consistent with a partial resolution of bile duct hyperplasia. With an absence of  correlating serum 
liver enzyme elevations, bile acid alterations or hepatocellula r degeneration, necrosis or 
regeneration, and with the appare nt reversibility after cessati on of treatment, these findings 
appear to have been tolerable by the affected animals. Therefor e, the maximum tolerated dose 
was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dos e for trospium chloride, 75 mg /kg/dose for xanomeline 
tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomelin e tartrate/trospium chloride. For 
males, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL  for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For fem ales, corresponding mean plasma  AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 
950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Da y 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospium (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerati ons of systemic and CNS 
muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomelin e or trospium at high doses. 
Target organ findings with xanom eline alone were limited to bil iary hyperplasia in the 28-day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12- month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 
6-month monkey study. With KarXT , biliary hyperplasia was not o bserved in the 14-day rat 
study but was reported in the 40-day rat study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not 
thought to represent pre-neoplastic lesions, because they were of low severity; no fibrosis or 
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary-related 
serum chemistry.  
Completed Clinical Studies 
Refer to the IB for complete information regarding previous clinical studies conducted with 
xanomeline by Eli Lilly, and studies KAR-001, KAR-002, KAR-003, a nd KAR-004 conducted 
by Karuna Therapeutics using xanomeline with trospium. 
To date, more than 840 subjects or volunteers have been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral formulation, either alone, in combination with trospium, or as the combination drug KarXT) in 
19 completed clinical studies c onducted either by Eli Lilly or Karuna Therapeutics, some for as 
long as 3 years. In those studies, significant improvements in cognition and red uced psychotic 
symptoms were observed.  
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[ 18]. In 
this pilot study, the effects of x anomeline were examined in 20  subjects with schizophrenia 
utilizing a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-week study desi gn. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly be tter than subjects in the placeb o group on Brief Psychiatric 
Rating Scale total scores and PANSS total scores (ie, 24-point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test battery, subjects in the xanomeline group sh owed improvements relative to 
placebo in some of the cognitive domains of verbal learning and  short-term memory function.

Page 26 of 96 These studies demonstrated the  potential for xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and 
cognition across multiple subject populations.  
Study H2Q-EW-E001, conducted by Lilly, had 36 male healthy volu nteers in 4 groups of 9, who 
were administered escalating sin gle doses of xanomeline tartrat e in increments of 1, 5, 10, 25, 
50, 75, 100 mg, and 150 mg. Each group took 2 ascending doses of xanomeline tartrate and 
1 dose of placebo in a single subject blind manner. There were no serious AEs (SAEs). AEs 
included watery diarrhea, nausea , dizziness, sweating, shiverin g, mild disorientation, increased 
blood pressure (BP), increase i n sitting and stand ing heart rat e, slight increase i n supine systolic 
BP, and postural hypotension. 
The clinical experience with Kar XT initiated by Karuna Therapeu tics to date includes 
3 completed Phase 1, clinical ph armacology studies in healthy v olunteers (KAR-001, KAR-002, 
and KAR-003) and one completed P hase 2 study (KAR-004) in adult  inpatients with DSM-5 
schizophrenia. The first study conducted by Kar una, KAR-001 was “A Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, 
multiple-dose, pilot study comparing xanomeline administered alone to xanomeline administered 
in combination with trospium chloride in normal healthy volunte ers.” This study consisted of 
2 arms, in which xanomeline was ad ministered TID, alone, at a total daily dose of 225 mg in one 
arm, and the second arm received the same dose of xanomeline in  combination with trospium 
chloride 20 mg administered BID , a total daily dose of 40 mg. S ubjects were treated for 7 days. 
The goal was to determine whet her this dosing regimen would red uce the cholinergic side effects 
of xanomeline by co-administration of the muscarinic antagonist, trospium.  
Overall, treatment with xanome line 225 mg daily + trospium 40 m g daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and w ell tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (a lthough not statistically signif icant) in visual analog scale (VAS) 
scores for cholinergic events for  the xanomeline + trospium tre atment arm compared to the 
xanomeline alone treatment arm. S pecifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for 
the xanomeline + trospium treat ment arm was observed for the su pportive endpoints of 
maximum weekly individual VAS scores and mean daily maximum com posite VAS scores.  
Results of the clinician-administered scales were supportive of  a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and s weating that interfered with  daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm. 
There were no meaningful diffe rences between treatment groups i n heart rate, resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardi ogram (ECG) parameters includ ing QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment arms  had transient increases in hear t rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in  those subjects. Two subjects 
(both in the xanomeline alone a rm) experienced syncope. The inc idence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-h alf that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.

Page 27 of 96 The most commonly reported treatm ent-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in KAR-001 (≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were  hyperhidrosis, salivary hypersecr etion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences  of these 5 TEAEs was higher in  the xanomeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm  (34.3%).  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospiu m chloride 40 mg 
administered over 7 days was consid ered safe and w ell-tolerated . The observed side effect profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospium chloride. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was  lower in the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm 
compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm. 
Study KAR-002 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple -dose adaptive design pilot 
study to evaluate the safety a nd tolerability of KarXT in norma l healthy volunteers. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID or place bo. The first cohort of this 
study was stopped after 1.5 days w hen the US FDA put the program on hold due to a preliminary 
rat finding in the 14-day study. T his study used a new formulation of KarXT in which 
xanomeline and trospium were com bined into a single dose form a nd given BID. Safety findings 
included an increase in orthosta tic complaints. Caution should be used in drawing conclusions 
from this study, as subjects did not have time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as 
only 3 doses were given. 
Study KAR-003 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple -dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability o f KarXT in normal healthy 
volunteers. The primary objective  of this study was to assess t he safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarX T at various dose combinations, administered BID. Subjects 
received either KarXT or place bo (3:1 ratio). A ll subjects on K arXT received 2 days of 50 mg 
xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID, and then increased to differen t doses for Days 3 to 7. This 
study also used the new formulation of KarXT in which xanomelin e and trospium were 
combined into a single dosage form and given BID.  
There was a relatively high degr ee of variability in xanomeline and trospium exposures between 
individuals in all c ohorts, which is consistent with previous results with KarXT, 
xanomeline-alone, and trospium-alone. Peak plasma concentration s were observed at a median 
time of 2.0 hours for xanomeline and 1.0 hour for trospium acro ss all treatment groups and study 
days.  
Although there was insufficient data to draw a definitive concl usion regarding the impact of 
trospium on the pharmacokinetics ( PK) and bioavailability of xa nomeline, or the impact of 
xanomeline on the PK and bioavail ability of trospium, the PK re sults suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK  behavior of the other drug. 
During the 2-day lead-in phase, t he most common AEs (≥20% of su bjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that 
completed dosing, although the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the KarXT 100/20 BID

Page 28 of 96 (66.7%) group compared to KarXT 125/40 group (88.9%), the incid ence of cholinergic TEAEs 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) w as similar between the 2 groups. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs ( 20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, d yspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria. For the t reatment groups that did not com plete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were g enerally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing.  
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur primarily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospium BID (KarXT 150/40 BID and KarXT 125/4 0 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID, suggesting  to consider slightly lowering 
the trospium dose from 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs w ere mild or moderate in 
severity, and there were no SAEs  or deaths. Treatment-emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few antic holinergic). Doses of 100 mg and  125 mg BID of xanomeline were 
well tolerated when paired with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospium , respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID w as acceptable and supports 
further evaluation at similar dos es in future studies. Doses of  KarXT 150/20 BID and 
150/40 BID were not well tolerate d in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg 
trospium appeared to be better tolerated than 150/20, but some subjects still experienced 
tolerability issues. 
Study KAR-004 was a Phase 2 ra ndomized, double-blinded study to  assess the safety 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM-5 schizophrenia, hospitaliz ed with acute 
psychosis. The primary objective of the study was to assess the  efficacy of KarXT 125/30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS to tal scores in adult inpatien ts with a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 
5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead-in dose of KarXT  50/20 BID for the first 2 days 
followed by KarXT 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing w as titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 BID unless the subject was continuing to experienc e AEs from previous dose 
increase of 100/20 BID. The clinic al portion of this study was completed and clinical study 
report is in progress. No new safety concerns have arisen durin g this study. 
The KAR-004 trial results are  unambiguous regarding efficacy, w here not only the primary 
outcome measure showed a robust separation from placebo, but th e additional sensitivity and 
secondary outcome measures were  consistently robust as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically mea ningful mean reductions in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo (P < 0.0001) in the modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjuste d mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a 
difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score (Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and 4; more over, the difference appears 
to be widening with each succes sive timepoint. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the p

5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of  KarXT and Study Rationale 
The risks and benefits of KarXT  in humans are not fully known. KarXT is a fixed dose 
combination of xanomeline and trosp ium. The available clinical trial data indica te that KarXT 
has robust efficacy and a favorable safety profile that appears  unique compared with all available 
APDs. Treatment with KarXT is not associated with weight gain, sedation, or meaningful EPS 
changes. In contrast, these seri ous side effects pose a signifi cant risk with other APD treatments 
for schizophrenia and can lead t o discontinuation  of treatment and significant morbidity. A Phase 
2 registration qualit y pivotal trial in 182 subjects met the pr imary endpoint with the PANSS total 
score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo  with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 place bo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with placebo, demonstrated highly significant reductio n in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (Weeks 2, 4,  and, 5) with a calculated effects 
size (Cohen’s d) of 0.75. KarXT, as compared to placebo, demons trated significant improvement 
at all post randomization time points for PANSS positive sympto m subscores, PANSS negative 
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor negative symptom subscores, and CGI-S scores. 
More than 840 subjects or volunt eers have been exposed to xanom eline tartrate (oral 
formulation, either alone, in c ombination with trospium, or as the fixed dose combination drug 
KarXT) in clinical studies. These  early clinical studies, as well as nonclinical pharmacology and 
toxicology studies, have not revea led any specific contraindica tions to the use of xanomeline. 
The most common side effects/symptoms are the cholinergic relat ed effects: nausea, vomiting, 
excess salivation, excess sw eating, and diarrhea. In addition, subjects treated with xanomeline 
alone have reported both syncope and orthostatic dizziness. The  addition of trospium decreases 
the peripheral cholinergic effect of xanomeline creating a bett er tolerated therapy. In addition, a 
titration phase also increases the tolerability of KarXT. 
Trospium chloride has been marketed in the US for 12 years. The most frequently reported AEs 
reported in pivotal trials we re dry mouth, constipation, abdomi nal pain, headache, urinary

package insert for trospium chloride tablets for oral use can be found in the IB. 
In a Phase 2 (KAR-004) clini cal study, KarXT (100/20 and 125/30 ) significantly reduced the 
symptoms of schizophrenia in sub jects with acute psychosis afte r treatment for 28 days. KarXT 
also showed an acceptable safety profile with the most common T EAEs being constipation, 
nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. All the reported TE AEs were mild or moderate in 
intensity. One SAE (psychotic d isorder) was reported by a singl e subject and no deaths were 
reported in the study. KarXT was generally well-tolerated and f ound to be safe in this patient 
population. 
KarXT represents a novel appro ach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningf ul alternative t o current ther apies. The current tolerability and 
AE profile and the efficacy of KarXT justify further development of KarXT in this patient 
population by advancing to Phase 3 trials. 
Subjects assigned to active st udy drug may benefit by improveme nt in schizophrenia symptoms. 
Since subjects will be having an acute psychotic event, subject s will be hospitalized where the 
clinical staff is available to help them 24 hours a day. In add ition, the inpatient setting represents 
an important venue for research, examining the effects of KarXT  and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible , subjectivity and bias. Furthermore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adher ence.

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This Phase 3, randomized, double- blind, parallel-group, placebo -controlled, multicenter, 
inpatient clinical study in adults  who are acutely psychotic wi th a DSM-5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment  with KarXT will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie,  improvement) in the primary and secondary endpoints at 
Week 5 from baseline compared with placebo. Total study duratio n is up to 8 weeks, including a 
7-day screening phase (up to a 7-day extension of the screening  phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7- day follow-up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to 
KAR-008 study). Subjects completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a 
long-term open-label study (KAR- 008) in which every subject will receive KarXT. 
Screening Period:  
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize app roximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US and 10 sites in Ukraine. Subje cts will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receiv e either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5 weeks. 
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all s ubjects assigned to KarXT will st art on a lead-in dose of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the first  2 days (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless 
the subject is continuing to expe rience AEs from the previous d ose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All 
subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, will have the opti on to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of the 
treatment period. Dosing must not  change after Visit 7 (Day 21)  of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerab ility reasons no more t han once during the  study. In addition, dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 BID may not occur outside of the per mitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day 8.  
All randomized subjects will have structured diagnostic intervi ew sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study (see Schedule of Assessments Table 2 ). Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed. 
Efficacy assessments (PANSS scores and CGI-S score) will be ass essed at scheduled visits. 
Refer to Section 11 for more details. 
Safety will be assessed through spontaneous AEs including AESIs , procholinergic and 
anticholinergic symptoms, cognition testing, SAS, BARS, AIMS, body weight, BMI, waist

 Page 41 of 96 7.2 Discussion of Study Design 
A randomized, double-blind, parall el-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimiz e bias and provide reference data 
for comparison of efficacy and safet y parameters of the investigational drug. 
Schizophrenia is a long-term menta l disorder which requires a chronic therapy. A 5-week 
treatment duration is considered  an acceptable treatment durati on to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint ca n be achieved). The 5-week tre atment duration is substantiated 
by the statistically significan t outcome of the KAR-004 study of the same duration.  
7.3 End of Study 
A subject will have fulfilled the requirements for study comple tion when the subject has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit ( Visit 10/Day 35 [End of 
Treatment] for subjects who ro ll over into KAR-008 or Visit 11/Day 42 [Follow-up] for subjects 
who do not roll over into the KAR-008 study) as indicated in th e Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subjects completing this study wil l have the option of rolling over into a long-term open-label 
study (KAR-008) in which every subj ect will receive KarXT, following completion of 
Visit 10/Day 35 of the cu rrent study (KAR-009). 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for subjects 
who have completed Visit 10/Day 35 but do not rollover in to th e long-term open-label study. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee 
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group  of individuals with pertinent 
expertise that reviews on a re gular basis accumulating safety a nd tolerability data from the 
clinical study. The ISMC will include 3 clinicians and a report ing statistician. This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for an y new toxicities that might be 
involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinde d data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important sa fety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the detail s of the types of data to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no trigger s), and the communication plan 
for disseminating review recommendations.

Page 45 of 96 8.3 Rescreening 
Individuals who sign the informe d consent form (ICF) to partici pate in the study but who do not 
subsequently meet all the require ments for safety laboratory as sessments and therefore do not 
enroll (screen failures) ma y be rescreened, upon approval of the medical monitor on a case by 
case basis. Such individuals may be allowed to rescreen up to 1  time. When re-testing within the 
same screening procedure, only the  exclusionary laboratory test s will be repeated once in case 
the exclusionary laboratory res ult was not due to a pathologica l condition and was occasional 
(except for individuals who have positive serology results).  
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects 
If a subject discontinues study t reatment and is withdrawn from  the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notif y the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorde d on the electronic case report form (eCRF). Subjects who 
complete or discontinue early f rom the study will be discharged  from the study site, if clinically 
warranted after completing all the Visit 10/early termination assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). 
Note: A safety follow-up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Study visit for those 
subjects who do not roll over int o the long-term open-label stu dy KAR-008. 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the s tudy because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEA E will be followed up until it res olves (returns to normal or 
baseline values) or stabilizes , or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clinically 
significant. 
Once a subject is withdrawn fro m the study, the subject will no t re-enter the study. 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw  or be withdrawn from the stu dy at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease 
• unacceptable toxicity or AE 
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a subject’s partici pation in the study may be 
terminated at his/her request . The reason for subject withdrawa l will be noted on the 
eCRF 
• on the basis of the investig ator’s clini cal judgement 
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated  to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatmen t and necessitated the subject’s  termination from the 
study

Page 46 of 96 • general or specific changes in the subject’s condition that ren ders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to t he inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject has need for a 
medication prohibited by the protocol) 
• subject fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance [if a study 
subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row])  
• violation of entry criteria; ie,  subjects who are enrolled but are later discovered not to 
meet entry criteria 
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.8. Any study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study tre atment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term 
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, pa rticularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who compl eted the study. 
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subjects who leave t he unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of study will be followed until the AE is resolved (regardless of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open-label study KAR-008) or the subject is considere d to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in  case of SAEs or if special 
circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making fu rther treatment of subjects 
impossible. In this event, the i nvestigator(s) will be informed  of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy 
No evidence of mutagenicity, o r treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animal s following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well-controlled studi es in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospium chloride have shown an adverse  effect on the fetus, but 
potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despite the risk (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C). 
Therefore, women of childbearing potential in this study must b e willing to use a highly effective 
method of birth control (see APPENDIX 1  for a list of acceptable highly effective methods of 
contraception) during the study and for 7 days after the last d ose of study drug. Females of 
childbearing potential will have  a serum pregnancy test at scre ening and a urine pregnancy test

Page 47 of 96 on Day 1 (before receiving Kar XT), Day 35, and Day 42 (only for  females of childbearing 
potential who do not roll over to KAR-008).  
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on the developing 
human fetus are unknown with the pot ential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. 
Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with KarXT, women who are breastfeeding must not be enrolled in the study. 
The effects of study drug on sperm are unknown. Men who are wil ling to participate in the study 
must agree to use a highly eff ective method of birth control (s ee APPENDIX 1  for a list of 
acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) and must not impregnate a sexual partner 
during or for 7 days after the l ast dose of study drug. They mu st also agree to refrain from sperm 
donation for 7 days after the  last dose of study drug. 
Female subjects of child-beari ng potential will be instructed t hat known or suspected pregnancy 
occurring during the study should be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a female 
subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must withdraw her fr om the study without delay. The 
subject must not receive any fur ther doses of the study drug. U pon discontinuation from the 
study, only those procedures tha t would not expose the pregnant  female subject to undue risk 
will be performed. See Section 12.7.8  for further reporting and monitoring details. 
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawa l page (exit form) of the eCRF, or 
a pregnancy report will be completed if the subject has complet ed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted on the Pregnancy Reporting Form w ithin 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is no t to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using 
the same procedure as described for reporting SAE (Section 12.7.4). 
8.5 Completion of the Study or Lost to Follow-up 
The study will be completed when a ll subjects have completed th eir study-related procedures in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Every reasonable effort will be made to contact subjects who le ave the facility and are lost to 
follow-up to obtain end of study information. Details regarding  follow-up efforts are to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records/source documentatio n. 
8.6 Study Termination 
The availability of any new advers e safety information related to KarXT may result in stopping 
the study. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent Ethics Comm ittee (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take su ch actions. If the study is termi nated for safety reasons, subjects 
will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow-up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subjects, and IEC/IRB will be 
informed about the reason for  such action. Similarly, if the Sp onsor terminates the study, it will

9.1 Details of Study Treatments 
KarXT is formulated as hard hydroxypropyl methylcellulose oral capsules containing 2 distinct 
populations of drug beads, one of which is loaded with xanomeli ne tartrate and the other of 
which is loaded with trospium chloride. Each capsule contains t he freebase equivalent of 
xanomeline and trospium according to the desired dose strength.  In addition to the active 
ingredients, the drug beads cont ain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The beads are not coated 
and are formulated for immediate release of the active ingredie nts. 
 Identity of Study Treatments 
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish orange-white, opaque, and 
hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be pr epared in matching capsules; 
therefore, an unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense  study agent at each day of 
dosing. For the 2-day lead-in period (Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will 
receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 BID, followed by 2 capsule s of KarXT 50/10 mg BID or a 
dosage of 100/20 BID for a total daily dosage of 200/40 mg xano meline/trospium chloride for 
the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week  2, dosing may be increased to 
2 capsules of KarXT 62.5/15 mg or a dosage of 125/30 BID for a total daily dosage of 
250/60 mg xanomeline/trospium chloride, depending on clinical r esponse and tolerability. 
Investigators have the option to return a subject to KarXT 100/ 20 BID for the remainder of the 
treatment period, but dosing must not change after Visit 7 of t he study.  
KarXT 50/10 mg is composed of 44.4% xanomeline tartrate, 5.8% t rospium chloride, excipients 
37.59% MCC, 11.5% lactose monohydrat e, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0 .5% talc in a size 0, 
Swedish orange, hydroxypropyl m ethylcellulose hard capsule. 
KarXT 50/20 mg is composed of 33.4% xanomeline tartrate, 8.7% t rospium chloride, excipients 
39.8% MCC, 17.3% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0. 5% talc in a size 0, Swedish 
orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsule. 
KarXT 62.5/15 mg is composed of 41.7% xanomeline tartrate, 6.5%  trospium chloride, 
excipients 38.1% MCC, 12.9% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0.5% talc in a 
size 0, Swedish orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard caps ule. 
Placebo is composed of sugar spheres pf011, 850/1000 suglets, 9 9.05% colorcon, and 10.05% 
talc in a size 0, Swedish orange, an opaque white hydroxypropyl  methylcellulose hard capsule. 
All investigational agents are to be stored according to requirements. 
 Packaging and Labelling 
The study packaging and labelling will be performed by Corealis Pharma, located in Laval,

Further details on labelling of investigational products will b e provided in the Pharmacy Manual.  
 Study Drug Storage 
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature  15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel. 
 Study Drug Retention 
Study drug not used in KAR-009 may be used for the long-term ex tension study (KAR-008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or 
termination of the KarXT program , and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. The unused study drug can be reassigned in the IWRS to subjects in the KAR-008 
study. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified by 
Sponsor. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written 
authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropri ate records of the disposal are 
documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully 
accounted for by the study monitor. 
9.2 Dose Schedule 
The first dose of the study drug will be administered in the mo rning of Day 1. The last dose will 
be administered in the morning of Visit 10 (Day 35 -2 days). Th e study drug should be 
administered daily BID on an emp ty stomach ie, at least 1 hour before a meal or 2 to 3 hours 
after a meal. Some considerations  for dosing and PK blood withd rawals are provided in the 
subsections below. 
 Visit 2b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning, and the evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose.  
• All subjects must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation to KarXT 100/20 or placebo BID.

Page 51 of 96 
 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 100/20 or placebo level is conf irmed by investigator 
order on Visit 3/Day 3, that dose is to be administered in the morning. 
• When Day 3 occurs on a weekend, it is expected that the complete Visit 3 will be 
performed, and the subject’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day  visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated until the stud y visit occurs. In all cases, 
the subject must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20 or placebo before escalating to KarXT 100/20 or placebo. 
• This may result in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo d ose at Visit 5/Day 8, 
which is acceptable. 
• All subjects must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose escalation to KarXT 125/30 or placebo BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK Considerations and Visit 8/Day 28 P K 
Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is conf irmed by investigator 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for ser ial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2 , 
Footnote p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of dose escalation for Visit 5.  
• For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; therefore, there must be no changes in dose for at least 7 days prior to Visit 8. PK sampli ng must accompany the 
actual day of Visit 8 if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• All subjects will receive their final dose of KarXT or placebo on the morning of 
Visit 10/Day 35. It is intended that subjects rolling over to K AR-008 will begin 
open-label treatment the next day in the morning.

On Day -1, all eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a  1:1 ratio to either KarXT or 
placebo groups. Subjects will be assigned a randomization number through the IWRS, in 
accordance with the randomization code generated by the authori zed personnel at VERISTAT. 
At the study site, the randomization schedule will only be accessible to authorized unblinded 
pharmacy personnel or designee. Once a randomization number is allocated to one subject, it 
may not be assigned to another subject even if the former disco ntinued the study. 
 Blinding 
An IWRS will allocate treatment based on a prespecified randomi zation list generated by 
VERISTAT. Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or othe r 
designated unblinded individual) , subjects, informants/caregive rs, Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study.  
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study  treatment, that subject will be 
discontinued from the study unle ss there are ethical reasons fo r that subject not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be  obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT will generate and maintain the security of the randomi zation code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject’s safety or wellbeing, t he investigator may break the r andomization code for just that 
subject via the IWRS, by which system the unblinding will be ca ptured after consultation and 
agreement with the medical monitor/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion 
of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be relat ed to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investig ational treatment and/or treat t he subject. Subject withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. I f discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be

Page 53 of 96 made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever t he duration of discontinuation. 
When a subject has an AE that requires that the investigator be  unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study 
medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in  the subject’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: In most circumstances, it is  not necessary to unblind a 
subject, even if an SAE has occu rred. For many drugs there is n o specific therapy for AEs. The 
appropriate course of action is t o stop the investigational dru g and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE. 
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the sa fety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subjects will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2 ). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous pre clinical and 
clinical studies (see Section 5.2). Per the protocol, subjects  will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and 7 and at unscheduled visits. No  dose adjustments are allowed after 
Visit 7. No other dose modifications are permissible in this st udy except those specified in this 
protocol. 
9.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance 
The pharmacist or other designated unblinded individual will ma intain records of study treatment 
delivered to the study site, the inventory at the study site, t he distribution to each subject, and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or d isposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subjects. 
Administration of study drug w ill be supervised by study site personnel to ensure compliance. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document th at the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigationa l product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodically by the assigned unblinded study m onitor. 
9.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subjects will be asked for all pr ior medications they were taki ng up to 6 months before the study, 
up to the time of the first dos e of study medication on Day 1. All prior medications will be 
recorded on the eCRF. Restricted prior therapies are provided in Section 8.2.

treatments initiated before the start of the study, must be rec orded on the eCRF. 
During the study (ie, from the time of screening visit until st udy completion), subjects will 
refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without  the specific prior approval of 
the investigator. The administration of any other concomitant m edications during the study 
period is prohibited without the  prior approval of the investig ator unless its use is deemed 
necessary in a medical emergency. Any medication or therapy tha t is taken by or administered to 
the subject during the course of the study must be recorded in the eCRF. The entry must include 
the dose, regimen, route, indication, dates of use, and time of use (only for concomitant 
medications used on an as-needed [PRN] basis). 
After written informed consent is  obtained from the subject, th ose subjects who are taking the 
following medications must have the minimum washout periods spe cified below and not take the 
medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half-lives or 1 week, whichever is longer, before base line (Day -1), subjects 
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibi tors, mood stabilizers 
(ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tri cyclic antidepressants (eg, 
imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibito rs, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken  on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could no t have received a dose of 
medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRINZA®).  
Note: Please direct questions relating to prohibited medication s to the Medical Monitor. 
 Concomitant Medications for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subjects are allowed to take benzodiazepines (up to 6 mg loraze pam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation, and insomnia on a PRN basis. Subjects may also use non-benzodiazepine 
medications (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon) as a sleep aid also on a P RN basis. Study sites must record 
the use of such medications in th e eCRF on a per-administration  basis and subject’s source 
document. Note: Cognition test ing should not be done within 8 hours of receiving a 
benzodiazepine or sleep medication.

a. Up to a 7-day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if n eeded. 
b. Other assessments as needed. 
c. A serum pregnancy test for females of childbearing potential sh ould be done at screening, and urine pregnancy tests should be done at other visits. 
d. A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabi noids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and c ocaine) will be 
performed at screening and at Visit 2a (baseline). If a subject  leaves the study site, they should have a urine drug screen and test for alcohol (breathalyzer 
or blood alcohol level) upon returning to the study site.  
e. A complete physical examination includes body temperature (°C),  general appearance, head/eyes/ ears/nose/throat, examination of  thorax and 
abdomen, assessment of cardiac, m usculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited neurolog ical 
examination. 
f. AEs as reported by subjects or observed by clinical staff and occurs from Day -1. One PK blood s ample may be drawn if a releva nt/significant AE 
(based on medical judgement) is reported during a scheduled vis it or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant A E reported during an 
unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). 
g. Vital signs taken supine and standing after 2 minutes. BP includes systolic and diastolic BP and is to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. Heart rate is measured in beats/minute. During treatment , beginning with Day 1, orthostatic vital signs should occur 2 (±1) hours after morning 
dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the mor ning dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostat ic vital sign monitoring is

j. Optional COVID-19 test may be per formed at unscheduled visits b ased on the Investigator’s discretion. 
k. Blood sample for prolactin must be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug at scheduled visits (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests compl eted at Screening: anti-HCV antib ody, HBV surface antigen, HBV core antibody, 
HIV-1 antibody, and HIV-2 antibody. If the subject tests positi ve for anti-HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain rea ction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection. 
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subjects will be asked whether they have  experienced constipation (per t he ROME III criteria and 
Bristol Stool Form scale; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes , whether the constipation required intervention. If th e subject answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subj ects to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is docume nted as concomitant 
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not al ready an inpatient, the subject  should be admitted to the inpatient unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID (first dose of study will be administere d in the morning of Day 1, and  evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose and after la st PK sampling [for Visits 5 and 8 ] is completed), on an empty stomach ie, at least 1 hour 
before a meal or 2 to 3 hours a fter a meal by the study staff, with the last dose administered on the morning of Visit 10. All  subjects must receive at 
least 4 dosages of the 50/20 BID before dose escalation to KarX T 100/20 BID. 
p. For Visit 5/Day 8 and Visit 8/Da y 28, 7 PK blood draws are requ ired: before the morning dose, and at 0.5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 5 minutes, 
2 hours ± 10 minutes, 4 hours ± 10 minutes, 8 hours ± 10 minute s, and 12 hours ± 10 minutes after the morning dose (Note: The 12-hour samples must 
be collected before administration of the evening dose). PK blo od draws at Visit 5 must be drawn in relation to the first dose  of KarXT 125/30 for 
subjects who are escalated in th e morning of Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days. PK blood must also be drawn in relation to the morning do se for subjects who are 
not escalated at Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days. For Visit 10/ET, a sin gle PK blood sample should be withdrawn before discharge (prefe rably in the morning 
after the last dose of the study drug). One PK blood sample may  also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported during  a scheduled visit or if 
there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reporte d during an unscheduled visit (n o multiple draws). For an ET Vi sit that is related to an 
AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and sho uld be drawn before discharge. 
q. It should be performed before PANSS assessment. 
r. It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all the other scale assessments (except MINI) for 
all visits at which it is perform ed. The PANSS assessment inclu des the Marder Factor. 
s. C-SSRS first time use lifetime, other times use “Since Last Visit” version. At the Unscheduled visit, the C-SSRS should be per formed to monitor subjects 
for suicidality. 
t. During screening, subjects will complete each of the CANTAB tes ts for familiarization purposes. These same tests will then be administered on Visits 
2a, 7, and 9. Note: Cognition testing cannot be done within 8 h ours of receiving benzodiazep ine or sleep medications.

Page 62 of 96 11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
The Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician-admini stered scale used for measuring symptom severity of subjects 
with schizophrenia and is widel y used in the study of antipsych otic therapy[ 23]. The PANSS 
rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7 negative syst em scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. S ubjects are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion  of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approx imately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is  the sum of all scales with a m inimum score of 30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Marder Factor. 
It is recommended, if at all possi ble, that the PANSS assessmen t should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments (exce pt MINI at screening) for all visits at which it is performed.  
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI-S is a rating scale com pleted independently by a clinician that is used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subjects with mental disorders. It is u sed to rate the severity of a 
subject’s illness at the time of  assessment. The modified CGI-S  asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical  experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7-point scale: 1 =  normal, not at all ill; 2 = borderline 
mentally ill; 3 = mildly ill; 4 = moderately ill; 5 = markedly ill; 6 = severely ill; 7 = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 24]. 
This rating is based upon observe d and reported symptoms, behav ior, and function in the past 
7 days. As symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week, the  score should reflect the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

Safety assessments (spontaneous A Es; AESIs; procholinergic and anticholinergic symptoms; 
cognition testing [CANTAB]; SAS; BARS; AIMS; body weight; BMI; waist circumference; 
orthostatic vital signs; ECG; c linical laboratory assessments [hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, prolactin, and drug screen]; physical examination; and C-SSRS) are to be 
performed at protocol-specifie d visits, as specified in the Sch edule of Assessments ( Table 2 ).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical and Psychiatric History 
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screenin g. The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alterna tively year of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity, which will be  obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Medical and psychiatric history w ill be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms  of the subject’s preexisting co nditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surg ical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include his tory of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within 1 year 
before Screening. 
Illnesses first occurring or de tected during the study and/or w orsening of a concomitant illness 
during the study are to be docum ented as AEs on the eCRF in acc ordance with Section 12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medica l history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs 
Orthostatic vital signs (systol ic and diastolic  BP and heart ra te measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the  Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supine and standing after 2 minutes . BP measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During tre atment, beginning with Day 1, orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the 
morning dose of the specified vi sit days, but additional orthos tatic vital sign monitoring is 
allowed at the investigator’s discretion. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically signific ant or machine/equipment errors 
occur. Out-of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repea ted at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinica lly significant vital sign me asurements must be recorded as 
AEs.

musculoskeletal, and circulator y systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination) will be performed at visits as specif ied in Table 2 . Physical 
examinations will be performed by a physician. 
12.4 Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference 
Height (screening only), weight, a nd waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table 2 . BMI should be calculated at these visits. All findings should  be recorded 
in the eCRF. 12.5 Electrocardiograms 
A 12-lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2 ). During the ECG, ventricular ra te (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained. ECG at Day 1 will be performed 2 hours (+ 15 minutes) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled v isits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety lab oratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be i nterpreted by experienced indepe ndent blinded reader(s) at the 
central reading facility. 
At screening, the investigator w ill examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed o r artifacts are present. 
12.6 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessment samples ( Table 3 ) are to be obtained at designate d visits as detailed in the

dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated, the  sample will be sent the central 
laboratory, and a microscopic analysis will be performed. All l aboratory reports must be 
reviewed, signed, and dated by th e investigator. A legible copy  of all reports must be filed with 
both the subject’s eCRF and medical record (source document) fo r that visit. Any laboratory test 
result considered by the investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE 
(clinically significant AEs incl ude those that require an inter vention). Clinically significant 
abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed up with until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically signif icant.  
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug-induc ed liver toxicity, detailed in 
Section 12.7.5 , during the study. 
Other Laboratory Assessments: 
• A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be perf ormed using a dipstick at 
screening, Visit 2a (baseline) , and at unscheduled visits.  
• Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or blood alco hol test.  
• If a subject leaves the study s ite, they should have a urine dr ug screen test and test for 
alcohol (breathalyzer or blood al cohol test) upon returning to the study site. 
 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics 
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for explor atory pharmacogenetic analysis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA  extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central lab oratory facility, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The 
collection, storage, shipping, p rocessing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be 
used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.

present at screening will be docum ented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the st udy. Clinically significant vital  signs and laboratory abnormalities 
should also be recorded as AEs. S urgical procedures that were p lanned before the subject 
enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study 
inclusion; the medical conditi on should be reported in the subj ect’s medical history. 
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit AEs and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period,  and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. A Es will be elicited by asking th e subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the r esults of the final laboratory tests 
are available. 
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study d rug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is t o be classifie d as being seri ous or nonserious. Changes in 
AEs and resolution dates are  to be documented on the eCRF. 
For the purposes of this st udy, the period of observation for c ollection of TEAEs extends from 
the time immediately after t he administration of study drug on Day 1 until the End of Study 
(Visit 10 for subjects who roll  over and Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR-
008 study) or early termination. F ollow up of the AE, even afte r the date of therapy 
discontinuation, is required if th e AE persists until the event  resolves or stabilizes at a level 
acceptable to the investigator. When changes in the intensity of  an AE occur more frequently th an once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event shoul d be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be rec orded separately (with distinct  onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be grade d according to the National Ca ncer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), version 5. 0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classify ing AEs by intensity and relati onship to study drug are given in 
Table 4  and Table 5 . 
Table 4. Classification of Adverse Events by Intensity 
MILD : An event that is easily toler ated by the subject, causing min imal discomfort and not interfering with

 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The AESIs will be monitored and include orthostasis and liver f unction test elevations inclusive 
of DILI. 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate. 
 Serious Adverse Events 
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life-threatening, 
• results in inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existin g hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective t reatment of a pre-existing, nonworsening condition is not,

medical history or physical examination page of the eCRF), 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, and /or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization, based upon appr opriate medical judgment, are c onsidered SAEs if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject and/or require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. SAEs are critically important for  the identificati on of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into accoun t both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either t he Sponsor or the investigator  believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered, during the study, or 
within 1 week of stopping the tr eatment must be reported to the  Catalyst Clinical Research 
Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor . Any such SAE due to any 
cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be report ed within 24 hours of occurrence 
or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made using email. 
Catalyst Clinical Research Pharmacovigilance email address is:  
The events must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminar y reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of 
hospital case reports, consultant  reports, autopsy reports, and  other documents when requested 
and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the inv estigator considers the event to 
be related to the investigational drug. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE,  and the response should be 
recorded. The investigator must report all additional follow-up evaluations to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research Pharmacovigila nce group within 24 hours of be coming aware of the additional 
information or as soon as is practicable. All SAEs will be foll owed up until the investigator and 
Sponsor agree the event is s atisfactorily resolved. 
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon di scontinuation of the subject’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either  resolves, stabilizes, returns to 
baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown  to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures.

followed by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours of all 4 of the usual serum measures 
(ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if 
they are increasing or decreasing. An inqui ry should be made about the symptoms 
(fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadr ant pain or tenderness, fever, and rash). 
• Close observation should be initiated with ALT or AST >3 × ULN: 
o Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. Frequency of 
retesting can decrease to once per week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued, and the subject is asymptomatic. 
o Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
o Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement prepara tions), alcohol use, recreational drug 
use, and special diets. 
o Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease. 
o Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
o Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver f unction, as appropriate (eg, international 
normalized ratio, direct bilirubin). 
o Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
• Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
o ALT or AST >8 × ULN 
o ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
o ALT or AST >3 × ULN and (total bilirubi n >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio >1.5) 
o ALT or AST >3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>5%) 
• Hepatic adjudication of cases should include an evaluation for alternative causes such as 
viral, autoimmune, alcohol, hepatobiliary disorders, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concomitant medications, etc. 
• Follow up to resolution of elevated liver enzymes. 
• Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase elevations alone should not prompt drug 
discontinuation. 
 Trial Discontinuation Criteria Other than DILI and Pregnancy 
12.7.6.1 Individual Stopping Criteria 
Based on NCI CTCAE v5.0, the stu dy drug will be discontinued in  any subject who has a 
≥ Grade 4 AE. Discontinuation or  reduction in the dosage of the  study drug for Grade 3 AEs, 
other than DILI AEs, (see Section 12.7.5) will be at the discretion of the investigator. 
12.7.6.2 Trial Stopping Rules 
The safety and tolerability aspects of KarXT will be overseen b y an ISMC. The ISMC will meet 
periodically and review the unblinded data and will be responsi ble for advising the Sponsor on

 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and reported to the appropriate regu latory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting : 
• serious 
• unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safety inf ormation in the IB or 
package insert of generic trospium) 
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a caus al relationship between the event 
and the study treatment 
The investigator will assess whet her or not an event is causally related to study treatment. The 
Sponsor (or their designee Syne os Health) will consider the investigator’s assessment and 
determine whether the event meets the criteria for being report able as a 7-day or 15-day safety 
report. SUSARs that are fatal or life-threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities 
and the IEC/IRBs (where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor (or their designee) has first 
knowledge of them, with a follow-up report submitted within a f urther 8 calendar days. Other 
SUSARs must be reported to the r elevant regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor  (or their designee) first ha s knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor (or their designee)  is responsible for reporting SU SARs and any other events 
required to be reported in an e xpedited manner to the regulator y authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicab le regulatory requirements within 
specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within the applicable timeframes. 
Warnings and Precautions 
Risk of Urinary Retention: 
Trospium chloride tablets should be administered with caution t o subjects with clinically 
significant bladder outflow obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. 
Angioedema: 
Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been re ported with trospium chloride, the 
active ingredient in trospium chloride tablets. In one case, angioedema occurred after the first 
dose of trospium chloride. Angioedema associated with upper air way swelling may be life 
threatening. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or lary nx occurs, trospium chloride 
should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided.

Page 72 of 96 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: 
Trospium should be administered with caution to subjects with GI obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastric retention. Trospium chloride, like other  antimuscarinic agents, may decrease 
GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with co nditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis. 
Controlled Narrow-angle Glaucoma:  
In subjects being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, trospium c hloride should only be used if 
the potential benefits outweigh th e risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring. 
Central Nervous System Effects:  
Trospium chloride is associated with anticholinergic CNS effect s. A variety of CNS 
anticholinergic effects have been  reported, including dizziness , confusion, hallucinations, and 
somnolence. Subjects should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly 
after beginning treatment or i ncreasing the dose. Advise subjects not to drive or operate heavy 
machinery until they know how trospium chloride affects them. I f a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinua tion should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Ren al Impairment:  
Trospium is substantially excrete d by the kidney. The effects o f moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely  increased. Therefore, 
anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract 
infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment. 
Elevation of liver enzymes: 
Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in previous studies o f xanomeline alone in patients 
with Alzheimer’s disease. It is notable, however, that hepatic enzyme elevations were not 
observed in the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, and that  the liver function test elevations 
observed in the Phase 2 schizophrenia study (KAR-004) with KarX T (a combination of 
xanomeline and trospium) were quite limited in contrast to the effects observed with xanomeline 
in the elderly Alzheimer’s popula tion. Moreover, even in patients with Alzheimer disease who 
experienced more hepatic enzyme elevations, the data demonstrat e reversibility even with 
continued xanomeline treatment in those patients for whom there  was sufficient follow-up data. 
Importantly, there were no Hy’s law cases or elevations in tota l bilirubin to a value of >2 × upper 
limit of reference range in either the xanomeline or KarXT data sets. 
 Pregnancy 
WOCBP must have a negative pregna ncy test at screening. After a dministration of study drug,

event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow up 
with the subject until completi on of the pregnancy and must ass ess the outcome in the shortest 
possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the  pregnancy. The investigator 
should notify the Sponsor (or de signee) of the pregnancy outcom e by submitting a follow-up 
pregnancy report. If the outcome  of the pregnancy involved spon taneous or therapeutic abortion 
(any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be d ocumented), stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the event by faxing/emailing a 
completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) wi thin 24 hours of knowledge of 
the event. This event is considered an SAE. 
Upon discontinuation from the st udy, only those procedures that would not expose the subject to 
undue risk will be performed. The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring 
during the study but confirmed af ter completion of the study. In the event that a subject is 
subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study,  any pregnancy will be followed to 
term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to th e Sponsor after delivery. 
 Overdose 
The investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study drug. Overdose should be managed with symptomatic and supportiv e care. 
12.8 Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery 
The computerized CANTAB provides an objective measure of cognitive function correlated to 
neural networks. A short cognitive battery measuring core cogni tive domains of impairment in 
schizophrenia (ie, as per Brief Assessment of Cognition Schizophrenia key cognitive domains) will be employed for this study, and it will take approximately  30 minutes to complete. These 
CANTAB tests meet MATRICS workshop criteria [ 25]. Subjects will have 1 familiarization 
session with the CANTAB tests dur ing the screening visit and wi ll subsequently complete the 
same test battery on Visits 2a (baseline), Visit 7, and Visit 9. Subjects perform the test on a provisioned iPad with data immediately uploaded to the CANTAB Connect cloud-based 
platform (WiFi permitting). 
Cognition testing cannot be done within 8 hours of receiving be nzodiazepine or sleep 
medications.

12.9 Simpson-Angus Scale 
The SAS is an established instrument to measure drug-related ex trapyramidal syndromes. It is a 
10-item testing instrument us ed to assess gait, arm dropping, s houlder shaking, elbow rigidity, 
wrist rigidity, leg pendulousness, head dropping, glabella tap,  tremor, and salivation. The range 
of scores is from 0 to 40 with increased scores indicating incr eased severity. 
12.10 Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The BARS is a rating scale used to assess the severity of drug- induced akathisia, or restlessness, 
involuntary movements and inabi lity to sit still. The range of scores is 0 to 14, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity[ 26]. 
12.11 Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale 
The AIMS is a rating scale that is used to measure involuntary movements know as tardive 
dyskinesia, which can sometimes  develop as a side effect of lon g-term treatment with 
antipsychotic medications. It is a 12-item scale to assess orof acial, extremity, and truncal 
movements as well as the overa ll severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s level of awareness of 
the movements. Items are score d from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more 
severe dyskinesia. 
12.12 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and trac k suicidal AEs (sui cidal behavior 
and suicidal ideati on) throughout the study[ 27]. The strength of this su icide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensive ly identify suicidal events w hile limiting the ove r identification 
of suicidal behavior. The scale takes approximately 5 minutes t o administer. The C-SSRS will be

12.13 Functional Constipation Inquiry 
Constipation refers to bowel move ments that are infrequent or h ard to pass[ 28]. The stool is 
often hard and dry[ 29]. Other symptoms may include  abdominal pain, bloating, and fee ling as if 
one has not completely passed the bowel movement[ 30]. The normal frequency of bowel 
movements in adults is between 3 per day and 3 per week[ 28]. Constipation will be defined per 
the Rome III criteria, as less than 3 bowel movements per week,  APPENDIX 2  
(Longswreth,1486,C3)[ 31]. 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale has been correlated with a change in intestinal function, and had 
been shown to be a useful tool in c linical practice and researc h[32]. A sample Bristol Stool Form 
Scale is located in APPENDIX 2 . 
As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit (except at Visit 2a), subjects will be asked 
whether they have experienced constipation per the ROME III cri teria since the last visit, and if 
yes, whether the constipation re quired intervention. If the sub ject answers yes, sites are 
instructed to ask subjects to provide event date and ensure eve nt is documented as an AE and 
treatment is documented as concomitant medication. Subjects wil l not be required to collect and 
present their stool sample nor w ill clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject assessment. 
Additional attention can be give n to other complaints as well i ncluding: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard  stools and pain with bowel 
movements secondary to strain ing, abdominal pain, abdominal blo ating, and the sensation of 
incomplete bowel evacuation[ 30,33]. 
Treatment of constipation depe nds on the underlying cause and the duration that it has been 
present. For the purposes of cons tipation complaints during a c linical trial, the use of laxatives of 
a bulk forming agent, osmotic agent , stool softener, or lubrica nt type may be used. 
As definitions of constipation are typically based on a history  of at least a week, site physician 
discretion will be allowed for initiation of such treatments.

13.1 Pharmacokinetic Sampling 
 Blood Samples 
Blood samples for PK analysis of  KarXT levels will be collected  at the time points indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2 ). Approximately 6 mL of blood to be collected at each 
scheduled time point. The actual date and time of each blood sa mple collection will be recorded. 
• Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanome line and trospium will be 
obtained on Visit 5/Day 8 ± 2 days  (first dose of fixed titrati on period) and Visit 8/Day 28 
± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time points on these days:  
PK Sample Timing of Collection Collection Window 
1 Before morning dose  
 After morning dose  
2    0.5 hours ± 0.5 min 
3    1 hour ± 0.5 min 
4    2 hours ± 10 min 
5    4 hours ± 10 min 
6    8 hours ± 10 min 
7     12 hours after (but before the 
evening dose) ± 10 min 
• It is very important that the exact time of each PK draw and dosing times are recorded in 
the eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the specified  times of collection. 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK samplin g must accompany the 
actual day of potential dose escalation for Visit 5. 
•  For Visit 8, serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If vi sit windows are used for 
Visit 8, the PK sampling should occur at least 7 days after Vis it 7 is completed, and there 
must be no changes in dose for at least 7 days leading up to Vi sit 8. PK sampling must 
accompany the actual day of Visit 8.  
• Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before discharge (pref erably in the morning 
after the last dose of the st udy drug) at Visit 10/Day 35 -2 da ys or ET. In addition, one PK 
sample may be drawn if a relev ant/significant AE is reported during a scheduled visit or if 
there is a dose adjustment or relevant/significant AE reported during an unscheduled visit 
(no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to an AE, the collection of a PK blood 
sample is not optional and should be drawn before discharge.

Page 79 of 96 14 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This doc ument will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analy sis variables and analysis methodology to address all study 
objectives. The SAP will serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences. 
The statistical evaluati on will be performed using SAS® software vers ion 9.4 or higher 
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary  tables will be provided. 
Summary statistics will be presented by dose group. For continu ous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of s ubjects (N), mean and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by treatment group. For categorical variables, data  will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subjects for each category by treatmen t group. 
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of  change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 
8 points between drug and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 9 0.3% for a 2-sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects  are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent-to-Treat Population 
All subjects who are randomize d to the study will be included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population 
All subjects who are randomize d, received at least 1 dose of study drug, have a baseline PANSS 
assessment, and at least 1 post-baseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT 
population and will be used in the efficacy analysis. 
Safety Population 
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug will be  included in the safety population 
and will be used in the safety analysis. 
PK Population 
All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be included in the PK population and will be 
used in the PK analysis. Subject s must have received at least 1  dose of active study drug and 
have at least 1 measurable pl asma concentration of study drug.

Page 80 of 96 14.3 General Statistical Considerations 
All efficacy analyses will be performed using the mITT populati on. The statistical analysis of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for m ultiplicity by using a fixed 
sequence testing procedure. The  primary endpoint of change from  baseline to Week 5 in PANSS 
total score will be evaluated first. The endpoints are set up as a hierarchical list and step down 
through the statistical testi ng of each endpoint using an alpha  of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS n egative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score, CGI-S, and percentage of PANSS re sponders will be performed 
only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha l evel (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would 
continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy e ndpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, 
then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control t he overall Type 1 error rate across all 
hypotheses/endpoints being tested. Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

6. Percentage of PANSS responders ( a 30% change in PANSS total sco re) at Week 5  
 
14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Primary Estimand 
The population of the primary estimand is among adult inpatient s (aged 18-65 years) with a 
DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia , confirmed by MINI for schizop hrenia, who are acutely 
psychotic and hospitalized with PANSS score of 80-120 at time o f enrollment, defined according 
to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary analysis will be executed on the mITT 
population, including all subjects  with a baseline and at least  1 post-baseline PANSS 
measurement, grouped as randomized.  
The variable is the change from baseline in PANSS total score a t Week 5.

discontinuation from the study wi ll be included in the analysis  
• Use of concomitant medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid: Treatment policy strategy 
where results will be used regardless of concomitant medication s for anxiety and/or sleep 
aid 
The population level summary is the difference between treatmen t groups (KarXT vs placebo) in 
mean change from baseline in PANSS at Week 5, obtained from a m ixed modelrepeated 
measures (MMRM). 
Robustness of the estimand will be assessed through sensitivity  analyses using alternative 
methods for handling of missing data (eg, multiple imputation); accounting for changes in dosing 
(eg, including actual dose as a time varying covariate in the M MRM), and accounting for use of 
concomitant medications for anxi ety and/or sleep aid (eg, subgr oup by use of concomitant 
medication or including use of such concomitant medications as time-varying covariate in the 
MMRM). 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from b aseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5 will be estimated using an 
MMRM. The model will include the change from baseline PANSS tot al scores at Week 2, Week 
3, Week 4, and Week 5 as the response. Within-subject correlati on will be accounted for using 
an unstructured covariance matrix. Fixed effects will include t he treatment group (KarXT or 
placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment grou p and visit, site, age, sex, and 
baseline PANSS total score. Low-enrolling sites may be pooled, if necessary, for modeling 
purposes. The algorithm for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint may be pe rformed on an observed case 
basis, using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying tr eatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. Alternative time-varying parameterizations of dose level and use of concomitant 
medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid may also be included in  sensitivity analyses. In addition, 
alternative covariance matrices f or the MMRM may be investigate d. The sensitivity analyses of 
the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP. 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Wee k 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMR M).  
The categorical secondary endpoint ( percentage of PANSS responders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT and placebo) using  the Cochran-Mantel-
Haenszel test.

14.5 Safety Analysis 
All reported AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 
22.1 or higher. The incidence of TEAEs (events with onset dates on or after the start of the study 
drug) will be summarized for each treatment group separately by  System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term. All AEs will  be listed by subjec t, along with i nformation regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and sev erity to study drug, action taken  with study drug, treatment of 
event, and outcome. 
Orthostatic vital signs, clinical  laboratory data, prolactin le vels, ECG parameters, and physical 
examinations will be summarize d using descriptive statistics, including observed and change 
from baseline values, as well as numbers of subjects with value s outside limits of the normal 
range at each time point by treatment group. Similar descriptiv e summaries will be provided for 
SAS, BARS, change in cognition (CANTAB), AIMS, body weight, BMI , and waist 
circumference. 
14.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
• PK results will be listed for all subjects who received active treatment. The profiles or time 
points obtained with protocol devi ations affecting PK results w ill be flagged and may be 
excluded from summaries and analyses. 
• The data will be presented graphically via individual plots and  mean plots summarized by 
actual treatment, visit, and time point.  
• PK parameters for xanomeline and trospium will be derived from plasma concentration 
data using noncompartmental methods. Actual time elapsed from dosing will be used to estimate all individual PK parame ters. The primary PK parameter s of interest will include 
C
max, Tmax, and AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from 0 to the last measurable concentration). 
Additional parameters (not limited to the following) such as th e elimination half-life, 
clearance, and volume of distribution will be determined if the  data permit. 
• The effect of dose on PK and other inferential analyses for exp osure-response relationship 
may be performed. The details of the PK analysis will be descri bed in the SAP. The 
noncompartmental analysis will be  described as a part of final clinical study report.

Several different methods to handl e the missing data in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
may be used. 
• For the primary efficacy analysis, likelihood-based modeling ap proach will be used to 
handle incomplete data. For this purpose, an MMRM will be applied. 
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the last 
observation carried for ward approach. In this analysis, the missing values will be 
replaced by the previous visit P ANSS total score carried forwar d.  
• Sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted using the 
Multiple Imputation approach (ie, by replacing each missing val ue with a set of plausible 
values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute).

Page 94 of 96 APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES 
Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and men whose sexual pa rtners are WOCBP must 
use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception during the study and for 7 days after the 
last dose of study treatment.  
A woman is considered to be a WOCBP (fertile) following menarch e and until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and bila teral oophorecto my. A postmenopausal state is 
defined as no menses for 12 mont hs without an alternative medic al cause. A high 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a 
postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement 
therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is 
insufficient.  
A man is considered fertile aft er puberty unless permanently st erile by bilateral  orchidectomy. 
Highly effective methods of contr aception are those which have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently and correctly) and include: 
• combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contrac eption associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (administ ration may be oral, intravagin al, or transdermal) 
• progestogen-only hormonal contrace ption associated with inhibit ion of ovulation 
(administration may be oral, injectable, or implantable) 
• intrauterine device 
• intrauterine horm one-releasing system 
• bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion 
• vasectomy (provided that the mal e has a medical assessment of surgical success) 
• sexual abstinence (defined as re fraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire 
period of risk in relation to the  duration of the clinical tria l, in line with the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the subject) 
All subjects will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male subjects) should 
not become pregnant while on study treatment or for 7 days afte r the last dose. A  female subject 
will be advised that she must report immediately to the study site for pregnancy testing and 
appropriate management in the e vent that she may be pregnant.

Title of Study:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -blind, Parallel -group, Placebo -controlled, 
Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of KarXT in Acutely 
Psychotic Hospitalized Adults with DSM -5 Schizophrenia  
Protocol Number:  KAR -009 
Study Sites:  Approximately 10 sites in the United States  and 10 sites in Ukraine  
Phase of Development:  Phase  3 
Objectives:  Primary Objective  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of KarXT (a 
fixed combination of xanomeline and trospium chloride [ xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg] twice daily [BID]) versus placebo in reducing 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores in adult 
inpatients with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) 
diagnosis of schizophrenia.  
Secondary Objectives : 
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the reduction of PANSS positive score in subject s 
treated with KarXT versus placebo  
• To evaluate the improvement in Clinical Global Impression -Severity 
(CGI -S) results in subject s treated with KarXT versus placebo  
• To evaluate the reduction of PANSS negative score in  subject s 
treated with KarXT versus placebo  
• To evaluate the reduction of PANSS Marder Factor negative 
symptoms score in subject s treated with KarXT versus placebo  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT  
• To assess the pharmacokin etics (PK) of xanomeline and trospium 
after administration of KarXT in adults who are acutely psychotic 
with a DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia  
Exploratory Objective s: 
The exploratory objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the change in cognition measuring core domains of 
impairment in schizophrenia using Cambridge Neuropsychological 
Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)

Study Design:  This is a Phase 3  randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, 
placebo -controlled, multicenter inpatient study in adults who are 
acutely psychotic with a DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia. Subject s 
will be randomized  (1:1 ratio)  to receive either KarXT or placebo for a 
treatment period of 5 weeks. Subjects will start on a lead-in dos e of 
KarXT 50/20 (xanomeline 50  mg/trospium 20 mg) BID  for the first 
2 days (Days  1 and 2) followed by KarXT 100/20 (xanomeline 
100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of Week  1 (Days 3 to 
7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to Ka rXT 125/30 BID 
unless the subject  is continuing to experience AEs from the previous 
dose increase of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subject s who were increased 
to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and tolerability, 
will have the option to return to K arXT 100/20 BID for the remainder 
of the treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) 
of the study and may be decreased for tolerability reasons no more than 
once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT 125/30

Page  7 of 94 BID may not  occur outside of the p ermitted visit window for 
Visit 5/Day  8. 
A safety follow -up visit (Visit 11/ Day 42 + 5 days) will be performed 
for all those subjects who d o not ro llover in to the long -term open -label 
study KAR -008. 
The study is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT 
in adult schizophreni a subjects with acute psychosis will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in the primary and 
secondary endpoints at Week 5 from  baseline compared with placebo. 
The endpoin ts are set up as a hierarchical list and step down through 
the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical 
testing of change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, and PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, 
CGI-S score at Week 5, and percentage of PANSS responders will be 
performed only if the primary endpoint is sign ificant at the 0.05 alpha 
level (P  ≤ 0.05), and t esting would continue through a preordered list of 
key secondary efficacy endpoints. If at any point P > 0.05, then formal 
statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.

Efficacy  Assessments : PANSS total score, PANSS positive score , PANSS negative score, PANSS 
Negative Marder Factor score,  and CGI -S score will be evaluated at 
scheduled visits . 
Safety  Assessments : Spontaneous AEs  including AESIs , procholinergic and anticholinergic 
symptoms,  SAS, BARS , AIMS, body weight, body mass index , waist 
circumference, orthostatic vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory assessments 
(hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen), 
prolactin levels, physical examination, and C -SSRS will be evaluated 
throughout the study as scheduled.  
Pharmacokinet ic Assessments : AUC , Cmax, and T max will be estimated at scheduled visits.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Intent -to-treat (ITT)  population : All subjects who are randomized to the study 
will be included in the ITT population.  
Modified ITT (mITT) population : All subjects who are randomized, received 
at least 1 dose of study drug,  have a baseline PANSS assessment , and at least 
1 postbaseline PANSS  assessment will be included in the mITT population 
and will be used in the efficacy analysis.  
Safety p opulation : All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
will be included in the safety population and will be used in the safety analysis.  
PK population : All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be 
included in the PK population and wil l be used in the PK analysis. Subjects 
must have  received at least 1 dose of active study drug and have at least 
1 measurable plasma  concentration  of study drug .  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in 
PANSS total score a t Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed model for repeated measures.  The key 
secondary endpoints are the change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS 
positive score, PANSS negative score, and PANSS Negative Marder Fact or 
score , CGI-S score  at Week 5 , and percentage of PANSS responders at 
Week  5. The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy 
variables will account for multiplicity by using a fixed sequence testing 
procedure. This testing procedure will control the overall Type 1 error rate 
across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested.  
Assuming the treatment difference in the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5 is 8 points between KarXT and placebo (standard deviation 16), a sample size of approximately 172 subjects  (86 evaluable 
subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05

Page  19 of 94 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Schizophrenia  
Schizophrenia is a long- term mental disorder involving a breakdown in the relation between 
thought, emotion, and behavior and leads to faulty perception, inappropriate actions and feelings, 
withdrawal from reality and personal relationships into fantasy and delusion, and a sense of 
mental fr agmentation. Symptoms include delusions, hallucination, disorganized speech or 
behavior, and impaired cognitive ability[ 1]. The prevalence of schizophrenia is between 0.6% 
and 1.9% in the United States (US) population[ 2]. Moreover, a claims analysis has estimated that 
the annual prevalence of diagnosed schizophrenia in the US  is 5.1 per 1000 lives[ 3]. It is found 
equally in males and females, with males usually having an earlier onset of symptoms[ 4].  
The mainstay for treating schizophrenia is antipsychotic dru gs (APDs) [5]. All currently available 
antipsychotics act through blockage of all or subsets of dopamine receptors in the brain. 
First-generation APDs include chlorpromazine and haloperidol; treatment with these agents is 
marked by high rates of parkinsonian extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia , 
and they consequently have limited use today. The second-generation agents that include risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, lurasi done, aripiprazole , and lumateperone tend to have 
lower levels of EPS or tardive dyskinesia and are currently the most commonly prescribed APD 
class. However, the second -generation drugs also have proble matic side effects that include 
significant weight gain, metabolic disturbances, sedation, and akathisia[ 6,7,8]. These side effects 
contribute to poor medication adherence resulting in frequent relapses and hospitalizations[ 9,10]. 
Thus there is a need for medications for schizophrenia which act through alternative mechanisms.  
Central muscarinic receptors have been hypothesized to be therapeutic treatments fo r 
schizophrenia based on several converging lines of evidence including both animal and human studies[ 11,12 ]. There are 5 subtypes of muscarinic receptors (M1- M5). The therapeutic effect of 
central muscarinic receptor agonism is thought to be due to agonism of M1 and M4 receptors in 
the central nervous system (CNS)[ 13]. However, compounds that agonize M1 and M4 receptors 
are often not specific enough not to also agonize M2 and M3 receptors outside of the CNS due to the highly conserved allosteric binding sites that the receptors share, leading to adverse events (AEs) related to activation of these peripheral receptors. Thus, any potential benefit of muscarinic agonists in schizophrenia (or other indications such as Alzheimer’s disease [AD] ) has 
been outweighed by the occurrence of AEs associated with peripheral cholinergic side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation).  
5.2 Background on KarXT  (Xanomeline Tartrate an d Trospium  Chloride)  
Xanomeline tartrate  is a muscarinic -cholinergic receptor agonist. It has agonistic activity at all 
5 muscarinic receptors but preferentially stimulates M
1 and M 4 receptors  and binding to M 1 and 
M4 receptors in the CNS is thought to be responsible for the drug’s potential therapeutic effects

Page  20 of 94 (Roth, unpublished data). A recent study reports that xanomeline is a very potent M 4 muscarinic 
agonist in vivo, measured by various second messenger assays[ 14]. Xanomeline also enters the 
brain rapidly achieving a brain to plasma ratio of greater than 10 making it an attractive CNS 
drug candidate [15]. 
Xanomeline does not have any direct binding activity on dopaminergic receptors, suggesting that 
its mechanism of action  is unrelated to direct dopamine involvement.  
Previous double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trials have provided strong evidence that 
xanomeline has clinically relevant antipsychotic efficacy.  In a multicenter outpatient trial in AD 
(N = 343), 3 doses of xanomeline (up to 225 mg/day) and placebo were assessed for 
26 weeks [16,17]. Significant dose-dependent improvements in psychotic symptoms relative to 
placeb o were observed. Moreover, psychotic symptoms resolved quite rapidly in subject s who 
were symptomatic at baseline and a dose dependent reduction in the emergence of psychotic 
symptoms versus placebo was also observed. In a completer analysis, cognitive improvement was also found suggesting longer treatment intervals may be necessary for cognitive enhancement [16,17]. In a subsequent small (N = 20) double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient 
trial in treatment resistant subjects with schizophrenia, xanomeline (225 mg/day) demonstrated 
robust and relatively rapid improvement in psychosis compared to placebo. In addition, improvement in both negative symptoms and cognitive impairment was observed[ 18]. 
In both the AD and schizophrenia trials, as well as in previous healthy volunteer studies, dose 
dependent “cholinergic” AEs were also reported, namely vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating 
and hypersalivation. These side effects were frequent and, at the higher doses of xanomeline led to significant rates of discontinuation in the AD studies. This “ procholinergic” AE profile 
curtailed further development of xanomeline as a single agent.  
It is believed that the procholinergic AEs associated with xanomeline are mediated by 
xanomeline’s stimulation of peripheral  rather than central muscarinic receptors, which would 
make these AEs theoretically amenable to counteracting peripheral anticholinergic treatment. 
Trospium chloride is a peripherally acting muscarinic antagonist which binds to and antagonizes all five muscarinic receptor subtypes [19]. It is a commonly used generic drug approved for over 
10 ye ars by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) and by European authorities to treat 
overactive bladder and is generally well tolerated [19]. Several human subject studies have 
demonstrated that trospium does not appreciably cross the blood brain barrier, consistent with the drug’s quaternary ammonium structure[ 20].  
KarXT is a novel combination of xanomeline tartrate and trospium chloride. Karuna hypothesized that the addition of trospium would mitigate peripheral procholinergic side effects (vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, sweating and hyper -salivation) and thus provide a strategy to allow 
xanomeline to be administered and stimulate brain muscarinic receptors with a decreased side 
effect burden. Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers of this combination demonstrated that 
KarXT reduced the se side effects by 46% compared to xanomeline alone[ 21]. Moreover, the 
remaining cholinergic AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and tran sient in nature,

Page  21 of 94 often lasting a few hours without recurrence and were generally single- episode. In general, 
KarXT was well tolerated in healthy adult volunteers. These encouraging safety data prompted 
further work to assess KarXT for the treatment of schizophrenia and potentially other CNS 
disorders. 
Karuna has recently completed an adequate and well -controlled, randomized, multi- center 
Phase 2, placebo-controlled, inpatient clinical trial of acute psychosis with schizophrenia in 
182 adult subject s (KAR -004). KarXT demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful 11.6 point mean reduction in total Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) 
at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001), with statistical separation at each time point 
assessed (2, 4 , and 5 weeks) and also demonstrated good overall safety and tolerability. 
The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of KarXT (xanomeline 
125 mg/trospium 30 mg) administered twice daily (BID) in adult inpatients with Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual‒Fifth Edition (DSM -5) diagnosis of schizophrenia. A placebo arm is included 
to provide test sensitivity.  
Xanomeline is currently not approved or marketed in any country. Trospium is marketed in the US and other regions of the world for the treatment of overactive bladder.  
Nonclinical Studies  
The following is a summary of the important nonclinical safety and toxicology studies. More 
detailed information can be found in the KarXT Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 
The acute toxicity of  xanomeline tartrate was ev aluated i n mice and  rats.  All ani mals were 
observed for 2 weeks for mortality and clinical signs of intolerance , and then necropsied for 
gross examinations
. In-life f indings a ttributed to the  test article included excessive 
muscarinic -mediated pha
rmacology, such as excessive salivation, hypoactivity, ataxia, soft 
stools, exophthalmos, ocular discharge, tremors , and convulsions, with survivors typically 
appearing 
normal b y Days 3 or 4. Gross findings at necropsy wer e gene rally unremarkable (eg, 
gas-distended or mucous -filled gastrointestinal [ GI] tracts after o ral dos ing ). 
KarXT -301 was a 14-day, repeat dose study of KarXT in rats where relatively high doses of 
xanomeline and trospium were give n, with either xanomeline alone or in combinati on with 
trospium. Seven groups of 10 ra
ts/sex/group were administered either vehicle (reverse osmosis 
water); xanomeline alone at 37, 75, 150, or 300 mg/kg/day (split into BID doses, every 
12 hours); or xanomeline/trospium combination d osages of 150/200 mg/kg/day or 
225/400 mg/kg/day, respectively (split into BID doses, every 12 hou rs).

There was no

assessments. All intolerance could be attributed to recognized pharmacology of either test article.

Page  22 of 94 No dose- related  ophthalmic observations were noted. Findings were not indicative of specific 
target organ toxicity. In short, no new hazard was identified. 
Clinical observations noted in most animals  administered 300 mg/kg/day xanomeline included 
hypoactivity, clear oral  discharge, dilated pupils, irregular or labored respiration, and rough 
haircoat , among other observations. These findings are generally consistent with the anticipa ted 
pharmacology of xanomeline. Three TK animals in the low -dose combination group died or were euthanized in extremis. It is 
unclear to what extent the combination treatment effects versus the different handling of these 
animals (including 3 plasma samplings per animal) contributed to these deaths. If gavage accidents were involved (as happened  with some TK animals), then they were not detected at 
gross necropsy. There was no microscopic evidence of toxicity was seen in any toxicity animals  
in this group or in the higher-dose combination group. 
Three toxicology and 3 TK animal  deaths (total of 6) occurred in the high-dose combination 
group. Two toxicology animals had evidence of gavage accidents. For the third, the cause of 
death was undetermined , and a test article -related effect cannot be ruled out, but 
degeneration/regeneration of esophageal m uscular  is indicated some dosing- related trauma. If 
gavage accidents were involved, then they were not detected at gross necropsy. There was no evidence of target organ microscopic findings in GI tract or any other tissue of any animal, including the early death toxicity animals.  
A pharmacodynamics -mediated reduction in GI motility is consistent with the anti- muscarinic 
effects of trospium on intestinal musculature. Fecal retention, malabsorption, cessation of eating, dehydration, and rapid deterioration followed with continued dosing. Cessation of dosing in the high dose combination animals that survived led to rapid recovery, implying the deleterious effects had been pharmacodynamics -related. No effects on food consumption were seen in any 
xanomeline-alone group. The lack of microscopic findings in the GI tract of any early death or surviving animal implies that the adverse effects were pharmacologically mediated rather than direct target organ toxicity.  
Twenty -eight Day Repeat -Dose Studies with Xanomeline in Rats and Monkeys: Rats were fed 
xanomeline tartrate at 0 %, 0.05%, 0.1%, or 0.2% daily and monkeys were fed xanomeline 
tartrate daily at 0, 5, 12.5, or 30 mg/kg. All animals survived until necropsy. Safety findings in rats included reduced body weight in the high dose group, increases in gamma- glutamyl-
transferase, cholesterol, and bilirubin, slight decreases in triglycerides, bile duct hyperplasia, 
higher serum potassium (males), and lower serum globulin (females). Findings in monkeys were 
dose related and included signs of intolerance such as emesis, salivation, diarrhea, hypoactivity, weight loss, and treatment- related tachycardia in the high -dose animals.  
Forty -Day Repeat Dose Study of KarXT in R ats (KarXT -302): Six groups of 15 rats/sex/group 
were giv en vehicle, xanomeline alone at 75 or 150 mg/kg/day, trospium alone at 100 mg/kg/day,

Page  23 of 94 all doses split into BID doses. Satellite rats (TK animals) were included for collection of plasma 
after the first and last doses to determine concentrations of each drug. Dosing was initially planned to be 90 days but was terminated after 40 days because of unexpected deaths in the TK 
animals. No target organ toxicity was seen. Safet y findings included pharmacologically mediated 
constipation in the trospium alone and combination groups and mild biliary hyperplasia in the 
high-dose xanomeline alone and combination groups. There were 4 unscheduled deaths in TK 
animals; 2 in the high -dose xanomeline alone group (150 g/kg/day ) and 2 in the high-dose 
combination group (150 mg/kg/day xanomeline plus 100 mg/kg/day trospium). Both xanomeline-only animals had necropsy gross findings of a gavage accident, and cause of death could not be determined. All toxicology animals survived to their scheduled sacrifice. Sponsor considers that the volume depletion and trauma of multiple bleeds (3 per animal), followed by 
reduced absorption of fluids and nutrients secondary to reduced GI motility with continued BID 
dosing explains the greater demise of TK animals relative to toxicity animals.  
Based on the results of the 90-day rat toxicology study, oral administration of trospium chloride and xanomeline tartrate alone or in combination to Crl:CD (SD) rats BID (12 hours ± 60 minutes 
apart) at dosage levels of 25 and 50 mg/kg/dose trospium chloride, 37 and 75 mg/kg/dose xanomeline tartrate , and a combination of 37/25, 75/25, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose xanomeline 
tartrate/trospium chloride for a minimum of 90 days resulted in minimal to moderate bile duct hyperplasia in the livers of the xanomeline tartrate and combination (xanomeline tartrate and 
trospium chloride) group males. Although there were no notable differences in the incidence of 
bile duct hyperplasia when comparing the single vs combination groups, there was an increased severity observed in the combination group males (specifically the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group males) when compared with the xanomeline tartrate group males at the 
terminal euthanasia. The bile duct hyperplasia was considered adverse in the high -dose 
xanomeline tartrate group males and in the 75/25 and 75/50 mg/kg/dose combination group males due to instances of moderate severity. Therefore, the no- observed -adverse- effect level was 
considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 37 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, and 37/25 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/tros pium chloride. At these 
doses for males, mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium, 
146,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline, and 4510 + 111,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. At these dosages for females, mean plasm a AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 267,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 16,700 + 171,000 pg•hr/mL 
for trospium + xanomeline, respectively, on Day 91. The absence of bile duct hyperplasia in 
females cannot be explained from differences in drug exposure. At the recovery euthanasia, bile duct hyperplasia was still present but was limited to minimal severity , and there was a decreased 
incidence in both the xanomeline tartrate and combination group males. There was also no 
notable difference in se verity between the single vs combination groups at the recovery 
euthanasia. Given the decreased incidence/severity, in combination with the improved histologic 
appearance of bile ducts at the recovery euthanasia (i.e., smaller/flattened epithelium, noninfl ammatory, and an absence of portal bridging), changes at the recovery euthanasia were

Page  24 of 94 consistent with a partial resolution of bile duct hyperplasia. With an absence of correlating serum 
liver enzyme elevations, bile acid alterations or hepatocellular degen eration, necrosis or 
regeneration, and with the apparent reversibility after cessation of treatment, these findings 
appear to have been tolerable by the affected animals. Therefore, the maximum tolerated dose was considered to be 50 mg/kg/dose for trospium chloride, 75 mg/kg/dose for xanomeline tartrate, and 75/50 mg/kg/dose for the combination of xanomeline tartrate/trospium chloride. For males, corresponding mean plasma AUC
0-24 values were 27,700 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 
822,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and  133,000 + 276,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomeline, 
respectively, on Day 91. For females, corresponding mean plasma AUC 0-24 values were 
9230 pg•hr/mL for trospium; 2,090,000 pg•hr/mL for xanomeline; and 17,600 + 950,000 pg•hr/mL for trospium + xanomelin e, respectively, on Day 91. 
In summary, no new findings on the “combination” of xanomeline and trospium (KarXT) were 
discovered; toxicology studies revealed the familiar exaggerations of systemic and CNS muscarinic effects that had previously been seen with xanomeline or trospium at high doses. 
Target organ findings with xanomeline alone were limited to biliary hyperplasia in the 28 -day rat 
study but not the 28-day or 12-month monkey study, though similar findings were described in a 6-month monkey study. With KarXT, biliary hyperplasia was not observed in the 14- day rat
study but was reported in the 40-day rat  study. Notably, these hyperplastic findings are not
thought to represent pre- neoplastic lesions, because they were  of low severity; no fibrosis or
associated hepatocellular changes, and no significant effects were seen on hepatobiliary -related
serum chemistry.
Completed Clinical Studies  
Refer to the IB for complete information regarding previous clinical studies conducted with 
xanomeline by Eli Lilly, and s
tudies KAR-001, KAR-002, KAR -003, a nd KAR -004 conducted 
by K aruna Therapeutics using xanomeline with trospium. 
To date, more than 840 s ubjects or  volunteers h ave been exposed t o xanom eline tartrat e (oral 
formulation, e ithe
r alone, in combination with trospium, or as the combination drug KarXT ) in 
19 completed clinical studies conducted either by Eli Lilly or Karuna Therapeutics, some for as 
long as 3 years. In those studies, significant improvements in cogniti on and reduced psychotic 
symptoms w ere obs erved. 
A study of xanomeline monotherapy in subjects with schizophrenia was reported in 2008[18] . In 
t
his pilot study, the effects of xanomeline were examined in 20 s ubjects w ith schizophrenia 
utilizing a doubl e-blind, pl
acebo- controlled, 4-week study design. Subjects treated with 
xanomeline did significantly better than subjects in the placebo group on Brief P sychiatric 
Rating  Scale total s co
res and P ANSS total s cores ( ie, 24- point change over placebo, P = 0.04). In 
the cognitive test batter

Page  25 of 94 These studies demonstrated the potential for xanomeline as a treatment for psychosis and 
cognition across multiple subject populations. 
Study H 2Q-EW-E001, conducted by Lilly, had 36 male healthy volunteers in 4 groups of 9, who 
were administered escalating single doses of xanomeline tartrate in increments of 1, 5, 10, 25, 
50, 75, 100 mg, and 150 mg. Each group took 2 ascending doses of xanomeline tartrate and 1 dose of placebo in a single subject blind manner. There were no serious AE s (SAEs). AEs 
included watery diarrhea, nausea, dizziness, sweating, shivering, mild disorientation, increased 
blood pressure (BP), increase in sitting and standing heart rate, slight increase in supine systolic 
BP, and postural hypotension. 
The clinical experience with KarXT initiated by Karuna Therapeutics to date includes 
3 completed Phase 1, clinical pharmacology studies in healthy volunteers (KAR-001, KAR-002, 
and KAR -003) and one completed  Phase 2 study (KAR-004) in adult inpatients with DSM -5 
schizophrenia. 
The first study conducted by Karuna, KAR- 001 was “A Phase 1 , double-blind , randomized, 
multiple -dose, pilot s tudy comparing  xanomeline administered alone to xanomeline a dministered  
in combination with trospium chloride in normal healthy v olunteers.” This study consisted of 
2 arms, in which xanomeline was administered TID, alone, at a total daily dose of 225 mg in one 
arm, and the second arm received the same dose of xanomeline in combination with trospium chloride 20 mg administered BID, a total daily dose of 40 mg. Subjects were treated for 7 days. 
The goal was to determine whether this dosing regimen would reduce the cholinergic side ef fects 
of xanomeline by co -administration of the muscarinic antagonist, trospium.  
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg daily + trospium 40 mg daily administered over 
7 days was considered safe and well tolerated. The results of key and supportive endpoints 
showed a numerical reduction (although not statistically significant) in visual analog scale ( VAS ) 
scores for cholinergic events for the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm. Specifically, consistent numerical reduction in VAS scores for the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm was observed for the supportive endpoints of maximum weekly individual VAS scores and mean daily maximum composite VAS scores. 
Results of the clinician -administered scales were suppor tive of a reduction in vomiting, feelings 
of nausea, excess salivation, and sweating that interfered with daily activities in the 
xanomeline + trospium treatment arm compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm.  
There were no meaningful differences between treatment groups in heart rate, resting BP, 
orthostatic BP or any electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters including QT. A small subset of 
subjects in both treatment a rms had transient increases in heart rate and orthostatic BP changes 
which may have contributed to syncope and postural dizziness in those subjects. Two subjects (both in the xanomeline alone arm) experienced syncope. The incidence of orthostatic AEs in the 
KarXT group was approximately one-half that of subjects in the xanomeline alone group.

Page  26 of 94 The most commonly reported treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs ) in KAR -001 (≥20% of subjects 
in either treatment arm) were hyperhidrosis, salivary hypersecretion, nausea, dizziness postural, 
and diarrhea. Subject incidences of these 5 TEAEs was higher in the xan omeline alone treatment 
arm (61.8%) compared to the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm (34.3%). 
Overall, treatment with xanomeline 225 mg combined with trospium chloride 40 mg 
administered over 7 days was considered safe and well -tolerated. The observed s ide effect profile 
was consistent with the known safety profile of xanomeline and trospium chloride. The incidence 
of TEAEs and cholinergic TEAEs was lower in the xanomeline + trospium treatment arm 
compared to the xanomeline alone treatment arm.  
Study KAR -002 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose adaptive design pilot 
study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT in normal healthy volunteers. Subjects 
received either 100 mg xanomeline + 20 mg trospium BID or placebo. The first cohort of this 
study was stopped after 1.5 days when the US FDA put the program on hold due to a preliminary 
rat finding in the 14-day study. This study used a new formulation of KarXT in which xanomeline and trospium were combined into a single dose form and given BID. Safety findings 
included an increase in orthostatic complaints. Caution should be used in drawing conclusions 
from this study, as subjects did not have time to reach steady state plasma levels from dosing, as only 3 doses were given.  
Study KAR -003 was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, multiple-dose, adaptive design, 
inpatient pilot study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of KarXT in normal healthy volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of 7 days 
of daily administration of KarXT at various dose combinations, administered BID. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (3:1 ratio). All subjects on KarXT received 2 days of 50 mg xanomeline + 20  mg trospium BID , and then increased to differen t doses for Days 3 to 7. This 
study also used the new formulation of KarXT in which xanomeline and trospium were combined into a single dosage form and given BID. 
There was a relatively high degree of variability in xanomeline and trospium exposures between 
individuals in all cohorts, which is consistent with previous results with KarXT, 
xanomeline-alone, and trospium- alone. Peak plasma concentrations were observed at a median 
time of 2.0 hours for xanomeline and 1.0 hour for trospium across all treatment groups and study 
days.  
Although there was insufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the impact of 
trospium on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and bioavailability of xanomeline, or the impact of 
xanomeline on the PK and bioavailability of trospium, the PK results suggest that neither drug 
had a meaningful impact on the PK behavior of the other drug. 
During the 2- day lead -in phase, the most common AEs (≥20% of subjects) when all the subjects 
completed dosing were dry mouth, nausea, and constipation. For the treatment groups that 
completed dosing, although the incidence of TEAEs was lower in the KarXT 100/20 BID

Page  27 of 94 (66.7%) group compared to KarXT 125/40 group (88.9%) , the incidence of cholinergic TEAEs 
(nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, and excess salivation) was similar between the 2 groups. 
The most commonly reported TEAEs ( 20% of subjects in either treatment group) in these 
groups were dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, headache, vomiting, dyspepsia, somnolence, vision 
blurred, and dysuria. For the treatment groups that did not complete dosing (KarXT 150/20 BID 
group and KarXT 150/40 BID group), the cholinergic TEAEs were generally higher compared to 
the treatment groups that completed dosing. 
Overall, anticholinergic TEAEs appeared to occur prim arily in the treatment groups that were 
dosed with 40 mg trospium BID (KarXT 150/40 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID groups), 
particularly when paired with 125 mg xanomeline BID, suggesting to consider slightly lowering the trospium dose from 40 mg BID in future studies. All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and there were no SAEs or deaths. T reatment -emergent AEs were primarily cholinergic 
or orthostatic (and a few anticholinergic). Doses of 100 mg and 125 mg BID of xanomeline were well tolerated when paire d with 20 mg and 40 mg BID of trospium, respectively. The safety and 
tolerability profile of KarXT 100/20 BID and KarXT 125/40 BID was acceptable and supports further evaluation at similar doses in future studies. Doses of KarXT 150/20 BID and 150/40 BID w ere not well tolerated in this study. A pairing of 150 mg xanomeline with 40 mg 
trospium appeared to be better tolerated than 150/20, but some subjects still experienced 
tolerability issues.  
Study KAR -004 was a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded study to a ssess the safety 
tolerability, and efficacy of KarXT in adults with DSM -5 schizophrenia, hospitalized with acute 
psychosis. The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of KarXT 125 /30 BID 
versus placebo in reducing PANSS total scores in a dult inpatients with a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Subjects received either KarXT or placebo (1:1 ratio) for a treatment period of 5 weeks. All subjects on KarXT received a lead -in dose of KarXT 50/20 BID for the first 2 days 
followed by KarXT 100/20 BID on Days 3 to 7. On Day 8, dosing was titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless the subject was continuing to experience AEs from previous dose increase of 100/20 BID. The clinical portion of this study was completed and clinical study report is in progress. No new safety concerns have arisen during this study. 
The KAR -004 trial results are unambiguous regarding efficacy, where not only the primary 
outcome measure showed a robust separation from placebo, but the additional sensitivity and secondary outcome measures were consistently robust as well.  
KarXT demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction s in total 
PANSS scores at 5 weeks compared to placebo ( P < 0.0001) in the modified intent- to-treat 
(mITT ) population. The KarXT group showed an adjusted mean improvement of 17.40 points at 
Week 5 compared to an adjusted mean 5.85 point improvement in the placebo group for a difference of 11.56 points in the total PANSS score ( Figure 1 ). Substantial significant differences 
were also seen between KarXT and placebo at Weeks 2 and  4; moreover, the difference appears 
to be widening with each successive time point . In addition, sensitivity analyses of the primary

The overall safety/tolerability data were also fairly unambiguous; among the highlights:

• The overall TEAE rate on KarXT was 5 4% vs 43% on placebo  
• Most common TEAEs  were constipation, nausea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, and vomiting. 
None of these TEAEs were rated as severe, and none led to  discontinuations 
• One SAE  occurred in the study (the subject was on KarXT): the subject discontinued 
treatment and subsequently sought hospital care for worsening psychosis, meeting the regulatory definition of an SAE. 
• No syncope or mean changes in BP were seen  
• A 5.5 bpm peak mean placebo adjusted resting heart rate increase with a downward  trend 
after week 2 was seen  
• One subject (on KarXT) was discontinued due to an elevated gamma -glutamyl

changes . In contra
st, these serious side effects  pose a significant risk w ith other A PD tr eatments 
for schizophrenia and ca

score showing a 11.6 point mean improvement compared to placebo with a highly significant 
(P < 0.0001) separation from placebo (-17.4 KarXT vs -5.9 placebo) at Week 5. KarXT, as 
compared with place bo, demonstrated highly significant reduction in PANSS total scores 
(P < 0.0001) at all post randomization time points (Weeks 2, 4, a nd, 5)  with a calculated ef fects 
size (Cohe

at all 
post randomization  time poi nts for PANSS p ositive symptom subsco res, P ANSS ne gative  
symptom subscores, PANSS Marder Factor  negative symptom subscores , and C GI-S scor es. 
More than 840 subjects or volunteers have been exposed to xanomeline tartrate (oral 
for

KarXT represents a novel approach to the treatment of patients with schizophrenia that will 
provide an important and meaningful alternative to current therapies. The current tolerability and

population by advancing to Phase 3 trials . 
Subjects assigned to active study drug may benefit by improvement in schizophrenia symptoms.  
Since subjects will be having an acute psychotic event, subjects will be hospitalized where the clinical staff is available to help them 24 hours a day. In addition, the inpatient setting represents an important venue for research , examining the effects of KarXT and helps to eliminate or 
reduce to the extent possible, subjectivity and bias. Furtherm ore, this inpatient setting will also 
enhance measurable quality standards as well as increased adherence.

7.1 Description of Overall Study Design and Plan 
This Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel -group, placebo- controlled, multicenter,  
inpatient clinical study in  adults who are acutely psychotic with  a DSM -5 diagnosis of 
schizophrenia is designed to test the hypothesis that treatment with KarXT will result in 
significantly greater reduction (ie , improvement) in t he primary and secondary endpoints at 
Week 5 from baseline compared with placebo. Total study duration is up to 8 weeks, including a 
7-day screening phase (up to a 7 -day extension of the screening phase is allowed, if necessary), a 
5 week treatment period, and a 7 -day follow -up period (only for subjects who do not rollover to 
KAR -008 study). Subjects completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a 
long-term open- label study (KAR -008) in which every subject will receive KarXT.  Study staff 
should discuss KAR -008 protocol participation with potential subjects prior to the final day of 
participation in the acute study, via use of the provided recruitment materials.  
Screening Period : 
Screening of subjects will take place in 7 days or less before Day -1 (Days -8 to -2). Up to a 
7-day extension of the screening time  is allowed, if necessary.  
A suitable number of subjects will be screened to randomize approximately 246 subjects across 
approximately 10 sites in the US  and 10 sites in Ukraine. Subjects will be randomized through 
the IWRS in a 1:1 ratio to receive either KarXT or placebo for a treatment duration of 5  weeks.  
Treatment Period:  
In the treatment period, all subjects assigned to KarXT will start on a lead -in dose of 
KarXT  50/20 (xanomeline 50 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the first 2 days (Days 1 and 2) 
followed by KarXT  100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) BID for the remainder of 
Week  1 (Days 3 to 7). On Day 8, dosing will be titrated upwards to KarXT 125/30 BID unless 
the subject is continuing to experience AEs from the previous dose of KarXT 100/20 BID. All subjects who are increased to KarXT 125/30 BID, depending on clinical response and 
tolerability, will have the option to return to KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of the treatment period. Dosing must not change after Visit 7 (Day 21) of the study and may be 
decreased for tolerability reasons no more than once during the study. In addition, dose escalation to KarXT  125/30 BID may not occur outside of the permitted visit wind ow for 
Visit 5/Day 8. 
All randomized subjects will have structured diagnostic interview sessions and questionnaires 
administered throughout the study (see Schedule of Assessments Table 2) . Analyses of change 
from baseline in diagnostic measures will be performed.  
Efficacy assessments (PANSS score s and CGI- S score) will be assessed at scheduled visits.

 Page  40 of 94 7.2 Discussion of Study Design  
A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study design is suitable for 
conducting any interventional studies. This design will minimize bias and provide reference data for comparison of efficacy and safety parameters of the investigational drug.  
Schizophrenia is a long- term mental disorder which requires a chronic therapy.  A 5-week 
treatmen t duration is considered an acceptable treatment duration to observe clinically significant 
response (ie. primary endpoint can be achieved). The 5 -week treatment duration is substantiated 
by the statistically significant outcome of the KAR -004 study of the same duration.  
7.3 End of Study  
A subject  will have fulfilled the requirements for study completion when the subject  has 
completed all study periods, including the End of Study visit (Visit 10/Day 35  [End of 
Treatment /Early Termination ] for subject s who roll over into KAR -008 or Visit 11/Day 42 
[Follow-up] for subject s who do not roll over in to the KAR -008 study) as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) in accordance with the protocol. 
Subject s completing this study will have the option of rolling over into a long-term open- label 
study (KAR -008) in which every subject  will receive KarXT , following completion of 
Visit 10/Day 35 of the c urrent study (KAR -009). 
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Treatment/Early 
Termination  visit (Visit 10) for subjects who have completed Visit 10/Day 35 but do not rollover 
in to the long- term open -label study  KAR -008. 
7.4 Independent Safety Monitoring Committee  
For the purpose of this study, the ISMC is an independent group of individuals with pertinent expertise that reviews on a regular basis accumulating safety and tolerability data from the 
clinical study. The ISMC wi ll include 3 clinicians and a reporting statistician. This committee 
will be responsible, on a periodic basis, for confirming the safety and tolerability of KarXT 
throughout the study, with particular focus on assessing for any new toxicities that might be involved with KarXT. 
The reviews will be of unblinded data to allow a comparison of event rates and detection of 
safety signals across treatment groups to identify important safety information. The ISMC 
charter will contain the details of the types of dat a to be reviewed, the defined triggers for 
review, the minimum frequency of meetings (timed, if no triggers), and the communication plan for disseminating review recommendations.

the exclusionary laboratory result was not due to a pathological condition and was occasional (except for individuals who have positive serology results).  
8.4 Study Withdrawal, Removal, and Replacement of Subjects  
If a subject  discontinues study treatment and is withdrawn from the study for any reason, the 
study site must immediately notify the medical monitor. The date and the reason for study 
discontinuation must be recorded on the electronic case report form (eCRF ). Subject s who 
complete or discontinue early from the study will be discharged  from  the study site, if clinically 
warranted  after completing all the Visit 10/early termination  assessments as indicated in the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
Note: A safety follow -up visit will be performed 1 week after the End of Treatment/Early 
Termination  visit (Visit 10)  for those subjects who do not roll over into the long-term open- label 
study KAR -008. 
In the event that a subject discontinues prematurely from the study because of a TEAE or serious 
TEAE, the TEAE or serious TEAE will be followed up until it resolves (returns to normal or baseline values) or stabilizes, or until it is judged by the investigator to no longer be clinically 
significant.  
Once a subject is withdrawn from the study, the subject  will not re-enter the study. 
A subject  may voluntarily withdraw or be withdrawn from the study at any time for reasons 
including, but not limited to, the following: 
• progressive disease  
• unacceptable toxicity or AE  
• subject withdrawal of consent: at any time, a  subject ’s participation in the study may be 
terminate d at his/her request.  The reason for s ubject  withdrawal will be noted on the 
eCRF  
• on the basis of the investigator’s clinical judgement 
• intercurrent illness: a condition, injury, or disease unrelated to the primary diagnosis that 
became apparent during treatment and necessitated the subject ’s termination from the 
study 
• general or specific changes in the subject ’s condition that renders him/her ineligible for 
further treatment according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria  (eg, subject  has need for a 
medication prohibited by the protocol) 
• subject  fails to adhere to the protocol requirements (eg, drug noncompliance [if a study 
subject is off study drug for >5 days in a row])

meet entry criteria  
• development of suicidal or assaultive behavior 
• alcohol or illegal drug use 
• pregnancy, as indicated in Section 12.7.8. A ny study subject who becomes pregnant 
while participating in the study will be unblinded to study treatment randomization. If she 
is found to be on active treatment assignment, she will be followed until her pregnancy 
reaches term  
• Sponsor’s decision to discontinue study 
Subject s withdrawing from the study will be encouraged to complete the same final evaluations 
as subjects completing the study according to this protocol, particularly safety evaluations. The 
aim is to record data in the same way as for subjects who completed the study.  
Reasonable efforts will be made to contact subject s who leave the unit or are lost to follow-up. 
These efforts must be documented in the subject’s file. Subjects with AEs ongoing at end of 
study will be followed until the AE is resolved  (regardless  of whether they enroll in the 
long-term open- label study KAR -008) or the subject  is considered to be in stable condition. 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time in case of SAEs or if special circumstances concerning the study drug become known, making further treatment of subject s 
impossible. In this event, the investigator(s) will be informed of the reason for study termination. 
 Pregnancy  
No evidence of mutagenicity, or treatment effects on reproduction, fertility, or fetal parameters 
have been demonstrated in animals following administration of xanomeline, but there are no 
adequate and well -controlled studies in pregnant women (FDA Pregnancy Category B). Animal 
reproduction studies of trospium chloride have shown an adverse effect on the fetus, but potential benefits may warrant the use of the drug in pregnant women despite the risk (FDA 
Pregnancy Category C).  
Therefore, WOCBP  in this study must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth 
control (see APPENDIX 1  for a list of acceptable highly effective methods of contraception) 
during the study and for 30 days after the last dose of study drug . WOCBP  will have a serum 
pregnancy test at screening and a urine pregnancy test  on Day - 1 (before receiving KarXT)  and 
thereafter, as designated at other scheduled visits ( Table 2). In case of positive urine pregnancy 
test result, a serum sample should be sent to the central laboratory to confirm the result. 
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of KarXT on the developing 
human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient ef fects.

Page  46 of 94 Because there is an unknown but potential risk for AEs in nursing infants secondary to treatment 
of the mother with KarXT , women who are breastfeeding must not be enrolled in the study. 
The effects of study drug on sperm are unknown. Men whose sexua l partners are WOCBP must 
agree to use a highly effective method of birth control ( see APPENDIX 1  for a list of acceptable 
highly effective methods of contraception) and must not impregnate a sexual partner dur ing or 
for 30 days after the last dose of study drug . They must also agree to refrain from sperm donation 
for 30 days after the last dose of study drug . 
WOCBP  will be instructed that known or suspected pregnancy occurring during the study should 
be confirmed and reported to the investigator. If a female subject becomes pregnant, the 
investigator must withdraw her from the study without delay. The subject  must not receive any 
further doses of the study drug. Upon discontinuation from the study, only those procedures that 
would not expose the pregnant female subject to undue risk will be performed. See Section 12.7.8 for further reporting and m onitoring details.  
Full details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the withdrawal page (exit form) of the eCRF, or a pregnancy rep ort will be completed if the subject has completed the study. Notification of the 
pregnancy should be submitted via the Preg nancy Reporting Form within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the pregnancy. Pregnancy is not to be considered an AE; however, it must be reported using the same procedure as described for reporting SAE ( Section 12.7.4). 
8.5 Completion of the Study or Lost to Follow- up 
The study will be completed when all subjects have completed their study -related procedures in 
accordance with the protocol. 
Every reasonable eff ort will be made to contact subject s who leave the facility and are lost to 
follow-up to obtain end of study information. Details regarding follow- up efforts are to be 
documented in the subject’s medical records/source documentation. 
8.6 Study Termination 
The availability of any new adverse safety information related to KarXT may result in stopping 
the study. An investigator, Sponsor, or Independent E thics Committee (IEC)/Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) may take such actions. If the study is terminated for saf ety reasons, subjects 
will be notified immediately and assured that appropriate treatment and follow -up will be 
available. If an investigator terminates the study, the Sponsor, subject s, and IEC/ IRB will be 
informed about the reason for such action. Simila rly, if the Sponsor terminates the study, it will 
inform the investigators, the IEC/ IRB, and the subject s of the reason for such an action. Similar 
notifications will be sent by the IEC/ IRB if it takes such an action.

9.1 Details of Study Treatments  
KarXT is formulated as hard hydroxypropyl methylcellulose oral capsules containing 2 distinct 
populations of drug beads, one of which is loaded with xanomeline tartrate and the other of which is loaded with trospium chloride. Each capsule contains the fre ebase equivalent of 
xanomeline and trospium according to the desired dose strength. In addition to the active ingredients, the drug beads contain microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). The beads are not coated and are formulated for immediate release of the active ingredients.  
 Identity of Study Treatments  
Active study agents for treatment group will be size 0, Swedish -orange hydroxypropyl 
methylcellulose hard capsules. Placebo will be prepared in matching capsules ; therefore , an 
unblinded pharmacist will be required to dispense study drug in a blinded fashion to personnel who will be responsible for administration of IP to the subject. For the 2- day lead -in period 
(Days 1 and 2), subjects randomized to active drug will receive capsule strength KarXT 50/20 BID,  followed by 2 capsules of KarXT 50/10 mg BID or a dosage of 100/20 BID for a total daily 
dosage of 200/40 mg xanomeline/trospium chloride for the remainder of Week 1 (Days 3 to 7). At the beginning of Week 2, dosing may be increased to 2 capsules of KarXT  62.5/15 mg or a 
dosage of 125/30 BID for a total daily dosage of 250/60 mg xanomeline/trospium chloride, 
depending on clinical response and tolerability. Investigators have the option to return a subject 
to KarXT 100/20 BID for the remainder of the treatment period, but dosing must not change 
after Visit 7 of the study.  
KarXT 50/10 mg is composed of 44.4% xanomeline tartrate, 5.8% trospium chloride, excipients 37.59% MCC, 11.5% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0.5% talc in a size 0, 
Swedish -orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsule. 
KarXT 50/20 mg is composed of 33.4% xanomeline tartrate, 8.7% trospium chloride, excipients 
39.8% MCC, 17.3% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0.5% talc in a size 0, Swedish -orange, hydroxypropyl me thylcellulose hard capsule.  
KarXT 62.5/15 mg is composed of 41.7% xanomeline tartrate, 6.5% trospium chloride, 
excipients 38.1% MCC, 12.9% lactose monohydrate, 0.3% ascorbic acid and 0.5% talc in a 
size 0, Swedish-orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsule.  
Placebo is composed of sugar spheres pf011, 850/1000 suglets, 99.05% colorcon, and 10.05% talc in a size 0, Swedish -orange, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose hard capsule. 
All investigational agents are to be stored according to requirements.

 Packaging and Labelling 
The study packaging and labelling will be performed by Corealis Pharma, located in Laval, 
Quebec, Canada, Catalent  Pharma Solutions, located in Winchester, Kentucky (labelling for the 
US sites) , and Catalent Pharma Solutions, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania ( labelling for 
Ukrainian sites ). All packaging and labelling operations will be performed according to Good 
Manufacturing Practice for Medicinal Products and the relevant regulatory requirements.  
Bulk supply bottles are labeled with the name of the drug, recommended storage conditions, the 
name and address of the manufacturer , and the Investigational Use Statement (“Caution: New 
Drug – Limited by Federal [US] Law to Investigational Use”).  
Further details on labelling of investigational products will be provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
 Study Drug Storage 
KarXT and placebo must be stored at controlled room temperature 15°C-25°C in a secured 
location with no access to unauthorized personnel. 
 Study Drug Retention 
Study drug  not used in KAR-009 may be used for the long- term extension study (KAR -008). 
Therefore, unused study drug for this particular study must be retained until completion or termination of the KarXT program, and written authorization from the Sponsor has been 
received. The unused study drug can be reassigned in the IWRS to subjects in the KAR-008 
study. All unused and used study drug must be destroyed at the site or returned, as specified by 
Sponsor. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the Sponsor has provided written authorization prior to return or destruction, and that appropriate records of the disposal are documented and maintained. No used or unused study drug may be disposed until fully accounted for by the study monitor. 
9.2 Dose Schedule  
The first dose of the study drug will be administered in the morning of Day 1. T he last dose will 
be administered in the morning of Visit 10 (Day 35 -2 days). The study drug should be 
administered daily BID on an empty stomach ie , at least 1 hour before a meal  or 2 to 3 hours 
after a meal. Some considerations for dosing and PK blood withdrawals are provided in the 
subsections below. 
 Visit 2 b/Day 1 Randomization and Dosing 
• The first dose will be administered in the morning , and the evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose. 
• All subject s must be administered 4 dosages of the KarXT 50/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation  to KarXT 100/20 or placebo BID.

Page  49 of 94 
 Visit 3/Day 3 and/or Visits Occurring on Weekends/Holidays 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 100/20 or placebo level is confirmed by investigator 
order on Visit 3/Day 3, that dose is to be administered in the morning. 
• When Day 3 occurs on a weekend, it is expected that the complete Visit 3 will be 
performed , and the subject ’s dose will be escalated on Day 3. 
• If completion of the visit is not possible on Day 3, the +1-day visit window may be used. 
In this instance, the dose will not be escalated  until the study visit occurs. In all cases, the 
subject  must have had at least 4 doses of KarXT 50/20  or placebo before escalating  to 
KarXT  100/20 or placebo. 
• This may res ult in only 4 days of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo dose at Visit 5/D ay 8, 
which is acceptable.  
• All subject s must be administered 8 doses of the KarXT 100/20 or placebo before dose 
escalation to KarXT 125/30 or placebo BID. 
 Visit 5/Day 8 Dosing and PK C onsiderations and Visit 8 /Day 28 PK 
Considerations 
• If dose escalation to the KarXT 125/30 or placebo level is confirmed by i nvestigato r 
order on Visit 5/Day 8, that dose is to be administered in the morning (after the predose 
PK blood draw) to allow for serial postdose PK blood draws per protocol ( Table 2, 
Footnote  p). 
• Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must accompan y the 
actual day of dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
• For Visit 8 , serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject ’s final 
KarXT dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses; there fore, there  must be no 
changes in dose for at least 7 days prior to Visit 8. PK sampling  must accompany the 
actual day of Visit 8  if a window is used. 
 Visit 10/Day 35 Dosing 
• All subjects will receive their final dose of KarXT or placebo on the morning of 
Visit 10/Day 35. 
9.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Study Treatment  Assignment  
 Method of Study Treatment Assignment  
At Screening, the interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique subject 
identification number to the subject known as the Subject Number. This number will be 
associated with the subject throughout the study. Every subject who signs an ICF must be 
entered into the IWRS regardless of eligibility in order to obtain a Subject Number. This 9- digit 
Approved
1.0
v
Karuna Therapeutics  KAR -009 
KarXT  Final  v1.2 
This document is confidential.  
Page  50 of 94 number will consist of a 3-digit study code and a 3- digit site identification followed by a 3- digit 
subject number assigned sequentially within each site, starting at . 
On Day -1, all eligible subject s will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either KarXT or 
placebo groups. Subject s will be assigned a randomization number through the IWRS, in 
accordance with the randomization code generated by the authorized personnel at  VERISTAT . 
At the study site,  the randomization schedule will only be accessible to authorized unblinded 
pharmacy personnel or designee. Once a randomization number is allocated to one subject , it 
may not be assigned to another subject  even if the former discontinued the study. 
 Blinding  
An IWRS will allocate treatment based on a prespecified randomization list generated by  
VERISTAT . Active and placebo study drug will be provided in bulk to each site participating in 
the study. For each dose, study drug and packaging will be identical in size, shape, color, and 
appearance (see Section 9.1.2). No other study site personnel (except the pharmacist or other 
designated unblinded individual) , subject s, informants /caregivers , Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor 
designees  (eg, Sponsor’s Medical Monitor) will be unblinded to treatment assignment throughout 
the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. Both active study drug and placebo will 
be supplied as identical matching capsules. This prevents bias on the part of the study staff and 
the subject to influence the results of the study. 
If an investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject ’s study treatment, that subject  will be 
discontinued from the study unless there are ethical reasons for that subject  not to be 
discontinued; approval from the Sponsor/medical monitor must be obtained in such instances. 
VERISTAT  will generate and maintain the security of the randomizati on code. In the event that 
emergency unblinding is required for a given subject  because of  AEs or concerns for the 
subject ’s safety  or wellbeing,  the investigator may break the randomization code for just th at 
subject  via the IWRS , by which system the unbl inding will be captured  after consultation and 
agreement with the medical monitor/Sponsor. The unblinding and its cause will also be 
documented in the eCRF. Unblinding according to the protocol will occur only after completion of the study. 
If an AE is thought to be related to the study drug and poses a safety risk, the investigator must 
decide whether to stop investigational treatment and/or treat the subject . Subject  withdrawal 
should be avoided, if possible. If discontinuation of treatment occurs, every attempt should be 
made to restart study drug if medically appropriate, whatever the duration of discontinuation. When a subject  has an AE that requires that the investigator be unblinded, the investigator can 
obtain the treatment assignment from the IWRS system. The site is expected to notify the study medical monitor before breaking the study blind unless it is in the subject ’s best interest if the 
blind is broken immediately. Note: I n most circumstances , it is not necessary to unblind a 
subject , even if an SAE has occurred. For many drugs there is no specific therapy for AEs. The

Page  51 of 94 appropriate course of action is to stop the investigational drug and treat the signs and symptoms 
resulting from the AE.  
The members of the ISMC will be unblinded as they review the safety data from the study.  
9.4 Dose Modification 
Subject s will be dosed as described in Section 7.1 and in accordance with the Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table 2). The study drug doses were selected based on the previous preclinical and 
clinical studies (see Section  5.2). Per the protocol, subject s will be evaluated for dose 
adjustments at Visits 5, 6, and 7 and at unscheduled visits. No dose adjustments are allowed after Visit 7. No other dose modifications are permissible in this study except those specified in this protocol. 
9.5 Treatment Accountability and Compliance  
The pharmacist or other designated unblinded individual will maintain records of study treatment 
delivered to the study site , the inventory at the study site, the distribution to each subject, and the 
return of materials to the Sponsor or designee for storage or disposal. These records should 
include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates, temperature log, and unique 
code numbers assigned to the product and study subject s. 
Administration of study drug will be supervised by study site personnel to ensure compliance. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subjects were provided 
with the correct study treatment bulk supply and reconcile the products received from the drug 
dispensing center. Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor or designee until 
accountability has been fully monitored through the end of the study. Study drug accountability 
will be assessed periodical ly by the assigned unblinded study monitor. 
9.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
 Prior and Concomitant Medications 
Subject s will be asked for all prior medications they  were taking up to 6 months before the study, 
up to the time of the first dose of study medication on Day 1. All prior medications will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Restricted prior therapies  are provided in Section  8.2.  
All medications and other treatments taken by the subject  during the study, including those 
treatments initiated before the start of the study, must be recorded on the eCRF. 
During the stud y (ie, from the time of screening visit until study completion), subject s will 
refrain from the use of any new concomitant medications without the specific prior approval of the investigator. The administration of any other concomitant medications during the study period is prohibited without the prior approval of the investigator unless its use is deemed necessary in a medical emergency. Any medication or therapy that is taken by or administered to

the dose, regimen, route, indication, dates of use, and time of use (only for concomitant 
medications used on an as- needed  [PRN]  basis) . 
After written informed consent is obtained from the subject , those subject s who are taking the 
following medications must have the minimum washout periods specified below and not take the medications for the duration of the study. 
• Within 5 half- lives  or 1 week , whichever is longer, before baseline ( Day -1), subjects  
could not have taken oral antipsychotic medications, MAO inhibitors, mood stabilizers (ie, lithium), anticonvulsants (eg, lamotrigine, Depakote), tricyclic antidepressants (eg, imipramine, desipramine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or any other 
psychoactive medications except for anxiolytics that were taken on an as needed basis 
(eg, lorazepam, chloral hydrate).  
• Subjects taking a long acting injectable antipsychotic could not have received a dose of medication for at least 12 weeks (24 weeks for INVEGA TRIN ZA
®). 
Note:  Please direct questions relating to prohibited medications to the Medical Monitor.  
 Concomitant Medication s for Anxiety and/or Sleep aid 
Subject s are allowed to take benzodiazepines (up to 6 mg lorazepam/day or equivalent) for 
anxiety, agitation , and insomnia on a PRN  basis . Subject s may also use non-benzodiazepine 
medications (eg,  zolpidem, zaleplon) as a sleep aid  also on a PRN  basis . Study sites must record 
the use of such medications in the eCRF on a per- administration basis and subject ’s source 
document. Note: Cognition testing should not be done within 8 hours of receiving a 
benzodiazepine or sleep medication.

d. A National Institute on Drug Abuse -5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or marijuana, phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be 
performed at screening and at Visit 2a (baseline) . If a subject leaves the study site , they should have a urine drug screen and test for alcohol (breathalyzer 
or urine  alcohol level) upon returning to the  study site .  
e. A complete physical examination includes body temperature (°C), general appearance,  head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examination of thorax and 
abdomen, assessment of cardiac, musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited neurolo gical  
examination.

h. ECG on Day 1 will be done at 2 hours + 15 minutes post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before blood withdrawal for 
any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and QTcF  (msec)  
measure ments should be obtained. 
i. Refer to  Table  3 for individual laboratory  tests.  For urinalysis, a urine dipstick will be performed at the site , and the sa mple will be sent to the central 
laboratory  in case of abnormalities.  
j. Optional COVID -19 test  may be performed at unscheduled visit s based on the Investigator’s discretion.  
k. Blood sample for prolactin must  be obtained before the morning dose of the study drug  at scheduled visits  (except at Visit 2a) . 
l. All subjects must have the following viral serology tests completed at Screening: anti -HCV antibody, HBV surface antigen, HBV c ore antibody, 
HIV- 1 antibody, an d HIV -2 antibody. If the subject tests positive for anti -HCV antibody, then HCV RNA via polymerase chain reaction should be 
performed to confirm or rule out active infection.  
m. Functional constipation inquiry: At specified visits, subject s will be asked whether they have experienced constipation (per the ROME III criteria and 
Bristol Stool Form scale ; see APPENDIX 2 ) since the last visit and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject  answers yes, 
sites are instructed to ask subject s to provide event date and ensure the event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant 
medication.  
n. If an eligible subject is not already an inpatient, the subject should be admitted to the inpatient  unit. 
o. Starting on Day 1, study drug is administered daily BID  (first dose of study will be administered in the morning of Day 1, and evening dose will be 
administered 12 ± 0.5 hours after the morning dose and after last PK sampling  [for Vi sits 5 and 8 ] is completed) , on an empty stomach  ie, at least 1  hour 
before a meal  or 2 to 3 hours after a meal by the study staff, with the last dose administered  on the morning of Visit 10 . All subject s must receive at 
least 4 dos ages of the 50/20  BID before dose escalation to  KarXT  100/20 BID.  
p. For Visit 5/Day 8 and Visit 8/Day 28, 7 PK blood draws are required: before the morning dose, and at 0.5 hour ± 5 minutes, 1 hour ± 5 minutes, 
2 hours  ± 10 m inutes, 4  hours ± 10 minutes, 8 hours ± 10 minutes, and 12 hours ± 10 minutes after the morning dose  (Note: The 12 -hour samples must 
be collected before administration of the evening dose). PK blood draws at Visit 5 must be drawn in relation to the first dose of KarXT 125/30  for 
subject s who are escalated  in the morning of Visit 5 /Day 8 -1/+2 days. PK blood must also be drawn in relation to the morning dose for subjects who 
are not escalated  at Visit 5 /Day 8 -1/+2 days . For Visit 10/ET, a single PK blood sample should be withdrawn before  discharge (preferably in the 
morning after the last dose of the study drug). One PK blood sample may also be drawn if a relevant/ significant AE is reported during a scheduled visit 
or if there is a dose adjustment or a relevant/significant AE reported du ring an unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). For an ET Visit that is related to 
an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and should be drawn before  discharge.  
q. MINI  should be performed before PANSS assessment.

10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing s are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2). Section  12.6 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessment s and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 2).  
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section 11 and include PANSS and CGI -S scores . 
Safety assessments are described in Section 12 and include spontaneous AEs; AESIs, 
procholinergic and anticholinergic symptoms ; cognition testing  (CANTAB) ; SAS; BARS ; 
AIMS ; body weight; BMI; waist circumference; orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory 
assessments (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and drug screen); prolactin 
levels ; physical examination ; and C- SSRS. 
PK assessments are described in Section 13 and include estimation of AUC , Cmax, and T max. 
The invest igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow  up or are  considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to the use of study drug. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  The assessments and procedures that may be  performed during an 
unscheduled visit are outlined in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2). Additional assessments 
can be performed as needed, at the discretion of the investigator , and after discussion with the

The Schedule of Assessments (Table 2) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.1 Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
The PANSS is a clinician -administered scale used for measuring s ymptom severity of subject s 
with schizophrenia and is widely used in the study of antipsychotic therapy[ 22]. The PANSS 
rating form contains 7 positive symptom scales, 7  negative system scales, and 16 general 
psychopathology symptom scales. S ubject s are rated from 1 to 7 on each symptom scale. The 
positive symptoms in schizophrenia are the excess or distortion of normal function such as 
hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity, and hostility, and the negative symptoms in schizophrenia 
are the diminution or loss of normal functions. It takes approximately 45 to 50 minutes to 
administer. PANSS total score is the sum of all scales  with a minimum score of  30 and a 
maximum score of 210. The PANSS assessment includes the Mard er Factor.  
It is recommended, if at all possible, that the PANSS assessment should be performed before all 
the other scale assessments  (except MINI at screening)  for all visits at which it is performed.   
11.2 Clinical Global Impression‒Severity 
The CGI -S is a rating scale  completed independently by a clinician  that is  used to measure illness 
and symptom severity in subject s with mental disorders. It is used to rate the severity of a 
subject’s i llness at the time of assessment. The modified CGI -S asks the clinician 1 question: 
“Considering your total clinical experience, how mentally ill is the subject at this time?”  The 
clinician’s answer is rated on the following 7- point scale: 1  = normal, not at all ill; 2  = borderline 
mentally ill; 3  = mildly ill; 4  = moderately ill; 5  = markedly ill; 6  = severely ill; 7  = among the 
most extremely ill subjects[ 23]. 
This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past 7 days.  As symptoms and behavior can fluctuate over a week, the score should reflect the 
average severity level across the previous 7 days.

Safety assessments ( spontaneous AEs; AESIs; pro cholinergic and anticholinergic symptoms ; 
cognition testing  [CANTAB ]; SAS; BARS ; AIMS ; body weight ; BMI ; waist circumference; 
orthostatic vital signs ; ECG ; clinical laboratory assessments [hematology, clinical chemistry, 
coagulation, urinalysis, prolactin , and drug screen]; physical examination ; and C- SSRS) are to be 
performed at protocol- specified visits, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2).  
12.1 Demographics, and Medical  and Psychiatric History  
Demographic data will be collected for all subjects at Screening.  The information to be captured 
includes date of birth (alternatively year  of birth if full date of birth is not allowed to be collected 
for legal reasons), age, sex, race and ethnicity , which will be obtained from the subject and 
recorded in the eCRF.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be recorded at screening. Investigators should document the 
occurrence, signs, and symptoms of the subject ’s preexisting conditions, including all baseline 
symptoms, ongoing illnesses, other chronic conditions, and surgical history at screening. Medical 
history will also include history of drug, substance, or alcohol abuse/dependence within 1 year 
before  Screening . 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs on the e CRF  in accordance with Section  12.7. All 
changes not present at baseline or described in the past medical history and identified as clinica lly noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Orthostatic vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate measurements) will be evaluated 
at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2). All vital signs will be measured 
supine and standing after 2 minutes. BP  measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the 
duration of the study. During treatment, beginning with Day 1 , orthostatic vital signs should 
occur 2 (±1) hours after morning dosing. Orthostatic vital signs are only required after the morning dose of the specified visit days, but additional orthostatic vital sign monitoring is allowed at the investigator ’s discreti on. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range BP or heart rate measurements will be repeated at the investigator’s 
discretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measure ments must be recorded as 
AEs.

A complete physical examination ( body temperature, general appearance, 
head/eyes/ears/nose/throat, examination of thorax and abdomen, assessment of cardiac, 
musculoskeletal, and circulatory systems, palpations for lymphadenopathy, and limited 
neurological examination ) will be performed at visits as specified in Table 2 . Physical 
examinations will be pe rformed by a physician  or qualified designee. 
12.4 Weight, Height, Body Mass Index, Waist Circumference 
Height (screening only), weight, and waist circumference measurements will be obtained at visits 
as specified in Table 2. BMI  should be calculated at these visits. All findings should be recorded 
in the eCRF.  
12.5 Electrocardiograms  
A 12- lead, resting ECG will be obtained at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2). During the ECG, ventricular rate (bpm), PR (msec), QRS (msec), QT (msec), and 
QTcF (msec) measurements will be obtained . ECG at Day 1 will be performed 2 hours 
(+ 15 minutes ) post morning dose. ECGs at all other scheduled visits will be performed before 
blood withdrawal for any safety laboratory tests and/or PK analysis. 
All the ECGs obtained will be interpreted by experienced independent blinded reader (s) at the 
central reading facility . 
At screening, the investigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that could 
exclude the subject  from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be re corded; if the 
ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented on the eCRF. ECGs will be 
repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.

Page  65 of 94 Blood and abnormal urine  (microsco pic analysis)  samples will be analyzed at a central 
laboratory facility. Urine samples will first be analyzed by dipstick  at the site.  If the results of the 
dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated, the sample will be sent to the central 
laboratory, and a microscopic analysis will be performed. All laboratory reports must be 
reviewed, signed, and dated by the investigator. A legible copy of all reports must be filed with both the subject ’s eCRF and medical record (source document) for that visit. Any laboratory test 
result considered by the investigator to be clinically significant should be considered an AE 
(clinically significant AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant 
abnormal values occurring during the study will be followed up with  until repeat test results 
return to normal, stabilize, or are no longer clinically significant.  
All the study subjects will be closely monitored for drug-induced liver toxicity, detailed in 
Section  12.7.5, during the study.  
Other Laboratory Assessments : 
A National Institute on Drug Abuse-5 urine drug screen (cannabinoids or m arijuana, 
phencyclidine, amphetamines, opiates, and cocaine) will be performed using a dipstick at 
screening  and at  Visit 2a (baseline) . 
Alcohol testing is performed using a breathalyzer or urine alcohol test.  
If a subject leaves the study site , they should have a urine drug screen test and test for alcohol 
(breathalyzer or urine alcohol test) upon returning to the study site . 
 Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics 
A blood sample may be collected at baseline (Day -1) for exploratory pharmacogenetic analy sis. 
Approximately 9 mL of blood may be collected for subsequent DNA extraction. The samples 
will be stored at a central laboratory facility, where DNA will be extracted and retained. The collection, storage, shipping, processing of the blood samples, and the analytical methods to be used will be detailed in the laboratory manual.  
The gene tic variants  to be analyzed may include SNPs and any other variants as deemed 
necessary by the Sponsor.

12.7 Adverse Events  
 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if present at screening, worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) present at screening will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these

Page  66 of 94 conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinica lly significant vital signs and laboratory abnormalities 
should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject  
enrolled in the study are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject ’s medical history.  
In accordance with the protocol, the investigator and/or study staff will elicit A Es and 
intercurrent illness during and at the end of the study period, and these will be recorded on the 
appropriate page of the eCRF. AEs  will be elicited by asking the subject a nonleading question, 
for example, “Have you experienced any new or changed  symptoms since we last asked?” The 
eCRF will be completed at the end of the study as soon as the results of the final laboratory tests 
are available.  
Each AE is to be documented on the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, severity, rel ationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented on the e CRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time immediately after the administration of study drug on Day 1  until the End of S tudy (Visit 10 
for subjects who roll over and Visit 11 for subjects who do not roll over to Study KAR -008 
study)  or early termination . Follow up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, 
is required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the investigator.  
When changes in the intensity of an A E occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). 
The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) , version 5.0 (Grades 1 through 5). 
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by intensity and relationship to study drug are given in Table 4 and Table 5. 
Table 4. Class ification of Adverse Events by Intensity  
MILD : An event that is easily tolerated by the  subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE : An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.

UNRELATED : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc).  
UNLIKELY : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the test  drug but for which 
no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be considered unlikely to be related to study drug if or when it 
meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of 
the test drug; (2) it could readily have been produced by the subject  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it does not follow a known pattern of 
response to the test drug; or (4) it does not reappear or worsen when the drug is readministered.  
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for whi ch a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administ ration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable te mporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction 
in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet 
drug-relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed drug eruptions, or tardive 
dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteris tics of the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pattern 
of response to the test drug. 
Abbreviation: AE, adverse event.  
 
 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The AESIs  will be monitored  and include o rthostasis  and liver function test elevations inclusive 
of DILI . 
AEs of special interest should be recorded as AEs and reported as SAEs when appropriate. 
 Serious Adverse Events  
A, SAE is any untoward medical occurrence, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing , nonworsening condition is not,

medical history o r physical examination page of the eCRF) , 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , and/or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitaliza tion, based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs  if they are 
thought to jeopardize the subject  and/or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes defining an SAE. S AEs are critically important for the identific ation of significant 
safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the investigator’s and the 
Sponsor’s assessment. If either the Sponsor or the investigator believes that an event is serious, 
the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 
 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
An SAE occurring from the time first dose of the study drug is administered , during the study, or 
within 1 week of stopping the treatment must be reported to the Catalyst Clinical Research  
Pharmacovigilance group and will be communicated to the Sponsor. Any such SAE due to any cause, whether or not related to the study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of occurrence 
or when the investigator becomes aware of the event . Notification can be made using email . 
Catalyst Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance email address  is:  
The event s must be recorded on the standard AE eCRF. Preliminary reports of SAEs must be 
followed up by detailed descriptions later on, including clear and anonymized photocopies of hospital case reports, consultant reports, autopsy reports, and other documents when requested and applicable. SAE reports must be made whether or not the investigator considers the event to be related to the investigational drug. 
Appropriate remedial measures should be taken to treat the SAE, and the response should be 
recorded. The inve stigator must report all additional follow -up evaluations to the Catalyst 
Clinical Research  Pharmacovigilance group within 24 hours of becoming aware of the additional 
information or as soon as is  practicable. All SAEs will be followed up until the investigator and 
Sponsor agree the event is satisfactorily resolved.  
Any SAE that is not resolved by the end of the study or upon discontinuation of the subject ’s 
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to baseline values (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures.

followed by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours of all 4 of the usual serum measures 
(ALT, AST, ALP, and total bilirubin) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing. An inquiry should be made about the sy mptoms 
(fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, and rash). 
• Close observation should be initiated with ALT or AST >3 × ULN:  
o Repeat liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests 2 or 3 times weekly. Frequency of retesting can decr ease to once per week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial 
drug has been discontinued, and the subject is asymptomatic. 
o Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
o Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets. 
o Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic hepatitis ; nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary 
tract disease.  
o Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents. 
o Obtain additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (eg, international normalized ratio, direct bilirubin). 
o Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations. 
• Discontinuation of treatment should be considered if: 
o ALT or AST >8  × ULN  
o ALT or AST >5  × ULN for more than 2 weeks 
o ALT or AST >3  × ULN and (total bilirubin >2 × ULN or international normalized 
ratio >1.5) 
o ALT or AST >3  × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right 
upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia (>5%) 
• Hepatic adjudication of cases should include an evaluation for alternative causes such as viral, autoimmune, alcohol, hepatobiliary disorders, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, concomitant medications, etc. 
• Follow up to resolution of elevated liver enzymes.  
• Gamma -glutamyl transpeptidase elevations alone should not prompt drug 
discontinuation. 
 Trial Discontinuation Criteria Other than DILI and Pregnancy  
12.7.6.1 Individual Stopping Criteria  
Based on NCI CTCAE v5.0, the study drug will be discontinued in any subject who has a 
≥ Grade 4 AE. Discontinuation or reduction in the dosage of the study drug for Grade 3 AEs, 
other than DILI AEs, (see Section 12.7.5) will be at the discretion of the investigator.  
12.7.6.2 Trial Stopping Rules  
The safety and tolerability aspects of KarXT will be overseen by an ISMC. The ISMC will meet periodically and review the unblinded data and will be responsible for advising the Sponsor on 
ways to s afeguard the interests of the clinical study subjects. The committee is expected to

Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities i n accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
•serious
•unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safety information in the IB or
package insert of generic trospium)
•there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the eventand the study treatment
The investigator will assess whether or not an event is causally related to study treatment. The 
Sponsor (or their designee Syneos Health) will consider the investigator’s assessment and 
determine whether the event meets the criteria for being reportable as a 7 -day or 15 -day safety 
report. SUSARs that are fatal or life -threatening must be reported to the regulatory authorities 
and the IEC/IRBs (where required) within 7 days after the Sponsor (or their designee) has first 
knowledge of them, with a follow-up report submitted within a further 8 calendar days. Other 
SUSARs must be reported to the relevant regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 
15 calendar days after the Sponsor (or their designee) first has knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor (or their designee ) is responsible for reporting SUSARs and any other events 
required to be reported in an expedited manner to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within 
specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within the applicable timeframes.

Page  71 of 94 should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures necessary to ensure a 
patent airway should be promptly provided. 
Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility : 
Trospium should be administered with caution to subjects with GI  obstructive disorders because 
of the risk of gastric retention. Trospium chloride, like other antimuscarinic agents, may decrease GI motility and should be used with caution in subjects with conditions such as ulcerative colitis, 
intestinal atony, and myasthenia gravis. 
Controlled Narrow- angle Glaucoma:  
In subjects being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma, trospium chloride should only be used if the potential benefits outweigh  the risks and in that circumstance only with careful monitoring. 
Central Nervous System Effects : 
Trospium chloride is associated with anticholinergic CNS effects. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including dizziness, confusion, hallucinations, and somnolence. Subjects should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise subjects not to drive or operate heavy 
machinery until they know how trospium chloride affects them. If a subject experiences 
anticholinergic CNS effects, dose reduction or drug discontinuation should be considered. 
Anticholinergic Adverse Reactions in Subjects with Moderate Renal Impairment : 
Trospium is substantially excreted by the kidney. The effects of moderate renal impairment on 
systemic exposure are not known but systemic exposure is likely increased. Therefore, anticholinergic adverse reactions (including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention) are expected to be greater in subjects with moderate renal impairment.  
Elevation of liver enzymes: 
Elevated liver enzymes have been reported in previous studies of xanomeline alone in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. It is notable , however, th at hepatic enzyme elevations were not 
observed in the Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers, and that the liver function test elevations observed in the Phase 2 schizophrenia study (KAR-004) with KarXT (a combination of 
xanomeline and trospium) were quite limited in contrast to the effects observed with xanomeline 
in the elderly Alzheimer’s population. Moreover, even in patients with  Alzheimer disease who 
experienced more hepatic enzyme elevations, the data demonstrate reversibility even with continued xanomeline treatment in those patients for whom there was sufficient follow -up data. 
Importantly, there were no Hy’s law cases or elevations in total bilirubin to a value of >2 ×  upper 
limit of reference range in either the xanomeline or KarXT datasets.

 Pregnancy  
WOCBP  must have a negative pregnancy test at screening. The investigator must notify the 
Sponsor (or designee) of any female subject or female partner of a male subject that becomes 
pregnant while participating in the study. Any known cases of pregnanc y in female subjects will 
be reported until the subject  completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be 
reported immediately by faxing/emailing a completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or 
designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; however, the investigator will follow-up with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy 
and must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion of the pr egnancy.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant, the investigator must withdraw her from the study without delay. The subject must not receive any further doses of the study drug . Upon discontinuation 
from the study, only those procedures that would not expose the subject  to undue risk will be 
performed.  
If the female subject or the female partner of the male subject is willing and able to consent to pregnancy follow -up, she will be followed until her pregnancy reaches term. Information 
regarding the pregnanc y must only be submitted after obtaining written consent from the 
pregnant partner. The investigator will arrange counseling for the pregnant partner by a specialist to discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  
The investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by submitting a follow -up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous 
or therapeutic abortion ( any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fet us is to be 
documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the investigator will report the event by faxing /emailing  a completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event. This event is co nsidered a n SAE.  
The investigator should also be notified of pregnancy occurring during the study but confirmed after completion of the study. In the event that a subject is subsequently found to be pregnant after inclusion in the study, any pregnancy will be followed to term, and the status of mother and child will be reported to the Sponsor after delivery.  
 Overdose  
The investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of any occurrence of overdose with study 
drug. Overdose should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care.

The AIMS is a rating scale that is used to measure involuntary movements know as tardive 
dyskinesia, which can sometimes develop as a side effect of long -term treatment with 
antipsychotic medications. It is a 12 -item scale to assess orofacial, extremity, and truncal 
movements as well as the overall severity, incapacitation, and the subject’s level of awareness of the movements. Items are scored from 0 (none) to 4 (severe). A higher score indicates more severe dyskinesia.  
12.12 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs (suicidal behavior 
and suicidal ideation) throughout the study[ 26]. The strength of this suicide classification system 
is in its ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over  identification 
of suicidal behavior. The scale take s approximately 5  minutes to administer. The C -SSRS will be 
administered by a trained rater at the site.  
This study will utilize 2  versions of the C-SSRS. At the screening visit, the “lifetime”  version 
will be completed; for all subsequent visits the “Since Last Visit” version of the C -SSRS will be 
administered.  
12.13 Functional Constipation Inquiry  
Constipation refers to bowel movements that are infrequent or hard to pass[ 27]. The stool is 
often hard and dry[ 28]. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, bloating, and feeling as if 
one has not completely passed the bowel movement[ 29]. The normal frequency of bowel 
movements in adults is between 3 per day and 3 per week[ 27]. Constipation will be defined per 
the Rome III criteria, as less than 3 bowel movements per week, APPENDIX 2  
(Longswreth,1486,C3)[ 30]. 
The Bristol Stool Form Scale has been correlated with a change in intestinal function, and had 
been shown to be a useful tool in clinical practice and research[ 31]. A sample Bristol Stool Form 
Scale is located in  APPENDIX 2 . 
As a measure of anticholinergic effects, at each visit  (except at Visit 2a) , subjects will be asked 
whether they have experienced constipation per the ROME III criteria since the last visit, and if yes, whether the constipation required intervention. If the subject answers yes, sites are 
instructed to ask subjects to provide event date and ensure event is documented as an AE and treatment is documented as concomitant medication. Subjects will not be required to collect and present their stool sample nor will clinic staff be required to corroborate the subject assessment. 
Additional attention can be given to other complaints as well including: straining with bowel 
movements, excessive time needed to pass a bowel movement, hard stools and pain with bowel movements secondary to straining, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, and the sensation of incomple te bowel evacuation[ 29,32 ].

Blood samples to assess the change in prola ctin levels will be obtained on Visit 2 a/Day -1, 
Visit 7/Day 21 ± 2 days, and Visit 10/Day 35 - 2 days/ Early Termination ( ET). At each of these 
visits  (except Visit  2a), blood sample must be collected before the morning dose of the study 
drug.

13.1 Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
 Blood Samples 
Blood samples for PK  analysis of KarXT levels will be collected at the time  points indicated in 
the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2).  Approximately 6 mL of blood to be collected at each 
scheduled time point. The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded.  
Serial blood samples to measure plasma concentrations of xanomeline and trospium will be 
obtained on Visit 5/Day 8 -1/+2 days (first dose of fixed titration period) and Visit 8/Day 
28 ± 2 days. Blood samples will be obtained at the following time  points on these days: 
PK Sample  Timing of Collection  Collection Window  
1 Before morning dose   
 After morning dose   
2 0.5 hours  ± 5 min  
3 1 hour  ± 5 min  
4 2 hours  ± 10 min  
5 4 hours  ± 10 min  
6 8 hours  ± 10 min  
7 12 hours after (but before the 
evening dose)  ± 10 min  
 
It is very important that the exact time of each PK draw and dosing times are recorded in the 
eCRF and that PK samples are collected within the specified times of collection.  
Should the use of visit windows be necessary, serial PK sampling must accompan y the actual 
day of potential dose escalation  for Visit 5.  
For Visit 8 , serial PK sampling is meant to capture the PK profile of the subject’s final KarXT 
dose level (125/30 or 100/20) after multiple doses. If visit windows are used for Visit 8, the PK 
sampling should occur at least 7 days after Visit 7 is completed , and there must be no changes in 
dose for at least 7 days leading up to Visit 8. PK sampling must accompan y the actual day of 
Visit 8. 
Note: A single PK sample should be drawn before  discharge (preferably in the morning after the 
last dose of the study drug ) at Visit 10/Day 35 -2 days or ET. In addition, one PK sample may  be 
drawn if a relevant/significant  AE is reported during a scheduled visit or if there is a dose 
adjustment or relevant/significant AE reported during an unscheduled visit (no multiple draws). 
For an ET Visit that is related to an AE, the collection of a PK blood sample is not optional and 
should be drawn before  discharge.

A SAP will be prepared after the protocol is approved. This document will provide further details 
regarding the definition of analysis variables and analysis methodology to address all study objectives.  The SAP will  serve as a compliment to the protocol and supersedes it in case of 
differences.  
The statistical evaluation will be performed using SAS
® software  version 9.4 or higher 
(SAS  Institute, Cary, NC). All data will be listed, and summary tables will be provided.  
Summary statistics will be presented by dose group.  For continuous variables, data will be 
summarized with the number of subject s (N), mean  and standard deviation, median, minimum, 
and maximum by treatment group.  For categorical variables, data will be tabulated with the 
number and proportion of subject s for each category by treatment group.  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming treatment difference of change from baseline in  PANSS total score  at Week 5 is  
8 points between drug and placebo  (standard deviation 16) , a sample size of approximately 
172 (86 evaluable subjects per arm) will result in a power of 90.3% for a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 
(P ≤ 0.05). With a dropout rate of 30%, a total of 246 subjects are estimated to be enrolled. 
14.2 Analysis Populations 
Intent -to-Treat Population  
All subjects who are randomized to the study will be included in the intent- to-treat ( ITT) 
population. 
Modified ITT Population  
All subjects who are randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, have a baseline PANSS 
assessment , and at least 1 post- baseline PANSS assessment will be included in the mITT 
population and will be used in the efficacy analysis. 
Safety Population 
All subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safety population 
and will be used in the safety analysis. 
PK Population  
All subjects who have an evaluable PK profile will be included in the PK population and will be 
used in the PK analysis. Subjects must have received at least 1 dose of active study drug and 
have at least 1 measurable plasma concentration of study drug.

total score will be evaluated first. The endpoints are set up as a hierarchical list and step down 
through the statistical testing of each endpoint using an alpha of 0.05. Statistical testing of 
change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, PANSS negative score, and PANSS 
Negative Marder Fa ctor score, CGI -S score at Week 5 , and percentage of PANSS responders 
will be performed only if the primary endpoint is significant at the 0.05 alpha level (P ≤ 0.05), and testing would continue through a pre-ordered list of key secondary efficacy endpoints. If at 
any point P > 0.05, then formal statistical testing would stop. This will control the overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested . Table 7  outlines the testing procedure.

14.4 Efficacy Analysis 
 Primary Estim and 
The population of the primary estimand is among adult inpatients (aged 18- 65 years) with a 
DSM -5 diagnosis of schizophrenia, confirmed by MINI for schizophrenia, who are acutely 
psychotic and hospitalized with PANSS score of 80 to 120 at time of enrollment, defined  
according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria . Subjects will receive flexible dose KarXT, whereby 
a subject receiving 100/20 (xanomeline 100 mg/trospium 20 mg) may be titrated upwards to 
KarXT 125/30 on Day 8. All subjects who are increased to 125/30 BID will have the option to 
return to KarXT 100/20, but may not change their dose after Visit 7 (Day 21) or decrease their dose for tolerability reasons more than once. The primary analysis will be executed on t he mITT 
population, including all subjects with a baseline and at least 1 post- baseline PANSS 
measurement, grouped as randomized. 
The variable is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at Week 5.

aid 
The population level summary is the difference between treatment groups (KarXT vs placebo) in 
mean change from baseli ne in PANSS at Week 5, obtained from a mixed model repeated 
measures (MMRM).  
Robustness of the estimand will be assessed through sensitivity analyses using alternative methods for handling of missing data and accounting for use of concomitant medications f or 
anxiety and/or sleep aid (eg , subgroup by use of concomitant medication  or including use of such 
concomitant medications as time -varying covariate in the MMRM) . 
 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in PANSS total score at 
Week 5. The difference between KarXT and placebo at Week 5  will be estimated using a n 
MMRM. The model will include the  change from baseline PANSS total scores at Week 2, Week 
3, Week 4 , and Week 5 as the response. Within -subject correlation will be accounted for using 
an unstructured covariance matrix. Fixed effects will include the treatment group  (KarXT  or 
placebo), visit, and the interaction between the treatment group and visit, s ite, age, sex , and 
baseline PANSS total score.  Low-enrolling sites may be pooled, if necessary, for modeling 
purposes. The algorithm for pooling sites will be specified in the SAP. 
Sensitivity analys es of the primary efficacy endpoint may be performed on an observed case 
basis,  using multiple imputation techniques, and classifying treatment dropouts as treatment 
failures. Alternative time -varying parameterizations of dose level and use of concomitant 
medication for anxiety and/or sleep aid may also be included in sensitivity ana lyses. In addition, 
alternative covariance matrices for the MMRM may be investigated. The sensitivity analyses of 
the primary endpoint will be specified in the SAP . 
 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The continuous secondary endpoints (change from baseline to Week 5 in PANSS positive score, 
PANSS negative score, PANSS Negative Marder Factor score, and CGI-S) will be analyzed in the same manner as the primary efficacy analysis (ie, using MMRM).  
The categorical secondary endpoint (percentage of PANSS re sponders at Week 5) will be 
compared between the treatment groups (KarXT  and placebo) using th e Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel test.  
The statistical analysis of the primary and key secondary efficacy variables will account for multiplicity by using a fixed sequen ce testing procedure. This testing procedure will control the 
overall Type 1 error rate across all hypotheses/endpoints being tested .

The data will be presented graphically via individual plots and mean plots summarized by actual 
treatment, visit, and time point.  
PK parameters for xanomeline and trospium will be derived from plasma concentration data 
using noncompartmental methods. Actual time elapsed from dosing will be used to estimate all 
individual PK parameters. The primary PK parameters of interest will include Cmax, Tmax, and 
AUC from 0 to 12 hours (or from 0 to the last measurable concentration ). Additional parameters 
(not limited to the following) such as the elimination half -life, clearance, and volume of 
distribution  will be determined if the data permit.  
The effect of dose on PK and other inferential analyses for exposure-response relationship may

15.2 Data Handling 
Any data to be recorded directly on the eCRFs (to be considered as source data) will be 
identified at the start of the study.  Data reported on the eCRF that are derived from source 
documents should be consistent with the source documents, or the discrepanc ies must be 
explained.  See also Section 15.3. 
Clinical data will be entered by site personnel on eCRFs for transmission to the Sponsor. Data on 
eCRFs transmitted via the web -based data system must correspond to and be supported by source 
documentation maintained at the study site, unless the study site makes direct data entry to the databases for which no other original or source documentation is maintained.  In such cases, the 
study site should document which eCRFs are subject to direct data entry and should have in place procedures to obtain and retain copies of the information submitted by direct data entry. 
All study forms and records transmitte d to the Sponsor must only include coded identifiers such 
that directly  identifying personal information is not transmitted.  The primary method of data 
transmittal is via the secure, internet- based electronic data capture (EDC) system maintained by 
Syneos Health.  Access to the EDC system is available to only authorized users via the study’s

Page  85 of 94 The investigator/institution should maintain adequate and accurate source documents and trial 
records that include all pertinent observations on each of the site’s trial  subjects . Source data 
should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Changes to 
source data should be traceable, not obscure the original entry, and be explained if necessary. 
Data recorded on source documents will be transcribed onto eCRFs. Copies of completed eCRFs 
will be provided to the Sponsor and the sites at the end of the study. The completed eCRFs will be retained by the investigator.  
15.4 Record Retention  
Study records and source documents must be preserved for at least 15 years after the completion or discontinuation of/withdrawal from the study, at least 2 years after the  drug  being studied has 
received its last approval for sale, or at least 2 years after the drug development has stopped, and 
in accordance with the appl icable local privacy laws, whichever is the longer time period. 
The investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the privacy of  subject  health information, including, but not limited to, the 
Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR, Parts 160 and 164 (the Health Insurance Po rtability Accountability Act of  1996 [HIPAA] Privacy Regulation). The 
invest igator shall ensure that study subject s authorize the use and disclosure of protected health 
information in accordance with HIPAA Privacy Regulation and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor. 
15.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored  according to the KAR -009 monitoring plan to ensure that it is 
conducted and documented properly according to the protocol, GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements. 
Monitoring visits , on-site and remote (telephone)  or a combination and contacts will be made at 
appropriate times during the study. The Principal Inv estigator will assure him/her and adequate 
site personnel are available throughout the study to collaborate with clinical monitors. Clinical 
monitors must have direct access to source documentation in order to check the completeness, 
clarity, and consistency of the data recorded in the eCRFs for each  subject. 
The invest igator will make available to the clinical monitor all source documents and medical 
records necessary to review protocol adherence and eCRFs . In addition, the invest igator will 
work closely with the clinical monitor and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the protocol, applicable regulations, and GCP  
guidelines.

The Sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities of 
this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, security, and reliability of the 
study data presented to the Sponsor lies with the invest igator generating the data.  
The Sponsor will arrange audits as part of the implementation of quality assurance to ensure that 
the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating procedures, 
GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Audits will be independent of and separate 
from the routine monitoring and quality control functions. Quality assurance procedures will be 
performed at study sites and during data management to assure that safety and efficacy data are 
adequate and well documented.  
15.7 Protocol Amendment and Protocol Deviation 
 Protocol Amendment  
Amendments to the protocol that entail corrections of typographical errors, clarifications of confusing wording, changes in study personnel, and minor modifications that have no effect on 
the safety of  subjects or the conduct of the study will be classed as administrative amendments 
and will be submitted to the IEC/ IRB for information only. Syneos Health  will ensure that 
acknowledgement is received and filed. Amendments that are classed as  substantial amendments 
must be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IECs/ IRBs for approval and 
will not be implemented at sites until such approvals are received other than in the case of an 
urgent safety measure. 
 Protocol Deviations 
Should a protocol deviation occur, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. Protocol 
deviations and/or violations and the reasons they occurred will be included in the clinical study report.  Reporting of protocol deviations to the I EC/IRB and in accordance with applicable 
regulatory authority mandates is an investigator ’s responsibility. 
All protocol deviations will be tracked in the Clinical Trial Management S ystem . Deviations 
considered major will be identified as such before study unblinding during medical monitor periodic review . 
Major protocol deviations will be tabulated including the frequency and percentage of subjects 
with each type of deviation by treatment group. 
15.8 Ethical Considerations 
This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the accepted version of the 
Declaration of Helsinki and/or all relevant federal regulations, as set forth in Parts 50, 56, 312, Subpart D, of Title 21 of the CFR; and in compliance with GCP  guidelines.

Page  92 of 94 APPENDIX 1. CONTRACEPTION GUIDELINES  
Female subjects of childbearing potential with a non -sterilized male sexual partner must agree to 
use at least 1 highly effective method of contraception (eg, hormonal or double barrier method of 
birth control, or intrauterine device) beginning >30 days before receiving study drug on Day 1 
and continuing until 30 days after the last dose of study drug. If oral contraceptives are used, the 
subject must have been on a stable dose for  6 months. 
A woman is considered to be WOCBP following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal, 
unless she is permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy[ 1]. Female subjects who are postmenopausal, which 
is defined as 12 consecutive months with no menses without an alternative medical cause, must 
have been postmenopausal for >1 year if they wish to not use contraceptives. Postmenopausal 
status  must be confirmed by a test of the subject’s follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level 
which must be elevated and consistent with postmenopausal levels (ie, >40 IU/L); otherwise, these subjects must agree to use contraceptives listed below. Female subjects  who are surgically 
sterile (ie, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) will not need to undergo the FSH level test. 
A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.  
Highly effective  methods of contraception are those that  have a failure rate of <1% (when 
implemented consistently a nd correctly) and include the following: 
•combined (containing estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with
inhibition of ovulation (administration  may be ora l, intravaginal, or transdermal)
•progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation(administration  may be o ral, injectable, or implantable)
•intrauterine device
•intrauterine hormone- releasing system
•bilateral tubal ligation or occlusion
•vasectomy (provided that the male has a medical assessment of surgical success)
All subject s will be strongly advised that they (or the female partners of male subject s) should 
not become pregnant before receiving study drug on Day 1 and continuing until 30 days after the 
last dose of study drug. A female subject will be advised that she must report immediately to the 
study site for pregnancy testing and appropriate management in the event that she may be pregnant.

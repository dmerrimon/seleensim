Name of Investigational Product:  lenalidomide 
Protocol Number:  CC-5013-CLL-002 
Protocol Title:  A PHASE 3, MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, 
PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, PARALLEL-GROUP  STUDY OF THE EFFICACY AND 
SAFETY OF LENALIDOMIDE (REVLIMID®) AS MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR 
PATIENTS WITH B-CELL CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA FOLLOWING SECOND-LINE THERAPY 
Indication: Maintenance therapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who ha ve achieved at least partial response (PR) to second-line 
therapy. 
Study Duration:  Subjects randomized to the lenalidomide 
treatment arm and on treatment at the time of Amendment #10 
may, at the discretion of the investigator, continue on 
lenalidomide study treatment until disease progression (PD) 
develops.  Subjects randomized to the placebo treatment arm 
and on treatment at the time of Amendment #10 will enter the survival follow-up period.  Subjects who discontinue study 
treatment prematurely for reasons other than PD and subjects 
who develop PD (including disease transformation) will enter 
the survival follow-up period.   
Subjects will be followed until all subjects in the study have 
been followed for at least 5 years from the last randomization, 
October 2020, (or have died/become  lost to follow-up before 
the 5 years).  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue 
lenalidomide treatment immediately and complete the 
Treatment Discontinuation assessme nt.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period.  Phase of development:  
Phase 3 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
x To compare the efficacy of lenalidomide versus  placebo maintenance therapy. 
Secondary: 
x To evaluate the safety of lenalidomide versus placebo maintenance therapy.

Study Design: 
CC-5013-CLL-002 is a phase 3, multicenter, ra ndomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study that will compare the efficacy and safety  of oral lenalidomide maintenance therapy to 
that of placebo in patients with B-cell CLL who ac hieved at least partial response (PR) with 
second-line therapy.  The primary efficacy objectiv e of this study is to demonstrate superiority 
of lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging overall survival (OS) due to continued therapy, for 
all subjects, including subjects with or without p oor prognostic factors, subjects of various ages 
and subjects with PR, nodular partial response (n PR), complete response with incomplete bone 
marrow recovery (CRi), complete respon se (CR) and minimal residual disease (MRD)-
negative CR.  All subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment arm, including those 
subjects who do not improve their response (P R, nPR, CRi or CR) and subjects who do not 
have the opportunity to improve their response further (MRD-negative CR) will be treated up 
to disease progression, with the objec tive to demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Eligible subjects must have been treated with a purine analog-, a bendamustine-, an anti-CD20-
antibody-, or a chlorambucil-based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved 
at least PR to second-line induction therapy of sufficient duration.  Alemtuzumab- containing 
regimens will also be allowed for those subj ects with 17p deletion.  Subjects who achieve 
stable disease (SD) only or w ho develop progressive disease (P D) at any time during induction 
therapy will not be eligible for participation in this study. 
Approximately, three hundred twenty (320) su bjects with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD-negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into two arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.5 mg 
daily on days 1-28 of the first 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose level is well tolerated, 
escalation to 5 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle is permitted starting with the 
second cycle; for those subjects who tolerate we ll the 5 mg dose, escalation to 10 mg daily on 
days 1-28 of each 28-day cycl e after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be permitted. 
Each treatment arm will be stratified according to 1) the response to second-line induction 
therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD-negative CR); 2 DJHYHUVXV!\HDUVDQG
3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, 
unmutated IgVH or ȕ0!PJ/ (Yes versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment arm will continue to receive 
lenalidomide study drug up to PD.  Subjects who di scontinue therapy, will enter the survival 
follow-up phase of the study.  Subjects will be a ssessed for subsequent CLL therapies, second 
primary malignancies, recovery from serious adverse events (SAEs), and any new SAEs or 
AEs related to study procedures or prior maintenance therapy.   
Subjects randomized to the placebo arm and currently on treatment at the time of Amendment 
#10 and patients who previously discontinued from the study drug and will be followed every 
24 weeks for survival, subsequent CLL therapie s, response to next therapy and progression

subjects in the study have been followed for at  least 5 years from the last randomization, 
October 2020 (or have died/become lost to follow-up before 5 years).  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment  will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
Screening 
Subjects will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study- related procedures. 
Screening assessments for protocol eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 : Schedule of Assessments.  Subjects who develop PD 
during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study. 
All subjects will undergo both bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy procedures 
during screening.  MRD status will be assessed by peripheral blood and bone marrow flow 
cytometry at entry into the study for those su bjects who achieved a complete response (CR) to 
second-line induction therapy.  Peripheral bl ood flow cytometry will be performed for all 
subjects at entry to confirm disease diagnosis by immunophenotyping and to perform immune 
cell (NK and T cell) analyses.  If subjects ente r the study with MRD negativity, the disease 
diagnosis will be confirmed based on prior fl ow cytometry (documentation needed).  MRD 
status, immunophenotyping, and immune cell an alyses will be performed at a central 
laboratory.   
A peripheral blood sample for direct antiglobulin  test (DAT) will be collected during screening 
and analyzed at a central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by FISH, IgV H mutational status , 
DQGȕ07KHȕ0WHVWZLOOEHSHUIRUPHGGXULQJVFUHHQLQJXVLQJ DSHULSKHUDOEORRGVDPSOH  
and analyzed at a central laboratory. 
FISH and IgV H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the 
interval between second-line therapy, and sc reening or during the screening period using a 
peripheral blood sample.  Because test results cannot be obtained during screening or between 
second line and screening in some subjects w ho achieve a good response due to the limited 
number of remaining CLL cells, we r ecommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably 
prior to second line or during second line.   Samples for FISH and IgV
H will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
If tests do not yield results, subjects can be ran domized and stratified base d on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not ob tainable pre-randomization and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately. 
During screening, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will also be performed for all 
subjects; in particular, they will be used to doc ument the status (PR or CR) of subjects entering 
the study.   
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event cannot be corrected within the 28  day screening period, the subject may be re-
screened; however, the CT scans and bone marr ow aspirate and biopsy will not need to be 
repeated if those tests were implemented w ithin 56 days prior to randomization and the 
subject’s clinical status remains the same.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 9 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  Randomization must occur no less than 8 weeks ( 56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (140 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second-line induction therapy received by the 
subject in order for the subject to be eligible fo r enrollment into this study.  Subjects meeting 
all eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) in  a double-blind manner to receive maintenance 
therapy with either lenalidomide or placebo up to disease progression.  The randomization 
procedure will be accomplished by a validated interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
Subjects will be stratified at randomization by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD-negative CR); 2) age ( YHUVXV!\HDUVDQG

Maintenance Therapy 
Study treatment for each subject begins on th e same day the subject undergoes randomization.  
Study visits and serial measurements of safety  and efficacy during maintenance therapy will be 
performed as outlined in Table 2 .  Lenalidomide is administered orally.  Subjects will receive 
lenalidomide 2.5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28  of the first 28-day cy cle.  If the 2.5 mg 
dose is well tolerated (subject does not expe rience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related 
toxicities or any other toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] found to be unacceptable by the investigator or 
the subject), subjects should be escalated startin g at the second cycle to 5 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle up to di sease.  If a subject develops a Grade 1 or 2 
adverse event, the drug may be interrupted until resolution, however the subject must complete 
one full cycle at the 2.5 mg dose level pr ior to escalation to the 5 mg dose level. 
Subjects who complete 5 continuous cycles at  the 5 mg dose level without experiencing any 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related to xicities and without experiencing any other toxicity (Grade 1 
or 2) found to be unacceptable by the investigator may be escalated to 10 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of each 28-da y cycle up to disease progression. 
Dose interruptions/reductions are permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the 
investigator’s discretion.  A guideline for th e reduction of the dose of lenalidomide for dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) is provided (see Section  10.2.1 ).  Dose re-escalation is permitted if the 
subject is able to complete 2 full cycles at the reduced dose level without experiencing a DLT 
or other toxicity deemed to be unacceptable by the investigator or subjec t.  In the event the 
dose reduction is implemen ted due to Grade 4 neutropenia, subjects may be re-escalated after 
one full cycle at the lower dose level if the neut ropenia resolves to a Grade 2 or better by the 
end of the cycle and no other DLT is observed.  If  that dose level is again not tolerated, the 
subject should be de-escalated to the dose below and remain at that tolerated dose level for the 
rest of the study. 
Subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treat ment arm will continue to receive study 
lenalidomide maintenance therapy until PD devel ops.  Progressive disease is characterized by 
at least one of the following: 
x Lymphadenopathy.  Progression of ly mphadenopathy discovered by physical 
examination.  Disease progression occu rs if one of the following events is 
observed: 
- Appearance of any new lesion such as HQODUJHGO\PSKQRGHV!FP
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates. 
- An increase by 50% or more in greatest  determined diameter of any previous

chronic lymphocytic leukemia (   The severity of AEs will be graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE) version 3.0 with modifications as noted in Section 10.2.1  of the protocol. 
Local hematology and chemistry tests will be performed for patient management/treatment 
decisions. 
Bone marrow aspirate and bi opsy specimens obtained from each  subject will be reviewed 
centrally prior to randomization. All repeat bon e marrow aspirate and biopsy assessment will 
be completed at the discretion of the investigators and assessed locally.  The bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy assessment is remove d as part of protocol amendment #10.   
The CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis w ill be performed for all subjects at baseline.  
All repeat CT scan assessment will be comple ted at the discretion of the investigator and 
assessed locally.  The CT scan assessment is removed as part of protocol amendment #10.  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatmen t will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
 
Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS), thromboembolism and infection and treatment 
of tumor flare reaction (TFR) 
TLS prophylaxis, comprising of oral hydration a nd allopurinol 300 mg/day will be initiated 3 
days prior to starting maintenance therapy and for a minimum of the first treatment cycle at 
each dose level for those subjects entering the st udy with a PR to their second-line induction 
therapy .  Subjects with a known alle rgy to allopurinol and a PR will be excluded from 
the study.  Please refer to Section 10.2.1  for further guidance on allopurinol modification in 
the event of an adverse event.  If a subject is  taking allopurinol for a condition other than for 
TLS prophylaxis, the subject should be conti nued on the allopurinol prescribed by their

reasons other than TLS prophylax is is discontinued and prop hylaxis is still required per 
protocol, the subject should be administered commer cial allopurinol.  To maintain fluid intake, 
subjects must be instructed to  drink 8 to 10 eight ounce (240 mL ) glasses of water each day for 
the first 14 days of Cycle 1 and the first cycle of  each dose escalation.  Hydration levels should 
be adjusted according to age and clinical status , and lowered if the subject’s cardiovascular 
status indicates the possibility of volume overload.   At the investigator’s discretion, allopurinol 
prophylaxis may be omitted for s ubjects entering the study with a CR; however subjects must 
be advised of the need for ad equate hydration as outlined above. 
Grade 1 TFR may be treated with non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ie, 
ibuprofen 400-600 mg orally every 4- KRXUVDVQHHGHGDQG7)5*UDGHVKRXOGEHWUHDWHG

Subjects will be monitored for TLS  and TFR on Days 1, 8 and 15 for cycle 1.  Monitoring for 
TLS and TFR will continue on every 28 days  thereafter and as clinically indicated. 
It is recommended that subjects receive low dose aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg) as prophylactic 
anti-thrombotic treatment while on study drug , however the use of aspirin should only be 
implemented after careful evaluation of the hemorr hagic risk and determination that the subject 
is at limited risk.  The investigator may use ot her anti-coagulation prophylactic therapies (ie, 
low-molecular weight (LMW) hepa rin, warfarin, etc.) at their discretion based on the subjects 
pre-disposing risk factors for thromboem bolism (ie, subjects with a history of a 
thromboembolic event and/or ta king a concomitant medication as sociated with an increased 
risk for a thromboembolic event and/or known hypercoagulable state regardless of 
thromboembolic history).

Please refer to Figure 1  for an overall summary of the study design. 
Analysis and Reporting: The final analysis on OS will be performed a nd reported when 160 subjects have died (ie, 
when full information necessary to have 80% power for OS is achieved). 
Data Monitoring Committee 
An external independent Data Monitoring Committ ee will evaluate safety and efficacy data in 
an ongoing, periodic manner to assess benefit-to-r isk considerations.  Since the study will be 
unblinded, the Data Monitoring Committee will not be utilized beginning with protocol 
amendment #10.  Safety reviews will be perfor med by Celgene annually for the remainder of 
the study. Response Adjudication Committee An independent Response Adjudication Committee will perform a blinded, independent 
assessment of response (including the developm ent of PD) prior to the interim analysis 
database lock. Since the placebo arm is discontinued, the Response Adjudication Committee 
will not be utilized beginning w ith protocol amendment #10. 
Number of planned subjects:  320 (160 subjects per treatment arm) 
Enrollment will close once 320 subjects are random ized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are 
reached, whichever comes first.

Efficacy: 
x Survival/Date of death 
Safety : 
x Clinical laboratory evaluations 
x Pregnancy testing 
  
x AEs by NCI CTCAE Version 3.0, with modifications recommended by the 
IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
 (Appendix  22.4 ) 
x Second primary malignancies will be monitore d as events of interest and should be 
included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are to report any second primary malignancies as serious 
adverse events regardless of causal relati onship to study drug, occurring at any 
time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the informed consent up 
to and including the su rvival follow-up phase  
  
  
  
Statistical Analysis: 
Overview: The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance therap y in subjects with relapsed or refractory B-
cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) having achieved PR or better after second-line 
therapy. Overall Survival (OS) will be the primar y endpoint for the study following protocol 
amendment #10. Sample Size:  
For OS, a 61.3% improvement in median surv ival from randomization, from 3 years for 
placebo to 4.84 years on lenalidomide is considered  clinically relevant.  The OS distribution is 
assumed to be exponential with a constant failure  (hazard) rate.  At the conclusion of the study 
a two-sided log-rank test with an overall signif icance level of 0.025 would have 80% power to 
detect a hazard rate ratio of 0.62. To ensure timely completion of the study, 320 subjects will 
be enrolled, 160 in each treatment arm.  Enrollment will close once 320 subjects are 
randomized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are reached, whichever comes first. 
Demographic, Disposition, Study Medication:    
The baseline characteristics of subjects enrolled in each arm will be summarized.  An 
accounting will be made of the study course fo r all subjects who received study drug for each 
arm and, in particular, the number of subjects  who expired or withdr ew during treatment will 
be specified and reasons for withdrawal categorized.  
Efficacy Analysis: Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population that includes all 
subjects randomized.

amendment #10. 
 
 
  
Safety Analysis: 
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of st udy medication will be included in the safety 
analyses. AEs, clinical laboratory information,  will be tabulated 
and summarized.  Subject incidence rates of a ll AEs (including serious, Grade 3, Grade 4, 
treatment-related [with and without discontinuation]  and events requiring the discontinuation 
of investigational product), will be tabulated by system class, pr eferred term, and severity using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA) terms and NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 
severity grades with modifications. (Section  10.2.1 ).  Time to first dose reduction will be 
summarized.  The adverse event of infection will also be analyzed according to the grading 
system as recommended by the IWCLL guidelin es for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL 
(Appendix  22.4). 
Death and clinically important AEs (including  tumor flare, tumor lysis, second primary 
malignancies, and thrombosis ) will also be summarized. 
All other measurements will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimum, and maximum.  Graphical displays will be provided where useful in the interpretation of results.

8.1. Overall Study Design  
CC-5013-CLL-002 is a phase 3, multicenter, ra ndomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study that will compare the efficacy and safety of oral lenalidomide maintenance therapy to that 
of placebo in subjects with B-cell CLL who achie ved at least partial resp onse (PR) with second-
line therapy.  The primary effi cacy objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of 
lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging OS due to continued thera py, for all subjec ts, including 
subjects with or without poor progn ostic factors, subjects of vari ous ages and subjects with PR, 
nodular partial response (nPR), co mplete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), 
complete response (CR), and min imal residual disease (MRD)-negative CR.  All subjects 
randomized to the lenalidomide ar m, including those s ubjects who do not imp rove their response 
(PR, nPR, CRi, or CR) and subjects who do not have the opportunity to  improve their response 
further (MRD-negative CR) will be treated up to  disease progression with the objective to 
demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment  will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discon tinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow-up period. 
Eligible subjects must have been  treated with a purine analog-, a bendamustine-, an anti-CD20 
antibody-, or a chlorambucil-based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved at 
least PR to second-line induc tion therapy of sufficient dura tion. Alemtuzumab- containing 
regimens will also be allowed for those patients  with 17p deletion.  Subjec ts who achieve stable 
disease (SD) only or who develop progressive disease (PD) at a ny time during induction therapy 
will not be eligible for pa rticipation in this study. 
Approximately, three hundred twenty (320) subj ects with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD-negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into tw o arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.5 mg 
daily on days 1-28 of the first cycle.  If the 2.5 mg  dose level is well tolera ted, escalation to 5 mg 
daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle is permitted  starting with the second cycle.  If a subject 
develops a Grade 1 or 2 adverse event, the drug may be interrupted until resolution, however the 
subject must complete one full cycle at the 2.5 mg  dose level prior to escal ation to the 5 mg dose 
level.  For those subjects who to lerate the 5 mg dose without un acceptable toxicity, escalation to 
10 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycle after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be 
permitted.  Each treatment arm wi ll be stratified according to 1) the response to second-line 
induction therapy (PR, nPR,  CRi or CR versus MRD- QHJDWLYH&5DJHYHUVXV!
years); and 3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 
17p deletion, unmutated IgV H or ȕ0!PJ/  (Yes versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment will continue to receive lenalidomide up 
to PD.  For those subjects who discontinue ther apy for reasons other than PD (ie, unacceptable 
toxicity) they will transition to the survival follow-up period.  
Subjects who discontinued from the study drug will be followed every 24 weeks for survival, 
subsequent CLL therapies, res ponse to next therapy and progre ssion following next therapy, and

followed for at least 5 years from the last randomization, Oc tober 2020, (or have died/become 
lost to follow up befo re 5 years).     
Screening: 
Potential study subjects will be screened for protocol eligibility within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 .  Please refer to Figure 1 . 
During the screening process for potentially prot ocol-eligible subjects, complete blood counts 
(CBCs), serum chemistries, thyroid function test s, quantitative immunoglobulin tests, a 12-lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG), physical exam to asse ss lymphadenopathies, the spleen and the liver, 
vital signs (with weight), East ern Cooperative Oncology Group (E COG) performance status, and 
evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be performed. Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates are to be perf ormed on all subjects at  screening.  A central 
review of the bone marr ow aspirate and biopsy specimens wi ll be performed to confirm disease 
status.  Subjects who develop PD during screening w ill not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
Peripheral blood will be sent to a central labora tory for flow cytometr y for all subjects for 
disease diagnosis confirmation (by immunopheno typing), to perform immune cell (NK and T 
cell) analyses and for subjects en tering the study with a CR for de termination of MRD status. If 
peripheral blood is MRD negative, a bone marrow flow cytometry will be implemented. If 
subjects enter the study with MR D negativity, the diseas e diagnosis will be confirmed based on 
prior flow cytometry (d ocumentation needed). 
A peripheral blood sample for a dire ct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be  collected and analyzed at a 
central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by FISH, IgV
H mutational status , 
DQGȕ07KHȕ0WHVWZLOOEHSHUIRUPHGGXULQJVFUHHQLQJXVLQJ DSHULSKHUDOEORRGVDPSOHDQG
analyzed at a central laboratory. FISH and IgV
H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the interval 
between second-line therapy and screening or during the screening period using a peripheral 
blood sample.  Because test results cannot be obtained during screening or between second line 
and screening in some subject s who achieve a good response du e to the limited number of 
remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably prior to 
second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory. 
If tests do not yield results, subjects can be rando mized and stratified ba sed on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not ob tainable pre-randomiz ation and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately. 
An additional peripheral blood sample will be collected at baseline and stored  at -70° at a central 
laboratory until the completion of the study; subject s will be re-consented if additional testing is 
to be performed. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest,  abdomen, and pelvis will be performed at 
baseline for all subjects to document the subject’s status (PR or CR).

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 46 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable ev ent that prevents randomization 
and the event cannot be corrected within th e 28 day screening period, the subject may be 
re-screened; however, the CT scans and bone marr ow aspirate and biopsy will not need to be 
repeated if those tests were implemented within  56 days prior to randomi zation and the subject’s 
clinical status remains the same. 
Females of childbearing potential  (FCBP) must have two negative pregnancy tests performed at 
the study site prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy. The first pr egnancy test will be performed 
within 10-14 days prior to ra ndomization and the sec ond test within 24 hour s prior to starting 
study drug.  FCBP must agree to birth control requirements as outlined in Appendix  22.6 during 
the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 
2) while participating in the st udy; and 3) at least 28 days af ter the treatment  discontinuation 
visit.  FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.  Males 
must commit to continued abstinence from hete rosexual contact or ag ree to use appropriate 
contraceptive methods during any sexual contact with FCBP during study participation and for at 
least 28 days following the treatment discontinuation visit as outlined in Appendix  22.6.  Male 
subjects must agree to abstain fro m donating blood, semen or sperm during  study participation 
and for at least 28 days after th e treatment discontinuation visit.  Subjects must be counseled 
about pregnancy precautions and the potential risk of fetal exposure. 
Randomization: Randomization must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (140 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by the subject 
in order for the subject to be eligible for enrollment into th is study.  Subjects meeting all 
eligibility criteri a will be randomized (1:1 ) in a double-blind fash ion to receive either 
lenalidomide or placebo.  The randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated 
interactive voice response system (IVRS) (see Section  10.1.1). Subjects will be stratified at 
randomization by: 1) their respons e to second-line induction thera py (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus

mg/L (Yes versus No versus Unknown).   
Maintenance Therapy: 
Study treatment for each subject begins on the same day the subject undergoes randomization.  
Lenalidomide is administered orally.  Subjects will receive lenalidomide 2.5 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerated (subject does not 
experience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related toxicities or any ot her toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] 
found to be unacceptable by the investigator or the subject), subjects should be escalated starting 
at the second cycle to 5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle up to disease 
progression.  If a subject develops a Grade 1 or  2 adverse event, the drug may be interrupted 
until resolution, however the subject  must complete one full cycle at the 2.5 mg dose level prior 
to escalation to the 5 mg dose level. 
Subjects who complete 5 conti nuous cycles at the 5 mg dose level without experiencing any 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related toxicities and wi thout experiencing any other toxicity (Grade 1 
or 2) found to be unacceptable by the investigator  may be escalated to 10 mg once daily on Days 
1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle up to disease progression.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 47 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  Dose de-escalation to 7.5 mg from 10 mg and to  5 mg from 7.5 mg and to 2.5 mg from 5 mg and 
to 2.5 mg every other day from 2.5 mg will be pe rmitted for those subj ects who experience a 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related toxicity or a ny other Grade 1 or 2 toxicity found to be 
unacceptable by the investigator or subject. 
Dose interruptions are also permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the investigator’s 
discretion.  A guideline for the re duction of the dose of lenalido mide for dose-limiting toxicity 
(DLT) is provided (see Section 10.2.1). Dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject is ab le to complete 2 full cy cles at the reduced dose 
level without experiencing a DLT or  other toxicity deemed to be  unacceptable by the investigator 
or subject.  In the event the dos e reduction is implemented due to  Grade 4 neutropenia, subjects 
may be re-escalated after one full cycle at the lo wer dose level if the neutropenia resolves to a 
Grade 2 or better by the end of the cycle and no other DLT is observed.  If that dose level is 
again not tolerated, the subject should be de-escalated to the dose below and remain at that 
tolerated dose level for the rest of the study. 
Study visits and serial measuremen ts of safety and efficacy will be performed as outlined in 
Table 2 . 
Females of childbearing potenti al must have a pregnancy te st (conducted by the study site) 
within 24 hours prior to star ting study drug; the subject ma y not receive study drug until the 
Investigator has verified that the pregnancy test is negative. Pregnancy testing for FCBP will 
continue throughout the study as outlined in Table 2 and Appendix  22.6.   
Counseling regarding blood, eggs and ovum donation, and contraceptive use and the potential 
risks of fetal exposure should be performed as outlined in Appendix 22.6. 
FCBP should be monitored during the course of the study and afte r the end of st udy therapy to:  
x Ensure that pregnancy tests are performed during the course  of the study and after end 
of study therapy and are negative (see specifics in Appendix  22.6).  
x Ensure the subject continues to practi ce abstinence or remains on adequate 
contraception (see specifics in Appendix  22.6).  
If a FCBP becomes pregnant, treatment should be stopped and the subj ect referred to the 
appropriate physician. 
Male subjects should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of study 
therapy to: 
x Ensure they commit to continued abstinence  from heterosexual cont act or continue to 
use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP. 
x If a f
emale partner of a male  subject becomes pregnant she should be referred to the 
appropriate physician. 
CBCs will be monitored on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cy cle 1, on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter, and 
at the treatment disconti nuation visit.  In the event of Grad e 4 hematologic toxicity, monitoring 
of CBCs will continue weekly until resolution to grad e 3 or better.  It is recommended to utilize 
myeloid and erythroid growth fact ors as per the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)

If a subject develops Grade 4 neutropenia or th rombocytopenia, the drug will be withheld until 
the toxicity has recovered to Grade 3 or better.  The drug may then be restarted at  one dose level 
lower.  If the treatment has been  withheld and the next cycle is  delayed beyond 29 days after day 
1 of the prior treatment cycle, then day 1 of the next treatment cycle will be defined as the first 
day that the treatment is resumed. 
Serum chemistries will be performed on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, on Day 1 of each cycle 
thereafter, and at the treatme nt discontinuation visit.   
Scheduled laboratory studies (CBCs, chemistries) w ill be sent to the site’s local laboratory for 
analysis purposes.  The DAT test must be repeated if the invest igator suspects haemolytic anemia and will be 
analysed centrally during the course of the study. 
ECOG Performance Status will be measured at the treatment discontinuation visit. 
Evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be pe rformed at the treatment discontinuation visit. 
Vitals signs will be monitored at the treatment discontinuation visit.  A physical examination to 
assess in particular lymphadenopathies, spleen and liver will be performed at the treatment 
discontinuation visit. 
An ECG will be performed at the treatment discontinuation visit. 
Investigators will assess subjects for response every 28 days and at the treatment discontinuation 
visit.  Investigators will pr ovide an assessment of CR (MRD-n egative or MRD-positive), CRi, 
nPR, PR, and PD based on laboratory, physical ex am, and if appropriate local assessments for 
CT scan findings, flow cytometry and bone ma rrow aspirate and biops y.  To confirm a CR, 
subjects must have mainta ined no evidence of disease IRU 8 weeks and PR must be maintained 
IRU 8 weeks as per the Intern ational Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) 
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatme nt of chronic lym phocytic leukemia ( Hallek, 2008 ).   
FCBP must have a pregnancy test at the treatment discontinuation visit. 
Subjects will receive study maintenance thera py until PD develops; any disease transformation 
will need to be documented by lymph node biops ies for Richter’s syndrome and percent of 
peripheral blood or bone marrow pr olymphocytes for prolymphocytic leukemia.  Progressive 
disease is characterized by at least one of the following: 
x Lymphadenopathy.   Progression of ly mphadenopathy discovered by physical

10.1. Description of Study Drug 
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg  capsules for oral 
administration.  Subjects dose reduced to 7.5 mg dose level (as outlined in Section  10.2.1 ) will 
receive one 5.0 mg capsule and one 2.5 mg capsule daily. 
Study drug will be packaged in bottles containing  study capsules for 28 days.  Subjects assigned 
to active treatment will receive 28 days of active drug (with the exception of those subjects de-
escalated to 2.5 mg every other day).   
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply b linded allopurinol 300 mg  and matching placebo 
(Amendment #10). 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment immediately.  
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply lenalidomide (Amendment #11). 
10.1.1. Randomization 
Randomization will be accomplished by an IV RS to ensure timely registration and 
randomization.  Designated resear ch personnel at the investiga tional sites will be assigned 
password protected, coded identifi cation numbers, which gives them authorization to call into the 
IVRS to enroll subjects.  The system will present a menu of questions by which the research 
personnel will identify the subj ect and confirm eligibility. Wh en all questions have been 
answered, including questions regarding the result s of pregnancy tests for FCBP, the IVRS will 
assign a subject number  and study drug to the eligible subject. IVRS will fax a confirmation of 
registration and drug assignment for each subject to  the site and Celgene.   Subjects will be 
randomized (1:1) to receiv e lenalidomide or placebo.  Subjects will be stratified at randomization 
by: 1) their response to second-line induc tion therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus

reductions or escalations, and at discontinuation fro m treatment.  Confirmation of each call will 
be faxed to the site. 
10.2. Treatment Assignments 
Lenalidomide  
Oral lenalidomide 2.5 mg capsule once daily on Da ys 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle.  
If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerate d, subjects should be escalate d starting at the second cycle 
to 5 mg capsule once daily on Days 1 through 28 of  each 28-day cycle to disease progression.  
If a subject develops a Grade 1 or 2 advers e event, the drug may be interrupted until 
resolution, however the subject must complete one full cycle at  the 2.5 mg dose level prior to 
escalation to the 5 mg dose level.

If the treatment has been withhe ld and the next treatment cycl e is delayed beyond 29 days after 
Day 1 of the prior treatment cycle, then Day 1 of the next treatment cycle will be defined as the 
first day that the treatment is re sumed.  If dose reduction occurs with in a cycle, subjects will be

unused drug prior to ne w drug being dispensed. 
Dose re-escalation is permitted if the subject is ab le to complete 2 full cycles at the reduced dose 
level without experiencing a DLT or  other toxicity deemed to be  unacceptable by the investigator

16.1. Statistical Overview 
The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance th erapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leuke mia (CLL) having achieved PR or better afte r second-line 
therapy. 
Overall survival (OS) will be the primary e ndpoint for the protocol following amendment #10.  
This analysis will be performed at the completion of the study.  It is estimated that at least 160 
subjects across both treatment arms  have died at the time of an alysis (yielding 80% power to 
detect a 61.3% improvement in me dian OS for a two-sided test at 0.025 level allowing for one 
interim analysis).   
16.2. Study Population Definitions 
16.2.1. Intent-to-Treat Population 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed  on the intent-to-trea t (ITT) population, which 
will include all subjects  who were randomized. 
16.2.2. Safety Population 
All randomized subjects who receive any study dr ug will be included in the safety analyses. 
16.2.3. Subgroup Analyses 
In addition to analyses that include all subj ects, analyses will be performed to compare 
treatments within the following stratification subgroups: 
x Response to second-line induction ch emotherapy (PR, CRi or CR versus 
MRD-negative CR) 
x $JH\HDUVYHUVXV!\HDUV 
x Presence of at least one of the follow ing poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p 
deletion, unmutated IgV H or ȕ0!PJ/  (Yes versus No versus Unknown) 
Additional subgroups may be examined, as needed  based on regulatory and clinical requests. 
16.3. Efficacy Evaluation 
16.3.1. Primary Endpoint 
Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival is calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  OS will 
be censored at the last date that  the subject was known to be alive for subjects who were alive at 
the time of analysis and for subjects who were  lost to follow-up before  death was documented. 
Lenalidomide (CC-5013) 
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 80 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  The analysis of OS will include survival inform ation for all randomized subjects.  Subjects who 
discontinued from the treatment phase of th e study and who had possibly received other 
anti-cancer therapies and then subsequently died  will be included in the analysis as death.  
However, sensitivity analyses will be performed in which these subjects will be censored at the 
date of the first dose date of the anti-cancer therapy. 
16.3.2. Secondary Endpoint 
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2) 
PFS is defines as the time from randomization to the second objective di sease progression, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients alive and for whom a second objective 
disease progression has not been observed should be  censored at the last time known to be alive 
and without second objective dise ase progression.  In situations where OS and PFS2 cannot 
reliably be determined, it may be  possible to rule out significant lack of efficacy of further 
treatments by looking at the outcome  of the next line therapy.  Fo r this analysis, an event is 
defined as second objective dis ease progression, or death from any cause, or the start of the CLL 
therapy after next line trea tment, whichever occurred first (EMEA guideline 13 DEC 2012).  
Various schemes will be assessed for missing data imputation if needed. 
16.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Kaplan-Meier product limit methods will be used to  estimate the survivor ship functions for the 
time-to-event endpoints (eg, OS, and PFS2).  A two- sided log-rank test stratified by the 3 strata 
used in the randomization will be used as the pr imary analytic method to compare survivorship 
functions for time-to-event variables in the 2 tr eatment groups.  In term s of the survivorship 
functions for each treatment group, the hypotheses of interest were: 
H0:  F A(t) =  F P(t) for all t 
Versus 
H1:  F P(t)  FA(t) for all t 
where F P is the survivorship function for placebo and F A is the survivorship function for 
lenalidomide. Median OS will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier  estimates, and the 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) will be computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  Hazard ratio will be 
calculated using Cox model strati fied for the 3 strata (ie, response to second-line induction 
chemotherapy, age, and presence of  at least one prognostic factor) to account for the stratified 
randomization.  The Cox model will also be used to identify prognostic factors. 
Cross-tabulations will be provided by treatment group to summar ize improvements from the best 
response during induction therapy. 
16.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Subjects’ age, weight, height, and other conti nuous demographic and baseline variables will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), 
while performance status, gender, race, and othe r categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately and pooled over both treatment

(MedDRA) classification system. The severity of the toxicities will be graded according to the 
NCI CTCAE version 3.0 whenever possible. The adverse event of infection will also be analyzed according to the grading system as 
recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL  
(Appendix  22.4). 
AE frequency will be tabulated by body system, MedDRA preferred term for each treatment 
regimen during the Treatment Phase.   In the by-subject analysis, a subject having the same event 
more than once will be counted only once.  AEs will be summarized by worst NCI CTCAE 
version 3.0 grade.  AEs leading to death or to discontinua tion from treatment, ev ents classified as 
NCI CTCAE version 3.0 Grade 3 or higher, study-drug-related events, serious adverse events 
(SAEs), and events of interest (including s econd primary malignancies) will be summarized 
separately. 
Laboratory data will be graded  according to NCI CTCAE versi on 3.0 severity grade.  Cross 
tabulations will be provided to summarize frequencies of abnormalities. 
For vital sign and body weight data, means, medians, standard deviations, minimum, and 
maximum values will be provided. 
Graphical displays will be provi ded where useful to assist in the interpretation of results.

16.9. Sample Size and Power Considerations 
For OS, a 61.3% improvement in median survival  from randomizati on, from 3 years for placebo 
to 4.83 years on lenalidomide is c onsidered clinically relevant.  The OS is assumed to be 
exponential with a constant failure (hazard) ra te.  When the total number of events is 
approximately 160 over both treatme nt arms, then a two-sided l og-rank test with an overall 
significance level of 0.025 (allowi ng for one interim analysis) would have 80% power to detect a 
hazard rate ratio of 0.62 (that is, if the surviv al curves are exponential, to detect a 61.3% 
difference in the median OS in  the 2 arms). To ensure time ly completion of the study, 320 
subjects will be enrolled, 160 in each treatment ar m.  Enrollment will close once 320 subjects are 
randomized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are reached, whichever comes first.

Confidential and Proprietary 83 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  17. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
17.1. Monitoring 
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring proc edures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  Before the study is initiated at a site vi sit or at an investigator  meeting, all aspects of 
the study are reviewed with the investigator(s) and th e staff.   Prior to en rolling subjects into the 
study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining 
informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs with the Investigator(s).  Monitoring 
will include on-site visits with the Investigator(s ) and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, fax, or telephone.  At each  monitoring visit, the facilities, study drug 
storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representati ve for adherence to the protocol and Good 
Clinical Practice. 
The monitor will review CRFs for completion and accuracy.  Accuracy will be checked by 
performing source data verification at each site vi sit that is a direct comparison of the entries 
made onto the CRF against the appropriate sour ce documentation.  Any resulting discrepancies 
will be reviewed with the Investig ator(s) and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be 
made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the Investigator(s) and/or his/her staff. Monitoring 
procedures require that informed consents, a dherence to inclusion/ex clusion criteria, and 
documentation of SAEs and the proper recording be verified.  Additional monitoring activities 
may be outlined in a stud y-specific monitoring plan. 
17.2. Audits and Inspections 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene.  From time to time, representatives of this unit will conduct audits of 
clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene standard operating procedures (SOPs) to 
evaluate compliance with Good Clinical  Practice guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator(s) is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs, and applicable supporting records of subject part icipation for audits 
and inspections by Institutiona l Review Board/Independent Ethic Committees (IRB/IECs), 
regulatory authorities (eg, FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  The Investigator(s) should make every effort to be  available for the audits and/or inspections.  If 
the Investigator(s) is contacted  by any regulatory authority re garding an inspection, he/she 
should contact Celgene immediately . 
17.3. Investigator(s) Responsibilities 
Investigator responsibilities ar e set out in the International Conference on Harm onisation (ICH) 
guideline for Good Clinical Practi ce and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  Celgene or a 
representative will contact and select all principal investigators or co-investigators who in turn 
will select their staff.  The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant records to 
confirm the above. 
Lenalidomide (CC-5013) 
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 84 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  The Investigator(s) is responsib le for keeping a record of a ll subjects who sign an Informed 
Consent Form and are screened for entry into the study.  For those subjects who fail screening, 
the reason(s) for exclusion must be recorded in the subject’s s ource documents and in the IVRS 
system. 
No procedure/assessment/measurement/test other than those outlined here, or in the schedule of 
study assessments, is to be perfo rmed without the prior written approval of Celgene, or unless 
deemed by the investigator(s) as necessary for the subject’s medica l care.  Investigator(s) and/or 
authorized designee(s) must en ter study data onto CRFs supplied by Celgene.  The data on the 
CRF will be recorded in an anonymous manner to protect the subject’s id entity by using a unique 
identifier that will prevent pe rsonal identifiable information. 
The Investigator(s), or a designate d member of the Investigators’ st aff, must be available at some 
time during monitoring visits to re view data and resolve any queries  and to allow direct access to 
the subject’s records (eg,  medical records, office charts, hospit al charts, and study related charts) 
for source data verification.  The CRFs must be completed as soon as possible after the subject’s 
visit but no later than prior to  each monitoring visit and be made available to the Celgene 
representative(s) so that the accura cy and completeness may be checked.

18.1. Institutional Review Board/Indepe ndent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval 
The protocol for this study has been designed in  accordance with the general ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki ( Appendix 22.2).  The review of this protocol by the 
IRB/IEC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for 
obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance with princi ples enunciated in the 
declaration, as well as ICH Guide lines, Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 
50 Protection of Human Patients a nd Part 56 Institutional Review Boards.  Before implementing 
this study, the protocol, the proposed informed c onsent form and other in formation to subjects, 
must be reviewed by a properly constituted In stitutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC).  A signed and dated statemen t that the protocol and informed consent 
have been approved by the IRB/IEC must be give n to Celgene before the study initiation.  The 
names and occupations of the chairman and the members of the IRB/IEC must be supplied to 
Celgene. 
The Investigator(s) will be res ponsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant 
IRB/IEC and obtaining written appr oval for this study.  The approva l will be obtained prior to 
the initiation of the study. A copy of the IRB/IEC approval for the protocol and the Informed Consent is to be provided to 
Celgene. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the date of 
approval, protocol number and version, or amen dment number. 
The Investigator(s) is responsible  for notifying the IRB/IEC of a ny serious deviations from the 
protocol, or anything el se that may involve a dded risk to subjects. 
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by 
Celgene and the IRB/IEC prior to use. 
18.2. Protocol Amendments 
Any amendment to this protocol  that seems appropriate, as th e study progresses (eg, affects 
safety or efficacy) will be agreed upon between the coordinating and/or principal investigator(s) 
and the Celgene study physician.  Amendments wi ll be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written 
approval before the implementati on of the amended version.  Th e written signed approval from 
the IRB/IEC should refer specifically to the investigator(s) and to the protocol number and title and mention any amendment numbers that are applicable.  Celgene does not require that 
amendments that are administrative in nature re ceive IRB/IEC approval, but will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC for information purposes.  If loca l IRB/IEC procedures require approval of 
administrative amendments, then study sites should follow local IRB/IEC regulations. 
18.3. Informed Consent 
The Investigator(s) must obtain in formed consent of a subject or  his/her designee prior to any 
study related procedures as per Good Clinical Pr actices (GCP) as set forth in the 21 CFR Parts 
50 and 56 and ICH guidelines.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 86 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  Documentation that informed cons ent occurred prior to the subject ’s entry into the study and of 
the informed consent process should be recorded in the subject’s so urce documents.  The original 
consent form, signed and dated by the subject a nd by the person consenting the subject prior to 
the subject’s entry into the study, must be mainta ined in the Investigator’s study files and a copy 
given to the subject.  In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the 
informed consent, the informed  consent must be revised.  Su bjects participating in the study 
when the amended protocol is imp lemented must be re-consented w ith the revised version of the 
informed consent.  The revised consent form signed and dated by the subject and by the person 
consenting the subject must be maintained in th e Investigator’s study f iles and a copy given to 
the subject. 
18.4. Patient Confidentiality 
Celgene affirms the patient’s righ t to protection against invasion of privacy. In compliance with 
United States federal regulations, Celgene requ ires the Investigator(s) to permit Celgene’s 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or othe r regulatory authorities 
to review and/or copy any medical records releva nt to the study in accordance with local laws. 
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the 
patient’s statement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator(s) to obtain 
such permission in writing fro m the appropriate individual.

19.1. Data/Documents 
The investigator(s) must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distribution of the study drug, CRFs, source documents, original documents, data, 
records (eg, hospital records; c linical and office charts; laborat ory notes; memoranda; patient’s 
diaries or evaluation checklists ; pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from automated 
instruments; copies or transcriptions certified  after verification as being accurate copies; 
microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x-rays ; patient files), and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at  the laboratories, and at medi co-technical departments involved 
in the clinical study are complete, accurate , filed and retained. 
19.2. Data Management 
Data will be entered into the clinical databa se as per Celgene SOPs. These data will be 
electronically verified through use of on-line checks during da ta entry, and through programmed 
edit checks specified by the clinical team.  Disc repancies in the data will be brought to the 
attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of a 
Data Clarification Form (DCF).  Resolutions to th ese issues will be reflected in the database.  An 
audit trail within the system will track all change s made to the data.  A quality control audit will 
be performed per Celgene SOP(s). 
19.3. Retention of Records 
The investigator(s) must  maintain records of all study doc uments and supporting information 
relating to the conduct of the study.  This documentation include s, but is not limited to, 
protocols, case report forms, advertising for s ubject participation, advers e event reports, subject 
source data, correspondence with he alth authorities and IRBs/IECs, informed consent forms, 
investigator(s) curricula vitae,  monitoring visit logs, laborator y reference ranges, laboratory 
certification or quality control pro cedures, and laboratory director cu rriculum vitae.  Subject files 
and other source data must be kept for the ma ximum period of time pe rmitted by the hospital, 
institution or private practice specified below.  The study monitor must be consulted if the 
investigator(s) wishes to assign the study files to  someone else, remove th em to another location 
or is unable to retain th em for a specified period. 
For studies conducted in the United States under a US Investigational New Drug (IND), the investigator(s) must retain the study records for a minimum of 2 ye ars after a marketing 
application for the indication is  approved or for 2 years afte r the IND is withdrawn.  If no 
application is filed, or if the a pplication is not approved for the indication, the records are to be 
retained for two years after the investigation (ie, the IND) is discontinued, and FDA is notified of 
that fact.  For IND studies c onducted outside the US, the inves tigator(s), must retain study 
records for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, whichever is longer.  The monitor will inform the investigator(s) of the dates for retention.  All 
study documents should be made available if requi red by relevant health au thorities.  For studies 
not conducted under the US IND, the investigator(s ) records must be retained until at least 2 
years after the last approval of a marketing ap plication in an ICH regi on and until there are no

22.1. Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, uninten ded, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.  It may be a new 
intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illn ess, an injury, or any concomitant impairment 
of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), 
regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to study treatment and that 
remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE.  If there is a worsening of that 
medical condition, this should be considered an  AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be 
recorded on the AE page of the electronic Case Report Form rather  than the individual signs or 
symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All AEs will be recorded by th e Investigator(s) from the time of signing of informed consent 
form to 30 days after the treatment discontin uation visit.  All AEs that lead to study 
discontinuation should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  AEs will be recorded on the 
AE page of the CRF and in th e subject’s source documents. 
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events An abnormal laboratory value is  considered to be an AE if  the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following: 
x Results in discontin uation from the study. 
x Requires treatment, modification/interrupt ion of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention. 
x Is judged by the Investigator(s) to be  of significant clin ical importance. 
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of  the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. 
Please note that all Grade 3 hematologic lab ab normalities must be re ported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which: 
x Results in death 
x Is life-threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator[s] the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
x Requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of  existing hospitalization 
x Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to condu ct normal life functions) 
x Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 95 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  x Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are de fined as those occurrences that  may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hos pitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical inte rvention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether such an AE should be 
considered serious. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of intere st and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary mali gnancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the dur ation of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up 
period.  In this study, subjects will be followed un til all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least 5 years from the la st randomization, October 2020  (or have died/become lost to 
follow-up before 5 years).  Events of second pr imary malignancy are to  be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be cons idered an “Important Medical Ev ent” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be docum ented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Docu mentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory 
histology or cytology results).    Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitaliza tions which: were planned before entry into the 
clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its 
treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless 
fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied 
indication and are not associated wi th any deterioration in condition. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page s of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action ta ken regarding study drug, and outcome. 
Classification of severity For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) mu st assess the severity of the event. 
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE, Vers ion 3.0) with the 
exceptions recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia   AEs will be evaluated for severity according to the 
following scale: 
Grade 1 = Mild Grade 2 = Moderate 
Grade 3 = Severe 
Grade 4 =  Life Threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 =  Death

Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in 
patients receiving lenalidomide. During the conduct of CC-5013- CLL-002, all Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities will be repo rted to Celgene Drug Safety as SAEs at the discretion of the 
investigator and recorded in the CRF as SAEs , however those that are not deemed by the 
investigator to be  part of a diagnosis or syndrome will not reported to the Health Authorities in 
an expedited manner.  Laboratory values will be captured within the study database and will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by th e sponsor and (provided that it is determined that any 
observed individual abnormalit ies or patterns of abnormali ties do not warrant prompt 
communication to Health Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in periodic safety 
reports. 
Please note that all Grade 3 hematologic lab ab normalities must be re ported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Classification of Relationship/Causality of  adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug 
The Investigator(s) must determine the relations hip between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below: 
Not suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or 
remote, or other medications, ther apeutic interventions, or 

Lenalidomide (CC-5013) 
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 97 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  underlying conditions provide a su fficient explanation for the 
observed event 
Suspected: The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other 
medications, therapeutic interven tions, or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient expl anation for the observed event.  
Monitoring and reporting of adverse events 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the followi ng parameters: the subject’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, 
pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical examination findings; or other 
appropriate tests and procedures. 
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events  
Any AE that meets the criteri on for a SAE requires the comple tion of a SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to ensure 
that the data on these forms is accurate and cons istent.  This applies to all SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, that occur during th e study, those made known to the Investigator(s) 
within 30 days after a subject’s  treatment discontinuation visit,  and those made known to the 
investigator(s) at anytime that are su spected of being related to study drug. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of intere st and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary mali gnancy, regardless of causal 
relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the dur ation of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up 
period.  In this study, subjects will be followed un til all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least 5 years from the last randomization, October 2020 (or have died/become lost to 
follow-up before 5 years).  Events of second pr imary malignancy are to  be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be cons idered an “Important Medical Ev ent” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be docum ented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Docu mentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory 
histology or cytology results).    
Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in 
patients receiving lenalidomide.  The investigat or will use their judgeme nt to classify the 
seriousness of laboratory abnormality events.  La boratory values will be captured within the 
study database and will be reviewed on an ongoing  basis by the sponsor and (provided that it is 
determined that any observed individual abnormalities or pa tterns of abnormalities do not 
warrant prompt communication to Heath Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in 
periodic safety reports. 
The SAE must be reported (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
the Celgene Safety by facsimile.  An initial writ ten report (prepared by th e Investigator(s) using 
the SAE Report Form provided by Celgene) is to be faxed to the Safety Monitor (see below for 
contact information).

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 98 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  The SAE report should provide a detailed descrip tion of the SAE and incl ude copies of hospital 
records and other relevant documen ts.  If a subject has died and an autopsy has been performed, 
copies of the autopsy report a nd death certificate are to be sent to Celgene as soon as these 
become available.  Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, and 
sent to Celgene. 
The Investigator(s) is respons ible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing th em with all relevant initial and follow-up 
information about the event. Th e Investigator(s) must keep c opies of all SAE information, 
including correspondence with Ce lgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s pa rticipation in the study must be followed until 
either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/res olves with sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a 
baseline value is available). 
Pregnancies 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnanc ies (including a positive pregnanc y test regardless of age or 
disease state) of a female subject or  the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the 
subject is on study drug, or within  28 days of the treatment disc ontinuation visit, are considered 
immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be discontinue d immediately and the subject 
instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to the i nvestigator(s).  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test mu st be reported to the Celgene Safety Monitor 
immediately by facsimile using the SAE Report Form. The female should be referred to an obstetr ician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further ev aluation and counseling. 
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subj ect until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Safety of the outco me of the pregnancy as a follow -up to the initial SAE report. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital an omaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [i ncluding that in an aborted 
fetus]), the Investigator(s) shoul d follow the procedures for repor ting SAEs (ie, report the event 
to Celgene Safety by facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigat or’s knowledge of the event). 
In the case of a live “normal” birth, the Celg ene Safety Monitor should be advised by telephone 
and facsimile within 24 hour s of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. 
All neonatal deaths that occur w ithin 30 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the In vestigator(s) suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be  reported to Celgene Safety by 
facsimile within 24 hours of the Inves tigators’ knowledge of the event. 
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by the Investigator(s) and the Celgene Medical 
Monitor. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events

22.6.1. Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan 
22.6.1.1. Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation  Plan for Celgene Clinical Trials 
Appendix  22.6.1 applies to all patients receiving lenalidomide therapy.  The following 
Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan documen ts are included in this appendix:  
1) Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth 
Control Methods (Section 22.6.2);  
2) Lenalidomide Education and Couns eling Guidance Document (Section  22.6.2.1);    
3) Lenalidomide Information Sheet (Section  22.6.2.2). 
 
1. The Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods document (Section  22.6.2 ) provides the following 
information: 
x Potential risks to the fetus associ ated with lenalidomide exposure 
x Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential

Acceptable Birth Control Methods 
Risks Associated with Pregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally rela ted to thalidomide.  Thalidom ide is a known human teratogenic 
active substance that causes severe life-threaten ing birth defects. An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that le nalidomide produced malformations  in the offspring of female 
monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect  of lenalidomide in 
humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk mi nimization plan to prev ent pregnancy must be 
observed. Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a se xually mature woman who: 1) has 
not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oopho rectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive m onths (ie, has had menses at  any time in the preceding 24 
consecutive months). Counseling 
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomid e is contraindicated unl ess all of the following 
are met (ie, all females of childbearing potenti al must be counseled concerning the following 
risks and requirements prior to the st art of lenalidomide study therapy):  
x She understands the potential tera togenic risk to  the unborn child 
x She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks 
before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, 
dose interruption and 28 days af ter the end of study treatment 
x She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
x She is informed and unders tands the potential conseque nces of pregnancy and the 
need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy 
x She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is 
dispensed following a negative pregnancy test 
x She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol (Section 22.6.2 ) 
x She acknowledges that she understands th e hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide 
The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential: 
x Complies with the conditions for pr egnancy risk mini mization, including 
confirmation that she has an ad equate level of understanding 
x Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 117 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  For a female NOT of childbeari ng potential, lenalidomide is c ontraindicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbe aring potential must be counseled concerning 
the following risks and require ments prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
x She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide 
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet 
the following conditions (ie, a ll males must be counseled co ncerning the following risks and 
requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy): 
x Understand the potential teratoge nic risk if engaged in sexua l activity with a pregnant 
female or a female of  childbearing potential 
x Understand the need for the use of a condom  even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant  female or a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (F CBP) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact during the following time periods related to this study:  1) for at least 28 days before 
starting study drug; 2) while partic ipating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) for at least 
28 days after study trea tment discontinuation. 
The two methods of reliable c ontraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) me thod. FCBP must be referred  to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive methods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:   
x Highly effective methods: 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants) 
 Tubal ligation 
 Partner’s vasectomy 
x Additional effe ctive methods: 
 Male condom 
 Diaphragm 
 Cervical Cap 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasin g intrauterine systems are associ ated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregula r vaginal bleeding. Proph ylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.

Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensiti vity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of chil dbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below. 
Before starting study drug Female Patients: 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (s ensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the 
start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study drug.  The patient may not rece ive study drug until the study doctor has verified 
that the results of these pr egnancy tests are negative. 
Male Patients: 
Must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a 
pregnant female or a female of  childbearing potential while participating in the study, during 
dose interruptions and for at least 28 days fo llowing study drug disconti nuation, even if he has 
undergone a successful vasectomy. During study participation and for 28 days following study drug discontinuation  Female Patients:
 
x FCBP with regular or no mens trual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly 
for the first 28 days of study participation and then ever y 28 days while on study, at 
study discontinuation, and at day 28 fo llowing study drug discontinuation. If 
menstrual cycles are irregular , the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 
28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 
14 and 28 following study drug discontinuation. 
x At each visit, the Investigator must confir m with the FCBP that she is continuing to 
use two reliable methods of birth control. 
x Counseling about pregnancy precautions a nd the potential risk s of fetal exposure 
must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in a study pa tient, study drug must be immediately 
discontinued.  
x Pregnancy testing and counseli ng must be performed if a pa tient misses her period or 
if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abnormal.  Study drug treatment 
must be discontinued during this evaluation.
 
x Females must agree to abstain from breastf eeding during study pa rticipation and for 
at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation. 
Male Patients: 
x Counseling about the requirement for comp lete abstinence or condom use during 
sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential and the

baby.   Lenalidomide is similar to the medicine thalidomide. It is known that thalidomide 
causes life-threatening birth de fects.  Lenalidomide has not been tested in pregnant 
women but may also cause birth defects.  Findings from a monkey study indicate that 
lenalidomide caused birth defects in the offs pring of female monkeys who received the 
drug during pregnancy.   
If you are a female who is able to become pregnant: 
x Do not take study drug if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant 
x You must practice complete abstinence or  use two reliable, separate forms of 
effective birth control at the same time:   for 28 days before starting study drug 
 while taking study drug 
 during dose interruptions of study drug 
 for 28 days after st opping study drug  
x You must have pregnancy testing done at the following times: 
 within 10 to 14 days and again 24 hours prior to the first dose of study drug 
 weekly for the first 28 days 
 every 28 days after the first month or  every 14 days if you have irregular 
menstrual periods 
 if you miss your period or have  unusual menstrual bleeding 
 28 days after the last dose of study drug (14 and 28 days after the last dose if 
menstrual periods are irregular) 
x Stop taking study drug if you become pregnant during treatment 
 If you suspect you are pregnant at any time during the study, you must stop study 
drug immediately and immedi ately inform your study docto r.  Your study doctor 
will report all cases of pregnancy to Celgene Corporation 
x Do not breastfeed while taking study drug

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 124 CC-5013-CLL-002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018  x The study doctor will be able to advise you where to get additional advice on 
contraception.    
If you are a female not of childbearing potential: 
In order to ensure that an unborn baby is not exposed to lenalidomide, your study doctor 
will confirm that you are not able to become pregnant.   
If you are a male: 
Lenalidomide is detected in trace quantities in human semen. The risk to the foetus in 
females of childbearing poten tial whose male partner is  receiving lenalidomide is 
unknown at this time. 
x Male patients (including those who have had a vasectomy) must  practice complete 
abstinence or must use a condom during sexua l contact with a pregnant female or a 
female that can become pregnant:  While you are taking study drug 
 During dose interruptions of study drug 
  
 For 28 days after you stop taking study drug 
x Male patients should not donate sperm or semen  while taking study drug and for 
28 days after stopping study drug. 
x If you suspect that your partner is preg nant any time during the study, you must 
immediately inform your study doctor. The study doctor will report all cases of 
pregnancy to Celgene Corporation. Your partner should call their healthcare provider immediately if they get pregnant.   
2. Restrictions in sharing study  drug and donating blood:  
x Do not share study drug with other people . It must be kept out of the reach of 
children and should never be given to any other person. 
x Do not donate blood while you take study drug and fo r 28 days after stopping study 
drug. 
x Do not break, chew, or open study drug capsules.  
x You will get no more than a 28-day supply of study drug at one time. 
x Return unused study drug capsules to your study doctor.   
Additional information is provi ded in the informed consent form and you can ask your study 
doctor for more information.

Confidential and Proprietary 13 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 adverse events (SAEs) , and any new SAEs  or AEs  related to study procedures or prior 
maintenan ce therapy .   
Subjects randomized to the placebo arm and current ly on treatment at the time of Amendment 
#10 and patients who previously discontinued from the study drug and will be followed every 
24 weeks for survival, subsequent CLL therapies, response t o next therapy and progr ession 
following next therapy, and second primary malignancies.  Subjects will be followed until all 
subjects in the study have been followed for at least 5 years from the last  randomization, 
October 2020 (or have  died/become lost to follow -up before 5 years) .  
Amendment #11:  
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period.  
Screening  
Subjects will sign informed consent prior to undergoing any study-related procedures. 
Screening assessmen ts for protocol eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 : Schedule of Assessments.  Subjects who develop PD 
during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
All subject s will undergo both bone marrow aspirate and bone marrow biopsy procedures 
during screening.  MRD status will be assessed by peripheral blood and bone marrow flow cytome try at entry into the study for those subject s who achieved a complete response (CR) to 
second -line induction therapy.  Peripheral blood flow cytometry will be performed for all 
subject s at entry to confirm disease diagnosis by immunophenotyping and to per form immune  
cell (NK and T cell)  analyses.  If subject s enter the study with MRD negativ ity, the disease 
diagnosis will be confirmed based on prior flow cytometry (documentation needed) .  MRD 
status, immunophenotyping, and immune cell analyses will be performed at a central 
laboratory.    
A peripheral blood sample for direct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be collected during screening and analyzed at a central laboratory.  
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for cytogenetics by  FISH, IgV
H mutational s tatus , 
and β2M.  The β2M test will be performed during screening using a peripheral blood sample and analyzed at a central laboratory . 
FISH and IgV
H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second lin e, in the 
interval between second -line therapy , and screening  or during the screening period using a 
peripheral blood sample .  Because test results can not be obtained during screening or between 
second line and screening in some subjects who achieve a good response due to the limited number of remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV
H tests preferably 
prior to second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  
If tests d o not yield results, subjects can be randomized and stratified based on historical data.  
Those subjects for whom results were not obtainable pre-randomization and for whom no historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately.  
During screening, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will also be performed for all subject s; in particular, they will be used to document the  status (PR or CR) of subject s entering 
the study.    
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event can not be corrected within the 28 day screening period, the subject may be re -

Confidential and Proprietary 14 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 screened; however, the CT scans and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will not need to be 
repeated if those tests were implemented within 56 days prior to randomization and the 
subject ’s clinical status remains the same.  
Randomization 
Randomi zation must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (1 40 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by the 
subject  in order for the subject  to be eligible for enrollment into this study.  Subject s meeting 
all eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) in a double -blin d manner to receive maintenance 
therapy with either lenalidomide or placebo up to disease progression.  The randomization 
procedure will be accomplished by a validated interactive voice response system (IVRS).  
Subjects will be stratified at randomization by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD-negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 
3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, 
unmutated IgVH or  β2M > 4.0 mg/L (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).    
Maintenance Therapy 
Study treatment for each subject  begins on the same day the subject  undergoes randomization.  
Study visits and serial measurements of safety and efficacy during  maintenance therapy will be 
performed as outlined in Table 2 .  Lenalidomide is  administered orally.  Subject s will receive 
lenalidomide 2.5  mg once daily on Days 1 through 28  of the first 2 8-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg 
dose is well tolerated  (subject does not experience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related 
toxicities or any other toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] found to be unacceptable by the investigator or the subject), subjects should be escalated starting at the second cycle to 5 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle  up to disease  progression or  
  If a sub ject develops a Grade 1 or 2 adverse event, the drug may be 
interrupted until resolution, however the subject must complete one full cycle at the 2.5 mg dose leve
l prior to escalation to the 5 mg dose level.  
Subject s who complete 5 continuous cycles at the 5 mg dose level without experiencing any 
Grade 3 or  4 study drug-related toxicities  and without  experiencing any other toxicity (Grade 1 
or 2)  found to be unacceptable by the investi gator may be escalated to 10 mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle  up to disease progression   
 
Dose interruptions/reductions are permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the inves tig 
ator’s discretion.  A guideline for the reduction of the dose of lenalidomide for dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT) is provided (see Section 10.2.1).  Dose re-escalation is permitted if the 
subject  is able to complete 2  full cycles at the reduced  dose level without experiencing a DLT  
or other toxicity deemed to be unacceptable by the investigator or subject .  In the event the 
dose reduction is implemented due to G rade 4 neutropenia, subjects may  be re-escalated after 
one full cycle at the lower dose level if the neutropenia resolves to a Grade 2 or better by the end of the cycle and no other DLT is observed.  If that dose level is again not tolerated, the subject  should be de -escalated to the dose below and remain at that tolerated dose level for the 
rest of the study.  
Subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment  arm will c
 ontinue to receive study  
lenalidomide  maintenance therapy until PD develops   
  Progressive disease is characterized by at least one of the following:  
• Lymphadenopathy.   Progression of lymphadenopathy discovered by physical 
examination .  Disease progression occurs if one of the following events is 
observed:  

Lenalidomide (CC -5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 15 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 - Appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infilt rates.  
- An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site.   
• An increase in the previously noted enlargement of the  liver or spleen by 50% or 
more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.  
• An increase in the nu mber of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least 
5,000 B lymphocytes per μL. 
• Transformation to a more aggressive histology ( eg, Richter’s syndrome).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by lymph node biopsy.  
• Occurrence of cytopenia (neu tropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) attributable to 
CLL 
• During therapy:  cytopenias may occur as a side effect of many therapies and 
should be assessed according to Table 4 .  During therapy, cytopenias cannot be 
used to define disease progression.  
• Post treatment :  The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune 
cytopenia), as documented by a decrease of hemoglobin levels by more than 2 
g/dL or to less than 10 g/dL, or by a decrease of platelet counts by more than 50% or to less than 100,000/μL, which occurs at least 3 months after treatment, defines disease progression, if the marrow biopsy demonstrates an infiltrate of clonal CLL cells. 
Tumor response, including PD, will be assessed according to the International Workshop on 
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia .  The severity of AEs will be graded according to 
the National Cancer Institute  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE) version 3.0 with modifications as noted in Section 10.2.1  of the protocol.  
Local hematology  and chemistry  tests will be performed for patient management /treatment 
decisions. 
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens obtained from each subject will be reviewed 
centrally prior to randomization. All repeat bone marrow aspirate and biopsy assessment will 
be completed at the discretion of the investigators and assessed locally.  The bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy assessment is removed as part of protocol amendment #10.   
The CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be performed for all subjects at baseline.  
All repeat CT scan assessment will be completed at the discretion of the investigator and assessed locally.  The CT scan assessment is removed as part of protocol amendment #10.   
Amendment #11:  
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subjects will then 
transition to the survival follow -up per iod. 
 
Prophylaxis for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS ), thromboembolism and infection and treatment 
of tumor flare reaction (TFR)  
TLS prophylaxis, comprising of oral hydration and allopurinol 300 mg/day will be initiated 3 
days prior to starting  maintenance therapy and for a minimum of the first treatment cycle  at 

Lenalidomide (CC -5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 16 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 each dose level  for those subjects entering the study with a PR to their second -line induction 
therapy .  Subjects with a known allergy to allopurinol and a PR  will be excluded from 
the study.  Please refer to Section 10.2.1 for further guidance on allopurinol modification in 
the event of an adverse event.  If a subject is taking allopurinol for a condition other than for 
TLS prophylaxis, the subject should be continued on the allopurinol prescribed by their 
physician and the dose titrated to 300 mg/day.  If, at any time, the allopurinol being taken for 
reasons other than TLS prophylaxis is  discontinued and prophylaxis is still required per 
protocol, the subject should be administered commercial allopurinol.  To maintain fluid intake, 
subject s must  be inst ructed to drin k 8 to 10 eight ounc e (240 mL)  glasses of water each day for 
the first 14 days of Cycle 1 and the first cycle of each dose escalation .  Hydration levels should 
be adjusted according to age and clinical status, and lowered if the subject’s cardiovascular status indicates the possibility of volume overload.   At the investigator’s discretion, a llopurinol 
proph ylaxis may be omitted for subj ects entering the study with a CR;  however subjects must 
be advised of the need for  adequate hydration as outlined above.  
Grade 1 TFR may be treated with n on-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (ie, 
ibuprofen 400-600 mg orally every 4-6 hours as nee ded) and TFR ≥ Grade 2 should be treated 
with corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subjects experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tumor flare.  
Subjects will be monitored for TLS and TFR on Days 1, 8 and 15 for cycle 1.  Monitor ing for 
TLS and TFR will continue on every 28 days thereafter and as clinically indicated.  
It is recommended that subjects receive low dose aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg) as prophylactic anti-thrombotic treatment while on study drug, however the use of aspirin should only be 
implemented after careful evaluation of the hemorrhagic risk and determination that the subject is at limited risk.  The investigator may  use other anti -coagulation prophylactic therapies (ie, 
low-molecular weight ( LMW) heparin, warfarin, etc .) at their discretion based on the subjects 
pre-disposing risk factors for thromboembolism (ie , subjects with a history of a 
thromboembolic event and/or taking a concomitant medication associated with an increased risk for a thromboembolic event and/or known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboembolic history).  
Aspirin should be interrupted if the platelet count drops below 50,000/μL.  
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in patients with neutropenia.  In addition, 
subjects who were on prophylactic treatment for infection while on alemtuzumab therapy 
should continue prophylactic treatment for at least 6 months following the discontinuation of alemtuzumab therapy and can be enrolled into the study while continuing prophylactic therapy.  Subjects with an active infection requiring systemic antibiotics and subjects with a systemic 
infection that has not resolved > 2 months prior to initiating lenalidomide treatment in spite of adequate anti-infective therapy are excluded from entering the st udy. 
Treatment and Dose Modification for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS)  
Subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the Cairo -Bishop 
definition and grading system should be treated as follows:  
• Subjects must be hospitalized for ≥ G rade 1 TLS.  For laboratory TLS, hospitalization 
is left to the investigator’s discretion. 
• The following should be provided:  vigorous hydration and appropriate  therapy  (ie, 
rasburicase where available ) as needed to reduce hyperuricemia, until correction o f 
electrolyte abnormalities.  
• In cases of laboratory TLS and Grade 1 TLS, lenalidomide will be continued at the 
same dose without interruption or dose reduction.  Dose escalation to the next

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 17 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 consecutive dose level will be permitted when laboratory TLS is re solved and Grade 1 
TLS is resolved to Grade 0.  
• Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 TLS will have their dose interrupted and will resume 
lenalidomide at the next lower dose when electrolyte abnormalities are corrected (ie, 
Grade 0) as specified in the Dose Modification  and Interruption section of the protocol.  
If lenalidomide is resumed prior to the start of the subsequent cycle, a chemistry test should be performed every other day for the first week following initiation of lenalidomide. 
• When those subject s that have been dose reduced complete two  full cycle s without 
meeting criteria for laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS or experiencing toxicities, re -
escalation to their maximum dose level or to the next higher dose level is permitted. 
A total of 320 subject s will be enro lled ( 160 subject s/treatment arm) in order to detect a 61.3% 
improvement  (hazard ratio of 0.6 2) in median OS and PFS in the lenalidomide treatment group 
compared to placebo -treated subject s with 80% statistical power (see Section 16).   Enrollment 
will close once 320 subjects are randomized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are reached, 
whichever comes first.  
Please refer to Figure  1 for an overall summary of the study design.  
Analysis and Reporting:  
The final analysis on OS will be  performed and reported when 160 subject s have died (ie, 
when full information necessary to have 80% power for OS is achieved).  
Data Monitoring Committee  
An external independent Data Monitoring Committee will evaluate safety and efficacy data in 
an ongoing, periodic manner to assess benefit -to-risk considerations.  Since the study will be 
unblinde d, the Data Monitorin g Committee will not be utilized beginning with protocol 
amendment #10.  Safety  reviews will be performed  by Celgene annually for the remainder of 
the study.  
Response Adjudication Committee  
An independent Response Adjudication Committee will perform a blinded, independent assessment of response (including the development of PD)  prior to the interim analysis 
database lock . Since the placebo arm is  discontinued, t he Response Adjudication Committee 
will not be utilized  beginning with protocol amendment #10.  
Number of planned subjects:  320 (160 subject s per treatment arm) 
Enrollment will close once 320 subjects are randomized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are 
reached, whichever comes first.

Confidential and Proprietary 21 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11 Final:  16 March 2018 Assessments:  
Efficacy: 
• Survival/Date of death  
Safety : 
• Clinical laboratory evaluations  
• Pregnancy testing  
  
• AEs by NCI CTCAE Version 3.0, with modifications recommended by the 
IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  (Appendix 22.4 ) 
• Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and should be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are to report any second primary malignancies as serious 
adverse events regardless of causal relationship to  study drug, occurring at any 
time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the informed consent  up 
to and including the survival follow -up phase  
  
  
  
Statistical Analysis: 
Overview: The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance therapy in subject s with relapsed or refractory B -
cell chronic lymphocytic l eukemia (CLL) having achieved PR  or better after second-line 
therapy.  
Overall Survival (OS) will be the primary endpoint for the study following protocol 
amendment #10.  
Sample Size:  
For OS, a 61.3 % improvement in median survival from randomization, from 3 years for 
placebo to 4.84 years on lenalidomide is considered clinically relevant.  The OS  distribution is 
assumed to be exponential with a constant failure (hazard) rate.  At the conclusion of the study  
a two -sided log-rank test with an overall significance level of 0.025  would have 80% power to 
detect a hazard rate ratio of 0.62 . To ensure timely completion of the study, 320 subject s will 
be enrolled, 160  in each  treatment arm.  Enrollment will c lose once 320 subjects are 
randomized or 160 adjudicated PFS events are reached, whichever comes first. 
Demographic, Disposition, Study Medication:    
The baseline characteristics of subject s enrolled in each arm will be summarized.  An 
accounting will be m ade of the study course for all subject s who received study drug for each 
arm and, in particular, the number of subject s who expired or withdrew during treatment will 
be specified and reasons for withdrawal categorized.  
Efficacy Analysis:  
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population that includes all 
subject s randomized.

amendment #10.  
Exploratory analyses will be performed to investigate relationships between biomarker 
expression /cytogenetic characteristics, age  and overall survival .  Cytogenetic response  will be 
evaluated  in that subset of subject s who have follow -up cytogenetics.   
Safety Analysis: 
All subject s who receive at least 1 dose of study medication will be included in the safety 
analyses. AEs,  clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medi cations will be tabulated 
and summarized .  Subject  incidence rates of all AEs (including serious, Grade 3, Grade 4, 
treatment-related [with and without discontinuation]  and events requiring the discontinuation 
of investigational product), will be tabulated by system class, preferred term, and severity using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms and NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 
severity grades with modifications. (Section  10.2.1).  Time to first dose reduction will be 
summarized.   The adverse event of infection will also be analyzed according to the grading 
system as recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL 
 (Appendix 22.4). 
Death and clinically important AEs (including tumor flare, tumor lysis, second primary 
malignancies,  and thrombosis) will also be summarized.  
All other measurements will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, 
minimum, and maximum.  Graphical displays will be provided where useful in the 
interpret ation of results.

Confidential and Proprietary 49 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  9. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1. Overall Study Design  
CC-5013- CLL -002 is a pha se 3, multicenter, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel-group 
study that will compare the efficacy and safety of oral lenalidomide  maintenance therapy to that 
of placebo in subject s with B -cell CLL  who achieved at least partial response (PR) with secon d-
line therapy.  The primary efficacy objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of 
lenalidomide over placebo in prolonging OS due to continued therapy, for all subjects, including 
subjects with or without poor prognostic factors, subjects of various ages and subjects with PR, nodular partial response (nPR), complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), 
complete response (CR), and minimal residual disease (MRD) -negative CR.  All subjects  
randomized to the lenalidomide arm , includi ng those subjects who do not improve their response 
(PR, nPR, CRi , or CR) and subjects who do not have the opportunity to improve their response 
further (MRD -negative CR) will be treated up to disease progression   
with the obj
 ective to demonstrate prolongation of OS. 
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period. 
Eligible subject s must have been tr eated with a purine analog -, a bendamustine-, an  anti- CD20 
antibody-, or  a chlorambucil -based regimen in first and/or second line and must have achieved at 
least PR to second -line induction therapy of sufficient duration . Alemtuzumab - containing 
regimens w ill also be allowed for those patients with 17p deletion.  Subject s who  achieve stable 
disease (SD)  only or who develop progressive disease (PD) at any time during induction therapy 
will not be eligible for participation in this study.  
Approximately, t hree hundred twenty  (320) subject s with PR, nPR, CRi, CR or MRD -negative 
CR will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) into two arms:  placebo daily or lenalidomide 2.5 mg daily on days 1- 28 of the first cycle .  If the 2.5 mg dose level is well tolerated, escalation to 5 mg 
daily on days 1-28 of each 28-day cycl e is permitted starting with the second cycle.  If a subject 
develops a Grade 1 or 2 adverse event, the drug may be interrupted until resolution, however the subject must complete one full cycle at the 2.5 mg dose level prior to escalation to the 5 mg dose 
level.  F or those subject s who tolerate the 5 mg dose without unacceptable toxicity, escalation to 
10 mg daily on days 1-28 of each 28- day cycle after 5 continuous cycles at 5 mg will be 
permitted.   Each treatment arm will be stratified according to 1) th e response to second -line 
induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi or CR versus MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 
years); and 3) presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 
17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H or β2M > 4.0 mg/ L (Yes  versus No versus Unknown). 
The subjects randomized to the lenalidomide treatment will c ontinue to receive lenalidomide up 
to PD  .  For those subjects who discontinue therapy for 
reasons other than PD (ie, unacce ptable toxicity) they will transition to the survival follow -up 
period.  

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 50 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Subjects who discontinued from the study drug will be followed every 24 weeks for survival, 
subsequent CLL therapies , response to next therapy and progression following next therapy, and 
second primary malignancies.  Subjects will be followed until all subjects in the study have been 
followed for at least 5 years from the last  randomization, October 2020, ( or have died/be come 
lost to follow  up before 5 years) .     
Screening:  
Potential study subject s will be screened for protocol eligibility within 28 days prior to 
randomization as outlined in Table 2 .  Please refer to  Figure 1 . 
During the screening process for potentially protocol- eligible subjects, complete blood counts 
(CBCs), serum chemistries, thyroid function tests, quantitative immunoglobulin tests, a 12- lead 
electrocardiogram (ECG ), physical exam to assess lymphadenopathies, the spleen and the liver, 
vital signs (with weight), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG) performance status, and 
evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be performed.  
Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates are to be performed on all subject s at screening.   A central 
review of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens will be performed to confirm disease 
status.  Subjects who develop PD during screening will not be eligible to enroll into this study.  
Peripheral blood will be sent to a central laboratory for flow cytometry for all subject s for 
disease diagnosis confirmation (by immunophenotyping), to perform immune cell (NK and T 
cell) analyses  and for subject s entering the study with a CR for determination of MRD status. If 
peripheral blood is MRD negative, a bone marrow flow cytometry will be implemented. If 
subject s enter the study with MRD negativity , the disease diagnosis will  be c onfirmed based on 
prior flow cytometry (documentation needed). 
A peripheral blood sample for a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) will be collected and analyzed at a 
central laboratory. 
Before randomization, subjects will be tested for  cytogenetics by FISH, Ig VH mutational status , 
and β2M.  The β2M test will be performed during screening using a peripheral blood sample and 
analyzed at a central laboratory.  
FISH and IgV H testing will be performed prior to second line, during second line, in the interval 
between second -line therapy and screening or during the screening period using a peripheral 
blood sample .  Because test results can not be obtained during screening or between second line 
and screening in some subjects who achieve a good response due to the limited number of 
remaining CLL cells, we recommend conducting the FISH and IgV H tests preferably prior to 
second line or during second line.   
Samples for FISH and IgV H will be analyzed at a central laboratory.  
If tests do not yield results, subjects can  be randomized and stratified based on historical data. 
Those subjects for whom results were not obtainable pre -randomization and for whom no 
historical data were available will be enrolled and grouped separately.  
An additional peripheral blood sample will be collected at baseline and stored at -70° at a central 
laboratory until the completion of the study; subject s will be re -consented if additional testing is 
to be performed. 
Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 51 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Computed tomography ( CT) scans of the chest, abdomen , and pelvis will be performed at 
baseline for all subject s to document the subject’s status (PR or CR).   
If, during the screening period, the subject has a correctable event that prevents randomization 
and the event can not be corrected within the 28 day screening period, the subjec t may be 
re-screened; however, the CT scans and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy will not need to be 
repeated if those tests were implemented within 56 days prior to randomization and the subject’s clinical status remains the same.  
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP ) must have two negative pregnancy tests performed at 
the study site prior to initiating lenalidomide therapy. The first pregnancy test will be performed 
within 10-14 days prior to randomization and the second test within 24 hours prior to starting study drug.  FCBP must agree to birth control requirements as outlined in Appendix 22.6 during 
the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; and 3) at least 28 days after the treatment discontinuation visit.  FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of contraceptive methods, if needed.  Males 
must commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual contact or agree to use appropriate 
contraceptive methods during any sexual contact with FCBP during study participation and for at 
least 28 days following the treatment discontinuation visit as outlined in Appendix 22.6.  Male 
subjects must agree to abstain from donating blood, semen or sperm during study participation and for at least 28 days after the treatment d iscontinuation visit.  Subject s must be counseled 
about pregnancy precautions and the potential risk of fetal exposure. 
Randomization: 
Randomization must occur no less than 8 weeks (56 days) and no greater than 20 weeks (1 40 
days) from the last day of the last cycle of second -line induction therapy received by the subject 
in order for the subject to be eligible for enrollment into this study.  Subject s meeting all 
eligibility criteria will be randomized (1:1) in a double -blind fashion to receive either 
lenalidomide or placebo.  The randomization procedure will be accomplished by a validated 
interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) (see Section  10.1.1). Subject s will be stratified at 
randomization by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR, CRi  or CR versus 
MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 3) p resence of at least one of the 
following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H or β2M > 4.0 
mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).   
Maintenance Therapy:  
Study treatment for each subject begins on t he same day the subject undergoes randomization.  
Lenalidomide is  administered orally.  Subject s will receive lenalidomide 2.5  mg once daily on 
Days 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle.  If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerated (subject does not experience any Grade 3 or 4 study drug- related toxicities or any other toxicity [Grade 1 or 2] 
found to be unacceptable by the investigator or the subject), subjects should be escalated  starting 
at the second cycle to 5 mg once daily on Days 1 through 28 of each 28- day cycle up to disease 
progression .  If a subject develops a Grade 1 or 2 
adverse event, the drug may be interrupted until resolution, however the subject must complete 
one full c
ycle at the 2.5 mg dose level prior to escalation to the 5 mg dose level. 

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 52 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Subjects who complete 5 continuous cycles at the 5 mg dose l evel without experiencing any 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related toxicities and without experiencing any other toxicity (Grade 1 
or 2) found to be unacceptable by the investigator may be escalated to 1 0 mg once daily on Days 
1 through 28 of each 28-day cycle up to di sease progression   
 
Dose de- escalation to 7.5  mg from 1 0 m g and to 5 mg from 7.5  mg and to 2.5 mg from 5 mg  and 
to 2.5 mg every other day from 2.5 mg will be permitted for those subject s who experience a 
Grade 3 or 4 study drug-related toxicity or any other Grade 1 or 2 toxicity found to be unacceptable by the investigator or subject. 
Dose interruptions are  also permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the investigator’s 
discretion.  A guideline for the reduct ion of the dose of lenalidomide for dose- limiting toxicity 
(DLT ) is provided (see Section  10.2.1).  
Dose re- escalation is permitted if the subject is able to complete 2  full cycles at the reduced dose 
level without experiencing a DLT or other toxicity deemed to be unacceptable by the investigator or subject.  In the event the dose reduction is implemented due to Grade 4 neutr openia, subjects 
may be re -escalated after one full cycle at the lower dose level if the neutropenia resolves to a 
Grade 2 or better by the end of the cycle and no other DLT is observed.  If that dose level is 
again not tolerated, the subject should be de- escalated to the dose below and remain at that  
tolerated dose level for the rest of the study.  
Study visits and serial measurements of safety and efficacy will be performed as outlined in Table 2 . 
Females of childbearing potential must have a pregnancy test (conducted by the study site) within 24 hours prior to starting study drug; the subject  may not receive study drug until the 
Investigator has verified that the pregnancy test is negative. Pregnan cy testing for FCBP will 
continue throughout the study as outlined in Table 2  and Appendix 22.6.   
Counseling regarding blood, eggs and ovum donation, and contraceptive use and the potential 
risks of fetal exposure should be performed as outlined in Appendix 22.6. 
FCBP should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of study therapy to:  
• Ensure that pregnancy tests are performed during the course of the study and after end 
of study therapy and are negat ive (see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
• Ensure the subject continues to practic e abstinence or remains on adequate 
contracept ion (see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
If a FCBP becomes pregnant , treatment should be stopped and the subject referred to the 
appropriate physician.  
Male subject s should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of study 
therapy to: 
• Ensure they commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual contact or continue to 
use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 53 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  • If a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant she should be referred to the 
appropriate physician.  
CBCs will be monitored on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, on Day 1 of each cycle thereafter, and 
at the treatment discontinuation visit.   In the event of Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, monitoring 
of CBCs will continue weekly until resolution to grade 3 or better.  It is recommended to utilize myeloid and erythroid growth factors as per the A merican Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO) 
guidelines.  The use of myeloid growth factors is encouraged when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is less than 1,000/μL. 
If a subject  develops Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, the drug will be withheld until 
the toxicity has recovered to Grade 3 or better.  The drug may then be restarted at  one dose level 
lower.  If the treatment has been withheld and the next cycle is delayed beyond 29 days after day 1 of the prior treatment cycle, then day 1 of the next treatment cycle will be defined as the first 
day that the treatment is resumed.  
Serum chemistries will be performed on Day s 1, 8, and 15 of cycle 1, on Day 1 of each cycle 
thereafter , and at the treatment discontinuation visit.   
Scheduled laboratory studies (CBCs, chemistries ) will be sent to the site’s local laboratory for 
analysis purposes.  
The DAT test must be repeated if the investigator suspects haemolytic anemia and will be 
analysed  centrally during the course of the study. 
ECOG Performance Status will be measured at the treatment discontinuation  visit . 
Evaluation of constitutional symptoms will be performed at the treatment discontinuation visit.  
Vitals signs will be monitored at the treatment discontinuation visit.  A physical examination to 
assess in particular lymphadenopathies, spleen and liver will be performed at the treatment 
discontinuation visit. 
An ECG will be performed  at the treatment discontinuation visit.  
Investiga tors will assess subject s for response every  28 days and at the treatment discontinuation 
visit.  Investigators will provide an assessment of CR (MRD -negati ve or MRD -positive), CRi , 
nPR, PR , and PD based on laboratory, physical exam, and if appropriate local assessments for  
CT scan findings, flow cytometry and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.  To confirm a CR, 
subject s must have maintained no evidence of disease for ≥ 8 weeks and PR  must be maintained 
for ≥  8 weeks as per the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia  (IWCLL ) 
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia     
FCBP must have a pregnancy test at the treatment discontinuation visit. Subject s will receive st udy maintenance therapy until PD develops; any disease transformation 
will need to be documented by lymph node biopsies for Richter’s syndrome and percent of 
peripheral blood or bone marrow prolymphocytes for prolymphocytic leukemia.  Progressive 
disease i s characterized by at least one of the following:  
• Lymphadenopathy.   Progression of lymphadenopathy discovered by physical 
examination.  Disease progression occurs if one of the following events is observed:  

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 54 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  − Appearance of any new lesion such as enlarged lymph nodes (> 1.5 cm), 
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates. 
− An increase by 50% or more in greatest determined diameter of any previous site.   
• An increase in the previously noted enlargement of the liver or spleen size by 50% or 
more or the de novo appearance of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. 
• An increase in the number of blood lymphocytes by 50% or more with at least 5,000 
B lymphocytes per μL.  
• Transformation to a more aggressive histology ( eg, Richter’s syndrome).  Whenever 
possible, this diagnosis should be established by lymph node biopsy. 
• Occurrence of cytopenia (neutropenia, anemia or thrombocytopenia) attributable to 
CLL . 
• During therapy:  cytopenias may occur as a side effect of many therapies and should 
be assessed accordi ng to Table 4 .  During therapy, cytopenias cannot be used to 
define disease progression.  
• Post treatment:  The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated t o autoimmune 
cytopenia), as documented by a decrease of hemoglobin levels by more than 2 g/dL or to less than 10 g/dL, or by a decrease of platelet counts by more than 50% or to less than 100,000/μL, which occurs at least 3 months after treatment, defines disease 
progression, if the marrow biopsy demonstrates an infiltrate of clonal CLL cells.  
Prophylaxis for TLS, thromboembolism and infection and treatment of tumor flare reaction 
(TFR):  
TLS prophylaxis, comprising of oral hydration and allopurinol 300 mg/d ay will be initiated 3 
days prior to starting  maintenance therapy and for a minimum of the first treatment cycle  at each 
dose level for those  subject s entering t he study with a PR to their second -line induction therapy.  
Subjects with a known allergy to allopurinol with a response of PR   will be excluded from the 
study.  Please refer to Section 10.2.1 for further guidance on allopurinol modification in the 
event of an adverse event.  If a subject is taking allopurinol for a condition other than for TLS 
prophylaxis, the subject should be continued on the allopurinol prescribed by their physician and 
the dose titrated to 300 mg/day.  If, at any time, the allopurinol being taken for reasons other than TLS prophylaxis is discontinued and prophylaxis is still required per protocol, the subject  should 
be administered commercial  allopurinol.  To maintain fluid intake, subject s must  be instructed to 
drink 8 to 10 eight ounce (240 mL) glasses of water each day for the first 14 days of cycle 1 and 
the first cycle of each dose escalation .  Hydration levels should be adjusted according to age and 
clinical status, and lowered if the subject’s cardiovascular status indicates the p ossibility of 
volume overload.  At the investigator’s discretion, allopurinol prophylaxis may be omitted for subject s entering t he study with a CR;  however subjects must be advised of the need for 
adequate hydration as outlined above. 
Grade 1 TFR may be treated with non- steroidal anti -inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) (ie, ibuprofen 
400-600 mg orally every 4- 6 hours as needed) and TFR ≥ Grade 2 should be treated with 
Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 55 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  corticosteroids.  Narcotic analgesics may be added as needed for pain control in subject s 
experiencing ≥ Grade 2 tum or flare.  
Subjects will be monitored for TL S and TFR on Days 1, 8, and 15 for cycle 1 and the first cycle 
of each dose escalation.  Monitoring for TLS and TFR will continue on Days 1 and 15 for the 
second cycle of each dose level , at least every 28 days thereafter , and as clinically indicated.  
It is recommended that subjects receive low dose aspirin (75 mg to 100 mg) as prophylactic 
anti-thrombotic treatment while on study drug, however the use of aspirin should only be 
implemented after careful evaluation of the hemorrhagic risk and determination that the subject 
is at limited risk.  The investigator may  use other anti -coagulation prophylactic therapies (ie , 
low-molecular weight ( LMW ) heparin, warfarin, etc.)  at their discretion based on the subjects 
pre-disposing risk factors for thromboembolism (ie, subjects with a history of a thromboembolic 
event and/or taking a concomitant medication associated with an increased risk for a 
thromboembolic event and/or known hypercoagulable state regardless of thromboembolic 
history).  
Aspirin should be interrupted if the platelet count drops below 50,000/μL. 
Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered in patients with neutropenia.  In addition, subjects 
who were on prophylactic treatment for infection while on alemtuzumab therapy should continue prophylactic treatment for at least 6 months following the discontinuation of alemtuzumab 
therapy and can be enrolled into the study while continuing prophylactic therapy.  Subjects with 
an active infection requiring systemic antibiotics and subjects with a systemic infect ion that has 
not resolved > 2 months prior to initiating lenalidomide treatment in spite of adequate 
anti-infective therapy are excluded from entering the study. 
Treatment and Dose Modification for Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS): 
Subject s meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS according to the Cairo-Bishop 
definition and grading system should be treated as follows:  
• Subjects must be hospitalized for ≥ Grade 1 TLS.  For laboratory TLS, hospitalization 
is left to the investigator’s discretion.  
• The following should be provided:  vigorous hydration and appropriate therapy (ie , 
rasburicase where available) therapy as needed to reduce hyperuricemia, until 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities.  
• In cases of laboratory TLS and Grade 1 TLS, lenalidomide will be continued at the same dose without interruption or dose reduction.  Dose escalation to the next consecutive dose level will be permitted when laboratory TLS is resolved and Grade 
1 TLS is resolved to Grade 0. 
• Subject s with ≥ Grade 2 TL S will have their dose interrupted and will resume 
lenalidomide at the next lower dose when electrolyte abnormalities are corrected (ie , 
Grade 0) as specified in the Dose Modification and Interruption section of the 
protocol.  If lenalidomide is resumed prior to the start of the subsequent cycle, a chemistry test should be performed every other day for the first week following 
initiation of lenalidomide.

Confidential and Proprietary 67 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  11. DESCRIPTION OF TREATMENT 
11.1. Description of Study Drug 
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and  10 mg capsules for oral 
administration.   Subjects dose reduced to 7.5 mg dose level (as outlined in Section  10.2.1)  will 
receive one 5.0 mg capsule and one 2.5 mg capsule daily. 
Study drug will be packaged in bot tles containing study capsules for 28 days.  Subject s assigned 
to active treatment will receive 28  days of active drug (with the exception of those subjects de-
escalated to 2.5 mg every other day) .   
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply blinded allopu rinol 300 mg and matching placebo  
(Amendment #10). 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment immediately.  
Celgene Corporation will no longer supply lenalidomide (Amendment #11). 
11.1.1. Randomization 
Randomization will be accomplished by an IVRS to ensure timely registration and 
randomization.  Designated research personnel at the investigational sites will be assigned password protected, coded identification numbers, which gives them authorization to call into the 
IVRS to enroll subjects.  The system will present a menu of questions by which the research personnel will identify the subject and confirm eligibility. When all questions have been 
answered, including questions regarding the results of pregnancy tests for FCBP, the IVRS will 
assign a subject  number  and study drug to the eligible subject . IVRS will fax a confirmation of 
registration and drug assignment for each subject  to the site and Celgene.   Subject s will be 
randomized (1:1) to receive len alidomide or placebo.  Subject s will be stratified at randomization 
by: 1) their response to second-line induction therapy (PR, nPR,  CRi or CR versus 
MRD- negative CR); 2) age (≤ 70 versus > 70 years); and 3) presence of at least one of the 
following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p deletion, unmutated IgV
H, or β2M > 4.0 
mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown).   
Site staff are to contact Celgene at each visit for study drug assignment, to register dose 
reductions or escalations, and at discontinuation from treatment.  Confirmation of each call will be faxed to the site.  
11.2. Treatment Assignments  
Lenalidomide  
Oral lenalidomide 2.5 mg capsul e once dai ly on Days 1 through 28 of the first 28-day cycle.  
If the 2.5 mg dose is well tolerated, subjects should be escalated starting at the second cycle 
to 5 mg capsule once daily on Days 1 through 28 of each 28- day cycle to disease progression  
.  If a subject develops a Grade 1 or 2 adverse event, 
the drug may be interrupted until resolution, however the subject must complete one full cycle a
t the 2.5 mg dose level prior to escalation to the 5 mg dose level.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 68 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Following 5 continuous c ycles at the 5 mg dose level, subject s who are tolerating the 5 mg 
dose level may be escalated  to 10.0 mg once daily on days 1 through 28 of each 28- day cycle 
up to disease progression  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period. 
11.2.1. Dose Modification or Interruption  
Subject s will be evaluated for AEs at each visit with the NCI CTCAE (Version 3.0) used as a 
guide for the grading of severity with the exceptions recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for 
the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  as listed below*: 
Table 4: Grading Scale for Hematological Toxicity in CLL Studies  
Grade# Decrease in Platelets* or Hb° (nadir) 
From Pretreatment value (%)  Absolute neutrophil count/μ L@ (nadir) 
0 No change to 10%  ≥ 2,000  
1 11% - 24% ≥1,500 and < 2,000  
2 25% - 49% ≥1,000 and < 1,500  
3 50% - 74% ≥ 500 and < 1,000  
4 ≥ 75%  < 500  
* Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is 
<20,000/μL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life -threatening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (eg, 20,000/μL) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxicity 
referable to platelet counts.  
° Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  Baseline and subsequent Hb determinations must be 
performed before any given transfusions.  The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but should be documented.  
# Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life -threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5.  
@ If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches less than 1,000/μL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity.  
Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a 
decrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A gradual decrease in granulocytes is not 
a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity.  The use of G -CSF is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, 
but should be documented.  
In addition, TLS will be graded as specified by the Cairo-Bishop grading s ystem ( Appendix 
22.5). Subjects meeting criteria of laboratory TLS or ≥ Grade 1 TLS, will be hospitalized (per 
investigator’s discretion for laboratory TLS), provided with vigorous intravenous hydration and 
appropriate therapy (ie , rasburicase where available) as needed to reduce hyperuricemia, until 
correction of electrolyte abnormalities.  In the case of la boratory TLS and Grade 1 TLS, 
lenalidomide will be continued at the same dose without interruption or dose reduction. Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 TLS, will have their dose interrupted and will resume lenalidomide at the next 
lower dose level when electrolyte abnormalities are corrected (ie , Grade 0). If lenalidomide is

• May resume lenalidomide 
when the adverse event resolves to ≤ Grade 2 (decrease one dose level or maintain dose

discretion) 
A new course of treatment may begin on the scheduled Day 1 of a new cycle if:  
− the ANC is  ≥ 500/μL;  
− the platelet count is ≥ 25,000/μL;  
− any other lenalidomide -related non-hematologic adverse event that may have 
occurred has resolved as indicated in Table 6 . 
If these conditions are not met on Day 1 of a new cycle, the subject will be evaluated weekly and 
a new cycle will not be initiated until the toxicity ha s resolved as described above.  
Dose interruptions/reductions are permitted for Grade 1 or 2 adverse events at the investigator’s discretion.  
If a study drug interruption has lasted for 5 weeks, the investigator should contact the medical 
monitor to discuss whether the subject  should be continued on the study. 
Site staff  are to contact Celgene to record new dose level and obtain new study drug assignment.  
If the treatment has been withheld and the next treatment cycle is delayed beyond 29 days after Day 1 of the prior treatment cycle, then Day 1 of the next treatment cycle will be defined as th e 
first day that the treatment is resumed.  If dose reduction occurs within a cycle, subjects will be 
given a new 28-day supply bottle, subject s should begin taking study drug at the current cycle 
day (ie, if reduction occurs on Cycle Day 16, then the subj ect will take study drug from the new 
bottle for the remainder of the cycle ).  Subject s will be required to return empty bottle  or any 
unused drug prior to new drug being dispensed. 
Dose re- escalation is permitted if the subject is able to complete 2  full cycles at the reduced dose 
level without experiencing a DLT or other toxicity deemed to be unacceptable by the investigator 
or subject.  In the event the dose reduction is implemented due to Grade 4 neutropenia, subjects 
may be re -escalated after one full cycle at the lower dose level if the neutropenia resolves to a 
Grade 2 or better by the end of the cycle and no other DLT is observed.  If that dose level is 
again not tolerated, the subject should be de- escalated to the dose below and remain at that 
tolerated dose level for the rest of the study.

progression.  The placebo treatment arm is discontinued in amendment #10.  
Amendment #11: 
Subjects currently on lenalidomide treatment will discontinue lenalidomide treatment 
immediately and complete the Treatment Discontinuation assessment.  The subject s will then 
transition to the survival follow -up period. 
13.4. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
Celgene Corporation will supply lenalidomide 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and  10 mg capsules for oral 
administration.  Subjects dose reduced to 7.5 mg dose level (as outlined in Section  10.2.1)  will 
receive one 5.0 mg capsule and one 2.5 mg capsule daily. 
The lenalidomide study drug will be packaged in 28-count bottles.    
The label for study drug supplied by Celgene will bear Celgene’s name and address, the protocol 
number, EudraCT number (where required), product name, dosage form, and strength, medication identification/kit number, dosing instructions, storage conditions, the quantity of 
study drug contained, and  required caution statements and/or regulatory statements as 
applicable. Additional information may be included on the label as needed and/or applicable

Confidential and Proprietary 79 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Subjects requiring dose reduction within a treatment cycle must return to the study site and 
return the empty  bottles or any unused drug and a new bottle will be dispensed.  Subject s will be 
given a new 28-day supply bottle and should begin taking study drug at the current cycle day. 
13.5. Study Drug Receipt and Storage  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of study drug received, and comparing it with the accompanying study drug shipping order form.   The 
Investigator(s) will verify the accuracy of the information on the form and call Celgene  to 
register the study medication received at the site . 
At the study site, all investigational study drugs will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent 
unauthorized access.  
The study drug should be stored as directed on package label. 
13.6. Record of Administration  
Accurate recording of all study drug administration (including dispensing and dosing) will be 
made in the appropriate section of the subject ’s CRF a nd source documents. 
13.7. Study Drug Accountability  
The Investigator(s) or designee(s) is responsible for accounting for all study drug that is issued to and returned by the subject during the course of the study. 
13.8. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
FCBP should not handle or administer study drug unless they are wearing gloves. All patients 
should not extensively handle or open study drug capsules and should maintain storage of capsules in the packaging until ingestion. 
In investigational studies, study drug will be dispensed through a qualified healthcare 
professional (including but not limited to, nurses, pharmacists, and physicians).  These healthcare professionals will be trained by Celgene in requirements specific to counseling of patients.  Once 
trained these healthcare staff will counsel patients prior to  study drug being dispensed to ensure  
that the patient has complied with all requirements including use of birth control and pregnancy 
testing (FCBP) and that the patient understands the risks associated with lenalidomide.  This step 
will be documented with a completed lenalidomide Education and Counseling Guidance 
Document ( Appendix 22.6),  and no drug will be dispensed until this step occurs. Counseling 
includes verification with the patient that required pregnancy testing was per formed and results 
were negative. A  Lenalidomide Information Sheet  (Appendix 22.6) will be supplied with each 
study drug dispense.  
Celgene will instruct the Investigator(s) on the return or destruction of unused study drug.  If any 
study drug is lost or damaged, its disposition should be documented in the subject ’s CRF and 
source documents.  Celgene will provide instructions for the return of study drug supplies at the 
end of the study.

15.1. Assessments  
• Clinical laboratory evaluations:  
− Hematology: white blood cell (WBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), 
platelet count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC),  and absolute lymphocyte count 
(ALC) 
− Chemistry: calculated (method of Cockroft -Gault) creatinine c learance (screening 
only), potassium, calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT, and uric acid  
• Pregnancy testing for FCBP: serum or urine b eta-human chorionic gonadotropin 
hormone (β -HCG) pregnancy testing w ith a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL is to be 
done on FCBP only 
− FCBP should be monitored during the course of the study and after the end of 
study therapy to:  
o Ensure that pregnancy tests are performed during the course of the study and 
after end of study therapy and are negative ( see specifics in Appendix 22.6).  
o Ensure the patient continues to practice abstinence or remains on adequate 
contraception ( see specifics in  Appendix 22.6).  
o If a FCBP becomes pregnant treatment should be stopped and the patient referred to the appropriate physician 
• Male patients should be monitored during the course of the study and 28 days after 
the end of study therapy to: 
− Ensure they commit to continued abstinence from heterosexual contact or 
continue to use a condom during sexual contact with a FCBP 
− If a female partner of a male patient becom es pregnant she should be referred to 
an appropriate physician 
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs by NCI CTCAE Version 3.0 with modifications recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia   
 
• Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and should be included as part of the assessment of adverse events throughout the course of the study.  Investigators are to report any second pri mary malignancies as serious adverse 
events regardless of causal relationship to study drug, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the time of signing the informed consent up to and including the survival follow up phase.

Confidential and Proprietary 82 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  15.2. Methods and Timing of Safety Assessments  
Serial measurements of safety will be performed at baseline and at scheduled intervals 
throughout the duration of the study as outlined in Table 2 .  All scheduled visits will have a ± 3 
day window unless otherwise stated.  Abnormalities will be captured as adverse events.  The adverse event of flare reaction, which may mimic disease progression, may render the efficacy assessments not evaluable at the corresponding visit(s).  Cause of death is to be recorded in the 
CRF and the subject ’s medical record.  
15.3. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events 
The recording and reporting of adverse events is described in Appendix 22.1.

17.1. Statistical Overview 
The objective of the statistical analysis will be to compare the efficacy and safety of 
lenalidomide versus placebo as maintenance therapy in subjects with relapsed or refractory 
B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) having achieved PR or better after second -line 
therapy. 
Overall survival (OS) will be the primary endpoint for the protocol following amendment #10.  
This analysis wil l be performed at the completion of the study.  It is estimate d that at least 160 
subject s across both treatment arms have died  at the time of analysis  (yielding 80% power to 
detect a 61.3 % improvement in median OS for a two-sided test at 0.025 level allowing for one 
interim analysis ).   
17.2. Study Population Definitions 
17.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Population  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, which 
will include all subject s who were randomized. 
17.2.2. Safety Popul ation 
All randomized subjects who receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. 
17.2.3. Subgroup Analyses  
In addition to analyses that include all subject s, analyses will be performed to compare 
treatments within the following stratification subgroups: 
• Response to second -line induction chemotherapy (PR, CRi or CR versus 
MRD-negative CR) 
• Age (≤ 70 years versus > 70 years)  
• Presence of at least one of the following poor prognostic factors:  11q deletion, 17p 
deletion, unmutated IgV H or β2M > 4.0 mg/L  (Yes  versus No  versus Unknown) 
Additional subgroups may be examined, as needed based on regulatory and clinical requests. 
17.3. Efficacy Evaluation 
17.3.1. Primary Endpoint  
Overall Survival (OS) 
Overall survival is calculated as the time from randomization to death from any cause.  OS will 
be censored at the last date that the subject  was known to be alive for subject s who were alive at 
the time of analysis and for subject s who were lost to follow -up before death was documented. 
Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 85 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The analysis of OS will include survival information for all randomized subject s.  Subjects who 
discontinued from the treatment phase of the study and who had possibly received other 
anti-cancer therapies and then subsequently died will be included in the analysis as death.  
Howeve r, sensitivity analyses will be performed in which these subject s will be censored at the 
date of the first dose date of the anti -cancer therapy.  
17.3.2. Secondary Endpoint  
Progression Free Survival 2 (PFS2)  
PFS is defines as the time from randomization to the second objective disease progression, or 
death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients alive and for whom a second objective disease progression has not been observed should be censored at the last time known to be alive 
and without second objective disease progression.  In situations where OS and PFS2 cannot 
reliably  be determined, it may be possible to rule out significant lack of efficacy of further 
treatments by  looking at the outcome of the next line therapy.  For this an alysis, an event is 
defined as second  objective disease progression, or death from any cause, or the start of the CLL 
therapy after next line treatment, whichever occurred first (EMEA guideline 13 DEC 2012).  
Various schemes will be assessed for missing data imputation if needed.  
17.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 
Kaplan -Meier product limit methods will be used to estimate the survivorship functions for the 
time-to-event endpoints (eg, OS , and PFS2 ).  A two -sided log- rank test stratified by the 3 strata 
used in the randomiz ation will be used as the primary analytic method to compare survivorship 
functions for time -to-event variables in the 2 treatment groups.  In terms of the survivorship 
functions for each treatment group, the hypotheses of interest were: 
H
0:  F A(t) =  F P(t) for all t  
Versus  
H1:  F P(t) ≠ FA(t) for all t  
where F P is the survivorship function for placebo and F A is the survivorship function for 
lenalidomide. Median OS will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier estimates, and the 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) will be computed using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley.  Hazard ratio will be 
calculated using Cox model stratified for the 3 strata (ie, response to secon d-line induction 
chemotherapy, age, and presence of at least one prognostic factor ) to account for the stratified 
randomization.  The C ox model will also  be used to identify prognostic factors.  
Cross -tabulations will be provided by treatment group  to summarize improvements from the best 
response during induction therapy. 
17.4. Background and Demographic Characteristics 
Subjects’ age, weight, height, and other continuous demographic and baseline variables will be 
summarized using descri ptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), 
while performance status, gender, race, and other categorical variables will be summarized with 
frequency tabulations for each treatment group separately and pooled over both treatment

18.1. Monitoring  
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after 
the study.  Before the study is initiated at a site visit o r at an investigator meeting, all aspects of 
the study are reviewed with the investigator(s) and the staff.   Prior to enrolling subject s into the 
study, a Celgene representative will review the protocol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed consent, record keeping, and reporting of AEs with the Investigator(s).  Monitoring 
will include on -site visits with the Investigator(s) and his/her staff as well as any appropriate 
communications by mail, fax, or telephone.  At each monitoring visit, the facilities, study drug 
storage area, CRFs, subject’s source documents, and all other study documentation will be 
inspected/reviewed by the Celgene representative for adherence to the protocol and Good Clinical Practice.  
The monitor will review CRFs for completion and  accuracy.  Accuracy will be checked by 
performing source data verification at each site visit that is a direct comparison of the entries made onto the CRF against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting discrepancies 
will be reviewed with the  Investigator(s) and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary corrections will be 
made directly to the CRFs or via queries by the Investigator(s) and/or his/her staff. Monitoring 
procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion criteria , and 
documentation of SAEs and the proper recording be verified.  Additional monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan. 
18.2. Audits and Inspections  
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance unit exists within Celgene.  From time to time, representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research activities in accordance with Celgene standar d operating procedures ( SOPs ) to 
evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and regulations. 
The Investigator(s) is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs, and applicable suppor ting records of subject participation for audits 
and inspections by Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethic Committees ( IRB/IECs ), 
regulatory authorities (eg , FDA, EMA, Health Canada) and company authorized representatives.  
The Investigator(s) should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If 
the Investigator(s) is contacted by any regulatory authority regarding an inspection, he/she 
should contact Celgene immediately. 
18.3. Investigator(s) Responsibilities 
Investigator respons ibilities are set out in the International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH) 
guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the US Code of Federal Regulations.  Celgene or a representative will contact and select all principal investigators or co -investigators who in turn 
will select their staff.  The investigator must give the monitor access to relevant records to confirm the above.

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 89 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The Investigator(s) is responsible for keeping a record of all subjects who sign an Informed 
Consent Form and are screened for entry into the study.  For those subjects who fail screening, the reason(s) for exclusion must be recorded in the subject ’s source documents and in the IVRS 
system.  
No procedure/assessment/measurement/test other than those outlined here, or in the schedule of study assessments, is to be performed without the prior written approval of Celgene, or unless 
deemed by the investigator(s) as necessary for the subject ’s medical care.  Investigator(s) and/or 
authorized designee(s) must enter study data onto CRFs supplied by Celgene.  The data on the 
CRF will be recorded in an anonymous manner to protect the subject’s identity by using a unique 
identifier that will prevent personal identifiable information.  
The Investigator(s), or a designated member of the Investigators’ staff, must be available at some 
time during monitoring visits to review data and resolve any queries and to allow direct access to 
the subject’s records (eg, medical records, office charts, hospital charts, and study related charts) 
for source data ve rification.  The CRFs must be completed as soon as possible after the subject ’s 
visit but no later than prior to each monitoring visit and be made available to the Celgene 
representative(s) so that the accuracy and completeness may be checked.

19.1. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval  
The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance with the general ethical principles 
outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (Appendix 22.2).  The review of this protocol by the IRB/IEC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for 
obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance with principles enunciated in the 
declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, Title  21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 
50 Protection of Human Patients and Part 56 Institutional Review Boards.  Before implementing 
this study, the protocol, the proposed informed consent form and other information to subjects, 
must be re viewed by a properly constituted Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC).  A signed and dated statement that the protocol and informed consent 
have been approved by the IRB/IEC must be given to Celgene before the study initiation.  The 
names and occupations of the chairman and the members of the IRB/IE C must be supplied to 
Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/IEC and obtaining written approval for this study.  The approval will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study.  
A copy of the IRB/IEC approval for the protocol and the Informed Consent is to be provided to Celgene. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the date of approval, protocol number and version, or amendment number. 
The Investigator(s) is responsible for notifying the IRB/IEC of any serious deviations from the 
protocol, or anything else that may involve added risk to subjects.  
Any advertisements used to recruit su bject s for the study must be reviewed and approved by 
Celgene and the IRB/IEC prior to use.  
19.2. Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to this protocol that seems appropriate, as the study progresses (eg, affects 
safety or efficacy) will be agreed upon between the coordinating and/or principal investigator(s) and the Celgene study physician.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for written approval before the implementation of the amended version.  The written signed approval from 
the IRB/IEC should refer specifically to the investigator(s) and to the protocol number and title 
and mention any amendment numbers that are applicable.  Celgene does not require that amendments that are administrative in nature receive IRB/IEC approval, but will be submitted to 
the IRB/IEC for information purposes.  If local IRB/IEC procedures require approval of 
administrative amendments, then study sites should follow local IRB/IEC regulations.  
19.3. Informed Consent 
The Investigator(s) must obtain informed consent of a subject or his/h er designee prior to any 
study related procedures as per Good Clinical Practices (GCP) as set forth in the 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 and ICH guidelines.

Confidential and Proprietary 91 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Documentation that informed consent occurred prior to the subject ’s entry into the study and of 
the inform ed consent process should be recorded in the subject’s source documents.  The original 
consent form, signed and dated by the subject and by the person consenting the subject  prior to 
the subject ’s entry into the study, must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy 
given to the subject.  In addition, if a protocol is amended and it impacts on the content of the 
informed consent, the informed consent must be revised.  Subject s participating in the study 
when the amended protocol is implemented must be re-consented with the revised version of the informed consent.  The revised consent form signed and dated by the subject and by the person consenting the subject must be maintained in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to 
the subject. 
19.4. Patient Confidentiality  
Celgene affirms the patient’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. In compliance with United States federal regulations, Celgene requires the Investigator(s) to permit Celgene’s 
representatives and, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws.  
Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the patient’s st atement of informed consent, it is the responsibility of the Investigator(s) to obtain 
such permission in writing from the appropriate individual.

20.1. Data/Documents 
The investigator(s) must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the 
study and the distribution of the study drug, CRFs, source documents, original documents, data, 
records (eg, hospital records; clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; patient’s diaries or evaluation checklists; pharmacy dispensing records; recorded data from automated 
instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; 
microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x -rays; patient files) , and 
records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico -technical departments involved 
in the clinical study are complete, accurate, filed and retained.  
20.2. Data Management 
Data will be entered into the clinical database as per Celgene SOPs. These data wi ll be 
electronically verified through use of on-line checks during data entry, and through programmed edit checks specified by the clinical team.  Discrepancies in the data will be brought to the attention of the clinical team, and investigational site personnel, if necessary, in the form of a 
Data Clarification Form (DCF).  Resolutions to these issues will be reflected in the database.  An 
audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.  A quality control audit will be performed per Celgene SOP(s).  
20.3. Retention of Records 
The investigator(s) must maintain records of all study documents and supporting information relating to the conduct of the study.  This documentation includes, but is not limited to, 
protocols, case report forms, advertising for subject participation, adverse event reports, subject 
source data, correspondence with health authorities and IRBs/IECs, informed consent forms, investigator(s) curricula vitae, monitoring visit logs, laboratory reference ranges, laboratory 
certification or quality control procedures, and laboratory director curriculum vitae.  Subject files 
and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time permitted by the hospital, 
institution or private practice specified below.  The study monito r must be consulted if the 
investigator(s) wishes to assign the study files to someone else, remove them to another location or is unable to retain them for a specified period.  
For studies conducted in the United States under a US Investigational New Drug (IND), the 
investigator(s) must retain the study records for a minimum of 2 years after a marketing 
application for the indication is approved or for 2 years after the IND is withdrawn.  If no application is filed, or if the applic ation is not approved for the indication, the records are to be 
retained for two years after the investigation (ie, the IND) is discontinued, and FDA is notified of that fact.  For IND studies conducted outside the US, the investigator(s), must retain stud y 
records for the time period described above or according to local laws or requirements, 
whichever is longer.  The monitor will inform the investigator(s) of the dates for retention.  All 
study documents should be made available if required by relevant he alth authorities.  For studies 
not conducted under the US IND, the investigator(s) records must be retained until at least 2 
years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no

23.1. Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a study.  It may be a new 
intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or any concomitant impairment of the subject ’s health, including laboratory test values (as specified by the criteria below), 
regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE.  If there is a worsening of that medical condition , this should be considered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be 
recorded on the AE page of the electronic Case Report Form rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or syndrome. 
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator(s) from the time of signing of informed consent 
form to 30 days after  the treatment discontinuation visit.  All AEs that lead to study 
discontinuation should be followed until resolution or stabilization.  AEs will be recorded on the 
AE page of the CRF and in the subject’s source documents.  
Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following: 
• Results in discontinuation from the study. 
• Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other therapeutic intervention.  
• Is judged by the Investigator(s) to be of significant clinical importance.  
If a laboratory ab normality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a part of 
a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality should be recorded as the AE.  
Please note that all ≥ Grade 3 hematologic lab abnormalities must be reported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (ie, in the opinion of the Investigator[s] the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE) 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject ’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Confidential and Proprietary 100 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  • Constitutes an important medical event 
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may jeopardize the subject  or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up period.  In this study, subjects will  be followed until all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least 5 years from the last  randomization , October 2020  (or have died/become lost to 
follow -up before 5 years) .  Events of second primary malignancy are to be reported using the 
SAE re port form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious 
criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results).    
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations which: were planned before entry into the clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the studied indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do not result in admission (unless 
fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal treatment or monitoring of the studied 
indication and are not associated with any deterioration in condition. 
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form must be 
completed. 
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome. 
Classification of severity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event.  
The severity of AEs will be graded based upon the subject ’s symptoms according to National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Common T erminology Criteria (CTCAE, Version 3.0) with the 
exceptions recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia   AEs will be evaluated for severity according to the 
following scale:  
Grade 1 = Mild  
Grade 2 = Moderate  
Grade 3 = Severe  
Grade 4 =  Life Threatening or disabling AE 
Grade 5 =  Death  

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 101 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The following exceptions will be made as recommended by the IWCLL guidelines for the 
diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia as listed below*: 
Grade# Decrease in Platelets* or Hb° (nadir) 
From Pretreatment value (%)  Absolute n eutrophil count/μ L@ (nadir) 
0 No change to 10%  ≥ 2,000  
1 11% - 24% ≥1,500 and < 2,000  
2 25% - 49% ≥1,000 and < 1,500  
3 50% - 74% ≥ 500 and < 1,000  
4 ≥ 75%  < 500  
* Platelet counts must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  If, at any level of decrease the platelet count is < 
20,000/μL, this will be considered grade 4 toxicity, unless a severe or life -threatening decrease in the initial 
platelet count (eg, 20,000/μL) was present pretreatment, in which case the patient is not evaluable for toxici ty 
referable to platelet counts.  
° Hb levels must be below normal levels for grades 1 -4.  Baseline and subsequent Hb determinations must be 
performed before any given transfusions.  The use of erythropoietin is irrelevant for the grading of toxicity, but 
should be documented.  
# Grades: 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe; 4, life -threatening; 5, fatal.  Death occurring as a result of toxicity at any 
level of decrease from pretreatment will be recorded as grade 5.  
@ If the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) reaches  less than 1,000/μL, it should be judged to be grade 3 toxicity.  
Other decreases in the white blood cell count, or in circulating granulocytes, are not to be considered, since a 
decrease in the white blood cell count is a desired therapeutic end point.  A  gradual decrease in granulocytes is not 
a reliable index in CLL for stepwise grading of toxicity.  If the ANC was less than 1,000/μL prior to therapy, the 
patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC.  The use of G -CSF is irrelevant for the grading toxicity, 
but should be documented.  
Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in 
patients receiving lenali domide. During the conduct of CC-5013- CLL -002, all Grade 4 
laboratory abnormalities will be  reported to Celgene Drug Safety as SAEs at the discretion of the 
investigator and recorded in the CRF as SAEs, however those that are not deemed by the 
investigator to be  part of a diagnosis or syndrome will not reported to the Health Authorities  in 
an expedited manner.  Laboratory values will be captured within the study database and will be 
reviewed on an ongoing basis by the sponsor and (provided that it is determined that any 
observed individual abnormalities or patterns of abnormalities do not warrant prompt 
communication to Health Authorities) will be reported to  Health Authorities  in periodic safety 
reports. 
Please note that all ≥ Grade 3 hematologic lab abnormalities must be reported as an Adverse 
Event on the AE page of the CRF.   
Classification of R elationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug  
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study drug and 
the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:  
Not suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely or 
remote , or other medications, therapeutic interventions, or 

Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 102 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study drug 
administration makes a causal relationship possible,  and other 
medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying conditions 
do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Monitoring and reporting of adverse events 
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters: the subject ’s clinical symptoms; laboratory, 
pathological, radiological, or surgical findings; physical examination findings; or other appropriate tests and procedures.  
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events 
Any AE that meets the criterion for a SAE requires the completion of a SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies to all SAEs, regardless of 
relationship to study drug, that occur during the study, those made known to the Investigator(s) 
within 30 days after a subject ’s treatment discontinuation visit, and those made known to the 
investigator(s) at anytime that are suspected of being related to study drug.  
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interes t and must be reported as 
serious adverse events.  This includes any second primary malignancy, regardless of causal relationship to study medication, occurring at any time for the duration of the study, from the 
time of signing the ICF up to and including any follow-up, observation and/or survival follow-up period.  In this study, subjects will be followed until all subjects in the study have been followed 
for at least 5 years from the last  randomization , October 2020 (or have died/become lost to 
follow -up before 5 years).   Events of second primary malignancy are to be reported using the 
SAE report form and must be considered an “Important Medical Event” even if no other serious criteria apply; these events must also be documented in the appropriate page(s) of the CRF and 
subject's source documents.  Documentation of the diagnosis of the second primary malignancy 
must be provided at the time of reporting as a serious adverse event (eg, any confirmatory histology or cytology results).    
Grade 4 hematologic abnormalities are expected in patients with CLL, and are also observed in patients receiving lenali domide.  The investiga tor will use their judge ment to classify the 
seriousness of laboratory abnormality events.  Laboratory values will be captured within the 
study database and will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the sponsor and (provided that it is 
determined that any observed individual abnormalities or patterns of abnormalities do not warrant prompt communication to Heath Authorities) will be reported to Health Authorities  in 
periodic safety reports.  
The SAE must be reported  (ie, within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event) to 
the Celgene Safety by facsimile.  An initial written report (prepared by the Investigator(s) using  
the SAE Report Form provided by Celgene) is to be faxed to the Safety Monitor (see below for contact information).  
Lenalidomide (CC-5013)  
Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002    Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 103 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include copies of hospital 
records and other relevant documents.  If a s ubject  has died and an autopsy has been performed, 
copies of the autopsy report and death certificate are to be sent to Celgene as soon as these 
become available.  Any follow-up data will be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, and 
sent to Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -up 
information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copies of all SAE info rmation, 
including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs that have not 
resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study must be followed until 
either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resolves with  sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a 
baseline value is available).  
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  occurring while the 
subject is on study drug, or within 28 days of the treatment discontinuation visit, are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, 
suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to the Celgene Safety Monitor 
immediately by facsimile using the SAE Report Form.  
The female should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist experienced in reproductive 
toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must 
notify Celgene Safety of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow-up to the initi al SAE report.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE (ie, 
spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly [including that in an aborted 
fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs (ie, report the event 
to Celgene Safety by facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event). 
In the case of a li ve “normal” birth, the Celgene Safety Monitor should be advised by telephone 
and facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event. All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, without regard to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator(s) suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported to Celgene Safety by 
facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the event. 
If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s continued 
participation in the study will be determined by the Investigator(s) and the Celgene Medical 
Monitor.

23.6.1. Lenalidomide Pregnancy Prevention Risk Management Plan 
23.6.1.1. Lenalidomide Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan for Celgene Clinical Trials  
Appendix 22.6.1 applies to all patients receiving lenalidomide therapy.  The following 
Pregnancy Risk Minimisation Plan documents are included in this appendix:  
1) Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and Acceptable Birth 
Control Methods ( Section  22.6.2);  
2) Lenalidomide Education and Counseling Guidance Document ( Sectio n 22.6.2.1);    
3) Lenalidomide Information Sheet ( Section  22.6.2.2).  
 
1. The Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods document (Section  22.6.2 ) provides the following 
information: 
• Potential risks to the fetus associated with lenalidomide exposure 
• Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential  
• Pregnancy testing requirements for patie nts receiving Lenalidomide who are females 
of childbearing potential 
• Acceptable birth control methods for both female of childbearing potential and male 
patients receiving Lenalidomide in the study  
• Requirements for counseling of all study patients receiving Lenalidomide about 
pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure to lenalidomide 
2. The Lenalidomide Education and Counseling Guidance Document ( Section  22.6.2.1) 
must be completed and signed by either a trained counselor or the Investigator at the participating clinical center prior to each dispensing of lenalidomide  study treatment. A 
copy of this document must be maintained in the patient records.  
3. The Len alidomide Information Sheet (Section  22.6.2.2) will be given to each patient 
receiving lenalidomide study therapy. The pa tient must read this document prior to 
starting lenalidomide study treatment  and each time they receive a new supply of study 
drug.

Confidential and Proprietary 121 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  23.6.2. Lenalidomide Risks of Fetal Exposure, Pregnancy Testing Guidelines and 
Acceptable Birth Control Methods  
Risks Associa ted with Pregnancy  
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide.  Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic 
active substance that causes severe life- threatening birth defects. An embryofetal development 
study in animals indicates that lenalidomide produced malformations in the offspring of female monkeys who received the drug during pregnancy.  The teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, a risk minimization plan to prevent pregnancy must be 
observed. 
Criteria for females of childbearing potential (FCBP) 
This protocol defines a female of childbearing potential as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 2) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea f ollowing cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) 
for at least 24 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 
consecutive months).  
Counseling 
For a female of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are met (ie, all females of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning the following 
risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• She understands the potential teratogenic risk to the unborn child  
• She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, 4 weeks before starting study treatment, throughout the entire duration of study treatment, dose interruption and 28 days after the end of study treatment 
• She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
• She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to notify her study doctor immediately if there is a risk of pregnancy 
• She understands the need to commence the study treatment as soon as study drug is dispensed following a negative pregnancy test 
• She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing based on the 
frequency outlined in this protocol (Section  22.6.2 ) 
• She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
The investigator must ensure that for females of childbearing potential:  
• Complies with the conditions for pregnancy risk minimization, including confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
• Acknowledge the aforementioned requirements

Protocol CC-5013-CLL-002  Celgene Corporation 
Confidential and Proprietary 122 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  For a female NOT of childbearing potential, lenalidomid e is contraindicated unless all of the 
following are met (ie, all females NOT of childbearing potential must be counseled concerning 
the following risks and requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• She acknowledges that she understa nds the hazards and necessary precautions 
associated with the use of lenalidomide  
Traces of lenalidomide have been found in semen.  Male patients taking lenalidomide must meet 
the following conditions (ie, all males must be counseled concerning the following risks and 
requirements prior to the start of lenalidomide study therapy):  
• Understand the potential teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
female or a female of childbearing potential  
• Understand the need for the use of a condom even if he has had a vasectomy, if 
engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing 
potential.   
Contraception 
Females of childbearing potential (FCBP ) enrolled in this protocol must agree to use two reliable 
forms of contraception simultaneously or to practice complete abstinence from heterosexual 
contact during the following time periods related to this study: 1) for at least 28 days before starting study drug; 2) while participating in the study; 3) dose interruptions; and 4) f or at least 
28 days after study treatment discontinuation. 
The two methods of reliable contraception must include one highly effective method and one 
additional effective (barrier) method. FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of 
contraceptive meth ods if needed. The following are examples of highly effective and additional 
effective methods of contraception:   
• Highly effective methods:  
− Intrauterine device (IUD) 
− Hormonal (birth control pills, injections, implants) 
− Tubal ligation  
− Partner’s vasectomy  
• Additional effective methods:  
− Male condom  
− Diaphragm 
− Cervical Cap  
Implants and levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk 
of infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics 
should be considered particularly in patients with neutropenia.

Confidential and Proprietary 123 CC-5013 -CLL- 002 Amend 11  Final:  16 March 2018  Pregnancy testing 
Medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mIU/mL must be 
performed for females of childbearing potential, including females of childbearing potential who 
commit to complete abstinence, as outlined below.  
Before starting study drug  
Female Patients: 
FCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests (sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) prior to 
starting study drug.  The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10 to 14 days prior to the start of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior to the 
start of study drug.  The patient may not receive study drug until the study doctor has verified 
that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative.  
Male Patients:  
Must practice complete abstinence or agree to use a condom during sexual contact with a 
pregnant female or a female  of childbearing potential while participating in the study , during 
dose interruptions and for at least 28 days following study drug discontinuation, even if he has 
undergone a successful vasectomy.  
During study participation and for 28 days following stud y drug discontinuation  
Female Patients:  
• FCBP with regular or no menstrual cycles must agree to have pregnancy tests weekly for the first 28 days of study participation and then every 28 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at day 28 following study drug discontinuation. If 
menstrual cycles are irregular, the pregnancy testing must occur weekly for the first 
28 days and then every 14 days while on study, at study discontinuation, and at days 14 and 28 following study drug discontinuation. 
• At each visit , the Investigator must confirm with the FCBP that she is continuing to 
use two reliable methods of birth control. 
• Counseling about pregnancy precautions and the potential risks of fetal exposure 
must be conducted at a minimum of every 28 days. If pregnancy or a positive 
pregnancy test does occur in a study patient, study drug must be immediately discontinued.  
• Pregnancy testing and counseling must be performed if a patient misses her period or if her pregnancy test or her menstrual bleeding is abn ormal.  Study drug treatment 
must be discontinued during this evaluation.
 
• Females must agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 28 days after study drug discontinuation. 
Male Patients:  
• Counseling about the requirement  for complete abstinence or  condom use during 
sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential and the

every 28 days.  
• If pregnancy or a positive pregnancy test does occur in the partner of a male study 
patient during study participation, the investigator must be notified immediately. 
Additional precautions  
• Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any unused capsules to the study doctor at the end of treatment. 
• Female patients should not donate blood during therapy and for at least 28 days 
following discontinuation of study drug. 
• Male patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during therapy or for at least 28 days following discontinuation of study drug. 
• Only enough study drug for one cycle of therapy may be dispensed with each cycle of 
therapy.

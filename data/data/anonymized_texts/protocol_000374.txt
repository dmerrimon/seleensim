Up to 50% of patients do not take their cardiovascular medications as prescribed, resulting in 11 
increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Interventions to improve adherence, such 12 
as patient education, reminders, pharmacist support, and financial incentives , have produced 13 
mixed results —some demonstrating benefits, but many produc ing small to negative results. 14 
Adherence interventions have been limited by 1) includ ing adherent patients who may not ne ed 15 
an intervention; 2) resource -intensive approaches involving pharmacists; and 3) lack of attention 16 
to evidence-based strategies to motivate human behavior.   17 
Brief behavioral interventions can influence decision-making and are impactful. Principles of 18 
behavioral economics have been incorporated into health interventions to “nudge” people to  19 
achieve improved health outcomes. A behavioral nudge is a small change in framing choice that 20 
alters people’s behavior in a predictable way. A prior study test ing financial incentives through 21 
elimination of copayments for cardiovascular medications in the year after acute myocardial 22 
infarction improved adherence from 4% to 6% ; however, financial incentives are not 23 
generalizable and are unlikely to be sustainable. Behavioral nudges such as commitments ( e.g. 24 
asking patients for demonstrated commitment to change through a pledge), norms (using 25 
examples of others who take action), and salience (making information or recommendations 26 
resonant through use of stories) build on a well-evidenced body of behavioral science theory 27 
and have been shown to improve health behaviors such as smoking cessation and weight loss . 28 
These have yet to be tested to improve medication adherence. 29 
30 
Mobile and digital technologies for health promotion and disease self -management 1-3 offer an 31 
intriguing and as of yet untested opportunities to adapt behavioral ‘nudges ’ using ubiquitous cell 32 
phone technology to facilitate medication adherence.  33 
34 
The objectives of our two-part, multi-center study are as follows over the course of 4 years: 35 
Aim 1: Conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve 36 
adherence to chronic CV medications. The primary outcome will be medication adherence 37 
defined by the proportion of days covered (PDC) using pharmacy refill data. Secondary 38 
outcomes will include intermediate clinical measures (e.g., BP control), CV clinical events (e.g., 39 
hospitalizations), healthcare utilization, and costs. 40 
Aim 2: Evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and applying the RE-AIM 41 
(reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, 42 
assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and 43 
modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention within the 3 HCS more broadly and 44 
nationally.  45

BACKGROUND  AND SIGNIFICANCE  47 
Patients commonly fail to adhere to cardiovascular medications, resulting in an increased risk of 48 
adverse outcomes. Pharmacy refill data is routinely used to describe the prevalence and 49 
outcomes of medication non-adherence using one of two measures, the proportion of days 50 
covered (PDC) or the medication possession ratio (MPR). Both measures are calculated by the 51 
number of days supplied for a medication divided by the observation period with a range of 0 to 52 
1.0, with 1.0 implying perfect adherence. Non-adherence is commonly defined as a PDC or 53 
MPR <0.80. Prior work has found 20% to 50% of patients with cardiovascular diseases (e.g. 54 
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, or coronary artery disease) have poor 55 
medication adherence.  For example, in our prior work, over a quarter ( 28%) of patients were 56 
non-adherent to dabigatran, a direct oral anti-coagulant that is intended to reduce the risk of 57 
thromboembolic events among patients with atrial fibrillation. In the same study, we 58 
demonstrated poor adherence was associated with increased risk of mortality or stroke (HR 59 
1.13, 95% CI 1.07 -1.19 per 10% decrease in adherence as measured by the PDC). A similar 60 
association between medication non-adherence and adverse outcomes has been demonstrated 61 
for other classes of medications including anti -platelet medications, B-blockers, ACE inhibitors 62 
or ARBs, oral diabetes medications, and statins, all of which are used to treat cardiovascular 63 
diseases. The accumulated literature has shown that medication non-adherence to CV 64 
medications is common and results in suboptimal outcomes; thus effective interventions are 65 
needed to improve medicatio n adherence. 66 
Mobile telephone text messaging interventions , a form of mHealth technology , may be 67 
promising in improving medication adherence. Mobile telephones and text messaging are 68 
ubiquitous - this technology is increasingly used regardless of age, socioeconomic class and 69 
primary language. A recent meta-analysis of mobile telephone text messaging medication 70 
adherence interventions for chronic diseases demonstrated that text-messaging interventions 71 
approximately double the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into 72 
adherence rates improving from 50 .0% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic 73 
disease) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%. Another meta-analysis of text messaging 74 
to improve health behavior outcomes, including but not limited to medication adherence, found 75 
that personalized messages have greater effects than those that do not. While these meta- 76 
analyses demonstrate the potential for text messaging interventions, the underlying studies 77 
were markedly heterogeneous, leaving questions about the best strategies for message design, 78 
the impact of generic vs. tailored approaches, optimal message timing and intensity and 79 
whether bi-directional messaging is useful. Authors of both reviews concluded the results should 80 
be interpreted with caution given the short duration of studies and reliance on self-reported 81 
measures . The se preliminary data on the influence of text messaging interventions are cause 82 
for optimism. However, it is not yet known how this type of interventio n might be optimized at 83 
scale and whether doing so will improve outcomes.  84 
Behavioral “nudges” from the fields of behavioral economics and cognitive psychology have the 85 
potential to augment the impact of text messaging interventions to further enhance medication 86 
adherence. Normative theories of decision making, such as expected utility theory, are based 87 
on the ideal that all people approach decisions rationally and are able to weigh the risks and 88 
benefits of various interventions.  In medication adherence for example, a normative approach 89 
would mean someone would take the medication provided the benefits outweigh the risks. 90 
Descriptive theories of decision making, such as the Dual-Process theory and Prospect theory 91 
(two of the foundational theories suppor ting Dan Kahneman’s 2002 Nobel prize in economics), 92 
demonstrate that humans are subject to cognitive biases that cause decision-making to deviate 93 
from the normative or rational. The Dual-Pro cess Theory of decision making states that people 94 
make decisions e ither ‘intuitively,’ quickly drawing on emotion and past experiences or 95 
3 ‘reasonably’ using a thoughtful, analytic approach. Nudges take advantage of the intuitive 96 
aspects of decision-making. A nudge is defined as a small change in choice framing or choice 97 
architecture that “alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or 98 
significantly changing their economic incentives.” A technology -delivered nudge should 99 
positively i nfluence individuals’ behaviors through the use of non-intrusive education, social 100 
norm setting, and reciprocity expectation.  101 
There are thr ee types of nudge interventions strongly supported by prior literature that could be 102 
feasibly implemented as text messages within the context of medication adherence:  103 
1)Communicating social norms:  Social norms can activate and guide behavior in positive ways 104 
when a message normalizes positive behaviors, such as medication adherence, placing 105 
non-adherence outside the definition of typical behavior. In other contexts, social norms 106 
have been shown to improve healthy food choices, physical activity, everyday health 107 
behaviors (e.g. using the stairs vs. elevators) and even reduce home energy use. However, 108 
little or no research has tested the influence of social norm communication via text 109 
messaging to improve medication adherence. 110 
2)Behavioral commitments:  A behavioral commitment is something like committing to filling 111 
one’s prescription. Prior research has demonstrated a strong desire among individuals to act 112 
consistently with their prior commitments, and eliciting commitments to engage in a specific 113 
behavior has been shown to be effective at improving a  range of behaviors, including 114 
judicious use of antibiotics among clinicians.  Commitments to fill one’s prescription could be 115 
elicited via text messaging and may lead to greater concordance between individuals’ 116 
commitment and their behaviors. 117 
3)Narrative Stories:  Narrative stories are increasingly recognized as an important way to 118 
increase vividness and comprehension of medical outcomes. One issue underlying 119 
medication non-adherence is likely a failure to recognize or understand the potential 120 
negative consequences t he behavior, e.g. , stroke, heart attack, or even death. Narrative 121 
interventions —particularly ones that describe stories of negative outcomes —may be 122 
particularly effective at helping patients concretely understand potential risks of non- 123 
adherence, spurring them to take action (improving medication adherence) to prevent 124 
negative outcomes. 125 
Although text messaging has been used with positive effect to influence medication 126 
adherence,1-4 such messages are not theoretically informed to influence social norms, 127 
behav ioral commitment and/or use narratives. 128 
PREVIOUS WORK 129 
Through out 2018, we established the procedures and start-up necessary to initiate this four- 130 
year study successfully with an informed approach (COMIRB # 18-0630). We have developed a 131 
message library, and vetted and developed through a series of N of 1 trials and stakeholder 132 
panel input. IT infrastructure has been developed across three healthcare systems (see below 133 
for additional details).  134 
We have also piloted and refined our patient identification procedures, opt-out methods, and the 135 
text messaging intervention through a pilot study (in progress at this time ). 136 
SETTING 137 
The proposed study setting includes  Denver Health, UCHealth, and the Denver VA healthcare 138 
systems (HCS ). 139 
APPROACH  140 
4   Over the next four years, we propose conducting a patient-level, randomized pragmatic trial 141 
testing a variety of strategies “nudging” patients  through text messages to encourage 142 
medication adherence to already-prescribed cardiovascular medicines .  143 
Inclusion & Exclusion Criteria  144 
Programmers will identify eligible patients based on the presence at least 1 of the  145 
cardiovascular conditions listed in Table 1  and with a prescription for at least 1 of the classes 146 
of medications to treat the cardiovascular conditions listed in Table 1. Participants  must be 147 
patients at UCHealth, Denver Health, and the VA.  Patients must have had a fill for a 148 
medication of interest within the 100 days prior to the cohort build date.  149 
There will be minimal exclusions criteria: 1) patients who have neither a landline or cellphone; 150 
or 2) enrolled in hospice or palliative care; or 3) Non-English or Spanish speaking; 4) residing 151 
out of the state of Colorado .  152 
Patients with a refill gap of at least 7 days within the past year utilizing pharmacy refill data will 153 
be eligible to receive nudges . We will specifically target patients from the following patient 154 
groups: 1) Age > and <= 65 years of age; 2) Male and female patients; 3) one versus multiple 155 
cardiovascular condition of interest; and 4) English and Spanish speaking patients.  156 
Table 1. Inclusion criteria for the study based on cardiovascular conditions and m edications 157 
classes of interest  158

Opt-out Consent Process 159 
Programmers will develop identical study databases within each HCS to store potential 160 
participants. All data will be stored on secure, separate servers or on RedCap.  161 
We will use this pool to send opt-out consent letters to potential participants. An opt- out 162 
consent packet will be sent to all eligible patients prior to randomization. The packet will 163 
contain an introductory letter with information about the study, an opt-out form, and a self- 164 
addressed, stamped envelope. An opt-out survey will also be included. This opt-out survey 165 
aims to gauge the reason for patients o pting-out. The survey is optional.  166 
All materials will be available and sent to patients in both English and Spanish for UCHealth 167 
and Denver Health patients. If they have previously specified in their contact preferences that 168 
they prefer English or Spanish, we will send materials in their preferred language. As is 169 
standard, materials will be sent in English only at the VA. All materials will be sent on 170 
letterhead and branding appropriate and specific to each HCS. The letter will be signed by 171 
either the primary care provider for the patient or the site principal investigator. 172 
5 Should an opt-out packet be returned by the United States Postal Services (USPS) due to an 173 
incorrect address, etc, a member of the study team will call the potential participant no more 174 
than two times to verify their address; should they not hear from the participant the patient will 175 
not be included in the study. Upon the deadline for response to the opt-out consent has 176 
expired, patients that have not opted-out will be randomized accordingly. Signed and returned 177 
opt-out forms will be securely stored in a locked filing cabinet (returned opt-out forms for VA 178 
patients will be securely stored at the VA). 179 
180 
Patient Identification Process 181 
From this pool of candidates, patients will be followed forward and those identified to have a gap 182 
of at least 7 days in one of the CV medications at any time during the two -year monitoring 183 
period will be randomized to one of the four study arms. For patients who are prescribed 184 
multiple CV medications, eligibility for randomization will be triggered by the first 7-day gap for 185 
any medication.   186 
We have already developed algorithms that queries pharmacy data for a defined medication 187 
refill gap based on the date that the medication was supplied and the number of medication 188 
days supplied. This algorithm is in use for a medication adherence study currently. We will apply 189 
this algorithm across the 3 HCS to identify non-adherent patients.  190 
Pharmacy data from UCHealth and Denver Health will be accessed through both hospital- 191 
specific pharmacy data and Surescripts, a network with existing relationships with both HCS 192 
that provides pharmacy refill data from over 95% of US pharmacies. Daily pharmacy data via 193 
Surescripts is currently available at Denver Health, and is projected to become available at 194 
UCHealth in the fall of 2019.  195 
Every 3 months for up to two years , we will assess whether there are new patients who have 196 
met entry criteria in the interim, based on existing patients who now meet the eligibility criteria 197 
or new patients to the clinic. These patients will be sent an opt-out package and provided a 198 
reasonable timeline to return the opt-out form. We will continue to add new patients until 199 
months 24 following the start of the pragmatic study at each site to allow for at least 12 months 200 
of patient follow-up to assess for non -adherence. 201 
202 
Mobile Messenger  203 
Mobile Messenger (Upland Communications, Austin, TX) is an online platform specializing in 204 
text message transmission. Three separate accounts have been created to ensure each HCS 205 
data are stored separately; protected health information (PHI) between sites will never be 206 
combined. Each account will have a separate login and password. To access the Mobile 207 
Messenger account for the VA, Nudge study team members must be signed in behind the VA 208 
firewall. 209 
A trained member of the Nudge study team will upload phone numbers, first name, medication 210 
class, and first three digits of the zip code. First, the researcher will identify the patient has a 211 
listed cell phone. Upon confirming the phone number, the patient will be entered into the 212 
appropriate study arm. Message schedules and example messages (attached) are available in 213 
this application packet. 214 
The program will allow patients to STOP if they would like to opt -out of the study, or indicate 215 
DONE if they have filled their medication or if their physician has cancelled the medication of 216 
interest. There will also be an option to receive messages in Spanish. 217 
218 
6 Message arm descriptions  219 
The study will randomize at the patient level. Once randomized, patients will remain in the 220 
same study arm for the entire study whether or not they have subsequent refill gaps.  221 
1)Usual Care: This group will not receive an intervention. We have included a usual care 222 
group to demonstrate the impact of the text messaging interventions above and beyond usual 223 
care given that many prior medication adherence interventions have demonstrated small to 224 
negligible effects. 225 
2)Generic nudge : A generic reminder text will be delivered to patients to refill their 226 
medication at days 1, 3, 5, and 9 after they been labeled as non-adherent. During aim 1, we 227 
will further assess the optimal timing for delivery of these messages. We have put in the 228 
specific days to provide an example. In the day 1 text message, patients will have another 229 
opportunity to opt out of the study with text such as “text STOP if you wish to withdraw from 230 
this study.” The texts will stop once a patient has filled their medication. 231 
3)Optimized nudge: A behavioral nudge text will be delivered to patients to remind them to 232 
refill their medications at days 1, 3, 5 and 9 after they have been labeled as non-adherent. 233 
During aim 1, we will further assess the optimal timing for delivery of these messages. We 234 
have put in the specific days to provide an example. In the day 1 text message, patients will 235 
have another opportunity to opt out of the study with text such as “text STOP if you wish to 236 
withdraw from this study.”  The texts will stop once a patient has filled their medication. The 237 
content of the behavioral nudge text messages will vary with each text and will be derived from 238 
the text message library built during the pilot year (COMIRB #18-0630) 239 
4)Optimized nudge plus AI Chat Bot: A behavioral nudge text will be delivered to patients 240 
to remind them to refill their medications at days 1 and 3 after they have been labeled as non- 241 
adherent. In the day 1 text message, patients will have another opportunity to opt out of the 242 
study with te xt such as “text STOP if you wish to withdraw from this study.” The texts will stop 243 
once a patient has filled their medication. If the patient has not filled their medication on days 5 244 
and 9, an AI will conduct interactive chat via a chat bot to assess bar riers filling the medication 245 
as described in Aim 1 above. 246 
The AI Chat bot will assess for common barriers to medication adherence 1) socioeconomic 247 
factors, 2) provider-patient/health care system factors; 3) condition -related factors; 4) therapy 248 
related factors and 5) patient-related factors using a developed script that we are currently 249 
employing in a medication adherence study. Communication about all of these barriers will be 250 
pre-programmed to use as algorithms in the chat bot automated program. For each barrier, the 251 
AI Chat bot will problem-solve with the patient and identify commonly used successful 252 
approaches to overcome barriers, and will ask patients to choose and enact one solution to 253 
improve medication adherence. The AI chat bot library will include algorithms to support 254 
specific strategies to circumvent the adherence barriers responsible for each instance of a 255 
medication refill gap. For example, patients would be queried to determine if they have 256 
difficulty remembering what medications to take and when to take them; those that do would 257 
be asked if using a medication diary, involving a caretaker, or setting an alarm on their phone 258 
would help. Patients would be asked if they would like to try one of these strategies; for those 259 
that agree and identify a strategy, the AI chat program will include an algorithm to check in one 260 
week later to see how this strategy is going. Those who do not agree and/or identify a strategy 261 
will be offered other options and the process repeated until they do. If there are issues that 262 
arise that are not pre-programmed into the AI chat bot library, the AI Chat bot will refer the 263 
patient to the study pharmacist at each site for consultation and assistance with the issue. For 264 
example, a patient may have stopped taking his medication due to a side effect. The AI Chat 265 
bot will document this information through interactive chat then refer the patient to a study 266 
7 pharmacist to see if there are alternative medications . Dr. Bull has programmed libraries very 267 
similar to this AI Chat bot approach and utilized them for behavior change in prior interventions. 268 
Patients will be followed for up to 24 months.  They will remain in the same study arm for the 269 
duration of the study and receive the same intervention for subsequent episodes of non- 270 
adherence. 271 
272 
Plan for responding to text messages from patients 273 
a)If a patient text s “stop” to unsubscribe, the patient is automatically withdrawn from 274 
receiving the intervention (messages). Patients may also text m isspellings of the word 275 
"stop”  (such as “tsop,”  etc.), or send a message indicating the patient  would like to be 276 
removed from the study. We will continue to view already-collected, standard of care 277 
data from these patients. 278 
In the initial version of the consent form, we described a “stop ” response as a way to 279 
“fully  withdraw”  from the study. These patients  were opted  out from the study entirely, 280 
and data are no longer  being  collected on these patients. In v.12.3.19  of the info sheet, 281 
the language was amended. For patients  that have hit "st op" in the original cohort, 282 
researchers will call the patients  (please find script) to obtain verbal consent to collect 283 
their data moving forward. If patients  do not consent or cannot be reached after two 284 
attempts, we will continue to treat the patients  as fully opted out and we will not view 285 
their data moving forward. Patients from this original cohort that hit "stop" in the future 286 
will be flagged and the calling process will be implemented. 287 
b)Should a patient  respond “done”  to indicate they have already filled their prescription or 288 
a physician has cancelled their medication, we will stop sending patients  any further 289 
text messages about  refilling the medication in which they had a delay  until their 290 
medication is again  due for a refill (i.e. 30 – 90 days in the future) . We will immediately 291 
remove the patient  from further  text messages for this instance of medication non- 292 
adherence. 293 
Misspellings of “done”  or messages indicating they have already filled their prescription 294 
or that a physician cancelled their medications will be treated  as if they responded 295 
“done.”  If a physician has stopped their medication, we will no longer  monitor for 296 
medication refills for that specific medication. For other  medications, we will resume 297 
following the other  medication refills. If the patient  has a refill gap for the same or for 298 
other medications again, we will start delivering text messages within the same arm 299 
that they had been previously randomized to. 300 
c)Patients may request Spanish messages at any time via text. We will start to deliver 301 
Spanish language texts following the request. If the patient  meets additional criteria for 302 
texts during the duration of the study, they will receive Spanish language  texts. 303 
d)There will be text messages that do not fall into any of the categories above. A 304 
Research Assistant will monitor these responses and will triage the messages 305 
depending  on the content of the messages. In our pilot study, some patients  sent 306 
responses to the text messages that (a) requested additional  information about  the 307 
study and/or  (b) requested more detail  on the specific medication that required a refill, 308 
even though  the text message they were responding to did not solicit this information. 309 
For these types of unsolicited messages, the Research Assistant will respond with a 310 
link to our study webpage where we will post informat ion about  the study, sponsors, 311 
participating institutions, and a contact number they can call for more information. This 312 
webpage will include  a “Frequently  Asked Questions”  (FAQ) about  the Nudge Study, 313 
8 and we will post responses to anticipated questions (e.g. Does my provider know about  314 
this study?; How did you get my cell number?; What  if I don’t want to participate?; etc.).   315 
We anticipate that patients may text unsolicited information about  a side effect or 316 
adverse event related to their medications. In these cases, we will have the site study 317 
pharmacists call the patient to find out more about  the issue.  We will also have the 318 
pharmacist contact the patient’s  PCP to make them  aware of the issue.   319 
320 
Other responses, such as questions about  the intervention or requests for information about  321 
their medication, will be triaged and responded to by a research assistant, pharmacist, or 322 
physician, as deemed appropriate. A call script for the research assistant is included. We will 323 
catalogue the messages that we receive from patients and if there  is a theme, we will develop 324 
a FAQ and place information on the study website. In cases where the patient  still has not 325 
refilled their medication after 5 days of their reply “done”,  a research assistant on the study 326 
team  will first confirm that the medication refill has not been completed. If the medication has 327 
not been  refilled after chart review, they will then contact the patient  to see if he or she is 328 
having issues with refilling the medication and try to resolve any issues  with the patient.  329 
330 
In addition,  we will update  the patient’s  care provider on a regular basis about  medication gaps  331 
and other medication issues of their patients. The frequency  and mode of contact will be based 332 
on their indicated preference, which we will solicit at the start of the study during our clinic 333 
presentation. If the provider did not indicate a preference, we will send this information via email 334 
on a weekly basis.  335 
336 
337 
Quantitative Analysis 338 
339 
The study will be a randomized controlled study with four treatment arms.  When patients are 340 
identified through pharmacy refill data to have a 7-day gap in any prescribed CV medication 341 
refills, they will be randomized to one of four arms, described in Intervention below. 342 
Randomization will be stratified within each of the eight clinics, and within strata defined by 343 
number of other CV medication classes that are prescribed at randomization (1-4), using blocks 344 
of 4 patients to ensure balance within clinics over time. Thus, within each clinic and number of 345 
other medication stratum, each set of 4 consecutively enrolled subjects will be randomized to 346 
the four study arms. Treatments will be initiated immediately upon randomization, in response to 347 
the 7 -day gap.  348 
349 
The primary outcome is adherence to CV medications as measured by 12-month proportion of 350 
days covered (PDC).  There are several complications in using this outcome, including a) a 351 
need to account for periods when subjects are not at risk of depleting their medication supply 352 
(see below for details), b) defining PDC when considering five medication classes 353 
(antihypertensives, statins, oral hypoglycemics, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants), c) accounting 354 
for number of other prescribed CV medications (more opportunities to miss days, and more 355 
opportunities to receive reminders), d) modeling the non-normal bounded distribution of PDC, 356 
and e) a desire to express results on a PDC difference (not risk ratio or odds ratio) scale. 357 
Analyses accounting for these complications are described below.  Secondary outcomes 358 
include clinical events (e.g., event times for stroke, MI, mortality), utilization of care (e.g., 359 
hospitalizations or clinic visits for CV-related reasons), and costs of the interventions and of 360 
medical care. Given survival, subjects will be followed for at least 12 months following 361 
randomization to assess these secondary outcomes. Subjects who have more than one year of 362 
follow-up (up to 3 years depending on when they are enrolled during years 2-3) will continue to 363 
be followed for secondary outcomes.   364 
9 365 
Ascertainment of Outcomes 366 
Data for the primary outcome PDC will be obtained using pharmacy records from each of the 367 
healthcare systems during the 365-day follow-up.  To address complications a and b above: a) 368 
The assessment will be based on the number of o utpatient days a patient has a medication 369 
available, among all days they were at risk of depleting that medication.  At-risk days will be 370 
days during which a patient was prescribed the medication and should have depleted their 371 
supply, and will exclude days following death.  Inpatient days will not be considered in the 372 
calculation.  Note that at-risk days is medication specific, as medications may change during the 373 
one-year assessment period.  b) We will consider three definitions of PDC: i) Medication- 374 
specific PDC: calculate PDC for each class of medication a patient is prescribed, ii) All- 375 
medication PDC: calculate PDC requiring all prescribed and at-risk medications be available on 376 
a day, and iii) Average PDC: calculate the average PDC across medications the patient is at risk 377 
of depleting on a day, and average over all days when at risk of depleting at least one 378 
medication. 379 
380 
Secondary outcomes for clinical events and utilization of care will be captured from the 381 
electronic health records (EHRs) at each of the three health care systems.  Several sources of 382 
cost data will be used. To capture costs of development, implementation and maintenance of 383 
the intervention, we will develop instruments (e.g. time logs) and procedures to prospectively 384 
capture resource use associated with the intervention including what was done, who did it, how 385 
long it took, and what nonhuman resources were required. Intervention costs will be the long- 386 
term average cost of implementing the intervention excluding research and development costs. 387 
Medical care costs will be estimated using a resource-based method previously developed to 388 
assign costs to encounter data. Inpatient utilization will be measured using diagnostic-related 389 
groups (DRGs), outpatient utilization using relative value units (RVUs), and cost of pharmacy 390 
utilization using the midpoint between the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) and the National 391 
Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC). Inpatient costs will be estimated by applying national 392 
payment weights to DRGs, outpatient costs by applying a national conversion factor to RVUs, 393 
and pharmacy costs as the median between the FSS and NADAC.  394 
395 
Planned Analysis 396 
Analyses will be based on the intent to treat principle, using all patients who were randomized. 397 
398 
Descriptive analyses  399 
Descriptive analyses will be used to describe the cohort and to check for balance across study 400 
arms within strata (clinics and number of other medications prescribed).  Primary outcome PDC 401 
will be calculated during the one-year period following treatment initiation.  Simple descriptive 402 
estimates of each patient’s PDC on each medication will be used for descriptive analyses.  403 
404 
Modeling PDC 405 
Formal analyses will be based on daily data, using a binomial-type model with logistic link for 406 
the number of days covered by medication, which will be 365 but excluding days not at risk of 407 
depleting as described above.  We will model the three definitions of PDC described above:  408 
409 
i) Medication-specific PDC:  For a given medication class, the model will include fixed effect 410 
terms for treatment arm, clinic, patient covariates, and number of other CV medications the 411 
patient is prescribed, and a random subject effect for a subject’s tendency to have higher or 412 
lower PDC compared with other subjects.  Covariates to be adjusted for will be selected a priori 413 
based on clinical considerations and covariate data quality, the latter assessed after we have 414 
enough pilot and baseline data to make the assessment but before ex amining outcome data. 415 
All covariates included in outcome models will also be included in imputation models (see 416 
10 below). The analysis will be carried out using daily data to account for the differing numbers of 417 
at-risk days across patients, and the possibility that the number of other prescribed CV 418 
medications may change during the one year PDC modeling period.  The parameter being 419 
modeled is the probability that a given day is covered, conditional on fixed and random effects.  420 
This approach will account for complications a) varying numbers of at-risk days for different 421 
patients and different medication classes, b) defining PDC when considering multiple 422 
medication classes, c) adjusting for number of other CV medications prescribed, and d) the non- 423 
normal bounded distribution of PDC.  Due to non-independence of days for a given subject, the 424 
binomial assumption will not hold and inference will need to be carried out using bootstrap or 425 
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as described below. 426 
427 
ii) All-medication PDC:  Each day for each subject will be coded as whether they have all 428 
prescribed and at-risk medications available or not.  The same modeling process described 429 
above for medication-specific PDC will be used. 430 
431 
iii) Average PDC:  Medication-specific PDC models will be estimated as described above, and 432 
will be used to calculate estimates of average PDC using the standardization methods 433 
described below. 434 
435 
Treatment comparisons 436 
Discussions with clinicians have indicated expressing results on a linear scale (PDC 437 
differences), as opposed to odds ratios or risk ratios, will be most appropriate for interpretation.  438 
Several such modeling approaches exist including Modified Binomial using robust standard 439 
errors, Additive Binomial using maximum likeliho od, and standardization using counterfactu al 440 
methods .  We plan to base primary analyses on the standardization approach, which allows 441 
flexibility in estimating treatment comparisons and provides population average estimates that 442 
are parallel to simple proportion estimates of PDC.  In this approach a mixed logistic regression 443 
model will be estimated using maximum likelihood, and the estimated model is used to calculate 444 
probabilities that each day is covered for each subject and each medication.  Quantities of 445 
interest are estimated from the relevant averages of probabilities.  For example, the estimated 446 
probability of medication availability for a given medication on a given treatment is the average 447 
of all estimated probabilities for all exposed days across all subjects assum ing they received the 448 
specified treatment and were prescribed the specified medication, regardless of which treatment 449 
they actually received and which medication(s) they were actually prescribed.  Contrasts of 450 
interest are formed from these estimates.  Primary hypotheses involve pairwise comparisons 451 
between each of the four study arms, and will be conducted using the pairwise contrasts.  452 
Standard errors and confidence intervals will be calculated using bootstrap methods, since the 453 
binomial assumption of the model will not hold.  Bonferroni adjustments will be used to correct 454 
for the 6 pairwise treatment comparisons.   455 
456 
The secondary outcomes of clinical events, care utilization and cost will be analyzed using 457 
similar approaches but based on appropriate models, e.g. Cox survival models for time to 458 
clinical event or rehospitalization, generalized gamma regression for cost, etc.  Similar 459 
standardization methods allow results to be expressed on interpretable scales such as risk 460 
difference.  Data will be analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and R software. 461 
462 
Missing data:   Patients with missing data in covariates, treatments (unlikely) or outcomes will be 463 
retained in the intent to treat analyses and their missing values imputed using multiple chained 464 
equation methods.  The imputation model will include all covariate, exposure and outcome 465 
variables used in the outcome model.  If patients are randomized but later opt out or drop out, 466 
their outcome data will be collected up to the point that they leave, and will be used as a 467 
variable in the imputation.  When outcome data cannot be obtained, every effort will be made to 468 
11 document reasons for these missing observations. We will carry out the recommended 469 
sensitivity analyses based on pattern mixture models, by assuming various values for difference 470 
in means between observed and unobserved data and assessing differences in model 471 
conclusions. 472 
473 
Secondary analyses of primary outcome:   We will consider several sensitivity analyses.  First, 474 
an alternate estimation appr oach using MCMC instead of maximum likelihood will be considered. 475 
This approach would eliminate the need for bootstrapping, and would also allow imputation 476 
during the model estimation by treating missing covariates and outcomes as parameters in the 477 
Bayesian model and estimation.  Second, we will fit mixed linear regression models to the 478 
binary 0/1 daily medication coverage outcome.  Treatment differences will be on the PDC 479 
difference scale.  Robust sandwich estimators will be used in the estimation, and bootstrap will 480 
be used for inference.  We expect results of these sensitivity analyses to be similar to the 481 
primary analysis results.  We will also use the methods described above to conduct several 482 
secondary analyses evaluating a) predictors of patients having an initial gap of at least 7 days, 483 
using the initial pool of candidate patients, to identify types of patients or prescription 484 
characteristics for patients at highest risk for non-adherence; b) predictors of subjects having a 485 
gap of at least 7 days whi le enrolled in the study; c) PDC for the individual medication that 486 
triggered enrollment in the study, to allow analyses of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) by 487 
drug class; and d) analysis of alternate definitions of primary outcome, including time to first gap, 488 
PDC below 0.8, and number of 7-day gaps, during the one year follow-up.  We will also carry 489 
out an analysis to estimate possible HTE between the three health care systems, using an 490 
interaction of treatment arm with health care system. 491 
492 
Health system costs:  This analysis will examine intervention costs and incremental medical 493 
costs associated with the intervention. Cost data will be analyzed using the same methods 494 
described above with factors for study arm and health care system/clinic strata, using 495 
generalized Gamma regression, which include as special cases lognormal, Gamma and Weibull.  496 
The primary dependent variable will be healthcare cost, in total and separated into inpatient, 497 
outpatient, and pharmacy cost buckets. The primary independent v ariable will be the 498 
intervention arm the patient was randomized to. Results will be stratified by healthcare system.   499 
500 
Power Assessment 501 
We first estimated sample size required to achieve 80% power for the desired change in the 502 
primary outcome, then used current data to show we will be able to achieve this sample size. 503 
504 
Power and sample size:  Required sample size was estimated for the primary outcome PDC 505 
during the 12 months following randomization. Preliminary data from the VA were used for these 506 
estimates.  We made the following assumptions:  a) Significance using two-sided level 0.05 507 
tests, b) Power at least 80%; c) Difference between treatments in PDC of 10 percentage points; 508 
d) Bonferroni adjustment for the 6 pairwise comparisons among the 4 study arms, resulting in 509 
adjusted level 0.05/6; e) Analysis stratified by health care system; and f) Within-system and 510 
within-treatment residual standard deviation of 12 month PDC equal to 0.247 (mean 0.771), 511 
obtained by analysis of 594,466 veterans during the period 01/01/2010 – 09/30/2012 who were 512 
prescribed CVD medications. The large SD is due to a highly left-skewed PDC distribution.  (We 513 
base sample size estimation on t-tests rather than the proposed binomial models since we do 514 
not have estimates of quantities needed to carry out power simulations.  We may be able to 515 
obtain data for the PDC outcome for a set of baseline patients, in which case we will consider a 516 
refined power analysis.)  Using these assumptions and estimates, and comparing any two 517 
treatments usin g a linear model with the above residual standard deviation of PDC, we estimate 518 
using sample size functions in R that we will need N=154 subjects per treatment arm, total 519 
12 across the three health care systems, for a total of 616 subjects to be randomized across the 520 
three health care systems.  521 
522 
Available sample sizes:   We obtained data from each of the three health care systems on the 523 
number of patients at the eight specific clinics (VA, 2 clinics; UCHealth, 4 clinics; DH, 2 clinics) 524 
to be included in this study. Figure 1 below shows estimated numbers of patients seen, 525 
numbers with CVD conditions and prescribed CVD medications, and numbers with 7 day gap.  526 
These patients will be invited to participate, and assuming 80% agree to participate, and 90% of 527 
those yield usable outcome data, we expect to have usable outcome data for about 4,364 528 
patients, or about 1,091 per treatment arm. Thus, we expect to have ample subjects (about 529 
seven times as many as needed) to achieve the necessary power for the primary analysis of 530 
PDC.  Additional subjects will provide power for secondary analyses, and for analyses of 531 
secondary outcomes. 532 
533 
Exploratory 534 
535 
Covid Messaging 536 
537 
On April 6, 2020, the Nudge Study started to send Covid messages to patients enrolled in the 538 
study (Amendment PAM006-1, approved March 18, 2020). 539 
540 
This study plans to scale the concept of the Nudge Study to other applications in the future. We 541 
propose pulling data regarding Covid testing of patients sent messages after April 6, 2020  to 542 
compare with Arm 1 (non interventional arm).   543 
544 
Comparing opt out vs opt i n demographics  545 
546 
There is a growing interest in learning more about who is opting out of our study, as well as who 547 
is opting in. 548 
549 
Our study plans to compare the demographics of patients (race, age, ethnicity, gender) that 550 
have opted in vs opted out of our study. This requires pulling data from Electronic Health 551 
records to compare both cohorts.  552 
553 
We propose (12/1/20) to retrospectively pull demographic data from the EHR for patients that 554 
have opted out of the study (race, age, ethnicity, gender) to compare these data with patients 555 
that have opted in to the Nudge study. Moving forward, we  will include a statement in the opt out 556 
packet ( Information Sheet, v 12/1/20 ) to inform potentially-eligible patients that  receive an opt 557 
out packet that demographic information will be drawn. 558 
559 
Qualitative Analysis 560 
Assessment of patient perspectives 561 
In year 5, after the intervention and follow-up period has ended, we will survey patients via text 562 
message and Nof1 telephone interviews. We have conducted similar interviews with patients 563 
following adherence interventions. These interviews will help inform further refinement of the 564 
interventions65 as we plan for broader dissemination of the intervention (if demonstrated to be 565 
effective) to more clinics and patients with other chronic conditions. 566 
Text message survey 567 
We will random ly sample 150 patients across the three sites to participate in a voluntary survey 568 
about their experience with the intervention over the University-hosted Qualtrics platform 569 
13 (https://ucdenver.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5jBlah5rV7tcSoK). The survey will not collect 570 
or solicit any PHI (see Attachment – Satisfaction Survey v 9.23). The sample will be stratified 571 
evenly across patients who received one of the three intervention arms. 572 
Mailed survey 573 
If the response rate of the text messaged surveys is below 20%, the surveys will be mailed out 574 
to patients who previously received the survey via text but did not respond. A $2 incentive will 575 
be included in the mailed packet to encourage responses. An information sheet will be 576 
included to explain the survey and incentive to the patient (Attachment – Information Sheet 577 
v2.23). 578 
579 
Nof1 Interviews 580 
In a random sample of up to 50 patients who respond to the survey and indicate they would be 581 
interested in participating in an additional interview, we will contact them via telephone to get 582 
more in-depth feedback through qualitative interviews on the intervention (Attachment - Nof1 583 
interview guide, v. 9.23). No deeply personal information or PHI will be solicited. Interviews will 584 
take place over Zoom, Cisco Jabber (DH/UCH), and secure hospital phone lines (VA).  585 
Interviewers will utilize detailed notetaking with an interview guide, and interviews will be 586 
recorded to be transcribed (at DH and UCH only). Interviews will cease once information 587 
saturation is reached. Nof1 participants will receive an electronic gift card of $ 30. A postcard 588 
consent will be read to the patient prior to the commencement of the interview (Attachments – 589 
Satisfaction Postcard Consent v9.30 (for DH/UCH), Satisfaction Postcard Consent v5.23 (for 590 
the VA) ). 591 
592 
593 
Assessment of provider and health systems leaders perceptions 594 
We will conduct key-informant interviews with up to 2-3 providers (6-9 across the 3 HCS) 595 
from each setting whose patients have received the intervention to get their feedback about 596 
the intervention and the intervention effects o n their patient’s medication taking behavior. 597 
For some providers, they may have received a note from the study team informing them that 598 
their patient did not refill their medications and we will also interview the providers on their 599 
perceptions of that process. We will also conduct key-informant interviews with health 600 
systems leaders (3-6 interviewees) in each setting who are responsible for institutional 601 
policies related to patient data-management, informatics and pharmacy. In these 602 
interactions, we will share findings from the research and gauge their reaction to the findings. 603 
With any indication of positive outcomes, we will ask participants to describe their likelihood 604 
to maintain the system within their setting, and to discuss any barriers to maintenanc e and 605 
specific actions needed to overcome these barriers.  606 
Study Evaluation 607 
The study will be evaluated using the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability 608 
Model (PRISM) and RE-AIM framework components of Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, 609 
Implementation and Maintenance. We will also develop tools and a sustainability plan to 610 
broadly disseminate the intervention, if effective. PRISM considers important implementation 611 
concepts from Diffusion of Innovations, the Chronic Care Model, the Model for Improvement, 612 
and the RE-AIM framework and highlights four components that influence implementation 613 
success: 1) organizational and participants characteristics; 2) intervention characteristics from 614 
the organizational (health care system and providers) and partici pants’ perspectives (i.e., 615 
patients); 3) implementation and sustainability infrastructure (training and support); and 4) 616 
14 external environment. These four elements will be assessed in a formative manner and will be 617 
critical to understanding how to further disseminate the intervention if demonstrated to be 618 
effective. PRISM also identifies a set of important outcomes from the RE-AIM model (i.e., 619 
Reach and Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) for evaluation. We will 620 
incorporate the assessme nt of the 4 components that influence implementation success into 621 
our evaluation and this will be further discussed in the implementation evaluation section below 622 
(Table 2 ).  623

Data Management 626 
 We will set up a distributed network across the 3 HCS and each HCS will manage their own 627 
data in the delivery of the study intervention. We will set up parallel processes so that each of 628 
the sites can monitor patients for gaps in medication refills and can deliver the intervention 629 
when needed. This will keep patient PHI within each of the HCS without the data leaving the 630 
HCS. We envision that this will be the process for other HCS that want to adopt the 631 
intervention if the intervention is demonstrated to be effective across the NIH Collaboratory 632 
sites.  633 
15 At UCHealth and DH, pharmacy data is available for prescriptions filled within the HCS 634 
pharmacy as well as non-HCS pharmacy. Data for prescriptions filled at non-HCS pharmacy 635 
are automatically obtained at both UCHealth and DH as part of their routine clinical operations 636 
in the care of their patients through Surescripts. For example, we have all pharmacy data for 637 
UCHealth patients, which is derived from the following sources: ~15% from UCHealth 638 
pharmacy and ~85% from non-UCHealth pharmacy. Surescripts pharmacy data are available 639 
at the current time for Denver Health and will be estimated to become available in the Fall of 640 
2019 for UCHealth.  641 
642 
Data Movement 643 
Programmers will upload data to the appropriate secure server in an appropriate format. All data 644 
will be kept separate from the data associated with the other affiliated healthcare systems. Data 645 
will be accessed by a centralized programmer from the Nudge Team via secure server to put 646 
into Mobile Messenger (Figure 2 ). 647

Stakeholder Panel 651 
Stakeholder engagement in research is an important and challenging task. On one hand, we 652 
want to avoid tokenism and want stakeholders to be as involved as they would like to be. On the 653 
other hand, meaningful engagement can require a substantial time commitment . In a previous 654 
study (COMIRB #18-0630), we develop ed a standing stakeholder panel. We will continue to 655 
convene the Stakeholder panel quarterly, as needed. 656 
Participants:  The stakeholder panel consists of up to 5 people from each HCS : 1-2 of 657 
the following: patients, pharmacists, providers and persons involved in the leadership or 658 
operations of the health system from each HCS. Members previously recruited through 659 
relationships of the investigators will be welcome t o join. New members will be identified 660 
through existing relationships / snowball recruiting. 661 
Location:  The panel will meet in a central, secure location with ample free parking . 662 
Each member of the panel will be reimbursed $50 per meeting. 663

Protection of Human Subjects  672 
This research project involves human subjects recruited from three health care systems (HCS): 673 
1) University of Colorado Health; 2) Denver VA Medical Center; 3) Denver Health and Hospital 674 
Authority. We will identify eligible patients from the 3 HCS using the electronic medical record 675 
system of each HCS. Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to participate in 676 
the study: the presence of 1 or more of the following cardiovascular conditions (hypertension, 677 
hyperlipiemia, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and/or atrial fibrillation) and are prescribed 1 or 678 
more of the classes of medications to treat the cardiovascular conditions (b-blockers, calcium 679 
channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), angiot ension 680 
receptor blockers (ARB), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statins), thiazide diuretics, PGY-2 681 
inhibitors (anti-platelets), direct oral anticoagulants, oral diabetes medications). These inclusion 682 
criteria are designed to identify a group of adults with suboptimal medication adherence who 683 
would benefit from the proposed intervention. Participants are not eligible if they meet any 684 
exclusion criterion: 1) patients who do not have either a landline nor cellphone; 2) enrolled in 685 
hospice or palliative care; 3) Non-English or Spanish speaking. We plan to enroll up to 100 686 
subjects from each of the healthcare systems, resulting in enrollment of up to 300 patients total. 687 
The study team believes that this project poses minimal risk to all subjects involved. There is no 688 
clinical intervention being proposed, and no deeply personal matters will be discussed. The goal 689 
of this study is to ensure that patients take their medications as prescribed. 690 
Among patients who fulfil these eligibility criteria, we will send them a le tter outlining the study 691 
and include an opt-out postcard. Within the opt-out packet will include an introductory letter, 692 
information about the study, the opt out form, and a self addressed, stamped envelope. The 693 
envelope will be directed to a PRA within the Data Science to Patient Value (D2V) initiative, who 694 
will remove the participant from the potential list, and save the consent in secure, locked cabinet, 695 
as noted in the IRB application. Should an opt-out package be returned, a D2V PRA will call the 696 
poten tial participant no more than 2 times to verify their address; should we not hear from the 697 
participant, we will not include them in the study. 698 
For patients who do no t return the letter after the proposed deadline, we will include them in the 699 
study. Additionally, we will engage our stakeholder panel in designing, refining, and 700 
implementing the intervention. Stakeholder participants have been previously consented via 701 
postcard consent. 702 
703 
Study subject identification 704 
Study subjects will be identified using electronic data. For the Stakeholder Panel, we will 705 
continue to involve our existing Stakeholder Panel in the study, and recruit through existing 706 
relationships and/or snowball recruitment techniques as needed. 707 
We will request a waiver of documented consent from study subjects as this study is very low 708 
risk and could not be reasonably completed without such. As described previously, we will 709 
provide all potential participants with a packet of information about the study, an opt-out letter, 710 
and a self-addressed stamped envelope. The text messages will also allow for opting out by 711 
texing STOP (as described above).  712 
17 The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the U.S. Code of 713 
Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21 CFR (Part 50 – Protection of Human Subjects and Part 56 – 714 
Institutional Review Boards) and the Declaration of Helsinki.  715 
716 
Sources of Materials 717 
Trained and certified professional staff will manage all data according to detailed study protocols. 718 
Data will be used specifically for research purposes. All materials will be created for low-literacy 719 
populations, and also be translated to  Spanish for our Latino population. Materials will be 720 
reviewed by our Stakeholder Panel as applicable. 721 
722 
Potential Risks to Participants 723 
We do not anticipate any substantial risks to be associated with participation in this study. As 724 
with any study involving participants with chronic disease, however, there is some risk of 725 
psychological discomfort related to discussing disease management.  Participants will be 726 
informed that if they choose to discontinue the study at any time, this will not interfere with their 727 
usual medical care. 728 
729 
As with all research, there is always a slight risk of loss of confidentiality . We have standard 730 
operating procedures for data acquisition and data management designed to protect against 731 
data loss and maintain patient confidentialit y. Computer files will be password protected. Files 732 
containing names, addresses, or other personal identifiers will have a separate password and 733 
will be accessible only to personnel who need to contact subjects. 734 
735 
Behavioral incentives (nudges) will be administered to the participants as a method to reinforce 736 
the treatment plan prescribed by physicians that patients have already received. The nudges 737 
themselves will not prescribe medicines nor introduce new instructions/treatments. However, 738 
there is some risk that patients will interpret the text message information that is ‘tailored’ to 739 
them has been approved by their physician or that a computerized system is foolproof. 740 
741 
742 
Adequacy of Protection of Risk  743 
744 
To mitigate the above risks, t he text message nudges will contain a secondary opportunity for 745 
opt-out, and will contain pharmacy contact information, should the patient decide to discontinue 746 
their participation or want to contact the pharmacist with questions or need more information 747 
about the intervention  or their prescribed medications. Contact information for those opting out 748 
of the study will be maintained in a separate file and deleted as soon as recruitment is complete.  749 
The opt out consent will also state that the text messages are not from their doct or. 750 
751 
As is the standard, all staff participating in the project will complete compliance and human 752 
subject research training and all recruitment materials and consent forms will be approved by 753 
the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB).  754 
755 
Potential Benefits to Subjects  756 
No claim is made that subjects will benefit from participation in this project. However, the results 757 
of the study may improve care to the extent that our study improves medication adherence.  758 
759 
18 Data Quality, Transfer, and Security 760 
Designated study team members will oversee all Nudge Study data-related activities, including 761 
data quality monitoring and data security . All data will be stored on a secure server, separate for 762 
each site. Designated research team members will oversee local and central data quality 763 
checks for proper formatting, completeness and consistency. A data privacy and security 764 
protections plan, consistent with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and 765 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, will be in place prior to project commencement. Research team members 766 
will establish data use or business associate agreements for sharing data.  767 
768 
Nof1 Addendum proposal (1/ 24/21)  769 
770 
Interview overview 771 
Trained qualitative researchers will conduct Nof1 (one-on-one)  qualitative interviews to assess 772 
the usability and preference of a proposed research study that is being built off of the existing 773 
Nudge Study. Interviews will be held over Zoom (Sample questions are available in Appendix I ; 774 
sample messages are demonstrat ed in Appendix II ). Meetings should not exceed 60 minutes 775 
and patients will be reminded they can stop at any time. Patients will be notified that the Zoom 776 
meeting will be recorded. 777 
778 
Patient population   779 
We will purposively sample diverse patients from each setting to gain a balance of older and 780 
younger; male, female and non-gender conforming; Spanish and English speakers; and persons 781 
who identify as Latinx and/or Black proportional to their representation as patients at Denver 782 
Health. Patients must reside in the State of Colorado, speak English or Spanish, own a cell 783 
phone, and have the ability to participate in a virtual Zoom interview.  784 
785 
Recruitment methods   786 
Nudge Study PRAs will recruit patients from a Denver Health cardiovascular clinic under the 787 
direction of Site PI Pamela Peterson, MD, MSPH. PRAs will recruit an estimated 20 (no more 788 
than 30 ) patients with at least one cardiovascular condition and prescribed at least one 789 
medication to treat the condition of interest. Due to the Cov id-19 January surge, PRAs will 790 
recruit patients that would otherwise be recruited in person via the phone to reduce Covid 791 
transmission.  792 
793 
Consent 794 
Patients will be read a verbal postcard consent for this study over the phone as minimal risk is 795 
introduced in these interviews; no deeply personal matters will be discussed.  796 
797 
Compensation  798 
Patients participating in interviews will be offered a gift card for an online store valued at $ 50 for 799 
their participation. 800

EFFECTIVENESS STATIS TICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  (SAP) – REVISED  04/20/2023  1 
 2 
Summary of revision  3 
 4 
This revision of the analytic plan was motivated by several external disruptions during the 5 
conduct of the study, and by a brief examination of treatment -blinded outcome data.   The main 6 
changes to the original Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) involve the method used to  model  the 7 
primary PDC outcome, detailed specification of adjustment covariates, and adjustment for 8 
differing lengths of follow -up due to death, chang es in prescriptions , or external disruptions.   No 9 
changes to primary or secondary  outcomes are proposed.   The changes of substance occur  10 
only in Section s 3.1.a-e. 11 
 12 
1. Study summary  13 
 14 
The primary outcome will be medication adherence defined as the proportion of days covered 15 
(PDC) in the 12 months post randomization.  This will be a composite measure across a 16 
patient’s multiple medications and will be assessed using pharmacy refill data. Secondary 17 
outcomes will include intermediate clinical meas ures (e.g., BP control), CV clinical events (e.g., 18 
hospitalization for myocardial infarction) and procedures (e.g. PCI), medication -associated 19 
clinical events (e.g., syncope in patient on anti -hypertensive therapy), healthcare utilization, and 20 
costs.  Thes e outcomes will also be assessed at 12 months, with cost and utilization also 21 
assessed for specific components as described below.  22 
 23 
Study description: This individually randomized three -center trial will compare three behavioral 24 
nudges based on text and chatbot messaging with usual care to improve adherence to 25 
cardiovascular medications.  26 
 27 
Setting:  The study will  be conducted in 17 primary care clinics within 3 health care systems 28 
(University of Colorado Health, VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System, and Denver Health 29 
Medical Center).  30 
 31 
Design: The study will be a n individually  randomized controlled study with four treatment arms  32 
(details of interventions below) .  Patients become eligible for the study when  identified through 33 
pharmacy refill data to have a 7-day gap in any prescribed CV medication refills . Eligible 34 
patients  will be randomized to one of four arms.  Randomization will be stratified within each of 35 
the clinics, and further stratified within clinics  by patients with 1 -2 vs 3 or more active CV 36 
medi cation classes at baseline , and using blocks of 4 patients to ensure balance within clinics 37 
over time. Thus, within each clinic and number of other medication stratum, each set of 4 38 
consecutively enrolled subjects will be randomized to the four study arms. Treatments will be 39 
initiated im mediately upon randomization, in response to the 7 -day gap.  40 
 41 
Intervention: The four treatment arms will be 1) usual care (control); 2) generic text message 42 
reminder; 3) text message behavioral nudges only; or 4) text message behavioral nudge plus a 43 
pre-programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to identify and resolve barriers to medication 44 
refill and adherence.  45 
 46 
Delivery of treatments will be as follows:  47 
For patients randomized to one of the three active intervention arms:  48 
- If a patient gaps on a medicati on at baseline, they receive a text to refill that medication.  49 
- If a patient gaps on multiple medications at baseline, they receive only one text about all 50 
of the medications they gapped on.  51 
- If a patient later gaps on any study medication, they will receive  a reminder, regardless 52 
of whether they had gapped on or been prescribed the medication at baseline.  53 
- If a patient is removed from a medication, no further texts are sent for that medication.  54 
Patients randomized to the control arm receive no texts  or other reminders . 55 
 56 
2. Study outcomes  57 
 58 
Primary and secondary o utcomes: The study outcomes have been selected based on input 59 
directly elicited from patients and other stakeholders. The primary outcome is adherence to CV 60 
medications as measured by 12 -month composite  proportion of days covered (PDC).  61 
Secondary outcomes include alternate measures of CV medication adherence, clinical events 62 
(e.g., event times for stroke, MI, mortality), utilization of care (e.g., hospitalizations or clinic visits 63 
for CV -related reasons) , and costs of healthcare utilization. Subjects will be followed for at least 64 
12 months following randomization to assess these secondary outcomes. Subjects who have 65 
more than one year of follow -up (up to 3 years depending on when they are enrolled during 66 
years 2 -3) will continue to be followed for secondary outcomes.   67 
 68 
Ascertainment of Outcomes: Data for the primary outcome PDC will be obtained using  69 
pharmacy records from each of the healthcare systems during the 365 -day follow -up. The 70 
medication refill d ata needed to assess PDC is routinely collected in the pharmacy databases of 71 
each of the participating sites.  72 
 73 
During the UG3 phase, the data management workgroup developed definitions and 74 
specifications for the secondary outcomes that will be captured fr om the EHR at each of the 75 
three healthcare systems.  International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth 76 
Revision  (ICD 9 and 10), CPT and DRG codes identifying CV clinical events, CV procedures, 77 
and adverse medication associated clinical events have been compiled to ensure  accurate 78 
identification these outcomes. Outcome measures for BP and LDL have also been standardized 79 
using NIH Collaboratory definitions for these standardized EHR data elements ( Appendix V) . 80 
The data core successfully used EHR and administrative data to assess for each of these 81 
outcomes  during the UG3 pilot year.  82 
  83 
Several sources of cost data will be used. To capture costs of development, implementation and 84 
maintenance of the intervention,  we will develop instruments (e.g. time lo gs) and procedures to 85 
prospectively capture resource use associated with the intervention including what was done, 86 
who did it, how long it took, and what nonhuman resources were required. This is further 87 
discussed in greater detail in the health economics plan. In brief, intervention costs will be the 88 
cost of implementing the intervention excluding research and development costs. Costs 89 
associated with healthcare utilization  will also be estimated using a resource -based method 90 
previously developed to assign costs to encounter data. Inpatient utilization will be measured 91 
using diagnostic -related groups (DRGs), outpatient utilization using relative value units (RVUs), 92 
and cost of pharmacy utilization using the midpoint between the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) 93 
and the National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC). Inpatient costs will be estimated by 94 
applying national payment weights to DRGs, outpatient costs by applying a national conversion 95 
factor to RVUs, and pharmacy costs as the median between the FSS and NADAC. Please refer 96 
to health economic plan analysis for further details.  97

3.1 Analysis  of primary  composite PDC  outcome  103 
 104 
3.1.a Summary of modeling approach  105 
We propose to calculate a composite PDC ratio of days covered for each subject and analyze it 106 
using a standard longitudinal model  for monthly PDC values, with a linear mean model , and with 107 
robust standard error estimation and associated inference based on weighted G eneralized 108 
Estimating Equations (GEE) , e.g. Robins et al., 1995; Preisser et al., 2002 .  In more detail and 109 
with rationale:  110 
Outcome distribution :  Since data are in the form of a discrete proportion, our original 111 
proposal was based on Bernoulli/ binomial models.  However, treatment -blinded examination of 112 
a sample of outcome data show ed that the binomial assumption will not apply due to spikes 113 
caused by common prescription  lengths  (e.g. 30 and 90 days) , and strong overdispersion or 114 
equivalently lack of independence of daily outcome data over time.  We considered alternative 115 
approaches such as Poisson with offset for number of observation days but similar challenges 116 
of spikes, overdispersion and lack of indepe ndence remain.  Ultimately, w ith the large number of 117 
subjects available for analysis ( ~10,000 ) and the bounded distribution of PDC (between 0 and 118 
1), central limit theorem arguments make standard linear modeling valid  in this situation  (e.g. 119 
Lumley et al.,  2002 ), and robust inference methods described below provide additional 120 
assurance of valid inference even with heteroscedastic variance in the outcomes . 121 
Missing and truncated follow -up:  Missing data and truncated follow -up for PDC have 122 
occurred for several reasons.   Patients with inpatient stays have  medications supplied by the 123 
hospital  and thus don’t deplete their own supplies , so such days are omitted from both 124 
numerator and denominator of PDC .  Other situations resulted in early termination of PDC  125 
calculation.  Prescribed medications are sometimes  terminat ed by providers , or patients may die  126 
during follow -up.  Additionally, i nitial study procedures did not allow for collection of outcome 127 
data on patients who opted out, and while this was fixed early in the study a small percentage  of 128 
early patients have shorter PDC observation .  Finally, treatment deliver y was disrupted by two  129 
external situations specific to health care systems , one involving a new VA messaging system 130 
that would confound delivery of Nudge treatment messages, and one involving gap identification 131 
for patients at UCHealth.  In both cases, when the issue occurred o ur enrollment targets had 132 
been surpassed at each system.  Delivery of Nudge treatments was stopped and collection of 133 
daily PDC outcome data was truncated.   The disruptions due to these two exogenous  events  134 
result ed in data that can be assumed missing compl etely at random  (MCAR) , however this is 135 
likely not true for the other cases of early termination of PDC observation .  Further examination 136 
of the treatment -blinded outcome data showed a n increasing trend over time  from time zero  in 137 
PDC during periods shortly after randomi zation, due to the initial gaps.  This together with early 138 
termination could result in biased estimation.  139 
Longitudinal models  and GEE :  To account for the situations of shortened PDC observation 140 
and possible resulti ng biases we will use a longitudinal model with PDC calculated for monthly 141 
intervals.  We will use GEE  with identity link  and independence with unequal variances for the 142 
covariance structure.   This approach provides robust and likely conservative (Hernán  et al., 143 
2002) estimation using empirical (sandwich) variance estimates, but  is valid only for MCAR 144 
data.  However,  use of weighting can extend GEE  to data missing at random (MAR) .  In this 145 
approach, observation -specific weights are equal to the inverse pr obability that the longitudinal 146 
value was observed.  Probability of observation will be estimated by a logistic regression model 147 
for whether the value was observed (y/n) , with  covariates listed in section 3.1.c below.   Weights 148 
greater than the 95th percentile of weights will be set to the 95th percentile weight.  These 149 
methods can be implemented for example in SAS PROC  GEE (Lin & Rodriguez, 2015)  or R 150 
package wgeesel  (Xu et al., 2018) .  We will use multiple imputation to impute missing 151 
covariate dat a.  We will carry out the recommended sensitivity analyses to the MAR assumption 152 
using methods based on pattern mixture models  and imputation , by assuming a range of  153 
perturbations of imputed values and  assessing differences in  model conclusions  (e.g. White et 154 
al., 2011; Fiero et al., 2017 ). 155 
Treatment comparisons :  Discussions with clinicians have indicated expressing results on a 156 
linear scale (PDC differences), as opposed to odds ratios or risk ratios, will be most appropriate 157 
for interpretation.  This  occurs naturally with the linear specification in 3.1.a  and identity link in 158 
GEE .  Estimation and i nference will be carried out using the parameter estimates from the 159 
robust GEE estimation  to construct expected PDC treatment differences .  The estimand 160 
comparisons will be 12 -month PDC, calculated by summing  the 12 monthly longitudinal 161 
parameters, which incorporate the adjustments  for early termination of some subjects using the 162 
weighted GEE approach.  Primary hypotheses involve pairwise comparisons between each of 163 
the four study arms, and will be conducted using a  multistage gatekeeper approach to account  164 
for the multiple treatment comparisons. In stage 1 of this approach, each of the three active 165 
intervention arms is compared with the control arm using significance level 0.05/3. In stage 2, if 166 
any of the three stage 1 tests is significant, the three pairw ise comparisons among active 167 
intervention arms are tested with the Holm method using significance level (R/3)*(0.05/3), where 168 
R is the number of stage 1 tests that were significant  (Dmetrienko et al., 2008 ).  169 
 170 
3.1.b Defining composite PDC for multiple medi cations  171 
There are 13 CV medication  classe s considered in this study, and t he primary outcome is 172 
composite PDC across medications a patient is prescribed.  There are several considerations in 173 
defining composite PDC, including which of a patient’s medications to include in the composite 174 
PDC calculation , and calculation of composit e PDC with  differing lengths of follow -up for 175 
different medications.  176 
Medications to include in composite PDC:   We have  consider ed three ways of selecting 177 
medications to include in the primary PDC outcome: PDC1) all medications on which a patient 178 
gapped at baseline, PDC2) all medications a patient ever gaps on, calculating PDC from the 179 
time of gap, and PDC3) all medications a patient  was prescribed at baseline.  Medications 180 
prescribed after the baseline gap and enrollment will not be included in any of these definitions 181 
of PDC, though they will be considered in secondary analyses.  Each definition (1 -3) has 182 
benefits and shortcomings.  PDC1 is closest to a pure effect of the intervention, but exploratory 183 
analyses of pilot data have shown that many patients who gap in a medication and are 184 
randomized also gap in another medication shortly thereafter.  Specifically, preliminary data 185 
indica te that ~16% of patients gap on an additional medication within 30 days of baseline and 186 
~37% within 90 days.  PDC1 will omit these other medications prescribed but not gapped on at 187 
baseline. PDC2 provides a similar estimate incorporating these later -gapped  medications but 188 
excludes medications the patient may never gap on due to reminders for other medications.  189 
PDC3 provides an estimate of the overall effect of the interventions on medication patterns, 190 
incorporating indirect effects of reminders, but risks inflating PDC and diluting intervention 191 
effects by including medications the patient never gaps on.  Our primary analyses will use 192 
PDC1, while PDC2 and PDC3 will be considered in secondary analyses.  193 
Composite PDC with differing lengths of follow -up:  In ge neral, PDC is the sum of 194 
observation days covered divided by the sum of observation days.  Due to variations from the 195 
planned 365 days of assessment, t here are several ways of calculating composite PDC for 196 
multiple medications.  Information on hospitalizat ions, and on medication changes and 197 
cancellations, will be available from the patient’s electronic health record. Note that at -risk days 198 
is medication specific, as medications may change during the one -year assessment period.  Our 199 
primary PDC calculation will be PDC -C1 = (sum of numerators of medication -specific PDCs) / 200 
(sum of denominators of medication -specific PDCs).  This can also be viewed as a weighted 201 
sum of medication -specific PDCs with weights equal to the proportion of the 365 target days for 202 
which PDC was observed, and equally weights each day on each medication.  PDC -C1 will be 203 
the outcome  definition  in the longitudinal models described in section 3.1.a.  As a sensitivity 204 
analysis w e will also consider an alternate definition, PDC -C2 = average of medication -specific 205 
PDCs, which equally weights medications regardless of their length of observation.  When all 206 
medications are observed for 365 days these definitions are equal.   For the longitudinal 207 
analyses planned, these definitions will  be applied within each longitudinal interval.   We will 208 
carry out the recommended sensitivity analyses based on pattern mixture models, by assuming 209 
various values for difference in means between observed and unobserved data and assessing 210 
differences in mod el conclusions.  211 
 212 
3.1.c Adjustment /propensity  covariates  213 
The linear weighted GEE model for PDC and the logistic model for propensity of observation will 214 
each contain terms for randomization stratification variables health care system (VA, Denver 215 
Health or CUHealth), number of CV medications prescribed at baseline (1 -2 or 3+), calendar 216 
month of randomization ; treatment arm, follow -up month from randomization in longitudinal 217 
analysis , and treatment by follow -up month interaction ; patient demographic s age, rac e, 218 
ethnicity, insurance status, and marital status;  and comorbidity variables  hypertension, 219 
hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, chronic heart failure, chronic 220 
kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease, prior myocardial inf arction, prior revascularization, 221 
depression, PTSD, and substance abuse.  222 
 223 
3.1.d Alternate  measures of medication adherence  224 
We will consider several alternate analyses  for medication adherence .   225 
Alternate definitions of PDC:   Alternate definitions PDC2 and PDC3  and alternate composite 226 
PDC -C2 defined above will be analyzed using the same methods as for the primary definition 227 
PDC1 -C1.  These analyses will provide a better understanding of indirect effects of treatments, 228 
and of effects of treatments on all medications a patient is prescribed.    229 
Sensitivity to inactive medications :  Among medications gapping at baseline, we will  repeat 230 
the primary analysis  limiting our analyses to those  medications  that had at least one fill during 231 
the follow -up period.  This will allow us to assess treatment effect s among medications that are 232 
known to be active, removing medications that were cancelled but not indicated  as such by the 233 
medical record . 234 
Medication -specific adherence:   We w ill calculate and analyze PDC for each medication 235 
individually, to allow analyses of heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) by drug class .  Multiple 236 
comparisons will be adjusted for separately for each analysis using the gatekeeper approach 237 
described abov e. 238 
Medication gaps:   We will consider alternate ways of describing medication adherence 239 
behavior,  including length of initial gap, time to subsequent gap, average length of gaps, and 240 
number of 7 -day gaps . 241 
 242 
3.1.e Secondary examinations of medication adherence  243 
In secondary analyses we will examine several other questions related to medication 244 
adherence, including:  245 
Predictors of medication gaps:   We will examine predictors of patients having an initial gap 246 
of at least 7 days, using the initial pool of c andidate patients, to identify types of patients or 247 
prescription characteristics for patients at highest risk for non -adherence .  We will also examine  248 
predictors of subjects having a gap of at least 7 days while enrolled in the study . 249 
Mechanism of treatment effects:   We will carry out  analyses examining mechanisms or 250 
mediators of treatment effect by considering direct responses to reminders, including time from 251 
first reminder to refill, and measures of patient engagement, e.g. number of patient text  252 
responses to reminders (intensive text and chatbot arms only).  253 
Heterogeneity of treatment effect :  We will carry out analyses examining HTE, specifically i) 254 
HTE between the three health care systems, and ii) HTE for patient characteristics or subgroups 255 
of particular interest. HTE analyses will be carried out using interactions as recommended in 256 
Kent et al., 2010 23 and will be considered exploratory.  257

3.1.f Original po wer analysis  259 
We first estimate sample size required to achieve 80% power for the desired change in the 260 
primary outcome, then used current data to show we will be able to achieve this sample size.  261 
Power and sample size:  Required sample size was e stimated for the primary outcome PDC 262 
during the 12 months following randomization. Preliminary data from the VA were used for these 263 
estimates. We made the following assumptions:  a) Significance using two -sided level 0.05 264 
tests, b) Power at least 80%; c) D ifference between treatments in PDC of 10 percentage points; 265 
d) Bonferroni adjustment for the 6 pairwise comparisons among the 4 study arms, resulting in 266 
adjusted level 0.05/6 (a conservative alternative of the sequential gatekeeper approach to be 267 
used in the final analysis as described above, to simplify the calculation of power); e) Analysis 268 
stratified by health care system; and f) Within -system and within -treatment residual standard 269 
deviation of 12 month PDC equal to 0.22 (mean 0.732), obtained by analys is of 2,859  veterans 270 
during the period 01/01/2017 – 12/31/2017 who were prescribed the medications of interest in 271 
this study. The large SD is due to a highly left -skewed PDC distribution.  (We base sample size 272 
estimation on t -tests rather than the proposed  binomial models since we do not have estimates 273 
of quantities needed to carry out power simulations. We may be able to obtain data for the PDC 274 
outcome for a set of baseline patients, in which case we will consider a refined power analysis.)  275 
Using these as sumptions and estimates, and comparing any two treatments using a linear 276 
model with the above residual standard deviation of PDC, we estimate using sample size 277 
functions in R that we will need N=119 subjects per treatment arm, total across the three health  278 
care systems, for a total of 476 subjects to be randomized across the three health care systems.  279 
Available sample sizes:   We obtained data from each of the three health care systems on 280 
the number of patients at the seventeen specific clinics (VA, 4 clinic s; UCHealth, 5 clinics; DH 8 281 
clinics) to be included in this study. Figure 1, which we believe to present conservative 282 
estimates of enrollment, shows estimated numbers of patients with CVD conditions and 283 
prescribed CVD medications across the 3 HCS. Patient s will be sent a letter with the opportunity 284 
to opt -out. In addition, care providers will be provided lists of their patients who are potentially 285 
eligible for the study to see if there are patients that they feel should not be included in the 286 
study. Assumi ng that 75% of patients have a gap, another 15% of patients opt -out of the study 287 
following randomization, and 10% of patients do not have usable outcome data, we expect to 288 
have usable outcome data for about 7,740 patients across the four study arms.  289 
Plann ed enrollment:   In the patient accrual proposal sent to NHLBI (March 20, 2019), we 290 
proposed to enroll 5,000 patients which is a conservative estimate in case the number of 291 
patients opting out is higher than in the pilot or the number of patients with 7 -day gaps is lower 292 
than estimated. Even with this conservative estimate, we expect to have ample subjects (nearly 293 
ten times as many as needed) to achieve the necessary power for the primary analysis of PDC. 294 
Additional subjects will provide power for secondary analyses, and for analyses of secondary 295 
outcomes.  296 
Achieved sample sizes 3/2023  297 
We surpassed our overall enrollment goal of 5,000 patients, enrolling 1,235 patients the VA, 298 
7,266 patients at Denver Health, and 1,000 patients at UCHealth.  299

3.2 Analysis of secondary outcomes  301 
 302 
The secondary outcomes of clinical events, care utilization and cost will be analyzed using 303 
similar approaches as for the primary outcome but based on appropriate models, e.g. Cox 304 
survival models for time to clinical event or rehospital ization, generalized gamma regression for 305 
cost, etc. Standardization methods allow results to be expressed on interpretable scales such 306 
as risk difference (e.g. Sjolander, 2016).22  Data will be analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., 307 
Cary, NC) and R software. In the table below, we provide an estimate of the secondary 308 
outcomes of interest based on a cohort of patients who would have been potentially eligible for 309 
the study from 2 of our health systems. This illustrates that we are able to capture these 310 
outcomes.  311

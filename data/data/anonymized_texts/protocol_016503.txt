In case of unacceptably frequent spontaneous breakthrough BEs (i.e., more than 2 spontane-ous BEs or 1 major spontaneous BE within a 30- day period), the dose of Wilate 
should be 
increased by approximately 5 IU/kg (depending on the entire content of the additional vial(s) 
that need(s) to be reconstituted). If, after a dose increase, patients still experience more than 
2 spontaneous bleeding epis odes, the dosing interval should be shortened from 2 times per 
week to 3 times per week.  
Wilate Dosage for the Treatment of Breakthrough BEs:  
The following should be used to guide dosing in the treatment of BEs: 
Dose Type  Minor haemorrhage * Major haemorrhage  
Loading dose  20–40 IU/kg  40–60 IU/kg  
Maintenance dose  20–30 IU/kg every 12 –24 hours  20–40 IU/kg every 12 –24 hours  
Therapeutic goal  Maintain VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) and FVIII:C 
trough levels >30%  Maintain VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) and 
FVIII:C trough levels >50%  
*Menstrual bleeds of regular intensity (i.e., minor menstrual haemorrhage) will be considered normal and are not
expected to require therapy unless deemed necessary by the investigator and/or the patient.
Surgical Prophylaxis: 
The following should be used to guide dosing in surgical prophylaxis: 
Dose type  Minor surgeries (incl. tooth extra ctions)  Major surgeries  
Loading dose  30–60 IU/kg  40–60 IU/kg  
Maintenance dose  15–30 IU/kg, or half the loading dose, every 
12–24 hours for up to 3 days  20–40 IU/kg, or half the loading dose, 
every 12 –24 hours for up to 6 days or 
longer  
Therapeutic goal  Achieve VWF:Ac (VWF:RCo ) peak levels of 
50% after loading dose and trough levels of 
>30% during maintenance dosesAchieve VWF:Ac (VWF:RCo ) peak 
level of 100% after loading dose and trough levels of >50% during mainte-
nance doses  
DURATION OF TREATMENT:

EFFICACY PARAMETERS:  
For the evaluation of efficacy, the following parameters will be documented: 
IMP Administration Data  
The following parameters will be documented: 
Dates and times of IMP injections
Doses of IMP in IU and IU/kg and IMP batch numbers
Purpose of IMP injection (IVR, prophylaxis, prophylaxis of recurrent bleeding,
treatment of BE, surgery, prophylaxis after surgery, or menstrual bleeds)
Bleeding Episode (BE) Data 
Study participants will be instructed by the investigator on recordi ng all BEs  and in how to 
record them . For any BE occurring during the study, the following data will be recorded: 
BE type (spontaneous, traumatic, postoperative, other)
BE site
BE severity (minor or major , based on predefined criteria)
Date and time the BE  first occurred or was first noticed
Date and time the BE ended

Assessment of the efficacy of treatment at the end of the BE
All of these parameters will be documented by the patient (together with the investigator in 
case of on- site treatments  or together with the nurse in case a home -care service is used ) in 
the patient diary. Patients who experience a major BE should be treated at the study site, if possible. 
Based on these data, the frequency of BEs and the TABR and SABR under prophylactic treat-ment will be calculated.  
Assessment of Adherence with the Infusion Regimen  
Throughout the study, adherence with the infusion regimen will be assessed . Any change of 
the prophylactic dose as determined by the Principal Investigator during the Baseline Visit 
will be documented in the patient records and eCRF, including start and end dates of each 
dose, reasons for dose change, or reasons  for not implementing a required dose change .

Surgeri es are defined as major  if any of the following criteria are met:  
General or spinal anaesthesia required
Opening into the great body cavities required
Severe haemorrhage during surgery possible
Haemostatic therapy for at least 6 days required
Orthopaedic interventions involving joints (ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, shoulder)
3rd molar extraction or extraction of ≥ 3 teeth
Surgeries/conditions in which the patient’s life is at stake
The classification is made prospectively. All other surgeries are classified as minor . 
Efficacy in Surgical Prophylaxis 
Efficacy will be assessed at the end of surgery by the surgeon and at end of the postoperative period by the haematologist. In both case
s, predefined assessment criteria will be used. In 
addition, an overall assessment of efficacy will be made at the end of the postoperative period by the investigator. 
At the End of Surgery (by Surgeon) 
At the end of surgery, the haemostatic efficacy of Wilate will be assessed by the surgeon using 
the following predefined criteria:  
Efficacy Assessment at the End of Surgery  
Excellent  Intraoperative blood loss was lower than or equal to the average expected blood loss for the type 
of procedure performed in a patient with normal haemostasis and of the same sex, age, and stat-ure.  
Good  Intraoperative blood loss was higher than the average expected blood loss but lower or equal to the maxim um expected blood loss for the type of procedure in a patient with normal haemostasis. 
Moderate  Intraoperative blood loss was higher than the maximum expected blood loss for the type of proce-
dure performed in a patient with normal haemostasis, but haemostasis was controlled.  
None  Haemostasis was uncontrolled, necessitating a change in the clotting factor replacement regimen.  
At the End of the Postoperative Period (by Haematologist) 
At the end of the postoperative period, the haemostatic efficacy of Wilate  will be assessed by 
the haematologist using the following predefined criteria :

Efficacy Assessment at the End of the Postoperative Period  
Excellent  No postoperative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. All postopera-
tive bleeding (due to complications of surgery) was controlled with W ilate as anticipated for the 
type of procedure.  
Good  No postoperative bleeding or oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. Control of post-operative bleeding due to complications of surgery required increased dosing with Wilate or addi-
tional injections not originally anticipated for the type of procedure.  
Moderate  Some postoperativ e bleeding and oozing that was not due to complications of surgery. Control of 
postoperative bleeding required increased dosing with Wilate or additional injections not originally 
anticipated for the type of procedure.  
None  Extensive uncontrolled postoperative bleeding and oozing. Control of postoperative bleeding re-
quired use of an alternate VWF -containing product . 
Overall Efficacy Assessment at the End of the Postoperative Period (by Investigator) 
Overall efficacy using the ‘excellent,’ ‘good,’ moderate,’ and ‘none’ scale taking both the 
intra- and postoperative assessments into account will be determined by the investigator based 
on the following algorithm:

QoL Questionnaires 
For the assessment of quality of life, PROMIS -29 will be used for all patients. In addition, 
version 2 of the 36- Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36v2) will be used for patients aged 
≥16 years , and SF -10 will be used for patients aged 6–15 years.  At each visit requiring QoL 
assessments, the questionnaires should be completed before starting any other visit assess-
ment.

STUDY PROCEDURES:  
Because all paediatric patients (6 –16 years old) enrolled in the study will undergo PK assess-
ment, whereas adult patients  (≥17 years old)  will not, the first two study visits differ between 
these two age cohorts. 
Patients will participate in the following visits:  
Screening Visit
– For adult patients–For paediatric patients
Baseline Visit
–Baseline IVR Visit for adult patients
–Baseline PK Visit for paediatric patients
1-Month IVR Vis it
2-Month IVR Visit
3-Month IVR Visit
6-Month IVR Visit
9-Month IVR Visit
Study Completion (12 -Month) Visit
Between the 3 - and 6- Month Visits, the 6 - and 9 -Month Visits, and the 9 - and 12- Month 
Visits, monthly telephone contacts  will be performed.  
Where needed, external home -care companies  with experience in conducting clinical trials 
will be contracted , with trained nurses supporting patients  by providing training, re -training,  
and oversight through home-care visit support throughout the study.

SCREENING AND BASELINE VISITS FOR ADULT PATIENTS  (≥17 YEARS OLD)  
Screening Visit  (Adult Patients)  
The following assessments will be performed:  
Obtaining voluntarily given, written (signed and dated) informed consent
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Demographic  and baseline  characteristics
Weight
Height
Medical history, including:
— VWD type  
— Prior  medications  
— Birth control measures (for female patients of child -bearing potential)  
— History of heavy menstrual bleeding (for female patients)  
Family history of VWD
Vital signs
Physical examination
Blood samples for the following assessments:
— AB0 blood group, unless derivable from the baseline characteristics  [local lab ] 
— Routine safety laboratory  [local lab]  
Urine pregnancy test  (in female patients of child -bearing potential)
Concomitant medications
During the Screening Visit, patients will also receive a patient diary . The investigator will 
explain to the patient how to fill in the diary and emphasize the importance of carefully doc-umenting any BEs, treatment details, AEs, and concomitant medications
. Menstrual bleeds 
will be documented in the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) . Therefore, fe-
male patients of child -bearing potential will also be instructed in completing the PBAC. 
After the Screening Visit, eligible patients will participate in the Basel ine IVR Visit, during 
which the IVR injection of Wilate  will be administered.  
For adult patients, t he Screening Visit and the Baseline IVR Visit may coincide ; however, 
note that administration of the first prophylactic  dose of Wilate  during the Baseline IVR Visit 
requires a washout period of at least 72 hours  from the patient’s previous administration of 
a VWF -containing product. If possible, the interval between the Screening Visit and the Base-
line IVR V isit should not  exceed 2 weeks .

Monitoring of  adverse events (AEs)
Concomitant medications
All used and unused IMP vials will be returned by the patients or their home-care providers. 
Monthly Telephone Contacts  
Monthly telephone contacts will be performed 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 months (±1 week) after 
the first prophylactic injection of Wilate . Should a patient visit the study centre at the time 
any of these telephone contacts are scheduled, the required assessments may also be per-
formed during this visit. 
The following assessments will be performed: 
Review of compliance with correctly completing the patient diary, includingcompleting the PBAC (for female patients of child -bearing potential)
Review of adh erence to the infusion regimen
Monitoring of  adverse events (AEs)
Concomitant medications
If any issues  with completing the diaries or adhering to the infusion regime n are identified, 
the investigator or home- care provider will re-train the patient accordingly. 
Unscheduled Visits and Additional Measures  
If inhibitor development is suspected (e.g., based on an unexplained need to increase the dose, 
a lack of efficacy of IMP injections,  or prolonged bleeding), VWF and FVIII inhibitor tests 
will be performed at the central laboratory and documented. 
In case of positive inhibitor results, inhibitor retesting using a second, separately drawn sam-ple should be performed, preferably within 15 days of becoming aware of the positive result.
 
Other reasons for unscheduled visits may be the occurrence of serious AEs or hospital isation s 
for BEs or surgical interventions.

Surgical Visits  
Patients may undergo surgical interventions in the course of the study. Whether or not these patients will be hospitalised will depend on the type and severity of the surgery and be at the discretion of the investigator. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN:  
Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming a mean TABR ratio (TABR pr / TABR od) of 0.25 with a correlation of 0.5 between 
the two treatment regime ns, a coefficient of variation of 10 in on- demand treatment , and a 
coefficient of variation of 10 in prophylactic treatment, 25 patients will be needed to reject 
the null hypothesis with a power of 80% using a paired t- test for log -transformed data 
The primary approach to statistical analysis will be descriptive, c omplemented by exploratory 
confidence intervals (CIs) for means or proportions.  
Efficacy of Prophylactic Treatment with Wilate  
The primary endpoint of this study is to demonstrate that the TABR during prophylactic treat-ment with Wilate  lowers the patients’ TABR observed during on -
demand treatment by more 
than 50%. To test whether the mean TABR during prophylactic treatment (TABR pr) is less 
than half the mean TABR during on- demand treatment (TABR od), the following pair of hy-
potheses will be tested using a paired t-test assuming log-normally distributed data: 
H0: mean(TABR pr / TABR od) ≥0.5 vs H 1: mean(TABR pr / TABR od) <0.5 
at a one-sided alpha level of 2.5%. Corresponding two- sided 95% CIs for TABR will also be 
presented.  
To assess the qualitative robustness of the inferential result the hypothesis will additionally be tested with the Wilcoxon (matched -pair signed rank) test on the log- transformed bleeding 
rate as a distribution -free alternative. Also, a 95% Hodges -Lehmann CI for the median dif-
ference will be reported.  
In addition, intra -individual comparisons with each patient’s documented historical TABR 
will be performed.

Efficacy of Wilate  in the Treatment of BEs  
To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment o f breakthrough BEs, a fre-
quency distribution of all successfully treated BEs will be presented overall and by severity, 
along with an exploratory 95% CI. Statistical analyses of other secondary endpoints will be 
descriptive, including exploratory 95% CIs. 
IVR Assessments  
The results of IVR assessments over time will be presented per time point and as differences 
to baseline, along with 95% CIs for the mean differences. 
PK Assessments in Paediatric Patients  
The PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive  statistics and the presentation of 
concentration vs time plots. 
Safety Analysis  
The analysis of safety will be based on the occurrence of AEs, results of safety laboratory 
testing, and the occurrence of parvovirus B19 seroconversions. Analysis of AEs will focus on treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  
Time profiles of VWF and FVIII inhibitor testing results will be analysed by presenting sam-pling statistics for the values as well as fre
quency tables for positive findings, along with 95% 
Pearson -Clopper CIs. Incidences of parvovirus B19 seroconversions between baseline and 
the end of study will be estimated, along with 95% Pearson-Clopper CIs.

1.1 Von Willebrand Disease 
Inherited von Willebrand disease (V WD) is the most common inher ited haemo rrhag ic disor-
der, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in every 100 individuals of either sex. There is wide 
geno- and phenotypic variability of the disease, and not all patients with VWD require treat-
ment.  
Three types of inher ited VW D are known. Thus, whereas type 1 and type 3 disease are charac-
terised by a qua ntitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor ( VWF), VWD type 2 arises from 
a qualitative deficiency of VWF. There are various subtypes within the three inherited types of 
VWD. VWD may also be acquired.  
Of the inherited forms, type 1 is the most common, accounting for 70–80% of cases , followed 
by type 2, which affects approx imate ly 20% of pa tients. Type 3, the most severe form of VWD 
characterised by a complete absence of VWF, is rare and affects about 1–3%  of all patients [2]. 
Treatment of VWD depends on the type and sever ity of the dis ease. Whereas m ild to  moderate  
forms of type 1 and type 2A disease often respond adequate ly to treatm ent with desmopressin 
(1-deamino-8-D- arginine vasopre ssin, DDAVP), DDAVP  is cont raindicated in type 2B and not 
effective in  type 3 disease. T reatment with  DDAVP  may  also be cont raindicated for othe r clin-
ical reasons or may be associated with signifi cant side effects.  
The appropriate treatment for the patients in whom DDAVP is ineffective or contraindicated are VWF/ fac 
tor VIII (FVIII) concentrates, which have become the mainstay of VWD treatment . 
Cryoprecipitate, which is screened for viruses but not treated to inactiva te them, is also rich in 
VWF, but is likely to be less safe than the viral- attenuated concentrates  [3]. 
VWD affects all ethnic groups and both sexes. Women are more likely to experience symptoms of VWD and may pose a special treatment challenge because of the physiological events related to menstruation, pregnancy, and birth [4]. If untreated, pregnant women with VWD are at in-
creased risk of postpartum bleeding. In women with VWD types 1 or 2, the levels of VWF and FVIII rise 2 - to 3-fold during the second and third trimesters, but fall to baseline levels soon 
after delivery. By contrast, in VWD type 2B , the increase of the abnormal VWF can cause or 
worsen thrombocytopenia. In women with VWD type 3, VWF and FVIII do not increase during 
pregnancy, so that administration of VWF -containing products  may be required during preg-
nancy and at birth [4].

Page 36 of 86 1.2 Wilate  
Wilate  is a plasma- derived, stable, highly purified, double virus  inactivated concentrate of 
freeze- dried active von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) and factor VIII (FVIII) prepared from cryo-
precipitate and intended for the treatment of patients with VWD  and/or haemophilia A. By 
introducing new biotechnological methods and optimis ed chromatographic media into the 
Wilate  manufacturing process, it has been possible to manufacture a preparation containing the 
FVIII/VWF complex in its native form and almost devoid of lower molecular weight proteins. 
Therefore, antigenic ity and immunogenic ity due  to co-purified proteins are reduced to a mini-
mum.  
Overall, 1 5 prospective clinical studies with Wilate  have been completed, 8 in patients with 
VWD and 7 in patients with haemophilia A. A summary of findings from nonclinical and clin-
ical studies with Wilate  is provided in the product’s Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 
Wilate  received its first market authorisation in Germany  in Februar y 2005. By November  2018, 
Wilate  had been licensed in 68 countries worldwide. 
1.3 Rationale for Conducting the Study 
The purpose of this study is to obtain additional data on the safety and efficacy of Wilate  in 
previously treated pa tients with VWD undergoing regular prophylaxis, thus supplementing the 
existing body of data to obtain approval of Wilate  in the prophylactic treatment of patients with 
VWD in the US A. 
1.4 Dose Rationale 
The doses for prophylaxis  (20–40 IU/kg Wilate /kg BW administered 2 –3 times per week ), the 
treatment of BEs , and perioperative prophylaxis (see S ection 5.4) are as recommended in the 
product’s European Summary of Product Characteristics. 
1.5 Benefit-Risk Statement 
The following adverse drug reactions  (ADRs)  are known to occur with other VWF/FVIII prep-
arations and may also occur with the use of Wilate : 
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions  (which may include angioedema, burning,
and stinging at the infusion site, chills, flushing, generalis ed urticaria, headache,
hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest,tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed upon use of Wilate  and may , in
some cases , progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock) with or without feve r.
On rare occasions, fever has been observed.

Page 37 of 86 Patie
nts with VWD, especially type 3 patients, may develop neutral ising  antibodies
(inhibitors) to VWF  and/or FVIII . If expected VWF:RCo and/or FVIII:C activity
plasma levels are not attained or bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, an
appropriate assay should be performed to determine whether a VWF inhibitor  and/or
factor VIII inhibitor  is present. In patients with high titres  of inhibitor, VWF therapy
may not be effective, and other therapeutic options should be considered.
As for all medicinal products prepared from human blood or plasma, infectious diseasesdue to transmission of infective agents  cannot be totally excluded. This applies also
to pathogens of hitherto unknown origin. The manufacturing process of Wilate , which
includes 2 viral inactivation steps with different chemical/physical action principles ,
represents a high standard for plasma -derived concentrates in terms of pathogen safety.
The measures taken are considered effective for enveloped viruses such as human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), andfor the non- enveloped hepatitis A virus. The measures taken may be of limited value
against non-enveloped viruses such as p arvovirus B19.
Thrombotic events. When using a FVIII -containing VWF product, the treating physi-
cian should be aware that continued treatment may cause an excessive rise in FVIII :C.
Patients receiving FVIII -containing VWF products  should be monitored for su stained
excessive FVIII:C plasma level s, which may increase the ris k of thrombotic events.
The risk of occurrence of thrombotic events in patients using FVIII -containing VWF
products is particularly increased in patients with known clinical or laboratory risk fac-
tors. Therefore, patients at risk must be monitored for early signs of thrombosis.Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism should be instituted in accordance with
current  recommendations.
In view of its  state-of-the- art manufacturing process and available clinical and post -marketing 
evidence, the benefit-risk evaluation of Wilate  is positive .

Page 39 of 86 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Study Endpoints  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint of this study is to demonstrate that prophylactic treatment with Wilate  
lowers the patients’ total annualized bleeding rate (TABR) observed during on- demand treat-
ment by more than 50%.The TABR will be calculated as the total number of spontaneous 
bleeds,  traumatic  bleeds , and other  bleed s (except menstrual bleeds) oc curring  in the time pe-
riod between first dose of  the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) and the Study Comple-
tion Visit, divided by the duration (in years) between first dose of IMP and the Study Comple-tion Visit. Surgery periods, and BEs occurring within these  surgery  periods, will be excluded 
from the calculation of TABR. 
Similar calculation rules will be applied for the computation of the TABR during the previously 
documented on- demand treatment regimen.  
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoints

Page 40 of 86 3.2 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a p rospective, non-controlled, international, multi- centre phase 3 study investigating the 
efficacy  and safety  of Wilate  in pr eviously treated patients with type 3, type 2 (except 2N), or 
severe type 1 VWD  aged ≥6 years at the time of screening. 
Overall, around 40 patients  will be enrolled by approximately 14 study sites worldwide. Of the 
40 patients, at least 5 patients should have type 3 VWD, at least 6 patients should be aged 6–11 
years, and at least 6 patients should be aged 12–16 years.  
Of the 40 patients, at least 25 patients should be evaluable for the primary endpoint. 
Paediatric patients will undergo a 4- day PK assessment at the  time of the  Baseline PK Visit, 
with the aim to obtain evaluable PK data from at least 6 patients aged 6 –11 years (of which at 
least 4 evaluable) and at least  6 patients aged 12–16 years  (of which at least 4 evaluable) .  
The planned treatment duration per patient is 12 months. The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of Wilate  in the prophylactic 
treatment of previously treated patients with type 3, type 2 (except 2N), or severe type 1 VWD. 
The efficacy of prophylactic treatment with Wilate  will be assessed by comparing each patient’s 
individual total annualized bleeding rate (TABR) under prophylactic treatment in this study 
with the T ABR recorded for the same patient under at least 6 months of on- demand treatment .  
The secondary objectives  are to assess the incremental IVR of Wilate  for VWF:Ac and FVIII:C  
over time (at baseline and at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of treatment) , the VWF:Ac  and FVIII:C 
pharmacokinetics at baseline in paediatric patients aged 6–16 years,  the product’s safety and 
tolerability , and Wilate  consumption data. 
Additional objectives  are to determine the efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment of breakthrough 
bleeding episodes (BEs) and in surgical prophylaxis and to assess the patients’ QoL during 
prophylaxis with Wilate , joint status, and menstrual bleeding intensity ( in female patients of 
child -bearing potential). 
Where needed, external home- care companies with experi ence in conducting clinical trials will 
be contracted, with trained nurses supporting patients by providing training, re -training, and 
oversight through home-care visit support throughout the study.

Page 41 of 86 3.3 Discussion of Study Design 
This prospective, non- controlled, international, multi -centre phase 3 study is designed to 
demonstrate that Wilate  is efficacious in bleeding prophylaxis in patients with VWD. 
Reduction of the annual bleeding rate ( ABR ) of patients with coagulation bleeding disorders 
such as haemophilia A has been used as an efficacy endpoint to reliably demonstrate the impact 
of prophylaxis on the bleeding rates of these patients. 
In addition, it is expected that the quality of life of patients with VWD is considerably compro-
mised. Therefor e, it was considered valuable to investigate the QoL profile of enrolled  patients , 
despite there no t being any validated tools to determine QoL in patients with VWD.

4.4 Relevant Protocol Deviations 
In case o f any major protocol deviation, the investigator  and Octapharma will decide on the 
further participation of the patient in this study after having discussed all relevant aspects. 
5 INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
5.1 Characterisation of Wilate  
Wilate , produced from the plasma of human donors, is presented as a powder and solvent for 
intravenous injection containing nominally 500 IU or 1000 IU human VWF and human FVIII 
per vial. The ratio between VWF  ristocetin co -factor activity ( VWF:RCo ) and FVIII:C is 1:1. 
The product contains approximately 100 IU/ml human VWF when reconstituted with 
5 ml/10  mL water for injections  with 0.1% polysorbate 80. The specific activity of Wilate  is 
≥67 IU VWF:RCo/mg protein. 
The injection or infusion rate should not exceed  2–3 mL per minute. 
5.2 Packaging and Labell ing 
Final labelling will comply with the national  requirements  of each country where the study is 
conducted.

No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 45 of 86 5.3 Conditions for Storage and Use 
The powder and solvent vials  must be stored in a refrigerator  at +2°C to +8°C (36°F to 46°F) . 
The vials must be kept in the outer carton to protect from light and must not be frozen. 
The product can be stored at room temperature (max. of +25°C or 77°F) for 2 months. In this 
case, the shelf -life expires 2 months after the product has been taken out of the refrigerator for 
the first time.  
The investigator and any authoris ed personnel at the site will ensure that the IMP is stored in 
appropriate conditions with restricted access and in compliance with national regulations.  
5.4 Dose and Dosing Schedule 
5.4.1 Wilate  Dosage for PK Assessment  in Paediatric Patients  
For the PK assessment in paediatric patients  (6–16 years), a single dose of 60 ± 10 IU/kg will 
be administered.  
5.4.2 Wilate  Dosage for Prophylactic Treatment  
For prophylactic treatment, Wilate  should be administered 2–3 times per week at a dose of  
20–40 IU/kg BW for 12 months. 
The prophylactic dose for each patient will be determined by the Principal Investigator based 
on each patient’s clinical condition and at the following time points: 
At the Baseline IVR Visit (see Section 6.1.2 ) in adult patients  (≥17 years)
In adult patients, the first prophylactic dose will be administered at the time of thebaseline IVR assessment.
At the Baseline PK Visit (see Section 6.1.4 ) in paediatric patients  (6–16 years)
In paediatric patients , the first prophylactic dose will be administered after comple-
tion of the PK phase.
In case of unacceptably frequent spontaneous breakthrough BEs (i.e., more than 2 spontaneous 
BEs or 1 major spontaneous BE within a 30- day period), the dose of Wilate  should be increased 
by approximately 5 IU/kg (depending on the entire content of the addi tional vials that need to 
be reconstituted). If, after a dose increase, patients still experience more than 2 spontaneous 
bleeding episodes, the dosing interval should be shortened from 2 times per week to 3 times per week. 
 
5.4.3 Wilate  Dose for the Treatment of B reakthrough BEs  
The dose (and duration) of treatment of BEs will depend on the location and extent of bleed-
ing and on the clinical condition of the patient . 
Generally, 1 IU/kg BW VWF:Ac (VWF :RCo) and FVIII:C raises the plasma level by  
1.5–2% of normal activity for the respective protein. Usually, about 20–50 IU Wilate /kg BW 
are necessary to achieve adequate haemostasis. This will raise the VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) and

:C in the patients by approx. 30–100%. 
The following should be used to guide dosing in the treatment of BEs : 
Dose type  Minor h aemorrhage * Major h aemorrhage  
Loading dose  20–40 IU/kg  40–60 IU/kg  
Maintenance dose  20–30 IU/kg every 12– 24 hours  20–40 IU/kg every 12– 24 hours  
Therapeutic goal  Maintain VWF:Ac (VWF:RCo ) and 
FVIII:C  trough levels >30%  Maintain VWF:Ac (VWF:RCo ) and FVIII:C  
trough levels >50%  
*Menstrual bleeds of regular intensity (i.e., minor menstrual haemorrhage) will be considered normal and are not
expected to require therapy unless deemed necessary by the  investigator and/or the patient.
5.4.4 Surgical Prophylaxis 
For prevention of bleeding in case of surgery, levels of VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) ≥60 IU/dL 
(≥60%) and FVIII:C levels ≥40 IU/dL (≥40%) should be achieved.  
An appropriate dose should be re -administered every 12–24 hours of treatment. The dose and 
duration of the treatment depend on the clinical status of the patient, the type and severity of 
bleeding, and VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) and FVIII:C levels.  
In patients receiving FVIII -containing VWF products, plasma levels of FVIII:C should be mon-
itored to reveal sustained excessive FVIII:C plasma levels, which may increase the risk of thrombotic events. 
The following should be used to guide dosing in surgical prophylaxis: 
Dose type  Minor surgeries (incl . tooth extractions)  Major surgeries  
Loading dose  30–6 0 IU/kg  40–60 IU/kg  
Maintenance dose  15–30 IU/kg , or half the loading dose, every 
12–24 hours for up to 3 days  20–40 IU/kg, or half the loading dose, 
every 12 –24 hours for up to 6 days or 
longer  
Therapeutic  goal Achieve VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) peak levels of 
50% after loading dose and trough levels of 
>30% during maintenance dosesAchieve VWF:Ac ( VWF:RCo ) peak level 
of 100% after loading dose and trough 
levels of >50% during maintenance 
doses  
5.5 Preparation and Method of Administration

5.7.1 Drug Dispensing and Accountability  
Any IMP provided to the site will be accounted for . This includes IMP received at the site,  IMP 
dispensed to patients, and used or unused IMP returned by patients. 
A Drug Inventory and Dispensing L og will be kept current by the investigator , detailing the 
dates and quantities of IMP  received and dispensed to each patient  and the remaining quantity. 
The inventory and dispensing log will be available to the monitor to verify drug accountability 
during the study. 
Unused IMP can be destroyed at the study site or returned to the S ponsor for destruction. De-
struction can be initiated only after accountability has been verified and fully reconciled by the 
monitor and after the Sponsor has granted written approval of destruction. 
5.7.2 Assessment of Treatment Compliance and Adherence with Infusion Regimen  
For all IVR assessments as well as for the PK assessment in paediatric patients, Wilate  will be 
administered at the study site , with compliance under the control of the investigator. 
Assessment of Adherence with the Infusion Regimen  
Throughout the study, adherence with the infusion regimen will be assessed . Any change of the 
prophylactic dose as determined by the Principal Invest igator during the Baseline Visit will be 
documented in the patient records and eCRF, including start and end dates of each dose, reasons 
for dose change, or reasons for not implementing a required dose change.

Page 48 of 86 6.1 Observations by Visit for Prophylactic Treatment 
Because all paediatric patients enrolled in the study will undergo PK assessment, whereas adult 
patients will not, the first two study visits differ between these two age cohorts.  
All enrolled patients will participate  in the following study visits: 
Screening Visit
– For adult patients–For paediatric patients
Baseline Visit
–Baseline IVR Visit for adult patients
–Baseline PK Visit for paediatric patients
1-Month IVR Visit
2-Month IVR Visit
3-Month IVR Visit
6-Month IVR Visit
9-Month IVR Visit
Study Completion (12-Month) Visit
Between the 3 - and 6- Month Visits, the 6 - and 9- Month Visits, and the 9- and 12- Month Visits, 
monthly telephone contacts  will be performed. 
Where needed, external home -care companies  with experience in conducting clinical trials 
will be contracted, with trained nurses supporting patients by providing training, re -training, 
and oversight through home-care visit support throughout the study. 
SCREENING AND BASELINE VISITS FOR ADULT PATIENTS  (≥17 YEARS)

After the Screening Visit, eligible patients will participate in the Baseline IVR Visit, during 
which the first prophylactic dose of Wilate  will be administered.  
For adult patients, t he Screening Visit and the Baseline IVR Visit may coincide; however, note 
that administration of the first prophylactic dose of Wilate  during the Baseline IVR Visit re-
quires a washout period of at least 72 hours  from the patient’s previous administration of a 
VWF -containing product . If possible, t he interval between the Screening Visit and the Baseline 
IVR Visit should not exceed 2 weeks . 
Between the Screening Visit and the Baseline IVR Visit, on -demand treatment  of BEs or  
prophylactic treatment should be continued with the patient’s previously used VWF -
containing product . Any BEs occurring between the Screening Visit and the Baseline IVR 
Visit will b e documented in the patient diary  (menstrual bleeds in the PBAC) . Also, any 
infusions with the patient’s previous VWF -containing product during this time will be docu-

y Telephone Contacts  
Monthly telephone contacts will be performed 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 months (± 1 week) after 
first prophylactic injection of Wilate . Should a patient visit the study centre at the time any of 
these telephone contacts are scheduled, the required assessments may also be performed during this visit.  
The following assessments will be performed: 
Review of compliance with correctly  completing the patient diary  and PBAC (for
female patient s of child-bearing potential)
Review of adherence with the infusion regime n
Monitoring of adverse events (AEs)
Concomitant medications
If any issues with completing the diaries or adhering to the infusion regimen are identified, the investigator or home- care provider will re-train the patient accordingly. 
6.1.12 Unscheduled Visits and Additional Measures  
If inhibitor development is suspected (e.g., based on an unexplained need to increase the dose, a lack of efficacy of IMP injections, or prolonged bleeding), VWF a nd FVIII inhibitor tests will 
be performed at the central laboratory and documented (see Section 7.4.5.1).  
In case of positive inhibitor results, inhibitor retesting using a second, separately drawn sample should be performed, preferably within 15 days of becoming aware of the positive result. 
Other reasons for unscheduled visits may be the occurrence of serious AEs or hospitalisations 
for BEs or surg ical interventions.  
6.1.13 Surgical Visits  
Patients may undergo surgical interventions in the course of the study. Whether or not these patients will be hospitalised will depend on the type and severity of the surgery and be at the discretion of the investigator. 
In patients undergoing major surgeries, standard methods of postsurgical thromboprophylaxis , 
such as gradated compression stockings and early mobilisation, should be used to prevent ve-
nous thromboembolism. 
For the flow chart of assessments for surgical prophylaxis, see page 27. For details on the surgery data to be documented and the surgical efficacy assessments to be 
performed, see Section 7.2.4 and Section 7.2.5.

Page 58 of 86 7 ASSESSMENTS AND METHODS 
7.1 Demographic and Baseline Information 
The following information will be recorded during the Screening  Visit (see Section 6.1.1): 
7.1.1 Demographic and B aseline C haracteristics  
The d emographic and baseline characteristics are age, ethnic origin, weight, height, and AB 0 
blood group. 
7.1.2 Medical History and Prior M edications  
The m edical history  will be obtained by patient interview  and by collecting r ecords of past 
diseases and treatments (e.g. , hospital records ), if available.  Concomitant medication s will also 
be obtained by interview. 
For female patients of child -bearing potential, the birth control measures used within 6 months 
before enrolment will be documented. For all female patients, any history of heavy menstrual 
bleeding will be recorded.  The Pictorial Blood Chart Assessment (PB AC) score calculated dur-
ing the 6 months previous to Screening will be obtained in an observational study preceding 
this study, if applicable. 
In addition, information about the patients’ treatment with VWF -containing product  will be 
collected . To be eligible for the study, complete records on the type, frequency, and treatment 
of BEs for at least 6 months of on-demand treatment must be available (see Section 4.1.2).  
The history or (suspected) presence of VWF or FVIII inhibitor activity is an exclusion criterion 
(see Section 4.1.3).  
7.2 Efficacy Assessments 
This section summarises the assessments to be performed for the calculation of the primary 
endpoint (see Section 3.1.1) as well as the secondary (see Section 3.1.2)  and exploratory end-
points (see Section 3.1.3 ) of this study.

Page 59 of 86 7.2.1 IMP A
dministration Data  
The following parameters will be documented: 
Dates and times of IMP injections
Doses of IMP in IU  and IU/kg and IMP batch numbers
Purpose of IMP injection ( IVR, prophylaxis, prophylaxis of recurrent bleeding, treat-
ment of BE, surgery, prophylaxis after surgery, or menstrual bleeds)
Injections administered for the purpose of prophylaxis of recurrent bleeding are those injections 
administered after bleeding cessation and in advance of the patient’s next regular prophylactic dose. 
7.2.2 Bleeding E pisode (BE) Data 
Study participants will be instructed by the  investigator on recording all BEs and in how to 
record them . For any BE occurring during the study, the following data will be recorded: 
BE type (spontaneous, traumatic, postoperative, other)
BE site
BE severity (minor or major)  (see Table 1 )
Date and time the BE first occurred or was first noticed
Date and time the BE ended
IMP administration data (see Section 7.2.1)
Assessment of the efficacy of treatment at the end of the BE  (see Section 7.2.3)
All of these parameters will be documented by the patient (together with the investigator in case 
of on- site treatments  or together with the nurse in case a home -care service is used ) in the  patient 
diary. Patients who experience a major BE should be treated at the study site, if possible. 
Based on these data, the frequency of BEs and the T ABR and SABR under prophylactic treat-
ment will be calculated.  
If the treatment of a BE in one bleeding site is interrupted for more than 48 hours, two separate 
BEs will have to be recorded; if, in addition to the original bleeding site, another bleeding site is affected, these events will be recorded as separate BEs at any time.  
Menstrual bleedings will not be counted towards the TABR . 
BE severity and the severity of menstrual bleeds will be assessed using the criteria given in 
Table 1 .

1 Definition of the Severity of Bleeding  
Bleeding severity  Description  
Minor  Mild haemarthrosis (mild swelling, ‘aura ,’ pain, warmth of the skin over the 
joint, change in range of motion, decrease in mobility and activity, slight d iffi-
culty in using the limb compared with baseline) , superficial muscle bleed  (pain 
and/or swelling and functional impairment compared with baseline), soft-tissue 
bleeding (scrapes, superficial cuts  such as those cause by shaving razor, knife, 
or scissors, bleeding episodes that require frequent bandage changes, cutane-
ous bleeds with numerous bruises >1 cm), oral bleeding  (superficial mouth 
bleeds, oozing or bleeding related to tooth eruption or extraction, spontaneous 
or after brushing/flossing, gum bleeding, bleeding after bites to lip or  tongue), 
and most nose bleeds  (i.e., those  causing distress or interference with daily or 
social activities).  
Major  Generally requires hospitalization ; causes incapacity, significant pain, and 
substantial decrease in range of motion of affected joint ( in case of joint bleeds ); 
include s symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ ( such as intracranial, 
intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraabdominal, intraarticular, or pericar-
dial bleeds) , intramuscular bleeds with compartment syndrome, bleeds of the 
pelvic muscles, periorbital bleeds , gastrointestinal bleeds, central nervous sys-
tem bleeds, heavy menstrual bleeding,*  bleeding in the area of the neck or 
throat or pharynx, other major  trauma, or bleeding causing a decrease in hae-
moglobin level s by 20 g/L (1.24 mmol/L) or more.  
*Heavy  menstrual bleeding  is any menstrual bleeding  that impedes  the abil-
ity to perform daily activities such as work, housework, exercise, or social activi-ties during menstrual period s and should be considered ‘major. ’ Criteria for
heavy  (i.e., major ) menstrual  bleeding may also include any of the following:
changing pads /tampons  more frequently than hourly ; menstrual bleeding lasting
7 or more days; and the presence of clots >1 cm combined with a history of
flooding  or a PBAC score ≥185 .
7.2.3 Efficacy of the Treatment of B reakthrough BEs  
At the end of a BE, treatment efficacy will be assessed by the patient (together with the inves-
tigator  in case of on -site treatment) using the predefined criteria  detailed in Table 2 . 
Table 2 Efficacy Assessment  of the Treatment of Bre akthrough BEs  
Excellent  Bleeding was completely stopped within 3 days in case of minor bleed s, within 7 days in case of 
major bleed s, and within 10 days in case of gastrointestinal bleeds 
Good  Bleeding was completely stopped, but time and/or dose slightly exceeded expectations  
Moderate  Bleeding could be stopped only by significantly exceeding time and/or dose expectations  
None  Bleeding could be stopped only by using other VWF -containing products  
The proportion of BEs successfully treated with I MP will be evaluated for all BEs taken 
together and by BE severity. All efficacy ratings assessed as either ‘excellent’ or ‘good’ will be considered ‘successfully treated.’

7.2.5 Efficacy in Surgical Prophylaxis 
Efficacy will be assessed at the end of surgery by the surgeon (see Section 7.2.5.1) and at the 
end of the postoperative period by the ha ematologist (see Section 7.2.5.2). In both cases, pre-
defined assessment criteria will be used.  In addition, an overall assessment of efficacy will be 
made at the end of the postoperative period by the investigator (see Section 7.2.5.3). 
7.2.5.1 At the End of S urgery (by Surgeon) 
At the end of surgery, the haemostatic  efficacy of Wilate  will be assessed by the surgeon using 
the criteria listed in Table 3 . 
Table 3 Efficacy Assessment at the End of Surgery  
Excellent  Intraoperative blood loss was lower than or equal to the average expected blood loss for the 
type of procedure performed in a patient with normal haemostasis  and of the same sex, age, 
and stature  
Good  Intraoperative blood loss was higher than the average expected blood loss but lower or equal to 
the maxim um expected blood loss for the type of procedure in a patient with normal haemosta-
sis 
Moderate  Intraoperative blood loss was higher than the maximum expected blood loss for the type of pr o-
cedure performed in a patient with normal haemostasis , but haemostasis  was controlled  
None  Haemostasis  was uncontrolled, necessitating a change in the clotting factor replacement regi-
men 
7.2.5.2 At the 
End of the Postoperative P eriod (by Haematologist)

7.2.6 Quality of Life  
For the assessment of QoL , the following instruments will be used: 
Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 [5 –7]
for patients of all ages . For patients 6–7 years of age, the questionnaire will be com-
pleted by the parent/legal guardian. Self-reported measures will be used for patients
≥8 years old.
36-Item Short Form Health Survey, version 2 ( SF-36v2, [8]), for patients ≥16 years,
10-Item Short From Health Survey ( SF-10, [9]) will be used for patients 6–15 years
of age.
At each visit requiring QoL assessments, the questionnaires should be administered before start-ing any other visit assessment.

t Health Status  
Joint health will be assessed  using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS) [10] , which has 
been specifically validated for the assessment of clinical outcome in VWD [11]. 
Target joint(s) will also be documented. Target joint(s) are defined as having three or more 
spontaneous BEs into a single joint within 6 consecutive months preceding either the Baseline 
Visit or the Study Completion Visit. 
7.2.8 Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart  
Bleeding information from each menstrual period in this study wi ll be collected in the Pictorial 
Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC)  [12,13] . The  PBAC will be provided to all female patients of 
child -bearing potential. 
The investigator will train all relevant patients i n how to complete the PBAC . At each study 
visit, the investigator will review the completed PBAC and calculate the PBAC score. In addi-
tion, the investigator will review , together with the patient , the severity assessment of the men-
strual bleed using the criteria given in Table 1, Section 7.2.2 . The data documented in the 
PBAC  and the investigator- calculated final score will be recorded in the eCRF.  
7.3 PK Assessments 
PK parameters will be assessed for VWF:Ac (VWF:RCo) and FVIII:C using both the chromo-
genic (CHR) and one- stage (OS) assays based on actual IMP potencies.  
The foll owing PK parameters will be assessed:  
Area under the curve (AUC) and AUC normalized for the administered dose(AUC
norm)
In vivo half- life (T 1/2)
Maximum plasma concentration (C max)
Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max)
Mean residence time (MRT)
Volume of distribution (V d)
Clearance (CL)
Incremental in vivo recovery (IVR)

Page 65 of 86 7.4 Safety Assessments 
7.4.1 Assessments for Safety Endpoints  
The following drug safety information will be collected:  
Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs)  (for definitions and report-
ing requirements, see Section s 7.4.2, 7.4.3, and 7.4.4)
Pregnancies, d rug overdose, interaction, medication error, lack of efficacy, and post -
study SAEs (see Section 7.4.7)
7.4.2 Adverse Events (AEs)  
7.4.2.1 Definitions  
Adverse event (AE):  An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a study patient
receiving an IMP and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this
treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the useof an IMP, whether or not related to the IMP.
Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE):  A TEAE is an AE that started or wors-
ened after the start of IMP infusion.
Adverse drug reaction (ADR):  An ADR  is any noxious and unintended response to
an IMP related to any dose. The phrase ‘response to an IMP’ means that a causal rela-tionship between the IMP and an AE carries at least a reasonable possibility, i.e., therelationship cannot be ruled out.
Other s ignificant AEs:  Any marked laboratory abnormalities or any AEs that led to
an intervention, including withdrawal of drug treatment, dose reduction, or significantadditional concomitant therapy.
Withdrawal due to AE/ADR:  AE/ADR leading to discontinuation of treatment with
IMP. Any such events will be followed up by the investigator until the event is re-solved or until the medical condition of the patient is stable. All follow -up infor-
mation collected will be made available to the Sponsor.
7.4.2.2 Collection of AEs  
The condition of the patient will be monitored throughout the study. At each visit, whether scheduled or unscheduled, AEs will be elicited using a standard non- leading question such as  
“How have you been since the last visit/during the previous study period?” In addition, the investigator will check the patient diaries for any documented event.  
Any AE or ADR which occurs during the study will be noted in detail on the appropriate pages of the e CRF. If the patient reports several signs or symptoms representing a single syndrome or 
diagnosis, the diagnosis should be recorded in the eCRF. The investigator will grade the sever-
ity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate, or severe), the seriousness (non- serious or serious), 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07

Page 66 of 86 and the cau
sality as defined in Sections  7.4.2.3, 7.4.3, and 7.4.2.4. The Sponsor is responsible 
for assessing the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected) as defined in Sec-
tion 7.4.2.5. 
In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be confirmed and the patient followed up until the laboratory values have returned to normal and/or an ade-quate explanation for the abnormality has become available. 
Diseases, signs and symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already present before the first 
administration of IMP will not be considered AEs unless an exacerbation  in intensity or fre-
quency (worsening) occurs. Seroconversion for parvovirus B19 will be reported as an AE. 
The investigator will provide detailed information about any abnormalities and about the nature 
of and reasons for any action taken as well as any other observations or comments that may be 
useful for the interpretation and understanding of an AE or ADR. 
7.4.2.3 Severity of AEs  
The severity of AEs will be graded as follows: 
Mild:  an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with
the patient’s routine activities
Moderate:  an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the patient’s
routine a ctivities
Severe:  an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the patient’s rou-
tine activities
The grading of an AE is up to the medical judgment  of the investigator and will be decided on 
a case -by-case basis.  
7.4.2.4 Causality of AEs 
The relationsh ip of AEs to the administered IMP will be assessed by the investigator : 
Probable:  reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a
causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily
highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from admin-istration of the IMP; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the sus-pected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the medi-cine and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the pa-tient’s clinical state.
Possible:  reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal
relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connectionis uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing data or insufficient evidence.A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of theIMP; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine;but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors.

Page 67 of 86 Unlikely
: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from IMP admin-
istration. An event which may have been produced by the patient’s clinical state or by
environmental factors or other therapies administered.
Not related (unrelated):  events for which sufficient information exists to conclude
that the aetiology is unrelated to the IMP.
Unclassified:  reports which , for whatever  reason , are not yet assessable, e.g. , because
of still outstanding information (can only be a temporary assessment).
7.4.2.5 Classification of ADRs  by Expectedness  
ADRs will be classified by the Sponsor as either expected or unexpected: 
Expected:  an ADR that is listed in the current edition of the IB.
Unexpected:  an ADR that is not listed in the current edition of the I B or that  differs
because of greater severity or greater specificity.
7.4.2.6 Outcome of AEs  
The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows: 
1.Recovered, resolved
2. Recovering, resolving
3. Not recovered, not resolved4. Recovered, resolved with sequelae
5.Fatal
6. Unknown
NOTE:  A patient’s death  per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event which resulted in 
the patient’s death must be fully documented and reported, even in case the death occurs within 
4 weeks after IMP treatment end and regardless of whether or not it is considered treatment-related.  
7.4.2.7 Action(s) Taken 
AEs requiring action or therapy must be treated with recognis ed standards of medical care to 
protect the health and wellbeing  of the patient. Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medi-
cines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment in an emergency situation.  
The action s taken by the investigator must be documented: 
(a)General actions taken in the event of an AE
– None
– Medication (other than IMP) or other (e.g., physical) therapy started
–Test performed
–Other (to be specified)

No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 68 of 86 (b)IMP -relat
ed actions taken in the event of an AE
– None
– Product withdrawn–Dose reduced
–Dose increased
The investigator will follow up on each AE until it has resolved or until the medical condition 
of the patient has stabilis ed. Any relevant follow -up information will be reported to the Sponsor.  
7.4.3 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious AE (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
results in death,
is life -threatening (see below),
requires hospital isation  or prolongation of existing hospital isation ,
results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,
is a congenital anomaly/birth defect,
is another important medical event (see below) .
NOTE:  The term ‘life -threatening’  refers to an event in which the patient was, in the view of 
the reporting investigator , at immediate risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer 
to an event which may hypothetically have caused death had it been more severe. 
In deciding whether an AE/ADR is serious, medical judgment should be exercised. Thus, im-
portant AEs/ADRs that are not immediately life -threatening or do not result in death or hospi-
talisation  but may jeopardise the patient or  may require intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the definitions above should also be considered serious. 
Examples of ‘important medical events’ are all suspected transmissions of an infectious agent , 
which therefore have to be repo rted as SAE. A suspected virus transmission means that virus 
antigen has been detected in the patient. A passive transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission. Another such ‘important medical event’  that has to 
be reported as an SAE  is the development of VWF or FVIII inhibitors .

Waivers
 the from SAE Reporting R equirement  
Waivers from the SAE reporting requirement include surgeries that are elective or were planned 
before st udy entry or prolongations of existing hospital isation s for economic or social, but not 
medical, reasons. Such surgeries or prolongations of hospital isation s should not be considered 
SAEs.  
7.4.5 Laboratory Tests 
The following laboratory parameters will be determ ined at the time  points specified in  the flow 
chart s of assessments on pages 23, 25 and 27, in Sectio n 6, and in Table 6 and Table 7. 
7.4.5.1 Central Laboratory 
The following laboratory tests will be done at the central laborator y: 
VWF:Ac  in vials used for baseline IVR injections as well as in plasma will be deter-
mined using VWF:RCo and VWF: GPIbm .

F and FVIII inhibitor testing, a retention sample will be collected  and
stored at the central laboratory . In addition, VWF and FVIII inhibitor testing will be
performed at any time during the study in case inhibitor development is suspected.
For the determination of VWF inhibitors, a mixing study based on VWF: RCo will be
used. For the determination of FVIII inhibitors, the modified Bethesda assay (Nijme-gen modification) using the OS assay will be used.
Virus safety  will be evaluated by taking a plasma sample for anti -parvovirus B19 an-
tibody testing before the first injection  of Wilate . All patients negative at baseline will
be tested again at the Study Completion Visit. For patients with equivocal results atbaseline, the same sample will be re- tested. If re-testing also yields an equivocal re-
sult, the patient will be tested again at the Study Completion Visit. In addition, a re-tention serum sample for possible virus marker testing will be taken and stored at thecentral laboratory.
For patients with VWD type 2A, VWF multimers  will be determined by a quantita-
tive method .
For patients with VWD type 2B, bidirectional sequencing of exon 28 and its intron-exon boundaries will be performed to confirm the VWD type. If no mutation is identi-
fied, an additional molecular testing will be performed to exclude pseudo- VWD

igns and Physical Examination 
The vital signs obtained at the time points specified in Section 6 are blood pressure, body tem-
perature, heart  rate, and respiratory rate.  
Physical examinations will be performed at the visits specified in Section 6. Both height and 
weight will be measured during screening. In addition, weight will be measured at all visits 
prior to dosing. 
7.4.7 Other Relevant Safety Information 
(a)Post-study related safety reports
Any SAE  which occurs up to 4 weeks after the last IMP administration  should be reported 
by the investigator to the Sponsor in case the investigator becomes aware of it. Proactive mon-
itoring for post-study SAEs  is not required. 
If any such post-study event  is identified, the investigator will complete an SAE form  and trans-
mit it to the Clinical Trial Manager  and to Octapharma’s Corporate Drug Safety Unit  (see Sec-
tion 7.4.4). 
Deaths occurring within 4 weeks after the last IMP administration should also be reported, 
regardless of whether or not they are considered treatment -related.  
(b)Pregnancies
Every effort will be made to avoid a pregnancy during the use of an IMP. Pregnancies occurring during the study (foetal exposure to the IMP) must be reported. 
If a pregnancy occurs during the study, the investigator should complete the Pregnancy Notifi-
cation Form and transm it it to the Clinical Trial Manager and to Octapharma’s Corporate Drug 
Safety Unit  (see Section 7.4.4).  
Follow- up information on the outcome of both mother and foetus will be requested by a Sponsor 
representative.  
Overdose, interaction, medication error  
The following safety relevant information should be reported as AE or, if the reaction fulfils one of the criteria for seriousness, as SAE. 
(c)Drug o verdose
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
specified in the protocol and higher than the known therapeutic dose that is of clinical relevance. The reaction must be clearly identified as an overdos e. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07 
No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 73 of 86 (d)Drug
 interaction
A drug interaction is a situation in which a substance or medicinal product affects the activity 
of an IMP, i.e., increases or decreases its effects, or produces an effect that none of the products would exhibit on its own. The reaction must be clearly identified as a drug interaction. 
(e)Medication error
A medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal 
product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceutical form/packaging , 
or instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error.  
(f)Lack of efficacy
Lack of efficacy is suspected when the therapeutic result is not as expected. One example of a lack of efficacy may be continued bleeding i n a patient with VWD despite administration of 
coagulation factor. Lack of efficacy should be reported as an AE or, if the reaction fulfils one 
of the criteria for seriousness, as an SAE.  
7.5 Appropriateness of Measurements 
The criteria for assessing the safety and efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment of BEs as well as in 
surgical prophylaxis are identical to those used in similar studies with Wilate.  
Reduction of ABR of patients with coagulation bleeding disorders such as haemophilia A has been used as an efficacy endpoint to reliably demonstrate the impact of prophylaxis on the bleeding rates of these patients.  
8 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING 
8.1 Documentation of Data 
8.1.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are defined as all information related to clinical findi ngs, observations, or other 
activities in the study, written down in original records or certified copies of original records, allowing reconstruction and evaluation of the clinical study. 
The investigator will maintain adequate source records (e.g., case histories or patient files for 
each patient enrolled). Source records should be preserved for the maximum period of time 
required by local regulations. 
For each patient enrolled, the investigator will indicate in the source record(s) that the patient 
participates in this study. 
All data entered in the eCRF must be supported by source data in the patient records. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07 
No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 74 of 86 The inves
tigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, IEC/IRB reviews, and regulatory 
inspections, by providing direct access to the sourc e data/records.  
The investigator may authorise site staff (e.g., sub -investigators, nurses) to enter study 
data into the e CRF. This must be documented in the Delegation of Authority Log signed 
by the investigator. 
Patients will usually treat themselves at home, and they will therefore be provided with a suffi-
cient amount of IMP and a patient diary as well as the PBAC (women of child- bearing poten-
tial).  
The patient diary /PBAC  will be handed to the patient during the Screening Visit after inclusion 
into the study. The investigator will explain to the patient how to fill in the diary /PBAC  and 
emphasize the importance of careful  document ation . 
At each follow -up visit at the study site, the patient will bring along the patient diar y/PBAC  for 
review and validation by site personnel. During or after each follow -up visit, the information recorded in the patient diaries /PBACs  will 
be transcribed to the eCRFs. The patient diaries /PBACs  are classified as source data, and the 
originals will be included in the patient’s medical record.  
8.1.2 Case Report Forms  
For each patient enrolled, an electronic CRF (eCRF) will be completed within the Electronic 
Data Capture (EDC) system and approved by the investigator or an authoris ed sub-investigator. 
Study site staff (e.g., research nurse) will be responsible for entering patient data into the vali-dated EDC system. All site personnel will be trained on the EDC system and study- specific 
eCRFs prior to receiving access to the live database for data entry.  
The site is also provided with the approved eCRF Completion Guidelines which will assist in data entry and data issues/questions. The site will be  notified once the database is active to 
begin data entry. Additional site training may be provided as refreshers throughout the study, if needed. All persons allowed to enter or change eCRF data must be listed in the Delegation of Authority Log. 
8.1.3 Changes t o Case Report Form (CRF) Data  
Monitors will perform source data verification (SDV) as defined for the study. 
If any errors or discrepancies in the eCRFs are found during data entry or review, discrepancies 
will be generated programmatically within the EDC system, and ‘manual’ queries will be gen-erated by either a monitor or Data Management.  
Discrepancies and queries  can only be corrected by the investigator (s) or other authoris ed site 
personnel. An audit trail documents all changes to the data over the entire study period. If the reason for a change is not obvious, a comment must be supplied in the query’s response , stating 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07 
No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 75 of 86 the rea
son for the change, prior to closing. The study monitor should provide guidance to in-
vestigator(s) and the investigator (s)’ designated representatives on making such corrections. 
Once queries have been resolved by the site staff, the resolutions are assessed by Data Manage-
ment. If the query response provided confirms the data as correct, the discrepancy will be 
closed. If the response does not adequately address the question raised, a new query will be issued for further clarification.  
Manual checks are performed and programs are run throughout the study until the data is clean and the database is ready for lock. All discrepancies will be resolved prior to database lock. There will be a final run of the programmed checks to ensure all discrepancies ar e closed out, 
SDV will be confirmed as complete by the monitor, and all eCRFs will be approved by the investigator prior to database lock. 
8.2 Information for Investigators 
An Investigator’s Brochure (IB)  will be handed out to the investigator before the start  of the 
study. The IB contains all information in the Sponsor’s possession necessary for the investigator  
to be fully and accurately informed about the safety of the IMP under evaluation and the re-spective benefit -risk ratio.  
The IB will be updated by the Sponsor at regular intervals and whenever relevant new infor-
mation concerning the IMP becomes available.  
The investigator will be informed about the methods for rating relevant study outcomes and for 
completing e CRFs to reduce discrepancies between partici pating investigator and study sites. 
The investigator will be kept informed of important data that relate to the safe use of the IMP 
as the study proceeds. 
8.3 Responsibilities 
The P rincipal Investigator is accountable for the conduct of the clinical study. Re sponsibilities 
may be delegated to appropriately qualified persons. 
A Delegation of Authority Log will be filled in and signed by the Principal Investigator . In 
accordance with this authority log, study site staff (e.g., sub- investigators, nurses) is authori sed 
to perform tasks relating to the study. 
8.4 Investigator’s Site File 
At each study site, the investigator is responsible for maintaining all records to enable the con-
duct of the study to be fully documented. Essential documents as required by GCP guidelines and regulations (e.g., copies of the protocol, study approval letters, all original informed consent and assent forms, drug dispensing and accountability logs, correspondence pertaining to the 
study, etc.) should be filed accurately and kept by the investigator for the maximum period of 
time required by local regulations. 
Property of Octapharma. Do not copy or distribute without written permission.Study Protocol  CONFIDENTIAL  Version 07 
No. WIL -31 01-Mar-2021 
Page 76 of 86 The inves
tigator is responsible for  maintaining a confidential patient identification code list, 
which provides the unique link between named source records and CRF data for the Sponsor. 
The investigator must arrange for the retention of this confidential list for the maximum period 
of time  required by local regulations. 
No study document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the investi-gator and the Sponsor. Should the investigator elect to assign the study documents to another 
party, or move them to another location, the Sponsor must be notified in writing. 
8.5 Provision of Additional Information 
On request, the investigator will supply the Sponsor with additional data relating to the study, 
or copies of relevant source records, ensuring that the patient’s confidentiality is maintained. This is particularly important when CRFs are illegible or when errors in data transcription are encountered. In case of particular issues or governmental queries, it is also necessary to have access to the complete study records, provided that the patient’s confidentiality is protected in accordance with applicable regulations.  
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND SAMPLE SIZE 
The statistical analysis will be delegated  under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities to 
an external CRO that agrees to meet all Octapharma procedures and policies.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Assuming a mean T ABR ratio ( TABR pr / TABR od) of 0.25 with a correlation of 0.5 between 
the two treatment regime ns, a coefficient of variation of 10 in on- demand treatment , and a co-
efficient of variation of 10 in prophyla ctic treatment, 25 patients will be needed to reject the 
null hypothesis 
H0: mean(TABR pr / TABR od) ≥0.5 
in favour of 
H1: mean( TABR pr / TABR od) <0.5 
with a type one error of 0.025 and a power of 80%  using a paired t -test on log- transformed data.

Page 77 of 86 9.2 Statistical Analysis  
The primary approach to statistical analysis will be descriptive, presenting sampling statistics 
(n, mean, standard deviation, quartiles , and range s) for continuous measurements and absolute 
and relative frequency counts for categorical/ordinal data. This will be complemented by the presentation of exploratory confidence intervals (CIs) for means or proportions. 
A formal Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) describing all details of the analyses to be performed 
will be prepared by the study statistician and approved by the Sponsor prior to the start of the statistical analysis.  
9.2.1 Populations for Analysis 
The safety set (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one dose of IMP.  
The full analysis set (FAS) , defined according to the intention- to-treat (ITT) principle , will 
include all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of IMP after the Baseline IVR V isit 
in adults or the Baseline PK Visit in children . 
The per-protocol (PP) set , i.e., a subset of the FAS , will exclude patients with major protocol 
deviations which may have an impact on the evaluation of the primary study outcome parame-ter. Examples of major and minor protocol deviations will be described in the SAP. 
The surgery (SURG) set  will be a subset of the FAS, containing all patients who underwent a 
surgical procedure treated with Wilate  during their prophylactic t reatment phase.  
The pharmacokinetic  (PK) set will be a subset of the FAS, containing all patients for whom a 
valid PK  profile was obtained at baseline.  
A final decision about the classification of protocol deviations and their consequences regarding 
assignment of patients to analysis sets will be made during the data review meeting. Decisions and outcome will be approved by the Sponsor. 
The analysis of safety will be based on the SAF set.
The evaluation of the primary endpoint will be performed on the FAS (ITT analysis)and on the PP set (PP analysis).
For secondary and exploratory endpoints, ITT and PP analyses will be carried out, un-less these analysis sets differ by no more than 5% of patients.
Analysis of the efficacy and safety of Wilate  in surgeries will be based on the SURG
set.
Analysis of the PK  properties of Wilate  will be based on the PK set.
9.2.2 Efficacy Analysis Plan 
The analysis of the efficacy of prophylactic treatment with Wilate  will be based on the FAS and 
the PP set.

ily, all obtained data on treatment characteristics (IMP dosages, frequencies, total con-
sumption) , VWF:Ac  and FVIII:C  incremental IVR of Wilate  over time  and BEs (duration, fre-
quency, efficacy assessment) will be described using summary statistics.  
Whenever sufficient reliable and comparable data on secondary endpoints (see Section 3.1.2) 
or exploratory endpoints (see Section 3.1.3) are available for similar historical on -demand treat-
ment periods, exploratory statistical comparisons of these endpoints to on -demand treatment 
periods will be considered.  
Efficacy of Prophylactic Treatment with Wilate  
The efficacy of prophylactic treatm ent with Wilate  will be assessed by comparing each patient’s 
individual ABR  under prophylactic treatment in this study wi th the ABR  recorded for the same 
patient in a previous, non- interventional, study or with the ABR that can reliably be obtained 
from th e patient ’s bleeding document ation . 
Efficacy of prophylactic treatment with Wilate will be statistically evaluated by analysing the 
primary endpoint, i.e., demonstrat ion that the TABR during prophylactic treatment lowers the 
patients’ TABR during on-demand treatment by more than 50%. 
To test whether the mean TABR during prophylactic treatment (TABR pr) is less than half the 
historical mean TABR during on- demand treatment (TABR od), the following pair of hypotheses 
will be tested using a paired t- test assuming log- normally distributed data: 
H0: mean( TABR pr / TABR od) ≥0.5 vs H 1: mean( TABR pr / TABR od) <0.5 
at a one -sided alpha level of 2.5%. A corresponding two-sided 95% CI for the TABR will also 
be provided. To assess the qualitative robustness of the inferential result, the hypothesis will additionally be 
tested with the Wilcoxon (matched -pair signed rank) test on the log- transformed bleeding rate 
as a distribution -free alternative. Also, a 95% Hodges -Lehmann CI for the median differe nce 
will be reported. In addition to the comparison of the patients’ TABR during on-demand and prophylactic treat-
ment, intra -individual comparisons with each patient’s documented historical TABR  will be 
performed. For this, descriptive statistics for histo rical TABR and TABR during prophylactic 
treatment and their intra -individual differences will be tabulated. Descriptive statistics will also 
be presented for the SABR. 
Efficacy of Wilate in the Treatment of Breakthrough Bleedings 
To assess the haemostatic efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment of breakthrough BEs  during 
prophylaxis, a frequency distribution of all treated BEs that were successfully treated will be 
presented overal l and by severity, along with an exploratory 95% CI  for the proportion of suc-
cessfully treated BEs.

inetic Analysis 
All PK analyses will be based on the PK set . The following PK parameters for will be analysed:  
Area under the curve (AUC) and AUC norm (normalized for the administered dose)
In vivo h alf-life (T½)
Maximum plasma concentration (C max)
Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max)
Mean residence time (MRT)
Volume of distribution (Vd)
Clearance (CL)
Incremental in vivo recovery (IVR)
PK parameters will be computed for VWF:A c (VWF:RCo)  and FVIII:C. Both chromogenic 
(CHR) and one -stage (OS) assays, actual IMP potencies , and actual sampling times will be used 
in the calculations. PK parameters will be derived by non- compartmental  methods. 
The PK profiles of VWF:Ac  and FVIII:C and the PK parameters derived from them will be 
summarized by descriptive statistics (including geometric means and standard deviations) as 
well as the presentation of concentration vs time plots (individual values and means). 
Subgroup Analyses 
Analyses of the  primary endpoint assessing the e fficacy of prophylactic t reatment with Wilate  
and the secondary endpoint assessing the efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment of breakthrough 
bleedings will be presented for the following subgroups: 
Age ( 6–11 years ,’ ‘12–16 years, ’ and ‘ ≥17 years’)
Race (‘American Indian or Alaska Native,’ ‘Asian,’ ‘Black or African American,’
‘Native Hawaiian or Other Pacif ic Islander,’ ‘White,’ ‘Other’)
Geographical region (‘patients in the US,’ ‘patients outside the US’)
Sex (‘female,’ ‘male’)
Analysis of PK parameters will be presented by age (‘6–11 years’ and ‘12–16 years ’). 
Efficacy of Wilate in Surgical Prophylaxis 
To assess the efficacy of Wilate  in surgical prophylaxis, a frequency distribution of the efficacy 
rating for all surgical procedures will be presented. All other surgery data (e.g., severity, type, 
IMP consumption) will be presented descriptively. 
Efficacy of Wilate in Menstrual Bleedin g 
To assess the relative haemostatic efficacy of Wilate  in the treatment of menstrual bleeding 
during prophylaxis compared to on- demand treatment , changes in the PBAC score will be an-
alysed  based on complete cycle data. Only women of childbearing potential will be included in 
the analysis, which will include estimates and 95% C Is for PBAC score changes.

s of Other Endpoints 
The statistical analysis of other endpoints will be descriptiv e, including exploratory 95% CIs. 
9.2.3 Safety Analysis Plan 
All safety analyses will be based on the SAF population. 
The analysis of safety will be based on the occurrence of AEs, the results of the safety laboratory 
tests, and the occurrence of parvovirus B19 seroconversions. 
AEs will be coded according to the latest Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version. The analysis will include only treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs), i.e., AEs that started or worsened after the first  IMP infus ion. All TEAEs, related 
TEAEs (i.e., TEAEs probably or possibly related to the IMP), and serious TEAEs will be sum-marised and tabulated according to MedDRA primary system organ class and preferred term. 
Patient listings will be provided for patients with S AEs, AEs leading to withdrawal from study, 
and AEs leading to death. 
Time profiles of the safety laboratory parameters will be analysed  by presenting sampling sta-
tistics for the values as well as their difference to baseline at each time point. Additionally, 
frequency tables for values outside the normal ranges will be presented.  
Similarly, time profiles of VWF and FVIII inhibitor testing results will be analysed  by present-
ing sampling statistics for the values as well as frequency tables for positive findings, along with 95% Pearson-Clopper CIs. 
To assess the viral safety of Wilate , incidences of parvovirus B19 seroconversions between 
baseline and end of study will be estimated along with 95% Pearson-Clopper CIs. Other safety parameters (e.g., changes in ph ysical examination findings) will be analysed  by 
summary tables or listings.  
The analysis of the safety parameters recorded during surgery (lab values) will be purely de-
scriptive and presented as summary tables or listings. 
9.2.4 Handling of Missing Data 
In general, missing data will not be imputed. Calculations pertaining to the derivation of the 
TABR will be based on documented time periods only. 
Only in case of missing body weight will the last available weight measurement be used for 
calculating the dose per kg bodyweight (last observation carried forward, LOCF).

10.1 Ethical/Regulatory Framework 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid down in the Decla-
ration of Helsinki. The study protocol and any subsequent amendment(s) will be submitted to an Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Board (IRB)  and to the Regu la-
tory Authority. The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The regulatory application or submission for regulatory approval will be made by the Sponsor 
or designated third party (e.g., CRO) as required by national law. 
10.2 Approval of Study Documents 
The study protocol, a sample of the patient information and informed consent form, any other materials provided to the patients , and further requested information will be submitted by the 
Sponsor or the investigator to the appropriate IEC /IRB  and the Regulatory Authority. The study 
must be approved by the IEC/IRB and the Regulatory Authority before any IMP may be shipped to the study sites and any patient  is exposed to a study- related procedure.  
The Sponsor, the investigator, and any third party (e .g., CRO) involved in obtaining approval 
must inform each other in writing that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient is enrolled in the study.  
10.3 Patient Information and Informed Consent 
The investigator will obtain freely given written consent from each patient  after an appropriate 
explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, potential hazards , and any other aspect 
of the study which is relevant to the patient’s  decision to participate. The informed consent form 
must be signed, with name and date and time noted by the patient , before the patient  is exposed 
to any study-related procedure, includi ng screening tests for eligibility.  
For patients not qualified to give legal consent, written consent must be obtained from the le-
gal parent /guardian. If children are old enough to understand the risks and benefits of the 
study, they should also be informed and provide their oral or written assent . 
The investigator will explain that the patients  are completely free to refuse to enter the study or 
to withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for their further care and without 
the need to justify. The investigator will complete the informed consent section of the e CRF for 
each patient  enrolled. 
Each patient  will be informed that his medical ( source ) records may be reviewed by the study 
monitor, a quality assurance auditor , or a health authority inspector, in accordance with appli-
cable regulations, and that these persons are bound by confidentiality obligations.

Page 82 of 86 10.4 Protocol Amendments 
Any prospective change to the protocol will be agreed between the Co-ordinating Investigator 
and the Sponsor prior to its implementation. Any such amendments will be submitted to the IEC/IRB  and/or competent authority responsible as required by applicable regulations. 
IEC/IRB  approval will , at a minimum, be requested for any change to this protocol which could 
affect the safety of the patients, the objective/design of the study, any increase in dosage or duration of exposure to the IMP , an increase in the number of patients treated, the addition of a 
new test or procedure, or the dropping of a test intended to monitor safety. 
10.5 Confidentiality of Patient Data 
The investigator will ensure that th e patient ’s confidentiality is preserved. On CRFs or any other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor, the patients will not be identified by their names, but by a unique patient identifier . Documents not intended for submission to the Sponsor, i .e., the 
confi dential patient identification code list, original consent  and assent  forms , and source rec-
ords, will be maintained by the investigator in strict confidence.

Page 83 of 86 11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 
11.1 Periodic Monitoring 
The monitor will contact and visit the investigator periodically to review all study- related 
source data/records, verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, correctness and 
accuracy of all eCRF entries compared to source data. The investigator will co -operate with the 
monitor to ensure that any discrepancies identified are resolved.  
For this study, the first monitoring visit shall take place shortly after the inclusion of the first patient . Thereafter, monitoring frequency will depend on study progress. 
The monitor must be given direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify , and reproduce any rec-
ords and reports that are important to the evaluation of the clinical study. Source data will be available for all data in the eCRFs, including all laboratory results. 
11.2 Audit and Inspection 
The investigator will make all study- related source data and records available to a qualified 
quality assurance auditor mandated by the Sponsor, or to IEC/ IRB/ regulatory inspectors, after 
reasonable notice. The main purposes of an audit or inspection are to confirm that the rights and welfare of the patients  have been adequately protected, and that all data relevant for the 
assessment of safety and efficacy  of the IMP have been reported to the Sponsor. 
12 REPORTING AND PUBLICATION 
12.1 Clinical Study Report 
A clinical study report (in accordance with relevant guidelines and the Sponsor’s Standard Op-
erating Procedures ) will be prepared by the Sponsor after completion of the study. The Co-
ordinating Investigator will approve the final study report after review. 
12.2 Publication Policy 
The results of this study may be publis hed or presented at scientific meetings.  
If this is envisaged by an investigator , the investigator agrees to inform the Sponsor and to 
submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to submission to an editorial board or scientific review committee. This will allow the Sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments based on information that may not yet be available to the investigator. 
In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will support publication 
of multi- centre  studies only in their entirety and not as individual centre data. Authorship w ill 
be determined by mutual agreement.

An innovative proof -of-concept approach to identify age -modulating drugs capable of 
reversing inflammation and re -setting the epigenetic clock  (Topical -RAPA)  
Objectives  
AIM 1: Test whether epigenetic changes in skin are elicited by topical treatments with                  
RAPA 
AIM 2: Test whether baseline inflammation is affected by topical RAPA  
Design and Outcomes   
This is a double -blinded pilot treatment study, where e ach subject provides his/her  own 
control to assess whether rapamycin will stop, slow, or reverse the “epigenetic clock” 
using DNA extracted from skin and the change in levels of inflammatory mediators 
measured in blister fluid in healthy subjects aged 65- 95 years.   
Interventions and Duration  
Rapamycin 8% ointment will be applied topically , 0.25ml, to one of the participant ’s 
forearms and matching placebo , 0.25ml, to the opposite forearm daily for a total of 6 
months. The total participant duration will include a consenting/screening visit (0) will 
last 60 -90 minutes, followed by monthly visits (1- 6) of up to 60 minutes, and followed by 
the final visit (7) of up to 4 hours.  
 
Sample Size and Population  
The study aims to recruit 75 subjects to ensure at least 40 completers, approximately half 
male and half female.

2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE   
2.1 Background on Co ndition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The study is focused on the effects of mTOR antagonism specifically on elderly subjects.  
In order to identify drugs and/or interventions with the potential to delay the onset and progression 
of age -associated pathologies, preclinical studies have used animal models where extension of 
lifespan could be accurately assessed. Several outstanding candidate therapeutics have been identified over the last decade; these include mTOR inhibitors (like rapamycin), senolytic agents, acarbose, and others. However, translating anti -aging results from animal models into humans has 
been challenging. For exampl e, measuring extension of lifespan would be impractical in humans, 
so it is necessary to identify and validate parameters that can serve as surrogate markers of healthy aging. Moreover, the efficacy of age -modulating drugs is often only demonstrable with older 
individuals where functional deficits are already evident. Thus, testing of potential anti -aging 
therapeutics should be done in a cohort of human subjects of an advanced age; issues of safe administration would be even more acute in this “at risk” population. To circumvent these limitations, we propose to develop and validate an innovative, minimally invasive, cost -effective 
assay in human subjects ranging from 65- 95 years old. The putative anti -aging test drug will be 
applied topically to a discrete a rea of skin on the subject’s forearm while a “vehicle only” (control) 
is applied in parallel to the opposite arm. Thus, each subject will serve as his/her own control. The pharmacodynamic outcomes at the “test” and placebo sites will be compared in both ma les and 
females since the effects of age- modulating agents often differ between the sexes. Ascertaining 
the efficacy of topically -applied therapeutics requires robust biomarkers of aging that can be 
measured in skin, but will be generalizable to the intact organism. Towards this end, we have opted 
to use two independent parameters that are known to be modified with aging both locally (in individual tissues) and systemically: i) the DNA methylation pattern or “epigenetic clock” and  ii) biomarkers associated  with inflammation. To validate the proposed technique, we have chosen a 
drug, rapamycin (RAPA), which has already been shown to modulate aging in rodents and which 
has been tested for safe systemic application in humans [1 -4]. After a 6 month treatment phase, 
suction blisters will be generated at each site to allow collection of skin cells (blister flap) for use in the epigenomic analysis (Aim 1) and interstitial (blister) fluid for use in measuring cytokines and other inflammatory regulators (Aim 2). Once  validated, our approach can be used to safely 
and efficiently screen the age -modulating potential of pharmacological agents in humans to 
identify those agents that warrant large, expensive human clinical trials with systemic agent administration.  
 
 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   7  2.2 Study Rationale  
Demonstrating age modulating benefits of drugs in long- lived humans is challenging. Although 
there are outstanding animal models used to identify candidate interventions which extend 
lifespan [2, 3, 13], an efficient and cost -effective approach t o test which of these drugs can be 
used safely and with efficacy in an older human cohort is not available. Thus, we propose to 
develop and validate an innovative, relatively safe, minimally invasive approach for the initial 
evaluation of the potential eff icacy of purported age -modulating agents in humans prior to 
moving forward with a large, costly human clinical trial. Our scientific premise is that putative age-modulating agents can be pre -screened for beneficial effects through topical application to 
the skin of humans. In this way, the drug effects will be limited to the small test area with 
minimal or no systemic delivery, thereby avoiding serious risks to the human subjects. As 
summarized in Figure 1, potential agents can be applied to different ‘expe rimental’ skin sites in 
the same person with simultaneous application of ‘control’ placebo treatments on opposite 
forearms. This approach will allow each subject to serve as his/her own control. Age -modulating 
efficacy of the tested agent(s) can be assessed from skin samples obtained from the experimental 
treated and placebo control sites. Skin samples can be easily obtained with suction blister or 
small punch biopsy techniques for subsequent testing [14- 17]. Ascertaining the age modulating 
efficacy from th ese samples will require robust biomarkers of aging that can be measured in skin, 
but will be generalizable to the intact organism. Towards this end, we have opted to use two 
parameters that are known to be modified with aging both locally (in individual t issues) and 
systemically: i) the DNA methylation pattern or “epigenetic clock” and ii) biomarkers associated 
with inflammation.   
To validate the proposed pre -screening approach, we have chosen to initially test a single agent, 
rapamycin (RAPA), an mTOR pa thway antagonist. RAPA has been shown to prolong lifespan in 
rodents. Improvements in cognition, cardiovascular function, and certain aspects of immunity 
were also demonstrated in animal models [7, 18- 23].  Based on these promising results, we 
undertook a pilot study of orally- delivered RAPA in older (aged 70 -95 yrs) human subjects as a 
potential anti- aging therapeutic. As described in detail [1], short -term (2 months) RAPA 
treatment was relatively well tolerated in these older individuals. In addition, we and others have 
established that RAPA can be efficaciously delivered transdermally [24, 25]. As shown in Figure 
2A, easily detectable levels of the drug are obtained locally (in the skin at the application site) 
within 12 hours of application while there w as no detectable level of RAPA in the blood even 
after 7 days of topical application of 8% RAPA. Moreover, as shown in Figure 2B, 7 days of 8% 
RAPA led to improved endothelium -dependent vasodilation in older, but not younger persons, 
demonstrating that thi s treatment exerted pharmacological effects. In an "N of 1" study, 8 months 
of topical 8% RAPA treatment decreased the size of keloids (Kellogg, data not shown). Topical RAPA has also been tested clinically and shown to be efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis 
and tuberous sclerosis [24, 26, 27]. Thus, mTOR inhibition with RAPA should be an excellent 
model for development and validation of the proposed pre -screening protocol. The ‘long- term’ 
significance is that, once validated, our approach can be used to safely and efficiently screen the age-modulating potential of pharmacological agents in humans, in vivo, in a relatively short 
amount of time in order to identify those agents that warrant large, expensive human clinical 
trials with systemic agent administration.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   8   
b) Innovation:  
We will develop a new pre- screening approach that can be safely used for translational studies in 
humans. The proposed protocol, employing topical application, should both enhance our 
understanding of underlying mechanisms affe cted by aging and identify the most promising age -
modulating pharmacological therapies for future clinical trials with systemic administration. A 
priority for translating the pharmacological manipulation of aging from animal models into humans, especially in the geriatric age group, is subject safety. Since these test interventions will 
be given to essentially healthy persons to treat aging (a normal life process) rather than to 
mitigate an overt disease process, taking age- modulating drugs must entail no a dditional risks 
over those inherent in normal aging.  Furthermore, successful agents must act to prolong 
healthspan or at least delay the onset of age -related pathologies. Ideally, age modulating agents 
would ‘reset’ the biological clock and slow or revers e the increase in baseline inflammation; 
thereby rejuvenating treated individuals. The innovation in this proposal derives from the choice 
of biomarkers to be followed to assess efficacy of topical treatment. First, we propose to use two 
independent measur es of aging such that simultaneous effects on both outcomes would be highly 
significant. Second, the “epigenetic clock” defined by Dr. Steve Horvath (a collaborator on this 
project), is an innovative tool for estimating chronological age of cells based on the DNA 
methylation at 391 CpG motifs. This test has been previously validated for both skin cells and 
blood cells, suggesting that the results from topical administration will be directly translatable to 
systemic dosing. Third, to test for the effect of t he topically applied drug on baseline 
inflammation, we will use a multiplex Luminex array to measure levels of 29 human cytokines 
(both pro and anti -inflammatory). In addition, ELISAs will be performed on three analytes 
known to play critical roles in regulating inflammation: IL -6 (interleukin- 6), soluble ICAM -1, 
and RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). Importantly, by using RAPA as the 
initial test compound, we will be able to directly compare the results with topical application to 
results  from human clinical trials with oral administration. The future implications and potential 
uses deriving from this “high risk, potentially high reward” R21 are vast.  
c) Approach:  
Rationale. The NIA Interventions Testing Program (ITP) was developed to ass ess the potential of 
drugs to extend lifespan in mice and has identified several promising candidates, including 
aspirin, rapamycin (RAPA), 17αEstradiol, acarbose, NDGA (nordihydroguaiaretic acid), and Protadim [28] Additional putative age -modulating compounds have been identified through other 
approaches; these include senolytics, NAD precursors, and Sirtuin activators, among others [2]. 

20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   9  Although several of these agents have moved into human clinical trials, such efforts are limited 
due to: i) high costs; ii) the inability to use “lifespan” as an outcome measure in long- lived 
humans; and  iii) the reluctance to test drugs in an older “at risk” population. This last limitation 
is often circumvented either by using a younger subject cohort or by targeting individuals with 
serious illnesses; neither of these options is ideal. For example, some age -modulating drugs only 
show a treatment effect in older subjects where the loss of function with age changes the baseline 
allowing an effect to be detected (one such example is shown in Figure 2B where an effect of 
topical RAPA was seen only in older subjects). Similarly, studies of older subjects with cancer, 
autoimmunity, or another illness are compromised by associated co -morbidities and other drugs 
being taken to tr eat the primary illness. Thus, it is critically important to test putative age -
modulating drugs on an older human cohort that is otherwise clinically stable.   
The ‘gold standard’ for testing a drug for its ability to slow the ravages of aging would be a l ong-
term placebo -controlled human clinical trial where changes in lifespan and age- associated 
pathologies could be assessed. However, this is simply not feasible in humans and is even 
challenging in relatively long- lived non- human primate models. Thus, we propose to develop 
and validate an innovative, minimally invasive, safe, and cost -effective technique for initial 
translational testing of purported age -modulating agents in humans. Our approach utilizes topical 
application of the intervention being tested to the skin of consenting human subjects. In order to sample the treated skin regions, suction blisters will be generated as a source of skin cells (keratinocytes) and blister fluid to be used in determining efficacy of the putative anti -aging 
treatment. There are several significant advantages inherent in this new approach. Specifically, 
the topical administration of agents to small areas of skin in humans will obviate the greater risks 
of systemic drug administration. As the target area is relatively sma ll, this approach will require 
significantly less drug than a systemic clinical trial at a much lower cost as well. Moreover, the 
risk to human participants will be minimized as the agent is only delivered into skin, not 
systemically. As our proposed approach is safer than systemic administration and less invasive, 
we anticipate that successful recruitment of volunteer subjects will be much easier which is 
particularly important when dealing with an older cohort. Lastly, multiple ‘experimental’ skin 
sites c an be treated simultaneously such that each subject will serve as his/her own control, 
thereby increasing statistical power and validity of the trial.   
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
Overall study design .  
As shown diagrammatically in Figure 1, consenting subjects would apply the test compound to 
designated experimental and control sites on their forearms for the study period. As discussed below, we have opted for daily dosing over a 6- month period. At that point, suction blisters 

20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   10  would be generated at each  of the sites; this will allow us to harvest both the skin flap and blister 
fluid. The efficacy of the potential age -modulating drug would then be assessed using two 
independent parameters: i) the potential to stop, slow, or reverse the “epigenetic clock” (Specific 
Aim 1) using DNA extracted from the skin and ii ) changes in the levels of inflammatory 
mediators (Specific Aim 2) measured in the blister (interstitial) fluid. The topical approach to 
drug pre -screening is ideal for several reasons. First, skin i s easily accessible and the applications 
can be handled by the subjects themselves. Second, human skin shows an invariant age -
dependent phenotype characterized by decreased epidermal thickness, changes in the 
vasculature, reduction in the number of melanoc ytes and dendritic (Langerhans) cells, and lower 
levels of specific collagen types. Third, it is relatively easy to access the treated skin and fluids 
therein using the already established suction blister protocol [15, 16]. Lastly, the cost associated 
with topical application is significantly lower than systemic dosing as one can obtain relatively 
high concentrations of the test agent when it’s being applied to a small area of skin; in this case, 
10 cm  ²/site.   
 
4 SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS   
Participants will not be excluded based upon ethnicity or race. For the proposed studies, we will 
draw on the general population of San Antonio and surrounding area which is more than 50% Hispanic. We suspect that we will have approximately 50% (or slightly more) Hispanic subjects in our proposed study.  In our past studies, our volunteer population has been approximately 50% male and 50% female and we anticipate recruiting this equal sex distribution for the proposed trial.  All subjects will be in good health, non- smoking persons between the ages of 65 and 95.  
As outlined previously, all ethnicities, racial groups, and both sexes will be studied.  Subjects will be enrolled after confirmation of good health by history and physical exam, clini cal 
laboratory tests (fasting glucose and lipid profile, metabolic profile, complete blood count, Hemoglobin A1C) and 12- lead ECG. The ethnicity of our past study populations generally 
reflected our local population: 47% Non- Hispanic White, 48% Hispanic, a nd 5% African 
American with an equal gender distribution.    
Vulnerable Populations:   No vulnerable populations will be involved in the proposed protocols.  
 
4.1 Inclusion Criteria  
Participants must meet all of the inclusion criteria to participate in this study:  
• 65-95 years of age.  
• Good health with all chronic diseases (hypertension, coronary artery disease, etc.) 
clinically stable.  
• Selected subjects will be in good health (Per the World Health Organization, good 
health will be defined as complete physical,  mental, and social well- being and not 
merely the absence of disease or infirmity).  
• All diseases or infirmities will be clinically stable whether managed by medications or not. 
• CLOX score of 10 or greater  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   11  • Women will be postmenopausal  
• Postmenopausal women taking hormone replacement will be included if they 
have been on a stable dose for ≥6 months  
• Participants will have been vaccinated for COVID -19 prior to beginning the 
treatment course  
• Participants will live within 20 miles of the UTHS A to facilitate home visits  (or 
may choose to meet in a mutually convenient location within 20 miles of the 
UTHSA for all home visits)  
4.2   Exclusion  Criteria  
All candidates meeting any of the exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
study pa rticipation : 
• Diabetes.  
• History of skin ulcers or poor wound healing, or keloid formers . 
• Smoking (current or within 5 years) . 
• Current l iver disease (acute or chronic) .

• Treatment with drugs known to affect cytochrome P450 3A (dilti azem, 
erythromycin, etc. - due to role in rapamycin metabolism).  
• Treatment with an immunosuppressant (prednisone, etc.) within the 6 months. 
• History of r ecent (within 6 months) Myocardial Infarction or active Coronary 
Disease.  
• Hypersensitivity to rapamycin or petrolatum (ointment vehicle) . 
• Tattoo or scar tissue on the forearm in the application area.  
  
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Healthy human volunteers of normal cognitive function capable of consenting will be consented 
as study participa nts. Since the effectiveness of some age- modifying drugs (i.e., RAPA) can 
become more evident with age (Fig. 1B), we will recruit test subjects r anging from 65 to 95 y ears 
old. Subjects will be non- smokers and will be instructed to continue taking any currently 
prescribed medications. Female subjects will be postmenopausal. All ethnicities and races will be 
included. Prior to initiating treatment, potential subjects will be screened for exclusions, 
including serious co- morbidities, by medical history, clinical labs, and physical examination 
including EKGs. Both male and female subjects will be recruited. This is critically important as 
the age- modul ating drugs often show greater efficacy in one sex. For example, RAPA was 
shown to extend lifespan to a greater extent in female mice than in males while acarbose showed 
the reverse [4, 29]. Thus, our goal is to recruit 75 subjects to ensure that there wil l be 40 
“completers”, approximately half female and half male. Towards this end, we will use the Subject Recruitment Call Center established and operated by the Research Core- 2 (RC2) of the 
San Antonio OAIC (Pepper Center; Dr. Kellogg, RC2 co- leader). This  center has been 
spectacularly successful in meeting subject recruitment goals for clinical trials of age modulating 
agents and has registered over 1800 persons who are willing to participate in future human trials.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   12  Other instruments for subject recruitmen t may also be used. These include:  i) the national online registry 
at https://www.researchmatch.org ,  ii) UT Health's Find -A-Study webpage at 
https://vpr.uthscsa.edu/findastudy/ ;  and  iii) the Barshop Clinical Trials webpage at  
https://barshopinstitute.uthscsa.edu/clinical -trials/; iv) ads may be placed in the San Antonio Express 
News or other local periodicals read by the target population, and v) ads may be placed on Facebook 
and/or other social media sites .   
Once subjects have been appropriate ly consented and cleared for participation, each individual 
will be given two  Topi -CLICK® containers of ointment and complete instructions on the 
application protocol. Initially, we will test 1 concentration of the drug with a “vehicle only” 
(negative control, petrolatum) applied to the opposite arm. Importantly, since each subject will 
serve as his/her own control, no separate placebo group will be needed.   
4.4 Subject Recruitment and Retention 
Subject recruitment will take place through the Subjec t Recruitment Call Center established and 
operated by the San Antonio Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center (SA  
OAIC) Research Core- 2 (RC2, Dr. Kellogg Core Co- Leader).  RC2 developed the "Call Center 
and Participant Registry" for efficient subject recruitment.  The public is made aware of the Call 
Center through advertisements placed by the SA OAIC in local newspapers, websites, social media, or other online resources, on broadcast media, and through local presentations to civic groups.  The  Center has one primary phone line that receives phone calls from potential 
participants.  Potential subjects are asked for permission to enter demographic and preliminary clinical data that are subsequently entered into a REDCap based registry. The Call C enter is 
active 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and is the main point of entry for participants for aging studies such as the present proposal.  RC2 staff determine each caller's study suitability based on the caller’s interest, initial screening informatio n, and study eligibility criteria (which can vary 
among ongoing studies).  This subject database currently has records of 1811 persons who are willing trial participants.  The REDCap database of potential subjects will be queried for the proposed trial as the major source of recruitment, significantly reducing costs for external advertising. Enrolled subjects will be seen at in -person monthly Visits 1 -6 in their homes (or at 
an alternate convenient site) and contacted bi -weekly by the study team to facilita te retention and 
to confirm treatment compliance.
 Visits 4 and 6 may be conducted by phone with those subjects who 
have demonstrated their strict compliance to protocol (in Visits 2 and 3) and have experienced no adverse  
effects.  
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
The selection of topical application of 8% RAPA in petrolatum is based on our preliminary data.  
Our preliminary data indicate that topical 8% RAPA ointment: 
a) produces local effects (reduced EC50 for endothelium -dependent vasodilator response to 
methacholine in older, but not younger , persons; it also led to keloid regression);  
b) produces detectable intradermal RAPA levels (as measured with intradermal microdialysis);  
c) is without local or systemic adverse reactions; and  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   13  d) this concentration of RAPA ointment produces no detectable systemic RAPA levels.  
These preliminary results support our view that this treatment is safe for use in older humans. 
 
 
To validate the proposed technique, RAPA was chosen as our initial test agent; it has been found 
to extend lifespan in laboratory animals [4], be transdermally deliverable with topical application 
(see [24] and Fig. 2), improve epigenetic aging signatures in mice [30, 31], and restore some 
physiological functions in animal models when systemically delivered [7, 18- 23, 32]. Moreover, 
we and others have shown that RAPA can be used with relative safety in older humans, even 
with systemic delivery [1, 5, 6]. In preliminary feasibility studies, RAPA ointments (1% or 8%) 
were applied to forearm skin sites and RAPA delivery into the skin interstitial space was 
assessed by placing an intradermal microdialysis probe at each site and then measuring the drug 
levels att ained in the collected interstitial fluid by HPLC -mass spec. As shown in Figure 2A, 
significant RAPA levels (11.5±4.0 ng/ml) were seen with a 7 day course of the 8% RAPA 
ointment; while a 1% dose yielded much lower values. Simultaneous blood sampling after  1 
week of 8% RAPA dosing showed undetectable RAPA in the serum; thus, the treatment should 
be efficacious locally without having systemic consequences.   
    
5.1.1 Compounded Investigational Product  
 
5.1.1.1 Rapamycin powder (from a supplier to Doyle’s pharmacy)  
Molecular formula: C51H79NO 13 
Synonyms:  Rapamune, sirolimus  
PubChem Substance ID  57654583  
CAS No. 53123- 88-9 
An FDA -approved macrocyclic triene antibiotic forms a complex with FKBP12 that binds to and 
inhibits the molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR). Rapamycin (RAPA) is a potent 
immunosuppressant and has anticancer activity. 

20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   14  i) Mechanism of Action  
The RAPA oral formulation developed by Pfizer (RAPAMUNE, sirolimus) inhibits T 
lymphocyte activation and proliferation that occurs in response to antigenic and cytokine (Interleukin [IL] -2, IL -4, and IL -15) stimulation by a mechanism that is distinct from that of 
other immuno- modulator s.  In cells, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin, FK Binding Protein- 12 
(FKBP -12). The sirolimus: FKBP -12 complex has no effect on calcineurin activity. This 
complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian Target Of Rapamycin (mTOR), a key regulatory kinase. This inhibition suppresses cytokine -driven T -cell proliferation, inhibiting 
the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Dosage forms and strengths include: 
oral solution (60mg/60mL in amber glass bottle) and oral tablets (0.5, 1, and 2mg). 
ii) Safety  
From oral administration, serious allergic reactions identified by the manufacturer include:  
• swelling of face, eyes, or mouth 
• trouble breathing or wheezing  
• throat tightness  
• chest pain or tightness  
• feeling dizzy or faint  
• rash or peeling of skin  
In previous human studies cited earlier in this protocol, topical administration did not produce systemic or serious reactions. Potential Risks due to topical RAPA  include local skin rash or 
irritation; the drug does not reach detectable levels systemically . Participants will be instructed to 
notify the research team and get help right away if any of the above symptoms of an allergic reaction occur.  
iii) Storage  
The powder is packaged in a glass bottle with instructions to keep container tightly closed in a dry and well -ventilated place.  
5.1.1.2 
Petrolatum (Vaseline, vehicle only)  
i) Mechanism of Action  
Petrolatum is a pale yellow to yellow -colored, translucent, soft unctuous mass. It is odorless, 
tasteless, and not more than slightly fluorescent by daylight, even when melted. Petrolatum is an 
inert material with few incompatibilities.  
ii) Safety  
Petrolatum is mainly used in topical pharmaceutical formulations and is generally considered to be a nonirritant and nontoxic material. Animal studies, in mice, have shown petrolatum to be nontoxic and non- carcinogenic. Although petrolatum is generally nonirritant in humans 
following topical application, rare instances of allergic hypersensitivity reactions have been 
reported, as have cases of acne, in susceptible individuals following repeated use on facial skin. However, given the widespread use of petrolatum in topical products, the re are few reports of 
irritant reactions. The allergic components of petrolatum appear to be polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present as impurities. The quantities of these materials found in petrolatum vary depending upon the source and degree of refining . Hypersensitivity appears to occur less with 
white petrolatum and it is often the preferred material for use in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   15  iii) Storage  
Petrolatum is an inherently stable material owing to the unreactive nature of its hydrocarbon 
components; most stability problems occur because of the presence of small quantities of impurities. On exposure to light, these impurities may be oxidized to discolor the petrolatum and produce an undesirable odor. Petrolatum should not be heated for extended periods above the temperature necessary to achieve complete fluidity (approximately 70°C/158°F). When heated to decomposition it emits acrid smoke and irritating fumes.  
Petrolatum may be sterilized by dry heat. Petrolatum should be stored in a well -closed container, 
protected from light, in a cool, dry place.  
iv) Regulatory Status  
GRAS listed. Accepted for use in certain food applications in many countries worldwide. 
Included in the FDA Inactive Ingredients Database (ophthalmic preparations; oral capsules a nd 
tablets; otic, topical, and transdermal preparations). 
5.1.2 Packaging 
Drug and placebo will be supplied by the compounding pharmacy in a metered dispenser called  
the Topi -CLICK® container. The opaque Topi -CLICK® dispenses 0.25 mL of ointment, 
protects the product from light exposure, and serves to conceal any subtle differences between 
placebo and investigational product.  
Drug will be labeled as an investigational drug as required by law:  
“Caution: New  Drug  — Limited by Federal (or United States) law to  investigational  use.”  
 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions  
The 8% rapamycin and vehicle- only ointments will be compounded and purchased from Doyle’s 
Professional Pharmacy  who ha ve experience compounding rapamycin for topical application in 
human clinical trials.  All the rapamycin ointment and the placebo (petrolatum only) ointment 
will be provided to participants in Topi -CLICK® containers, a pump bottle  for use in clinical 
trials that dispense 0. 25ml per depression of the pump actuator.  Potency studies show that the 
8% rapamycin in petrolatum retains 96.8% potency after 60 days when stored at room temperature.  Dr. Kellogg holds a current IND (#144448) for topical rapamycin ointment  used in 
another trial . The FDA determined that the current study of topical rapamycin was "exempt."    
Study drug will be shipped to and stored in a Research Pharmacy and dispensed to participants by the research pharmacy pharmacist. The study team will maintain records of drug accountability.  
NOTE: RAPA 8% ointment retains 96.8% potency after 6 0 days at room temperature, as 
documented in IND 144448 under Dr. Kellogg. 
 5.3 Concomitant Interventions  
5.3.1 Allowed Interventions  
• For female postmenopausal participants, hormone replacement therapy use is 
permitted if the subject has been on a stable dose for at least 6 months.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   16   
5.3.2  Prohibited Interventions  
• Systemic steroid or immunosuppressant therapy  
• Body lotions, astringents, or ot her skin applications including cosmetics and 
especially sunscreen to the targeted skin  area(s)  
• Other antifungal, antibiotic, or topical preparations  
 
5.3.3 Drug interactions  
In previous human studies cited earlier in this protocol, topical administration did not produce 
systemic or serious reactions. Participants will be instructed to notify the research team and get 
help right away if any of the above symptoms of an allergic reaction occur.  
Drug interactions with systemic use include: Induc ers of CYP3A4 and P -gp may decrease 
sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P -gp may increase sirolimus 
concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, 
rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoc onazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, 
telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P -gp. Avoiding consumption of grapefruit juice 
is also cited.  
 
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Subjects will be c ontacted  monthly either in person or by phone ( Visits 2-7) to verify compliance . In 
addition, subjects will be called approximately 14 days after Visit 1 to ensure that they have been 
following the application directions and have no questions or potential adverse events. Subjects also 
receive a drug diary to hel p record administrations and any notable effects, which supports reporting 
the participant’s experiences at phone follow -ups and clinic visits.  
Each Topi -CLICK® container will be weighed before being given out and at collection (after 2 
months) to quantify compliance.

6.2.1 Visit 0  (60 to 90 minutes)  
 6.2.1.1 Consenting Procedure  
Before any screening procedure is performed, informed consent must be obtained. Eligible 
subjects will be asked to come to the research area to review and sign the consent form. Staff 
conducting the consent process adhere to local standard operating procedure (SOP) for consent 
administration. When scheduling consent appointments, staff will ask participants to arrive 
fasting. 
Participants will be asked at each visit whether they would like to continue participation in this 
study.  
 
6.2.1.2 Screening  /Baseline  
Following consent and signature, participants will undergo minimal cognitive screen using the 
CLOX1 test to ensure consent is valid. The CLOX test is a clinical tool widely used in screening 
for cognitive disorders and dementia, which involves a clock drawing task designed to elicit 
executive impairment and discriminate it from non -executive failure.   Study staff will:  
• Obtain vital signs, height and weight, lab work (fasting) to ensure safety and rule out 
systemic infection (complete blood count [CBC], comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP], 
lipid panel , HbA1C content ) 
• Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)  
• Document medical history, concomitant medication review, phys ical examination, and  
• Perform evaluation of eligibility criteria listed in Sections 4.1 –  4.2 above.  
 
Additional baseline activities and data collection to include: 
• Current and recent medications within past 6 months  
• Verification of application sites of study drug, RAPA/placebo  
 
6.2.2 Visit 1 (Less than 60 minutes) 
• Verify participant is still willing to participate in study  
• Explain how to apply medication and possible side effects to monitor.  
Use of the study drug  
Each ointment will be applied to a 10 cm² area of skin on the forearm with randomization 
among subjects of which side (left vs. right) receives RAPA vs. placebo to eliminate any 
positional bias. Importantly, each subject will be his/her own control. To permit double -
blinding while avoiding treatment confusion, dispensers will be color coded and subjects 
will have the skin sites similarly colored using surgical marke rs. The initial application 
will be done for subject education; thereafter, the subjects will apply the compounds daily and refresh the pen outlines as needed. Fresh Topi -CLICK® containers will be given  to 
each subject on a bi -monthly basis.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   19  After ointmen t application, subjects will cover the site with hypo -allergenic bandage    to 
prevent ointment removal or soiling of clothing. Subjects will be instructed to avoid 
cross -contamination between forearm sites by washing hands between applications and 
using new  disposable  finger cots ( glove -like, but cover only the finger)  with ea ch application. 
Subjects will be contacted/visited monthly to verify compliance. Topi -CLICK® containers 
will be weighed before they are given to participants and at collection ( after two month s) 
to quantify compliance and the amounts used. 
• Dispense study drug , two color coded Topi -CLICK® containers .  
• Phone calls will be made to follow up with subjects regarding adherence or AEs  approximately 
14 days after Visit 1.  
 
6.2.3 Visit 2 (Less than 60 minutes) 
• Verify participant is still willing to participate in study  
 
6.2.4 Visit 3- 6 (Each less than 60 minutes)  
• Verify participant is still willing to participate in study  
• Study drug will be dispensed at Visit  #3 and #5 (60- day supply)  
• For subjects who have demonstrated outstanding compliance and have experienced no adverse 
events, Visits 4 and/or 6 may be replaced by phone calls.  
 
6.2.5 Visit 7  (up to 4 hours)   
• Verify participant is still willing to participate in study  
• Physical exam  
• Self-reported AEs  
• Rapamycin blood levels  
• Suction blister fluid collection  
• Suction blister skin flap collection  
Process for induction of a suction blister  
Blisters are induced at the sites of rapamycin/placebo administration on the subjects by means of 
a negative pressure cutaneous suction method.  The Negative Pressure Instrument System is a commercially available self -contained instrument package that combines all the necessary 
elements to successfully create suction blisters on a patient's skin. The blisters are created through the use of suction cham bers that are attached to the patient's skin. The instrument 
console contains the power source, vacuum pump, temperature controls and all related controls to operate multiple suction chambers. The suction chambers are connected to the console by a flexible  connection. Each of the chambers is controlled by a preset temperature control to 
provide an optimal skin warming temperature. Both chambers share an adjustable common vacuum source that affects all chambers equally.  
1) Assemble the suction device.  
2) Disinfect  the orifice plate and the skin of the volunteer using alcohol swabs.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   20  3) Attach the suction device within the treatment area on each forearm, by loosely securing 
the chamber with the provided straps. The chamber will adhere to the skin and maintain 
its position once negative pressure is applied.  
4) Turn the suction device on and adjust the pressure to - 20kPa (150mmHg)  
5) After 30 minutes, increase the negative pressure to - 25kPa  (187.5 mm Hg) , and then to -
30kPa  (225 mmHg)  after 60 minutes. Keep the pressure at - 30kPa  (225 mm Hg)  until a 
blister is fully formed. The blister induction phase ranges from 60- 180 minutes. 
6) Once the blister is fully formed, release the pressure, and carefully remove the suction 
chamber whilst maintaining integrity of the blister.  
7) Note the t ime taken for blister induction.  
 
Harvesting the s uction blister f luid and blister r oof 
1) Using a sterile 1- 3 ml syringe with a 23G -26G needle, insert the needle into the 
top/lateral side of the blister roof and slowly aspirate the fluid, avoiding touching the 
floor of the cavity. Withdraw as much fluid as possible, and transfer to a sterile microfuge tube.  
2) Remove the blister roof using a  sterile scalpel or sterile surgical scissors and store at -
80°C for subsequent nucleic acid isolation.  
3) Apply an antibiotic ointment (such as Neosporin) and a band aid to the blister, as long as the subject does not have any allergic reaction to the antibi otic ointment. The blister 
should heal within a week, no anesthesia is required for this procedure.  
 
7 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Participant safety will be monitored once an individual is enrolled in the study. Dr. Kellogg will be responsible for ensuring the first -hand monitoring of the data and safety of study participants 
on a monthly basis. He will be assisted by other members of the study staff.  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Protection against risk is paramount in our research and in the operation of our laboratory. The 
risks of the proposed studies are extremely small.  This is by design and reflects the history and philosophy of the laboratory.  All of our proposed studies are reviewed and approved by our IRB prior to any studies in the clinic or laboratory.  All volunteers will be in good health, as documented by a medical history and physical examination performed by overseeing clinical staff. Volunteers will be queried using minimally invasive methods.  Antibiotic ointment and gauze are used to cover and protect the area of suction blister formation.  In the unlikely event of 
an adverse effect, appropriate medical procedures will be undertaken.  There are no known social, legal, or psychological risks.  At the time of collection, all data will be  de-identified and 
stored that way so that there is no risk to the privacy of individuals or confidentiality of data.  Data are stored in electronic form behind institutional electronic firewalls, or in physically secured laboratory facilities that are patrol led by armed police forces.  These procedures have 
adequately protected our data for decades and we believe that they will continue to  be highly 
effective in the future.  To minimize infection risk at suction blister sites, all subjects will have 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   21  the sites  treated with topical antibiotic ointment and covered with a bandage or gauze.  They will 
be provided with antibiotic ointment and bandages  for use at home until the sites have healed.  
Any participants with an  allergy to RAPA and persons with such sensitivity are excluded. Risks 
are minimized by the monitoring procedures we use, the selection of methods, and by the  
monitoring of adverse events and by using minimally invasive harvesting techniques for fluid 
aspiration and blister roof excision.  
7.2 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse E vent (AE): In general, AE is used very broadly and encompasses physical and 
psychological harms and includes:   
  
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research , whether or not it is 
considered related to the subject’s participation in the research.
 
 
Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regar ded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to addition al treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance  
Serious A dverse E vent (SAE ): Any adverse event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event 
as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization 
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant haza rds 
 
7.3 Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPIRSO)  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency (i.e. not described in study- related documents such 
as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc.)  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures 
involved in the research)  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  (includin g physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   22  7.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is normally defined as the period 
from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the study treatment follow -up. For this 
study, the study treatment follow -up is defined as 30 days following the last administration of 
study treatment.  
7.3.2 Pre-existing Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study. A pre -existing c ondition should be 
recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during 
the study period.  
 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition. At the 
end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an 
adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
7.3.3 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the following 
conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
The abnormality is of a clinically sig nificant degree requiring active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
 
7.3.4 Hospitalization , Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a SAE unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol. Any condition responsible for 
surgery should be documented as an AE if the condition meets the criteria f or and adverse event.  
 Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an AE in the 
following circumstances:  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a 
preexisting condition (e.g., colonoscopy, SCI annual evaluation, respite care).  
• Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was 
elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospitalization or pro longed hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the study.  
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it 
is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
 
7.4 Recording of Adverse Events  
At each contact with the subject, the investigator or study staff will seek information about adverse events 
by specific questioning and, if appropriate, by examination.  Information on all AEs will be recorded 
immediately in the source documentation. Site staff will record AEs using the appropriate data collection 
form in REDCap, which will be exported as an AE Log (See Section 9.3) for periodic review, at least 
monthly and ad hoc, depending on severity and expected/unexpected nature of the event.  
 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   23  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. SAEs that are still ongoi ng at the end 
of the study period will be followed up to determine the final outcome. Any SAE that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation will be recorded 
and reported per Instit utional policy and according to FDA requirements.  
7.6  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
 
SAEs and UPIRSOs will be reported per local IRB policy and procedure.  
 
Each subject is evaluated for any adverse events (AE). Any event t hat is reported to either the 
principal investigator or designated research staff by either the subject or medical staff caring for 
the subject and which meets the criteria will be documented. Any AE reported as serious will necessitate an adverse event report, which will be submitted to the IRB and to the Pepper Center DSMB.   
Unanticipated risks to subjects or others (UPIRSO) that are a result of study participation are promptly reported to the IRB and, if deemed appropriate, to the Pepper Center DSMB. The report will include a description of the event, when and how it was repo rted, as well as any 
official chart records or documentation to corroborate the event or the reporting of the event. All adverse events will be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. All adverse events will be summarized annually and submitted to the IRB. An y action resulting in a temporary or 
permanent suspension of this study (e.g. local site IRB actions) will be reported to FDA or drug manufacturer per IRB stipulations.   
7.6.1 Investigator Reporting: notifying DSMB  
Any study- related SAE -UPIRSO, must be re ported to the Principal Investigator by telephone 
within 24 hours of the event. To report such events, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form must 
be completed and submitted within 24 hours.  The investigator will keep a copy of this SAE form on file at the study site.    Report SAEs by email and facsimile to:  
Dean L. Kellogg, Jr, MD, PhD  
Professor, Medicine -Geriatrics  
Email: kelloggd@uthscsa.edu  
210-617-5132 fax      210 -235-3681 page  
   
Within the following 48 hours, the Principal Investigator provides further information on the SAE or the UPIRSO in the form of a written narrative. This should include a copy of the completed SAE form, and any other diagnostic information that will assist the understanding of the event.

7.9 Safety Monitorin g 
Data Safety Monitoring Pla n (DSMP):  Our studies are designed to explore both the responses 
to topical RAPA on DNA methylation (the Skin Epigenetic Clock) and the altered mechanisms 
involved in inflammation.  Dr. Kellogg will be responsible for ensuring the first -hand 
monitoring of  the data and safety of study participants on a weekly and monthly basis. He will 
be assisted by other members of the study staff. A REDCap database will be designed to include an inclusion/exclusion checklist that is reviewed and signed by Dr. Kellogg for  each subject 
enrolled before study medications are ordered by the investigators.  
 
The San Antonio Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for reviewing clinical trial data from the proposed study on an ongoing basis to ensure the safety of study subjects. This DSMB was created by the SA OAIC under the auspices of the SA OAIC Research Core 2 (RC2) to ensure subject safety and data integrity for studies involving older persons Board member s are 
independent, with no vested interest in this study. The DSMB will assign a staff member to conduct quarterly assessments for data quality control/assurance on collected data, which is reviewed on an annual basis by the Pepper Center Regulatory Coordi nator and PI at the time of 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   26  preparing continuing review documentation for IRB submission.  This study will be reviewed 
by the Pepper Center (DSMB) at least annually. The Pepper Center DSMB meets 3 -4 times a 
year, by teleconference call, to review study progress and participants’ safety. 
8 INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Should a subject develop a rash during study intervention, RAPA medication will be stopped and 
their participation will cease.  
In the unlikely event that a study- related death or SAE occurs, the decision to stop the trial, 
either temporarily or permanently, will be the collaborative responsibility of the Pepper Center 
DSMB and the Principal Investigator s. 
9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS   
9.1 General Design Issues  
The intent of this pilot proje ct is to validate the novel approach of examining age -modulating 
effects of pharmacological agents in humans, in vivo, through local transdermal drug application 
thus avoiding the risks of systemic drug administration.  We propose to study at least 40 older 
persons, age 65 -95.  We will study at least 20  women and 20 men.  The test agent for the project 
will be 8% rapamycin (RAPA) ointment with petrolatum- only ointment as a control agent.  
Ointment treatments will be for 6 months.  The duration derives i n part from our unpublished 
observation that 8 months of topical 8% RAPA ointment caused significant regression of an 
established keloid in a 63 year old person.  At present, there are no other in vivo data relevant to 
power analyses for our proposed proje ct; however, recently published in vitro work by our 
collaborator, Dr. Horvath, suggests that our approach may be viable in vivo.  In that study, Horvath and colleagues examined the in vitro effects of rapamycin on keratinocytes obtained 
from 3 different p ersons and found that rapamycin retarded keratinocyte aging independently 
from its effects on replicative senescence, proliferation rate or frequency, and differentiation (Horvath, Lu et al. 2019).  They also found that rapamycin inhibited cellular senesce nce, as well 
as epigenetic aging.  Our proposed trial will recapitulate the foregoing in vitro keratinocyte study design with substitution of in vivo treatment of keratinocytes in humans, in lieu of in vitro cell culture approach. Instead of samples from 3 different persons, we will study 50 different persons, 
half women and half men.  Our study use
s a "within -subject" design where each person will be 
his/her own control and thus increase statistical power.  In our pilot trial, we are interested in 
precise estimates of feasibility and acceptability, as well as outcome variability that will aid in 
the planning of future sufficiently powered efficacy trials.  
  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
A sample size of 40 persons with experimental (RAPA) and control sampl es from each person 
will allow us to be relatively precise in our conclusions regarding feasibility outcomes.  
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   27  9.2.1 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Participants are both the active comparator and control arm for the study with one forearm 
assigned as the active site and the other the control site. Randomization codes will be assigned to 
each subject for active study drug and placebo. Each participant receives color -coded Topi -
CLICK® containers of the study drug, which will be assigned to the same color -coded pat ch on 
the corresponding forearm. 
  
9.3 Interim analyses  and Stopping Rules  
The Sponsor, Dr. Kellogg , has the authority to stop patient participation, suspend accrual or stop 
the study in its entirety at any time for safety. (in particular any rash or skin reaction will stop 
that subject 's experiment.)  Dr. Kellogg will report all events (internal / exter nal) to the 
UTHSCSA Pepper Center DSMB and IRB per the UPIRSO reporting criteria.  UPIRSOs being 
submitted promptly and non- UPIRSOs reported at minimum annually.    
As described above, if an individual event or accumulation of events should occur that warr ant 
stopping the study, this will be done by Dr. Kellogg and DSMB.  Dr. Kellogg and DSMB will 
review safety summary reports and they will be reported to the IRB with progress reports or 
more promptly if they meet UPIRSO criteria.  
  
9.4 Primary Objective  
Test whether epigenetic changes in skin are elicited by topical treatments with RAPA  
 
Methylation of cytosine residues in DNA, particularly when found in CpG islands, is often associated with silencing of downstream genes. Dr. Horvath, a collabor ator on this project, has 
identified a set of 391 DNA methylation marks that change with aging and can be used to assess the age of an individual [34, 35]. His novel “epigenetic clock” has been used to predict “time to death” and parameters of healthy agin g. To determine the effects of topical RAPA on the 
epigenetic clock, DNA will be extracted from the blister skin flaps (keratinocytes) taken after treatment from the two sites on each subject using Qiagen DNeasy kits. The genomic DNA will be sent to the University of Minnesota Genomics Center for analysis on Infinium Methylation EPIC arrays. The data will be analyzed by Dr. Horvath; he will compare the profiles seen with RAPA to the profiles seen at the placebo site for each individual focusing on the methy lation 
marks that comprise the aging clock.  
 
9.5 Secondary Objectives  
Test whether baseline inflammation is affected by topical RAPA   
 
In order to examine the effect of topical RAPA (or any future test drug) on the inflammatory milieu in skin, Luminex- based assays will be performed on the interstitial fluid collected from 
suction blisters at the end of the 6 month treatment period. These all ow simultaneous 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   28  measurement of ≥ 29 different human cytokines/chemokines from as little as 30µl. It is 
anticipated that pro -inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL -12, IL -6, TNF -α) would be elevated in this 
older population, so a decrease in their levels upon treatment with RAPA (but not the vehicle) 
would support an anti -aging potential. Since inflammation underlies many age -associated 
pathologies, this finding would have broad implications. For this reason, we will also perform 
sensitive ELISAs for three analytes known to play a functional role in regulating age -associated 
inflammatory phenotypes. These will include:  i) interleukin -6 (IL -6); although present in the 
Luminex panel, IL -6 detection often requires a more sensitive ELISA [1]; ii) sICAM -1 (soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule -1, a biomarker of vascular endothelial cell activation/damage) 
[36] and iii) RAG E (receptor for advanced glycation end products) [37, 38]. Validated ELISA 
kits are commercially available for these three analytes and have been tested by us with sera 
from the subjects in the pilot human trial of oral RAPA (Fig. 4). Sufficient blister fluid will be 
recovered in order to perform all of the tests outlined including: i) RAPA levels by HPLC -mass 
spec; ii) Luminex multiplex cytokine arrays; and iii) ELISAs for IL -6, RAGE, and sICAM -1. 
Remaining fluid will be aliquoted and frozen at - 20°C.  
9.6 Data  Analyses  
As pilot studies are preparatory investigations that provide specific information necessary for 
planning subsequent definitive trials. A major purpose of the present proposal is to perfect the 
study design, measures, procedures, recruitment crite ria, and operational strategies for use in 
larger and/or longer subsequent trials with rapamycin and/or other purported anti -aging agents.  
 Our project will provide the means to evaluate the technical aspects of our novel approach of testing topical treatments with simultaneous untreated controls within individual subjects.  This 
pilot project will serve as a platform to generate preliminary data and foster new methodological 
development. Our pilot 'proof of concept' study is designed so that the information gained can be 
put to optimal use in future studies that build on scientific evidence of the efficacy and reduced 
costs of our approach.  
Our proposed 'proof of concept' trial will contribute to the development and design of future 
(larger and/or longer) studies by:  
– Refining the research hypotheses  
– Identifying barriers to successful study completion 
– Evaluating acceptability of methods and instruments to participants  
– Estimating the time required for study participation  
– Providing estimates of missing data and dropout  
– Estimating rates and variability in outcomes for future studies  
– Testing mechanistic efficacy/ ‘proof of concept’ for future trials  
Regarding analyses of inflammatory mediators:  
Assay results will be analyzed by 2 factor ANOVA (RAPA vs Placebo as within factor and sex as second factor); power calculations based on our prior studies with systemically administered 
20-720H, Kraig, Form BB, 08- 17-21, AMD.docx  Version 1.2   29  rapamycin indicate that N=9 may be needed for those inflammatory medi ators we previously 
found to decrease significantly with systemic RAPA (ICAM -1 and RAGE).  Calculations 
indicate that as many as 141 samples may be needed for others (IL -6) that we have not found to 
differ significantly with systemic RAPA. These estimates are based on unpaired comparisons 
between subjects who received systemic RAPA or placebo for 8 weeks. The design for the 
proposed trial permits each subject to serve as his/her own control and thus should reduce these 
estimates.  
 
10 DATA COLLECTION AND QUALIT Y ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Integrity  
Data integrity will be assessed by review of the written/computer (REDCap) documents used to 
record all collected data on a weekly basis. The representational faithfulness (composed of four

integrity of the data.   
14 PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH FINDINGS  
Publication authorship will be determined by the relative contributions of the PIs. It is likely that the first paper from this work will de monstrate validity of the topical age -modulating assay using 
rapamycin as the test drug. In this case, as in our previous paper (1), Dr. Kraig would likely handle much of the bench data analysis and would be first author, while Dr. Kellogg would have overs een all clinical aspects and comprehensive data analysis, so he would be the appropriate 
senior author. However, if the epigenomic data were used more extensively in a second paper, then Dr. Horvath might be first and the two PIs would have shared senior a uthorship. We make it 
a priority to discuss authorship openly before writing the paper(s).     
 
Dissemination Plan  
This trial has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ; Identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  All consent

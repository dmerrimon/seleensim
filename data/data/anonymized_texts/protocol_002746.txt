ConfidentialDOCUMENT HISTORY
Document Date of Issue Overall Rationale
3475 -715-06 04 -MAR -2019Data from the final anal ysis of KEYNOTE- 715/ECHO -306 (data cutoff: 13- DEC -2018) 
indicated that the study did not meet the pre -specified endpoint of improvement in 
objective response rate (ORR) for the combination of pembrolizumab plus epacadostat 
plus chemotherap y compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherap y plus placebo. 
Based upon these data from the final anal ysis, the Sponsor and MSD implemented this 
Amendment 06 to direct that all epacadostat and placebo administration stop and to reflect 
that the study  is no longer blinded. The study  will remain open so participants still on 
study  will have continued access to pembrolizumab.

ConfidentialPROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY OF CHANGES
Amendment 06
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:
Data from the final analysisof KEYNOTE- 715/ECHO -306 (data cutoff: 13-DEC-2018) indicated that the study  did not meet the pre -
specified endpoint of improvement in objective response rate (ORR) for the combination of pembrolizumab plus epacadostat plus 
chemotherap y compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherap yplus placebo .Based upon these data from the final anal ysis, the 
Sponsor and MSD implemented 
this Amendment 06 to direct that all epacadostat and placebo administration stop and to reflect that 
the study  is no longer blinded . The stud y will remain open so participants still on study  will have continued access to pembrolizumab.
Summary of Changes T able:
Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale
1. Sy nopsis Revised text and added notes to clarify  the removal of 
epacadostat and placebo treatments from the study ; 
participants may  choose to discontinue from the study  or 
continue on study  and receive pembrolizumab + 
chemotherap y or pembrolizumab as per protocol. Updated 
the duration of participation to reflect the removal of the 
Second Course Phase, Survival Follow
-up visits, and post -
treatment follow -up imaging as efficacy  endpoints will no 
longer be collected. In accordance with the overall rationale for 
the am endment provided above, all references 
to epacadostat and placebo, as well as 
assessments/procedures specific to these 
treatments, are removed from the protocol. 
The scope of the study  is reduced b y removal 
of the Second Course Phase, Follow -up 
Visits, and Survival Follow- up. Participants 
remaining in the stud y will be treated 
according to the site’s standard of care. 
Standard safet y reporting should continue, as 
applicable. Where deletion of text could cause 
confusion, due to the design of the stud y to 
date, the text has been left unchanged and a 
note has been added.2.1 Initial Treatment 
Phase SoAEpacadostat and matching placebo are removed from the 
study  and procedures for participants remaining in study  are 
simplified where possible. Second Course Phas e, Follow -up 
visits, and Survival Follow -up are removed. There are no 
required tumor imaging assessments during the treatment 
phase or at EOT; rather, all imaging is to be performed per 
local standard of care (note ,data will not be collected).

Epacadostat (INCB024360) with Platinum -based Chemotherap y Versus Pembrolizumab 
Plus Platinum -based Chemotherap y Plus Placebo as First- Line Treatment in Patients with 
Metastatic Non -Small Cell L ung Cancer
Short T itle: 
Phase 2 Study of Pembrolizumab/Epacadostat/Chemotherapy in Metastatic NSCL C
Objectives/Hypothes es and Endpoints:
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, epacadostat and matching placebo are removed from the
treatment groups. All participants remaining on study continue on pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy or pembrolizumab. The study will therefore stop collecting efficacy 
endpoints , .
In all randomized participants with treatment -naïve, stage IV non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCL C), intervention arms anal yzed separatel y versus the control arm:
Objective/Hypothesis Endpoint
Primary
To compare objective response rate (ORR) 
of the combinations of epacadostat + 
pembrolizumab + chemotherap y versus 
placebo + pembrolizumab + 
chemotherap y.ORR is defined as the proportion of 
participants who have a confirmed 
complete response (CR) or partial 
response (PR) per RECIST 1.1 based 
on BICR .
oHypothesis (H1): The combination of 
epacadostat + pembrolizumab + 
chemotherap y has superior ORR 
compared to placebo + pembrolizumab 
+ chemotherap y.
This study  will be considered to have met its success criteria if epacadostat + 
pembrolizumab + chemotherap y is superior to placebo + pembrolizumab + chemotherap y in 
ORR.
Secondary
To compare progression -free survival 
(PFS) of the combinations of epacadostat 
+ pembrolizumab +chemotherap y versus 
placebo + pembrolizumab +
chemotherap y.PFS is defined as the time from 
randomization to the first documented 
progressive disease (PD) per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECI ST 1.1) based on blinded

To evaluate duration of response (DOR) 
of the combinations of epacadostat + 
pembrolizumab + chemotherap y, and 
placebo + pembrolizumab + 
chemotherap y.DOR defined as the time from the 
earliest date of qualify ing response 
until earliest date of disease 
progression or death from any  cause, 
whichever comes first, per RECI ST1.1 
based on BI CR.
To evaluate the safet y and tolerability  of

ConfidentialNumber of Participant s:
The study  was initially  designed to recruit 1062 patients into 3 treatment arms. With 
Amendment 05, the epacadostat + pembrolizumab arm was dropped, and the sample 
size was reduced to a total of 148 participants randomized into the 2 remaining arms of 
the study , inclusive of participants who were enrolled into these 2 arms prior to 
Amendment 05. I t was estimated that approximately  60 additional participants 
would be 
required to be randomized into the remaining 2 treatment arms based on enrollment at 
the time Amendment 05 was released. Participants alread y randomized to the 
pembrolizumab
-epacadostat arm that wa s dropped will not be included in primary  
efficacy  and safet y analyses . 
Treatment Groups and Duration :
Treatment Groups Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every  3 weeks ( Q3W )
(original open -label arm)
Pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W + platinum -based 
chemotherap y IV Q3W
Platinum -basedchemotherap y is the Investigator’s choice of:
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2+ cisplatin 75 mg/m2for 4 cycles 
followed b y pemetrexed 500 mg/m2Q3W (non-squamous 
histology )
Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2+ carboplatin AUC 5mg
/mL/min
Q3W for 4 cycles followed by  pemetrexed 500 mg/m2Q3W 
(non-squamous histology)
Paclitaxel 175 -200 mg/m2+ carboplatin AUC 5 -6
mg/m L/min Q3W for 4 cy cles(squamous histology )
NOTE: The original study design randomized participants
into 3 treatment arms: epacadostat + pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy, epacadostat + pembrolizumab (open -label) , 
and pembrolizumab + chemotherapy + placebo .As of 
Amendment 05, the epacadostat + pembrolizumab (open -
label) arm was dropped ; participants already randomized 
i
ntothis arm were allowed to continue on their assigned 
study treatm entif they were deriving clinical benefit . As of 
Amendment 06, epacadostat and matching placebo are 
removed from all original treatment arms . Thus, 
participants 
remaining in the study receive 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy or pembrolizumab ,as 
per protoc ol, based on the arm to which they were 
originally randomized , unless they choose to discontinue 
from the study completely and be treated with standard of 
care.

ParticipationNOTE: As of Amendment 06, this section has been 
updated.
Each participant will partake in the study from the time the 
participant signs the informed consent f orm through the final 
contact.
After a screening phase of 30days, each participant will be 
assigned to receive study treatment until disease progression, 
unacceptable AEs, intercurrent illness that prevents further 
administration of treatment, Investigator ’s decision to 
withdraw the participant, noncompliance with study  
treatment or procedure requirements or administrative 
reasons requiring cessation of treatment, withdrawal of 
consent, or until the participant has received 
35administrations of pembrolizumab (approximately 
2years).
After the end of treatment, each participant wi ll be followed 
for the occurrence of AEs and spontaneousl y reported 
pregnancy as described under Section 9.3. As of 
Amendment 06, the last study  visit is the Safety  Follow -up 
Visit.

ConfidentialIntroduction 3.
Study Rationale 3.1
The global incidence of lung cancer was 1.8 million in 2012, resulting in an estimated 
1.6million deaths [World Health Organization 2012] . In the United States, the 2016 
estimated incidence of new diagnoses was 224,400 and estimated number of deaths was 
158,100 [National Cancer Institute 2016] . Non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represent s 
approximately  80% to 85% of all lung cancers. Of the patients with NSCLC, tumor histology  
is approximately  40% to 60% adenocarcinoma, 10% to 15% squamous, 5% neuroendocrine, 
and the rest, “not otherwise specified” [Sulpher, J. A., et al 2013] .
Approximately  70% of patients with NSCL C have advanced disease not amenable to surgical 
resection at the time of diagnosis . The 5 -year relative survival for patients with any lung 
cancer overall and metastatic lung cancer specifically has been reported to be 17.7% and 
4.3%, respectively  [National Cancer Institute 2016] .
The standard o f care (SOC) for metastatic NSCL C has changed in recent y ears with the 
development of immunother apy agents. In the Phase 3 study KEYNOTE -024, 
pembrolizumab (MK -3475), a programmed cell death protein 1 ( PD-1)inhibitor ,showed 
statistically  significant increases in overall survival ( OS)and progression -free survival ( PFS)
compared to SOC platinum -based chemotherap y for treatment -naïve participants with 
metastatic NSCL C whose tumor sexpressed high levels of the programmed cell death ligand 
1 (PD-L1) (tumor proportion score [ TPS] ≥50%) with no epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR )or anapl astic lymphoma kinase (ALK ) genomic tumor aberrations , leading to 
regulatory  approval for this indication in the US and other countries around the world.
Approximately  30% of patients with newly  diagnosed ,advanced NSCLC highl y express PD -
L1 to a TPS ≥50% [Reck, M., et al 2016] .
In the Phase 2 stud y KEYNOTE -021 Cohort G, pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and 
carboplatin showed statistically  significant increases in objective response rate (ORR) and 
PFS compared to pemetrexed and carboplatin alone in participants with non -squamous 
advanced NSCL C, regardless of PD -L1 status. These findings were fu rther confirmed in the 
Phase 3 randomized, double -blinded, active -controlled, multicenter KEYNOTE -189 study  of 
pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) v ersus pemetrexed 
and platinum in participants with treatment -naïve, metast atic, non -squamous NSCL C. 
KEYNOTE -189 showed that treatment with pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum 
(carboplatin or cisplatin) significantl y prolonged OS(HR 0.49; 95% CI :0.38 to 0.64; 
P<0.001 ) and PFS (0.52; 95% CI :0.43 to 0.64; P<0.001) compare d with SOC chemotherap y. 
These results established pembrolizumab plus chemotherap y as an efficacious option for 
first-line (1L) therap y in patients with non -squamous NSCL C[Gandhi, L ., et al 2018] .In 
addition ,the ongoing KEYNOTE -407 will further evaluate pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherap yin squamous NSCL C.Epacadostat (formerl y INCB024360) represents a 
novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 diox ygenase -1 (IDO1)

catabolizing enzy me IDO1 inhibits T -cell-mediated immune responses ,and IDO1 expression 
has been shown to be elevated in man y human cancers; thus, IDO1 inhibition may restore an

Confidentialproteins that could impact tryptophan catabolism .In vivo data demonstrate that epacadostat 
can inhibit I DO1 sy stemically  and, importantly , in tumors and tumor -draining l ymph nodes 
(TDLN) . Epacadostat was efficacious in mouse models of colon and pancreatic cancer, and 
its ability  to reduce tumor growth was dependent on a functional immune sy stem, consistent 
with its proposed mechanism of action. Moreover, epacadostat enhanced l ymphoc yte 
function in tumors and TDLN . The combination of epacadostat and either an anti –mouse 
cytotoxic T -lymphocy te-associated protein 4 (CTLA -4)or an anti -mouse PD -L1 antibody  
was also shown to act s ynergistically in significantly reducing tumor growth in a melanoma 
xenograft model . Finall y, epacadostat improved the tumor growth control of cy totoxic 
chemotherap y when used in combination. These data support the evaluation of epacadostat in 
patients with malignant diseases.
KEYNOTE -037 ( INCB 24360 -202), adose-escalation and expansion study  of 
pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat in participant s with stage IIIB, IV, or 
recurrent NSCLC, melanoma, transitional cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma , endometrial 
adenocarcinoma, or squamous head and neck carc inoma, is ongoing. Objective response rate
in 40evaluable participant s with previously -treated NSCL C was 35% (1 4/40)and disease 
control rate (DCR) was 60%, which includes 2participants with a CR . Details of the results 
of this study  thus far may be found in Section 3.2.3 and [Gangadhar, T. C., et al 2017] .
If the safet y profile of the combination of epacadostat + pembrolizumab + chemotherap y
remains acceptable and the combination is shown to improve outcomes compa red to 
pembrolizumab +chemotherap y, this combination will be further evaluated in the treatment
of patients with previously untreated metastatic NSCL C.
Background 3.2
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475) is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G4/kappa isot ype directed against PD-1, thus inhibiting its 
interaction with PD -L1 and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD -L2). Epacadostat (formerly  
INCB024360) represents a novel, potent, and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1 in both 
human tumor cells and human dendritic cells . For a thorough discussion of the pharmacology  
of pembrolizumab and epacadostat, refer to the pembrolizumab I nvestigator's Broc hure [IB 
Edition 15 2017] and the epacadostat Investigator's Brochure [IB Edition 9 2016] 
[Addendum 1 to IB Edition 9 2017] .
Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Bac kground 3.2.1
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic 
transformation has been known for decades [Disis, M. L . 2010] . The inability  of the immune 
system to control tumor growth does not appear to result from an inability  to recognize the 
tumor as foreign. Tumor cells have been shown to evade immune destruction despite 
display ing recognizable antigens on their surface and despite the presence of high avidit y T-
cells that are specific for these antigens [Boon, T. 1996] [ Ercolini, A. M., et al 2005] .
Histologic evaluation of many  human cancers shows extensive infiltration by  inflammatory  
and immune cells [Galon, J., et al 2006] , suggesting that the immune s ystem responds less 
effectivel y to malignancy. These observations have led to the h ypothesis that dominant

Confidentialmechanisms of immune tolerance or immune suppression are re sponsible for the immune 
system's inability  to effectively  respond in a way  that consistently  results in rejection.
The PD -1 receptor is an immunoglobulin superfamily  member shown to negativel y regulate 
antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its lig ands PD -L1 and/or PD -L2 [Greenwald, 
R. J., et al 2005] [Okazaki, T., et al 2001] . The PD -1 pathway  represents a major immune 
control switch, which can be exploited by  tumor cells to overcome active T- cellimmune 
surveillance. Expressed on the surface of activated T- cells under health y conditions, the 
function of the PD -1 receptor is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive 
immune/autoimmune responses. A variet y of cancers have been demonstrated to express 
abundant levels of PD -1 ligands, unlike healthy  organs. The observed correlation of clinical 
prognosis with PD -L1 expression in multiple cancers suggests that the PD- 1/PD -L1 pathway  
plays a critical role in tumor evasion and is thus an attractive target for therapeutic 
intervention.
Pembrolizumab is designed to directl y block the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands 
PD-L1 and PD -L2. This blockade enhances functional activity  of the target ly mphocy tes to 
facilitate tumor regression and ultimately  immune re jection of the tumor.
Recent interest has focused on the role of IDO1 as a mechanism of induction of tolerance to 
malignancy  [Godin -Ethier, J., et al 2011] . IDO1 is a heme -containing, monomeric 
oxidoreductase th at cataly zes the degradation of the essential amino acid try ptophan to N -
formy l
-kynurenine. Ky nurenine can be metabolized subsequentl y through a series of 
enzy matic steps to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. I DO1 is the first rate -limiting enzy me 
in one o f the breakdown pathway s of try ptophan. In another pathway , tryptophan 
hydroxylase catal ysis of try ptophan leads to the formation of serotonin and melatonin.
The expression and activity  profiles of IDO1 are distinct from those of tryptophan 
dioxy genase, an enzy me predominantly  expressed in liver that catal yzes the same enz ymatic 
reaction as IDO1 and maintains proper try ptophan balance in response to dietary  uptake. In 
contrast to try ptophan dioxy genase, IDO1 is expressed in a variety  of tissues, with 
partic ularly high levels found in areas of contact with potential sources of immune challenge 
(eg, gut, respiratory  tract, placenta, spleen), consistent with a role for regulating try ptophan 
metabolism in a local microenvironment [Mellor, A. L . 2004] . Within the immune sy stem, 
IDO1 activity  is specifically  induced in dendritic cells and macrophages at localized sites of 
inflammation [Munn, D. H. 2007] .
IDO1-driven oxidation of try ptophan results in a strong inhibitory  effect on the development 
of T- cell-mediated responses by  blocking T- cell activation and inducing T -cell apoptosis 
[Mellor, A. L ., et al 2003] . Both the reduction in local try ptophan levels and the production 
of try ptophan catabolites that are inhibitory  to cell proliferation contribute to the 
immunosuppressive effects [Frumento, G., et al 2002] . IDO1 a ctivity  also promotes the 
differentiation of naïve T cells to cells with a regulatory  phenot ype (T -
reg) [Fallarino, F., et 
al 2006] . Since increased T -reg activity  has been shown to promote tumor growth and T- reg 
depletion has been shown to allow an otherwise ineffectual antitumor immune response to 
occur [Zou, W. 2006]
, IDO1 expansion of T- regs may  provide an additional mechanism 
whereb y IDO1 could promote an immunosu ppressive environment.

ConfidentialThe biological relevance of IDO1 inhibition to immune tolerance was first demonstrated 
when it was shown that treating mice with a small molecule inhibitor of the IDO1 pathway , 
1-methy l - tryptophan, could break the tolerogenic state t hat protects allogeneic concepti from 
the maternal immune s ystem [Munn, D. H., et al 1998] . A critical role for IDO1 in 
immunomodulation has been confirmed in numerous animal models, including models of 
allograf t tolerance, inflammation, and cancer [Mellor, A. L. 2004] . While IDO1 inhibition 
can exacerbate disease in models of autoimmune disorders [Mellor, A. L . 2004] , IDO1 null 
mice show no evidence of susceptibility  to developing spontaneous autoimmunity  or 
alterations in immune system development [Mellor, A. L., et al 2003] , suggesting that IDO1 
inhibition, in a therapeutic sett ing, may  produce minimal side effects in participant s without 
pre-existing autoimmune conditions.
Within the context of cancer, there are several lines of evidence to suggest that IDO1 is a key 
regulator of the immunosuppressive mechanisms responsible for tumor escape from immune 
surveillance. Several groups have demonstrated that blockade of IDO1 activity  can directl y 
influence the ability  of tumor -bearing animals to reject tumors [Uyttenhove, C., et al 2003] 
[Muller, A. J., et al 2005] . In addition, studies with 1 -methy l-tryptophan, demonstrate that 
IDO1 inhibition dramatically  increases the efficacy  of various chemotherapeutic agents (eg, 
platinum compounds, taxane derivatives ,cyclophosphamide) wit hout increased toxicity  
[Muller, A. J., et al 2005]. Although the specific mechanisms responsible for this potentiation 
remain to be full y elucidated, the effects were not observed in T -cell-deficient animals, 
suggesting the disablement of immunosuppressive mechanisms that exist within the tumor 
microenvironment.
Based on studies examining serum levels of try ptophan and ky nurenine, IDO1 appears to be 
chronicall y activated in participants with cancer, and IDO1 act ivation correlates with more 
extensive disease [Huang, L ., et al 2010] [Weinlich, G., et al 2007] . IDO1 has subsequentl y 
been found to be overexpressed b y a wide variety of human tumor cell t ypes as well as b y the 
dendritic cells that localize to the TDL N [Uyttenhove, C., et al 2003] . Increased expression 
of IDO1 in tumor cells has been shown to be an independent prognostic variable for reduced 
OS in participant s with melanoma, ovarian, colorectal, and panc reatic cancers [Okamoto, A., 
et al 2005] [Brandacher, G., et al 2006] [I no, K., et al 2006] [Nakamura, T., et al 2007] 
[Witkiewicz, A., et a l 2008] . Together, these results suggest that the IDO1 pathway  is a key  
regulatory  element responsible for the induction and maintenance of tumor immune 
tolerance. Small molecule inhibitors of IDO1 may provide an innovative and tractable 
method to treat advanced malignancies in combination with chemotherapeutics and/or 
immunotherapy -based strategies.
As discussed above, there are a number of inhibitory  mechanisms that have been identified to 
be involved in tumor -mediated immune suppression. Agents that t arget these negative 
regulatory  pathway s and thereb y allow the expansion of effector T-cells present in the tumor 
may be beneficial in the clinic. Combined inhibition of both PD -L1 and IDO1 pathway s may  
therefore lead to greater enhancement of antitumor immunity
 and to increased efficacy .

ConfidentialCompleted Clinical Studies 3.2.2
Three completed clinical studies were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab 
monotherap y in the treatment of NSCL C: KEYNOT E-001, KEYNOTE -010, and 
KEYNOTE -024.
KEYNOTE -001:
An open -label Phase 1 study (KEYNOTE -001) was conducted to evaluate the safet y and 
clinical activity  of single agent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion of this study
evaluated three intravenous (IV) dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg administered 
every  2 weeks (Q2W), in participant s with advanced solid tumors. All three dose levels were 
well tolerated and no dose -limiting toxicities were observed. Based on pharmacok inetic (PK) 
data showing a half -life of 21 day s, the protocol was amen ded to change the dosing 
frequency  in the expansion cohort to every  3 weeks (Q3W). All cohorts have completed 
enrollment.
A total of 550 NSCL C participant s were treated in several dose expansion cohorts with at 
least one dose of pembrolizumab. The initial data from 495 NSCL C participant s were 
published and reported. The ORR was 19.4% (18.0% in the 394 previously treated 
participant s and 24.8% in the 101 previously  untreated participant s). The response rate (RR) 
was similar regardless of dose, schedule, and histologic anal ysis. Current or former smokers 
had an RR of 22.5%, as compared with 10.3% among participant s who had never smoked 
cigarettes.
Participant s were required to submit a newly  obtained tumor biopsy  prior to initiating therap y 
with pembrolizumab for evaluation of PD -L1 expression. After evaluation of several 
methods for pathological assessment, in a training set, membranous PD -L1 expression in at 
least 50% of tumor cells (TPS ≥50%) was selected as the cutoff point defining PD -L1 high. 
In a validat ion set of 313 participant s, the RR was 45.2% in the 73 participants with a TPS
≥50%, including 43.9% in previously  treated participant s and 50% in previously  untreated 
participant s, values that numericall y exceeded the RR in the training group [Garon, E. B., et 
al 2015] .
Pembrolizumab has been generall y well tolerated. The most common treatment -related 
adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (19.4%), pruritus (10.7%), and decreased appetite 
(10.5%). Adverse events of Grade 3 or higher were reported in 47 of 495 patients (9.5%). 
The only  treatment -related AEs of an inflammatory or immune -mediated nature that occurred 
in more than 2% of patients were infusion -related reactions (in 15 patients [3.0%]), 
hypothy roidism (in 34 patients [6.9%]), and pneumonitis (in 18 patients [3.6%]). One 
infusion reaction led to treatment discontinuation. All patients with hypothyroidism were 
successfull y treated with medical therap y [Garon, E. B., e t al 2015] .
KEYNOTE -010:
KEYNOTE -010 was a randomized, adaptively  designed Phase 2/3 study of pembrolizumab 
at two IV dose levels versus docetaxel in participant s with NSCL C with PD -L1 positive 
tumors who had experienced disease progression after platinum -containing sy stemic therap y. 
Participant s were randomized according to their TPS as follows: a TPS ≥50% was considered 
strongl y positive and a TPS =1% to 49% was considered weakl y positive. The study

Confidentialenrolled 1034 participant s to examine the efficacy of pembrolizumab compared to docetaxel 
in an enriched population.
Pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel in the strongl y positive TPS ≥50% stratum 
(n=422) with regard to OS, with a hazard ratio ( HR)of 0.54 ( p=0.00024) and 0.50 
(p=0.00002) for pembro lizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectively , compared 
to docetaxel. Pembrolizumab was superior to docetaxel in the overall positive TPS ≥1% 
population with regard to OS, with an HR of 0.71 ( p=0.00076) and 0.61 (p<0.00001) for 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q 3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectivel y. Pembrolizumab was 
superior to docetaxel in the strongl y positive TPS ≥50% stratum with regard to PFS, with an 
HR of 0.58 ( p=0.00009) and 0.59 ( p=0.00007) for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 
mg/kg Q3W, respectively, compar ed to docetaxel. Pembrolizumab also provided a 
numericall y superior benefit in PFS in the overall positive TPS ≥1% population, with an HR 
of 0.88 and 0.79 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W an
d 10 mg/kg Q3W, respectivel y, 
compared to docetaxel; however, the differences were not statisticall y significant at the 0.001 
level required per protocol.
The results of KEYNOTE- 010 indicate that in previously  treated participant s with NSCL C 
with PD -L1 TPS ≥1%, and disease progression following platinum -containing 
chemother apy, pembrolizumab provides a statistically  significant and clinically  meaningful 
OS benefit compared to standard docetaxel ch emotherap y. Furthermore, the PD -L1 selection 
employ ed in KEYNOTE -010 identified patients more likely  to benefit from pembrolizumab
and resulted in favorable HR in OS compared to docetaxel.
Overall, the results from KEYNOTE -001 and KEYNOTE
-010 demonstrated that 
pembrolizumab provided substantial, clinically meaningful benefits in OS, PFS, and ORR in

whose tumor cells expressed PD -L1. 
KEYNOTE -024:
KEYNOTE -024 was a multicenter, international, randomized, open -label, controlled study of 
IV pembrolizumab monotherapy versus the choice of multiple SOC platinum -based 
chemotherapies in participant s previously  untreated for their s tage IV NSCLC, whose tumors 
expressed PD
-L1 at TPS ≥50%, and in whom EGFR -or ALK -directed therapy  is not 
indic ated. During screening, 1653 participants provided evaluable tissue for PD -L1 
evaluation with 500 participants y ielding a TPS ≥50% (30.2%).
First-line treatment with pembrolizumab (n=154) significantl y prolonged PFS (HR 0.50; 
95% confidence interval ( CI): 0.37, 0.68; p<0.001) and OS (HR 0.60; 95% CI : 0.41, 0.89; 
p=0.005) compared with SOC chemotherap y(n=151) , inclusive of pemetrexed maintenance 
for participant s with non
-squamous tumors. In addition, pembrolizumab was associated with 
a higher ORR, including a higher complete response (CR) rate, as well as a longer DOR as 
compared to SOC.
Pembrolizumab was better tolerated than chemotherap y and AEs were easily managed. The 
observed safet y profile of the pembrolizumab arm was consistent with the safet y profile for 
pembrolizumab established to date. Based on the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, 
immune -related AEs (irAEs), including pneumonitis, occurred at a greater frequency  with

of PD -L1 (TPS ≥50%), in whom EGFR -or ALK -directed therap y is not indicated.
KEYNOTE -252/ECHO -301:
KEYNOTE -252/ECHO -301 was a Phase 3 stud y evaluating epacadostat in combination with 
pembrolizumab in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study  did not 
meet the primary  endp oint of improving progression -free survival in the overall population 
compared to pembrolizumab monotherap y[Merck & Co., Inc. 2018] .
Ongoing Clinical Studie s 3.2.3
Pembrolizumab is under evaluation in patients with NSCL C as monotherapy  and in 
combination with chemotherap y, immuno therap y, and targeted therapies . Epacadostat is 
undergoing studies in patients with NSCL C in combination with other immunotherapies 
including various PD -1/PD -L1 targeted therapies . A full lis t of ongoing studies can be found 
in the respective Investigator’s Brochures of pembrolizumab [IB Edition 15 2017] and 
epacadostat [IB Edition 9 2016] [Addendum 1 to IB Edition 9 2017] . Details of select
ongoing studies KEYNOTE -021, KEYNOTE -037, KEYNOTE -189, and KEYNOTE -407 are 
outlined below.
KEYNOTE -021
KEYNOTE -021 is a Phase 1/2, multi -cohort study of pembrolizumab in combination with 
platinum -based chemother apy, immunotherap y, or EGFR t yrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
[Langer, C. J., et al 2016] . Cohort G includes participants with treatment -naïve, non-
squamous, stage IIIB/IV NSCL C, irrespective of PD -L1 expression andwithout treatable 
EGFR mutations or ALK translocations ,randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab plus 
pemetrexed plus carboplatin ORpemetrexed plus carboplatin alone.
The cohort enrolled 123 participants with 60 randomly assigned to the pembrolizumab p lus 
chemotherap y group and 63 to the chemotherap y alone group. For the primary  endpoint of 
ORR , 33/60 participants (55%; 95% CI 42 to 68) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherap y 
group achieved an objective response compared with 18 /63 participants (29%; 95% CI 18to 
41)in the chemotherap y alone group (estimated treatment difference :26% [95% CI  9to 42];
p=0·0016).
Progression -free survival was significantly  longer with pembrolizumab plus chemotherap y 
compared with chemotherap y alone (HR 0 .53 [95% CI  0.31to 0.91]; p=0·010). Median PFS 
was 13. 0 months (95% CI 8 .3to not reached) for pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy  and 8. 9 
months ( 95% CI  4.
4to 10.3) for chemotherap y alone. At the time of data cutoff, no
difference in survival was noted between treatment grou ps (HR 0 .90 [95% CI  0.42to 1.91]), 
though the survival analysis may  be premature and participants progressing on the 
chemotherap y-only arm were permitted to crossover to pembrolizumab monotherap y on 
study as well as receive immunotherapy  subsequently .

ConfidentialTreatment -related AEs occurred in 55/ 59 (93%) participants in the as -treated pembrolizumab
plus chemotherap y group and 56/ 62 (90%) participants in the as -treated chemotherap y alone 
group, including 23 (39%) and 16 (26%) participants, respectivel y, who had eve nts of G rade 
3 or worse severit y. The rate of treatment discontinuation because of treatment
-related AEs 
was similar between groups, with 6/59 (10%) participants in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherap y group and 8/62 (13%) participants in the chemotherap y alone group.
The addition of pembrolizumab to carboplatin and pemetrexed significantly improved the 
proportion of patients who achieved an objective response compared with carboplati n and 
pemetrexed alone in participan ts with chemotherapy -naïve , advanced n on-squamous 
NSCL C. In addition, this combination signifi cantly  prolonged PFS in this population. These 
data suggest that the combination of pembrolizumab, carboplatin, and pemetrexed provides a 
significant and clinicall y relevant improvement in antitumor a ctivity  compared with 
chemotherap y alone for treatment- naïve, non- squamous, advance dNSCL C.These results 
subsequently  led to the FDA accelerated approval of the combination for the first -line 
treatment of patients with metastatic non- squamous NSCL C, conti ngent upon verification 
and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory  study .
In the Phase 1 Cohort A of KEYNOTE -021, 25 subjects with treatment- naïve, 
advanced/metastatic NSCL C, regardless of PD -L1 expression and without treatable EGFR or 
ALK aberr ations, were treated with 4 cy cles of carboplati n, paclitaxel, and pembrolizumab 
(randomized 1:1 to 2mg/kg or 10mg/kg) followed by  pembrolizumab Q3W . The primary  
endpoint of the cohort was to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose for pembrolizumab 
in combination with chemotherap y in subjects with unresectable or metastatic NSCL C.
No dose -limiting toxicities were observed, no treatment -related deaths occurred, and no 
treatment -
related discontinuations occurred. Grade 3/4 AE were observed in 56% of subjects 
and potential irAEs were observed in 16% of subjects.
After a median duration of follow-up of 13 months (range, 2- 21 months), the confirmed ORR 
was 52% (13/25; 95% CI: 31 to 72) per BI CR. Median PFS was 10.3 months (95% CI: 3.7 to 
not reached [ NR]) per BIC R and OS was NR (95% CI : 11.0 to NR). In the exploratory  
analysis of 9 subjects with squamous cell NSCL C, the ORR was 55.6 % (95% CI : 21.2 to 
86.3) with disease control rate of 100%; the median PFS and DOR had not been reached. 
Responses were seen in both PD-L1 positive and PD -L1 negative patients [Gadgeel, S., et al 
2016].

did not meet the pre -specified endpoint of improvement in objective response rate 
(ORR) for the combination of pembrolizumab plus epacadostat plus chemotherapy 
compared with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy plus placebo. As of Amendment 06, 
epacadostat and matching placebo have been removed from the study. T herefore, the

It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly  benefit from 
treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about 
the safet y and effectiveness of an investigational medicine.
Despite the substantial improvement in ORR and PFS observed with pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherap y as compared to chemotherap y-alone in KEYNOTE -021and KEYNOTE -189, 
there remains a need to investigate new treatments which offer the prospect of added benefit 
for this patient population. Details regarding specific benefits and risks of pembrolizumab 
treatment for participants in this clinical study may be found in the Investigator’s Brochure

Scientific Rationale for Study Design 5.4
Rationale for Endpoints 5.4.1
Efficacy Endpoints 5.4.1.1
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, data for efficacy endpoints , including disease assessments 
based on imaging, are no longer being collected . Imaging will be performed per local 
standard of care and will be assessed by the investigator/site radiologist; data will not 
be collected and transmission of images for central review is no longer required .
This study will use primary  endpoint ORR as outlined in Section 4.
ORR by  RECI ST 1.1 criteria as assessed b y BICR is considered preliminary evidence of 
efficacy  and is a primary  endpoint for this Phase 2 study .
OShas been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new 
antineoplastic therap y in randomized clinical studies.
PFS is an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a late stage study that demonstrates 
superiority  of a new antineoplastic therap y, especially if the magnitude of the effect is large 
and the therap y has an acceptable risk/benefit profile. The use of BICR and RECI ST 1.1 to 
assess PFS is ty pically considered acceptable b y regulatory authorities. Images wil l be read

Confidentialby a central imaging vendor blinded to treatment assignment to minimize bias in the response 
assessments. In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on 
the central assessment of progression, rather than a local s ite assessment. Real time 
determination of radiologic progression as determined by  central review will be 
communicated to the site .
The BICR consists of a group of highly qualified radiologists contracted b y the central 
imaging vendor who are otherwise not involved in the study . The methodology  of the BI CR 
is described in the imaging review charter.
RECIST 1.1 5.4.1.1.1
RECI ST 1.1 will be used by  the BICR when assessing images for efficacy  measures and by  
the local sit e when determining eligibility . Although traditio nal RECI ST 1.1 references a 
maximum of 5 target lesions in total and 2 per organ, this protocol has implemented a
modifi cation to RECI ST 1.1 to allow a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per 
organ. This will be termed as RECI ST 1.1 throughout the protocol. Furth er details are found 
in Section 9.2.1.5.
Modified RECIST for Immune -based Therapeutics (iRECIST) 5.4.1.1.2
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, the use of iRECIST is discontinued. This section is no 
longer applicable. Participants with radiographic disease progression as determined by 
RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment will discontinue from study treatment ; no 
confirmatory scans are required. However, if the participant is achieving a clinically 
meaningful benefit, an exception to continue with study trea tment may be considered 
following consultation with theMSD .
RECI ST 1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen following 
treatment with pembrolizumab. I mmunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may  
produce antitumor effects by  potentiating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses. 
The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course 
of responses see nwith cytotoxic agents, and participants treated with pembrolizumab may 
manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance 
of new lesions.
Thus, standard RECI ST 1.1 may  not provide a n accurate response assessment of 
immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Based on an analysis of participants with
melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE -001, 7% of evaluable participants experienced delay ed or 
early tumor pseudo -progression. Of note, participants who had PD by  RECIST 1.1 but not by  
the immune -related response criteria [Wolchok, J. D., et al 2009] had longer OS than 
participants with PD by  both criteria [Hodi, F. S., et al 2014] . Additionally , the data suggest 
that RECI ST 1.1 may  underestimate the benefit of pembrolizumab in approximately  15% of 
participants. These findings support the need to apply a modification to RECI ST 1.1 that 
takes into account the unique patterns of atypical response sin immunotherapy  and enable s
treatment bey ond initial radiographic progression , ifthe participant is clinically  stable .

In the Phase 1 Cohort A of KEYNOTE -021, 25 subjects with treatment -naïve,

aberrations, were treated with 4 cy cles of carboplatin, paclitaxel ,and pembrolizumab 
(randomized 1:1 to 2 mg/kg or 10mg/kg) followed by  pembrolizumab Q3W . After a median 
duration of follow -up of 13 months (range : 2to 21 months) ,the confirmed ORR was 52% 
(13/25; 95% CI : 31to 72) per BICR. Median PFS was 10.3 months (95% CI: 3.7 to NR) per 
BICR and OS was NR (95% CI :11.0 to NR). In the exploratory  anal ysis of 9 subjects with 
squamous cell NSCL C, the ORR was 55.6 % (95% CI : 21.2 to 86.3) with disease control rate 
of 100%; the median PFS and DOR ha dnot been reached. Responses were seen in both PD -

Justification for Dose 5.5
Rationale for Dose and Regimen of Pembrolizumab 5.5.1
The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this study is 200 mg Q3W. Based on the totality  of 
data generated in the Keytruda ®development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose 
of pembrolizumab for adults across all indication s and regardless of tumor ty pe. As outlined 
below, this dose is justified by:
Clinical data from 8randomized studies demonstrating flat dose -and exposure -
efficacy  relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg Q2W,
Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit -risk including OSat 200 
mg Q3W across multiple indications, and
Pharmacology  data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation 
(inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiolo gicall y-based PK anal ysis) 
at 200 mg Q3W .
Among the 8randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 participants were enrolled 
with melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment -naïve, previousl y 
treated, PD- L1 enriched and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherap y and in

Confidentialcombination with chemotherapy). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W v s10 mg/kg Q2W 
(KN001 B2, KN001 D, KN002, KN010 ,and KN021), and 3studies compared 10 mg/kg 
Q3W vs10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 B3, KN001 F2,and KN006). All of these studies 
demonstrated flat dose -and exposure -response relationships across the doses studied 
representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg 
fixed -dose) Q3W provided similar responses to th e highest doses studied. Subsequently , flat 
dose- /exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tumor t ypes including 
head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, 
confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriat e dose independent of the tumor ty pe. These 
findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts b y 
interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells.
Additionally , pharmacology  data clearl y show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK 
data in KN001 evaluating target -mediated drug disposition conclusively  demonstrated 
saturation of PD -1 in s ystemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Secondly , 
a phy siologicall y-based PK analy sis was conducted to predict tumor PD -1 saturation over a 
wide range of tumor penetration and PD -1 expression. This evaluation concluded that 
pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor.
Finally , population PK analy sis of pembrolizu mab, which characterized the influence of 
body  weight and other participant covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed -dosing 
provides similar cont rol of PK variability  as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap 
in the distribution of exposure s from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. 
Supported by  these PK characteristics and given that fixed -dose has advantages of reduced 
dosing complexity  and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose was 
selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols .
Rationale for Chemotherapy Dosing Regimens 5.5.2
The dosing regimens of chemotherap y represent the SOC per the approved product labels. 
Chemotherap y ma y be reduced, interrupted, or discontinued at the Investigator’s discretio n

Rationale for Dose and Regimen of Epacadostat in Combination with 5.5.3
Pembrolizumab
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, this section is no longer applicable.
The dose selected for epacadostat for the current stu dy was formed on the basis of having a 
well-tolerated safety profile as monotherap y and in combination with pembrolizumab, a 
robust ORR, durable DCRs, as well as providing optimal target inhibition of IDO1 based on 
nonclinical models. Doses of epacadostat of up to 700 mg BID as monotherapy  have been 
well tolerated.
Doses of epacadostat 25 mg PO BID to 300 mg BID in combination with pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab are currently being evaluated in several ongoing 
Phase 2 studies. Doses of pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg or a 200 mg flat dose have been studied 
in the ongoing Phase 1/2 study  of pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat.

Confidentialepacadostat 25 mg B ID to 100 mg BID in combination with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and 
200 mg flat dosing [Gangadhar, T. C., et al 2015] . Objective responses were observed in all 
tumor ty pes and the majority  are durable; this combinati on has been well tolerated with rates 
of irAEs that are similar to pembrolizumab monotherap y and low rates of treatment 
discontinuation due to irAEs [Gangadhar, T. C., et al 2017] [Hamid, O., et al 2017] .
 
 
 
 
Therefore, epacadostat 100mg BID was selected as the recommended dose in this study  
because this regimen had better t olerability  as demonstrated by  the Phase 1 safet y data ,
including fewer dose modifications (suspension and reductions) ,and resulted in consistent 
inhibition of I DO1. The overall experience of the epacadostat 100 mg BID dose in 
combination with pembrolizum ab in study  KEYNOTE -037 supports the selection of this 
dose in this study  of epacadostat to be combined with I V pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W .
Rationale for Dose and Regimen of Epacadostat in Combination with 5.5.4
Chemotherapy
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, this section is no longer applicable.
The c ombination of epacadostat 100 mg PO BID + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W + 
chemotherap y is expected to be tolerable based on the following considerations. The 
toxicities exhibited by  participants who received epacadostat in clini cal trials did not overlap 
with those related to chemotherap y, and no exacerbation of chemotherap y-induced toxicity  is 
expected with either pembrolizumab or epacadostat. As epacadostat is metabolized by 
UGT1A9 and is not known to inhibit any  drug metaboliz ing enzy mes [Boer, J., et al 2016] , 
nor is it anticipated that the chemotherap y to be used in this study  will interfere with 
epacadostat metabolism, it is unlikely  that there would be additional toxicity  related to co -
administration of these drugs.
Further rationale for the dose of epacadostat 100 mg BID in combination with 
pembrolizumab and chemotherap y can be derived from the safety profile of combinations 
evaluated in KEYNOTE -037 (INCB 24360- 202) and KEYNOTE -021. KEYNOTE -037 
demonstrated similar tolerability  for the combination of pembrolizumab + epacadostat 100 
mg BID as that of pembrolizumab monotherapy [Gangadhar, T. C., et al 2017] . KEYNOTE -
021 established the to lerability  of pembrolizumab + chemotherapy , where treatment -related 
AEs were as expected in both groups, without an y synergistic toxicities (see Section 3.2.2)
[Langer, C. J., et al 2016] [Gadgeel, S., et al 2016] .

Confidentialtumors was well tolerated with no unexpected toxicities [Soliman, H. H., et al 2014] .
Preliminary  safet y data from a Phase 2 study of indoximod in combination with docetaxel or 
paclitaxel showed AEs similar to those ty picall y seen with taxanes, with no unexpected AEs
[Tang, S., et al 2015] . Indoximod in combination with gemcitabine and nab -paclitaxel in 
participants with metastatic pancreatic cancer was also well tolerated in a Phase 1/2 study  
[Bahary , N., et al 2016] .
Based on the above data and the proposed pharmacovigilance plan that includes earl y safet y 
monitoring , it is reasonable to conclude that the dose of epacadostat 100 mg BID in 
combination with pembrolizumab and chemotherapy  would have a safety  profile similar to 
that of pembrolizumab + chemotherap yand can be evaluated in this study .

Participants should maintain a normal diet unless modifications are required to manage an 
AE such as diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.
 
Contraception 6.3.2
Pembrolizumab may  have adverse effects on a fetus in utero .
Developmental and reproductive toxicity  studies have not been performed with epacadostat. 
Epacadostat should not be used b y pregnant women.
Participant s should be informed that taking the study medication may  involve unknown risks 
to the fetus (unborn bab y) if pregnancy w ere to occur during the study . In order to participate 
in the study , participant s of childbearing potential must adhere to the contraception 
requirement from the day of study medication initiation (or 14 day s prior to the initiation of 
study medication for oral contraception) throughout the study period up to 120 days after the 
last dose of pembrolizumab and epacadostat/matching placebo or 180 day s after the last dose 
of chemotherap y. If there is any  question that a participant of childbearing potential will not 
reliably  comply  with the requirements for contraception, that participant should not be 
entered into the study . 
Definitions of WOCBP and standards for adequate contraception are outlined in Appendix 2.
Pregnancy 6.3.3
If a participant becomes pregnant while on treatment with pembrolizumab or epacadostat, the 
participant will be immediately discontinued from study  treatment . The site will contact the 
participant at least monthly  and document the participant’s status unti l the pregnancy  has 
been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy  will be reported to MSD
without delay  and within 24 hours if the outcome is an SAE (eg, death, abortion, congenital 
anomaly , or other disabling or life -threatening complicat ion to the mother or newborn). The 
Investigator will make every  effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy  and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to MSD . If a male participant 
impregnates his female partner, the study personne l at the site must be informed immediately 
and the pregnancy  must be reported to MSD and followed as described in Section 9. 3.6.
Use in Nursing Women 6.3.4
It is unknown whether pembrolizumab or epacadostat are excreted in human milk. Since 
many  drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in the nursing infant, participants who are breastfeeding are not eligible for 
enrollment.

ConfidentialDose Modifications for Immune -related AEs 7.2.1
Dose modification and toxicity  management for irAEs associated with pem brolizumab 
should be managed as follows.
Adverse events (both non -serious and serious) associated with pembrolizumab exposure may  
represent an immunologic etiology . These irAEs may  occur shortly  after the first dose or 
several months after the last dose of treatment and may  affect more than one body  system 
simultaneously . Therefore, earl y recognition and initiation of treatment is cr itical to reduce 
complications. Based on existing clinical study data, most irAEs were reversible and could 
be managed with in terruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids, and/or 
other supportive care. For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or 
exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscop y, endoscop y, or 
skin biopsy  may  be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, 
withhold or permanentl y discontinue pembrolizumab andadminister corticosteroids.
Table 3summarizes the irAE dose modification actions for pembrolizumab .
When chemotherap y is held or discontinued, treatment with pembrolizumab may continue at 
the investigator’s discretion. When pembrolizumab is held or discontinued due to toxicity , 
treatment with chemotherap y ma y continue at the investigator’s discretion.
Except in cases of emergency , it is recommended that the Investigator consult with the 
medical monitor (or other representative of MSD) before temporaril y interrupting therap y for 
reasons other than protocol -mandated medication hold.

NOTE: As of Amendment 06, this table has been replaced with the current guidelines for pembrolizumab.
General instructions:
1.Corticosteroid taper should be initiated upon AE improving to Grade 1 or less and continue to taper over at least 4 weeks.
2.For situations where pembrolizumab has been withheld, pembrolizumab can be resumed after AE has been reduced to Grade 1 or 0 and corticosteroid has 
been tapered. Pembrolizumab must be permanently discontinued if AE does not resolve within 12 w eeks o f last dose or corticosteroids cannot be reduced to 
≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. 
3.For severe and life -threatening irAEs, IV corticosteroid should be initiated first follow ed by  oral steroid. Other immunosuppressive treatment sh ould be 
initiated if irAEs cannot be controlled by corticosteroids.

Procedures for Participants Exhibiting Serotonin Syndrome 7.2.3
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, this section has been updated to reflect the removal of 
epacadostat from the study and updated information regarding the risks of SS with the 
use of epacadostat .
There is a rarechance that epacadostat could cause an increase in serotonin levels in the brain 
that might trigger serotonin sy ndrome ( SS)[Boy er, E. W. 2005] , when administered in 
combination w ith other serotonergic agents. Selective s erotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI s),
selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI s), and MAOIs are permitted in 
the study . Due to the results of a preclinical stud y specificall y evaluating the effect of 
epacadostat on the brain ECF concentrations of serotonin with linezolid [Zhang, Y., et al 
2016] , and the clinical experience with related medications (eg, SSRI s/SNRI s) that suggest 
that SS is low risk, the use of MAOIs is not prohibited in the current stud y.
Serotonin sy ndrome usually  manifests with autonomic changes, mental status chang es, and 
neurological f indings. These mild, moderate, and severe signs and sy mptoms of SS 
(summarized in Table 5) should be evaluated in the context of possible comorbid conditions 
as well.

Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease 9.2.1
NOTE: As of Amendment 06, central review of imaging (BICR) and iRECIST are no 
longer applicable. Disease assessments will be performed by the site 
investigator/radiology assessment per local sta ndard of care. This section has been 
updated accordingly.
Tumor imaging is strongly preferred to be acquired by CT. For the abdomen and pelvis, 
contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI ) may  be used when CT with iodinated 
contrast is contraindicate d or when local practice mandates it. MRI  is the strongl y preferred 
modality  for imaging the brain. The same imaging technique regarding modality , ideall y the 
same scanner ,and the use of contrast should be used in a participant throughout the study to 
optimize the reproducibility  of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve 
the accuracy  of the assessment of response or progression based on imaging.
Participant eligibility  will be dete rmined using local assessment (i nvestigator assessment)
based on RECI ST 1.1. 
Treatment should continue until PD has been determined by  Investigator -assessed disease 
progression perRECIST 1.1 ; no confirmatory  scans are required. However, if the participant 
is achieving a clinicall y meaningful benefit, an exce ption to continue with study  treatment 
may be considered following consultation with the MSD .
Initial Tumor Imaging 9.2.1.1
Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed within 30 days prior to the date of 
randomization. The site study  team must review screening images to confirm the participant 
has measurable disease per RECI ST 1.1. The screening images must be submitted to the 
central imaging vendor for retrospective review.
Tumor imaging performed as part of routine clinical management isacceptable for use as 
screening tumor imaging if it isof diagnostic quality and performed within 30 day s prior to 
the date of randomization and can be assessed b y the central imaging vendor.
Baseline brain imaging, while not required, should be p erform edper the loca l standard of 
care, especially  if the participant was previousl y treated for CNS metastases. If brain imaging 
is performed to document the stability  of existing metastases, MRI should be used if possible. 
If MRI is medicall y contraindicated, CT with contra st is an acceptable alternative .
Tumor Imaging During the Study 9.2.1.2
NOTE: As of Amendment 0 6, central review of imagin g (BICR) and iRECIST are no

Events 
The definitions of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE), as well as the 
method of recording, evaluating, and assessing caus ality of AE and SAE and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting AE, SAE and other reportable safet y event reports can be 
found in Appendix 3.
Progression of the cancer under study  is not considered an adverse event as described in 
Section 9.3.5 –Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualify ing as 
AEs or SAEs, and Appendix 3.
AE, SAEs, and other reportable safety  events will be reported by  the participant (or, when 
appropriate, b y a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's lega lly authorized representative). 
The investigator, who is a qualified ph ysician, and any  designees are responsible for 
detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or 
SAE as well as other reportable safety event s.Investigators remain responsible for following 
up AE, SAEs and other reportable safet y events for outcome according to Section 9.3.3.
Adverse events will not be collected for participants during the pre -screening period (for 
determination of archival tissue status) as long as that participant has not undergone an y 
protocol -specified procedure or intervention. If the participant requires a blood draw, fresh 
tumor biopsy  etc., the participant is first required to provide consent to the main study  and 
AEs will be captured according to guidelines for standard AE reporting.
Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 9.3.1
Safety Event Information 
All AEs, SAEs and other reportable safet y events that occur after the consent form is signed 
but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported b y the investigator if the 
participant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event causes the 
participant to be excluded from the study , or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, 
including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, or a procedu re. 
All AEs from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 30 days 
following cessation of study treatment must be reported by the investigator. 
All AEs meeting serious criteria, from the time of treatment allocation/randomization 
through 90 days following cessation of study treatment, or 30 day s following 
cessation of study treatment if the participant initiates new anticancer therapy, 
whichever is earlier must be reported b y the investigator. 
Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention o f an investigator at an y time outside 
of the time period specified above must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the 
event is considered to be drug -related.

Method of Detecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Events 9.3.2
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE and other reportable 
safet y events. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the 
preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence .
Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information 9.3.3
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE, SAE and other reportable safet y events 
including pregnancy  and exposure during breastfeeding, ECI, Cancer and Overdose will be 
followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is other wise explained, or the 
participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). In addition, the investigator will 
make every  attempt to follow all non -serious AEs that occur in random ized participants for 
outcome. Further information on follow -up pro cedures is given in Appendix 3.
Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE 9.3.4
Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by  the investigator to MSD of SAE is essential 
so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants 
and the safety  of a study  treatment under clinical investigation are met. 
The Sponsor and MSD have a legal responsibility  to notify  both the local regulatory  
authority  and other regulatory  agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under 
clinical investigati on. All Adverse Events will be reported to regulatory  authorities,

Statistical Analysis Plan 10.
NOTE: The final analysis of the study was conducted as described be low, with a data 
cutoff of 13 -DEC -2018. Data from the final analysis showed the study did not meet the 
pre-specified primary endpoint of improvement in ORR for the combination of 
pembrolizumab plus epacadostat plus chemotherapy compared with pem brolizumab 
plus chemotherapy plus matching placebo . As of Amendment 06, t he study will 
therefore stop collecting efficacy data, including central review of imaging . Thus, a fter 
study completion, only selected analyses as detailed in this section will be pe rformed ,
This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. If changes 
are made to primary  and/or key  secondary  hypotheses or the statistical methods related to 
those hy potheses after the study has begun, but prior to any  unblinding/final database lock, 
then the protocol will be amended (consistent with I CH Guideline E9).

Responsibility for Analyses/In -House Blinding 10.2
The statistical anal ysis of the data obtained from this study  will be the responsibility  of the 
MSD Clinical Biostatistics department.
MSD will generate the randomized allocation schedule for stud y treatment assignment for 
this protocol and the randomization will be implemented in IVRS /IWRS .
An external DMC will be convened to review accumulating safety data to provide an 
opportunity  to terminate the study  early if there are concerns regarding safety. Treatment -
level results including the previous randomized pembrolizumab + epac adostat arm at the 
interim analy ses will be provided by  the external unblinded statistician to the eDMC. The 
DMC responsibilities and review schedules will be outlined in the DMC charter. The 
recommendation of the DMC will be communicated to the Joint Executive Oversight 
Committee ( EOC )and, in the event of a recommendation to halt t he study early due to safet y 
concerns, to the appropriate regulatory  agencies. If the DMC recommends modifications to 
the design of the protocol or discontinuation of the study, the EOC and possibly  other limited 
numbers of additional Sponsor /MSD personnel may be unblinded to results at the treatment 
level in order to act on these recommendations.
Participant -level unblinding to support regulatory  filing , should one occur before the end of 
the study ,willbe restricted to a designate dSponsor/MSD team, who will have no other 
responsibilities associated with the study .The extent to which individuals are unblinded with 
respect to the results will be documented. Additional logistical details, revisions to the above 
plan,and data monitoring guidance will be p rovided in the DMC Charter.

Efficacy Endpoints 10.4.1
Primary
Objective Response Rate : The proportion of participants who have a confirmed CR or PR 
per RECI ST 1.1 based on BICR.
Secondary
Progression- free Survival :The time from randomiza tion to the first documented PD per 
RECI ST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to an y cause, whic hever occurs first. See

Duration of Response : The time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD per 
RECI ST 1.1 as assessed by  BICR or death due to any  cause, whichever occurs first, in 
participants who demonstrate CR or PR .
Safety Endpoints 10.4.2
Safety  and tolerability  will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including 
AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, laboratory  tests, and vital signs. Furthermore, specific events will be 
collected and designated as ECIs as described in Section 9.3.7 .
Analysis Populations 10.5
Efficacy Analysis Po pulations 10.5.1
The analyses of primary  efficacy  endpoints are based on the i ntention -to-treat (ITT) 
population . All participants randomized in treatment arm P+E+C and treatment arm P+C will 
be included in this population. Participants will be anal yzed in the tr eatment group to which 
they are randomized. Details on the approach to handling missing data are provided in 
Section 10.6.
Safety Analysis Populations 10.5.2
The all participants as treated ( APaT ) population will be used for the anal ysis of safet y data 
in this study . The APaT population consists of all randomized participant s who received at 
least one dose of stud y treatment. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group 
corresponding to th e study  treatment they  actually  received. For most participants, this will

change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required.
Statistical Methods 10.6
Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses 10.6.1
This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary efficacy 
objectives.  Efficacy  
results that will be deemed to be statistically  significant with Type I error strictly  control led 
at 5%. Nominal p -values will be computed for other efficacy  anal ysesbut should be 
interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity .
Objective Response Rate 10.6.1.1
The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method will be used for comparison of ORR between 
the treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% CI  from the stratified Miettinen and 
Nurminen method with strata weighting b y sample size will be provided. The stratification 
factors (Section 7.3.1) based on actual PD -L1 expressions and histology will be used as
stratification factors in the anal ysis.
Progression- free Survival 10.6.1.2
The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each 
treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed b y the stratified log -rank 
test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 7.3.1). A stratified Cox proportional 
hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the 
treatment difference (ie, the HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% CI  from 
the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment 
covariate will be reported. The stratification factors (Section 7.3.1) based on actual PD -L1 
expressions and histology will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified 
Cox model.
Since disease progression is assessed periodically, PD can occur an y time in the time interval 
between the last assessment where PD was not documented a nd the assessment when PD is 
documented. For the primary  anal ysis, for participants who have PD, the true date of disease 
progression will be approximated by  the date of the first assessment at which PD is 
objectively  documented per RECI ST 1.1 (based on BI CR), regardless of discontinuation of 
study  drug. Death is alway s considered as a confirmed PD event.
In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECI ST 1.1 based on BICR, two 
sensitivity  anal yses with a different set of censoring rules wil l be performed. For the first 
sensitivity  anal ysis, participants who miss more than one disease assessment (with or without

Overall Survival 10.6.1.3
The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The 
treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test (based on the 
stratification factor defined in Section 7.3.1). A stratified Cox propo rtional hazard model 
with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment 
difference (ie, the HR). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with a single 
treatment covariate will be reported. The stratificati on (Section 7.3.1) based on actual PD -L1 
expressions and histology will be applied to both the stratified log -rank test and the stratified 
Cox model. Participants without documented death at the time of anal ysis will be censored at 
the date of last known c ontact. Anal ysis using the Restricted Mean Survival Time method 
may be conducted for OS to account for the possible non -proportional hazards effect.

Appendix 1: Study Governance Considerations 12.1
Merck Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
Merck*
Code of Conduct for Clinical Trials
I.Introduction
A. Purpose
Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our 
products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in 
compliance with the high est ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant safety is the overriding concern 
in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or 
national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
B. Scope
Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the 
party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This 
Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code 
does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are not under the control of Merck.
II.Scientific Issues
A. Trial Conduct
1.Trial Design
Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy 
and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices o f Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may 
conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine 
participant preferences, etc.
The design (ie, participant population, duration, stati stical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose 
of the trial. Research participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 
2.Site Selection
Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to app ropriate participants, adequacy of 
facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial 
initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial.
3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity
Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical 
Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified versus source 
documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, 
misconduct or serious GCP -non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, 
the clinical site will be closed, t he responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and 
data disclosed accordingly. 
B. Publication and Authorship
To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or 
pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results 
may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of 
multiplicity.
Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH -Good Clinical Practice 
guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, 
performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to 
defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications.

MK-3475 -715- 06/ECHO -306-06 Final Protocol 04-Mar-2019
ConfidentialIII. Participant Protection
A.IRB/IEC review
All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site.
Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation, except that 
changes required urgently to protect participant safety and well -being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/IEC 
approval. For each site, the IRB/IEC and Merck will approve the participant informed consent form. 
B.Safety
The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant we lfare is of primary importance.
Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a 
minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Participants are never den ied access to 
appropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. 
All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Participants are enrolled only after providing informed consent 
for participation. Participants may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, 
or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them.
C.Confidentiality
Merck is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possibl e.Unless required by law, 
only the investigator, sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical 
records that might identify the research participant by name.
D.Genomic Research
Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by 
an Ethics Committee.
IV.Financial Considerations
A.Payments to Investigators
Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring 
institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to 
enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be
made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts.
Merck does not pay for participant referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on 
chart review to identify potentially eligible participants.
B.Clinical R esearch Funding 
Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring 
institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local IRB/IEC may wish to alter 
the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, 
publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding.
C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests
Funding of trav el by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be 
consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical 
Association (AMA). 
V. Investigator Com mitment
Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing 
the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards.
* In this document, "Merck" refers to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corporation, each of which is a 
subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Merck is known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada. As warranted by 
context, Merck also includes affiliates and subsidiaries of Merck & Co., Inc."

Definitions 
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal 
unless permanentl y sterile (see below) 
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP:
● Premenarchal
●Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
○Documen ted h ysterectomy
○Documented bilateral salpingectomy
○Documented bilateral oophorectom y
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.
●Postmenopausa l female
○A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. 
▪A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therap y (HRT). However, in the absence 
of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with two FSH measurements in the 
postmenopausal range is required. 
○Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one 
of the non -hormonal highly  effective contraception methods if they wish to continue 
their HRT during the st udy. Otherwise, they  must discontinue HRT to allow 
confirmation of postmenopausal status before study  enrollment.
Contraception Requirements
Male Participants
Male participants with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if 
they agree to one of the following during the protocol defined time frame in Section 6.1: 
●Be abstinent from penile -vaginal intercourse as their usual and pre ferred lifesty le 
(abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent.
●Use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive method with a failure rate of <1% 
per year as described in Table 14when having penile -vaginal intercourse with a woman of 
childbearing potent ial who is not currently  pregnant.

●Progestogen -only contraceptive implantb, c 
●Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)b
●Intrauterine device (IUD)
●Bilateral tubal occlusion
●Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is the 
sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an 
additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
●Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatment. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the 
preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant.
Notes: 
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participants of clinical studies. 
a) Typical use failure rates are higher than perfect -use failure rates (ie, when used consistently and 
correctly). 
b) If hormonal contraception efficacy is potentially decreased due to interaction with study 
treatment, condoms must be used in addition to the hormonal contraception during the treatment 
period and for at least 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizuma b and epacadostat/matching 
placebo and up to 180 days after last dose of chemotherapeutic agents .
c)If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, 
acceptable hormonal contraceptives are limited to those which inhibit ovulation.

Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting
Definition of AE
AE Definition
●An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally  associated with the use of study  treatment, whether or not considered 
related to the stud y treatment.
●NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally  
associated with the use of a study treatment.
●NOTE: for purposes of AE definition, study  treatment includes an y pharmaceutical 
product, biological product, vaccine, device, diagnostic agent or protocol specified 
procedure whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator product) 
or marketed, manufactured by , licensed by , provided by  or distributed by  the Sponsor
or MSD for human use in this study .
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
●Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry, or urinaly sis) or 
other safet y assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered clinicall y significant in 
the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator.
●Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency  and/or intensity  of the condition.
●New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment admini stration even 
though it may  have been present before the start of the study .
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.
●Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study  
treatment or a concomitant medication. 
●For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated 
adverse event, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test 
result. An overdose without any  associated clinical sy mptoms or abnormal laboratory  
results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without 
adverse effect.”
●Any new cancer (that is not a condition of the study ). 
Note: Progression of the cancer under study  is not a reportable event. Re fer to 
Section 9.3.5 for additional details.

ConfidentialEvents NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
●Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.
●Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital).
●Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present 
or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
●Surgery  planned prior to informed consen t to treat a pre -existing condition that has 
not worsened.
●Refer to Section 9.3.5 for protocol specific exceptions
Definition of SAE
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met 
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:
a.Results in death
b.Is life -threatening
●The term 'life- threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.
c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
●Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardles s of length of stay, even if the 
hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for 
an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious 
adverse event. A pre -existing c ondition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of 
a Merck product and is documented in the patient’s medical history.
d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity
●The term disability means a substantial disruption o f a person’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions.
●This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance 
such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(eg, sprai ned ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not 
constitute a substantial disruption.
e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Confidentialf.Other impor tant medical events:
●Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is 
appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above 
definition. These events should usually be considered serious.
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that 
do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
Addition al Events reported in the Sa me M anner as SAE
Additional Events which require reporting in the same manner as SAE
●In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to MSD in the same timeframe 
as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered 
serious by  MSD for collection purposes.
●Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study);
●Is associated with an overdose

Recording AE and SAE
AE and SAE Recording
●When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the 
event.
●The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the Adverse Event case 
report forms/worksheets at each examination.
●It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to MSD in lieu of compl etion of the AE CRF page.
●There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by 
MSD . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, 
will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to MSD .
●The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, 
and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual 
signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.
Assessment of Intensity
●An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as 
described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.
●The investigator will make an assessment of intensity  for each AE and SAE (and

Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. An y adverse event which changes CTCAE 
grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on 
the adverse event case report forms/worksheets.
●Grade 1: Mild; as ymptomatic or mid sy mptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only ; intervention not indicated.
●Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, loca l or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-

self-care ADL.
●Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.
●Grade 5: Death related to AE.
Assessment of Causality
●Did the study  treatment cause the adverse event?
●The determination of the likelihood that the study  treatment caused the adverse 
event will be provided b y an investigator who is a qualified physician.  The 
investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that 
supports the causalit y noted on the AE form, ensures that a medicall y qualified 
assessment of causality  was done.  This initialed document must be retained for 
the required regulatory  time frame.  The criteria below are intended as reference 
guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship 
between the test product and the adverse event based upon the available 
information
●The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between 
the study treatment and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components 
and their respective eleme nts (in number and/or intensity ), the more likely  the 
study  treatment caused the adverse event:
●Exposure:   Is there evidence that the participant was actuall y exposed to the 
study  treatment such as:  reliable history , acceptable compliance assessment 
(pill count, diary , etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of 
drug/metabolite in bodil y specimen?
●Time Course:   Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study  treatment ? Is the time of onset of the AE 
comp
atible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational 
medicinal product)?
●Likely Cause:   Is the AE not reasonabl y explained by  another etiology  such 
as underl ying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental 
facto rs

●If yes, did the AE resolve or improve?
●If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. 
●If no, this is a negative dechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the AE resulted in death or 
permanent disability ; (2) the AE resolved/improved despite continuation of 
the study  treatment ; (3) the trial is a single- dose drug trial); or (4) study  
treatment (s) is/are onl y used one time.)
●Rechallenge:   Was the participant re -exposed to the study  treatment in this 
trial?
●If yes, did the AE recur or worsen?
●If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. 
●If no, this is a negative rechallenge.
(Note:  This criterion is not applicable if:  (1) the initial AE resulted in death 
or permanent disability , or (2) the trial is a single -dose drug trial); or (3) study  
treatment (s) is/are used only  one time.)

●Consistency with Study treatment Profile: Is the clinical/pathologic al 
presentation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the 
study  treatment or drug class pharmacology  or toxicology ?
●The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms /worksheets 
by an investigator who is a qualified ph ysician according to his/her best clinical 
judgment, including consideration of the above elements.
●Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be 
indicative of a study  treatment relationship).
●Yes, there is a reasonable possibility  of study  treatment relationship:
There is evidence of exposure to the study  treatment
.  The temporal sequence of 
the AE onset relative to the administration of the study  treatment is reasonable.  
The AE is more likel y expl ained by  the study  treatment than by  another cause. 
●No, there is not a reasonable possibility  of study  treatment relationship:
Participant did not receive the study  treatment OR temporal sequence of the AE 
onset relative to administration of the study  treatment is not reasonable OR the 
AE is more likely  explained by  another cause than the study  treatment .  (Also

●For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that h e/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality .
●There may  be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to MSD . However, it is very  important 
that the i nvestigator always make an assessment of causalit y for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to MSD .
●The investigator may  change his/her opinion of causality  in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow- up report with the updated causality  assessment.
●The causality  assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory  
reporting requirements
●For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination 
regimen, the investigator may  attribu te each adverse event causality  to the 
combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination.  I n general, causality  
attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen ( ie,to all agents in the 
regimen). However, causality  attribution may  be a ssigned to a single agent if in the 
investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data to support full attribution of the adverse 
event to the single agent.
Follow -up of AE and SAE
●The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by MSD to elucidate 
the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may inclu de additional 
laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other 
health care professionals.
●New or updated information will be recorded in the CRF.
●The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to MSD within 24 hours of receipt of the 
information.

AE, SAE, and Other Reportable Safety Event Reporting to MSD via Electronic 
Data Collection Tool
●The primary mechanism for reporting to MSD will be the electronic data collection (EDC) 
tool.
●Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry  guidelines (or 
equivalent).
●If the electronic s ystem is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will 
use the paper AE Reporting form.
●Reference section 9.3.1 –Time Period and Frequency  for Collecting AE and 
SAE and Other Reportable Safet y Event Information for reporting time 
requirements 
●The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it beco mes available.
●After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken 
off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.
●If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a 
previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then 
the site can report this information on a paper SAE form or by telephone (see next section).
●Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent).
SAE Reporting to MSD via Paper CRF
●If the electronic data collection tool is not operational, facsimile transmission or secure e -mail 
of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to MSD .
●In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notifica tion by telephone is 
acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier 
service.
●Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete 
and sign the SAE CRF pages within the des ignated reporting time frames.
●Contacts and instructions for SAE reporting and paper reporting procedures can be found in

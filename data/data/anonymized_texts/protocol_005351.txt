Number the inclusion and exclusion  criteria.  
 
Refine the Chinese translation of “……and allow 
central over read turn over before randomization” as 
inclusion criteria to clarify the central reading result for 
endoscopy need to be ready before  randomization.  
 
Clarify subjects who had inadequate response,  loss of 
response or intolerance to conventional treatment 
(immune -suppressants or corticoserioids) could be 
included, whether the subjects previoulsy exposed to 
biological therapy or  not. 
 
Clarify the definition of treatment naïve subjects in 
exclusion criteria. Correct the typos to claify the 
exclusion criteria for biological therapy use, “subjects 
receiving interferon therapy within 12 weeks prior to 
baseline and anti -TNFα therapy/other bi ological 
therapies within 12 weeks prior to baseline” will be 
excluded, instead of 8 weeks, in order to keep 
consistency with Section 5.2 Inclusion Criteria.  Clarify 
subjects with hematopoietic disorders at screening 
should be  excluded.  
 
Correct the typos in Table 1 in Section 5.12 Time and 
Event Table, and the footnotes to ensure the procedures 
are consistent with subject selection criteria. Clarify 
chext X -ray to be performed if no chest X -ray or CT 
scan available within 3 months of Visit 1 instead of 6 
months in footnote 2. Typo correction to clarify the 
follow up visit is not a phone -call contact and clarify 
any SAEs will be recorded from the time of consent in 
footnote 7. Allow T -Spot as an alternative test for TB 
infection screening. Clarify only serum  β-Human 
Chorionic Gonadotrophin (β -HCG) is requested for 
pregnancy testing at screening visit and urine test is to 
be done from baseline. Clarify concurrent medication 
assessment should be done in Follow up/EW visit, in 
order to keep consistent with Secti on 6.6 Concomitant 
Medications. Clarify the early withdrawal visit  should

withdrawal rather than after 2 weeks of last 
dose/decision of withdrawal in footnote 11. FSH test is 
listed in the table to confirm postmenopausal status at 
screening.  
 
Provide oral steroids tapering guida nce in Section  6.6.1 
Permitted Concomitant Medications and refine the 
Chinese translation of oral steroids  permission  
 
Remove the time period of “within baseline”, to clarify 
the prohibition is throughout the duration of the study to 
avoid confusion in Sec tion 6.6.2 Prohibited 
Medications. And add live vaccines immunization as 
prohibited  mdications.  
 
Clarify that the images/video clips of endoscopy will be 
sent to central lab for central reading in Section 7.2.5 
Mayo Score  Assessment.  
 
Refine the Chinese translation of the intervals of 3 
ECGs in Section 7.3.2, to clarify “Triplicate ECG 
measurements ar e collected at rate of 3 ECGs with 5 
minutes between  each.”.  
 
Allow T -Spot test as an alternative test for TB infection 
screenin g according to local availability in Section 7.3.4 
QuantiFERON test/or T -Spot test. And provide the 
guidance on initial QFT -G/or T -Spot is  indeterminate.

1. Protocol  Summary  
1.1 Rationale  
 
Ulcerat ive Colitis (UC) is a debilitating disease resulting in high morbidity and severely 
affect patients’ quality of life. Patients with UC will experience periods of remission and flare 
up. It is a disease affecting the colon, characterized by altered bowel ha bit, bloody diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, weight loss and anaemia. The prevalence of UC is about 200/100,000 in the 
west compared to 50 -60/100,000 in China or Japan. Its incidence has been higher in the West 
compared to the East. However, over the last decade,  the prevalence has increased in the  East.  
(1) The cause of UC remains unknown; it is thought to be closely linked to autoimmunity to 
large bowel mucosal. ( 2) UC can develop at any age, but peak incidence is between the ages of 
20 and 30 years. It mainly affects the rectum, and a variable extent of the colon proximal to th e 
rectum. Inflammation of the rectum is referred to as proctitis, and inflammation of the rectum 
and sigmoid as proctosigmoiditis. Symptoms of active disease or relapse include bloody 
diarrhoea, an urgent need to defaecate and abdominal  pain.  
 
Currently the only way to “cure” the disease is by total colectomy which is not without its 
risk and complication. The treatment goal in UC is to induce response in those in active stage 
and to continue maintaining remission, ultimately ensuring patients h ave minimal symptoms and 
good quality of life. Over many decades, these were achieved by applying oral and intravenous 
immune -suppressants. Conventional immune -suppressants treatments include oral 
glucocorticoids, mesalamine, and methotrexate. The introduc tion of biological treatment nearly 
two decades ago such as, anti -TNFα, a IgG monoclonal antibody has changed the treatment 
paradigm for moderate to severe UC over the last decide and has now become a gold  standard.  
However, its use is still limited by its  cost in some  regions.  
 
The understanding of cytokines and intracellular messenger pathway in UC has led to the 
discovery of Janus Kinase (JAK) enzymes, and their role in the activation of Signal Transducers 
and Activators of Transcription (STATs) via auto  phosphorylation ( 3). The JAK -STATs  pathway 
regulates the signaling of various interferon and interleukin which are implicated in the 
pathogenesis of UC. By block ing this pathway, it is thought that this immune -regulated 
inflammation could be halted, hence controlling the disease  (4). 
 
There are a number of Janus kinase (J AK) inhibitors currently under investigation for the 
treatments of immune -induced diseases, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Psoriatic Arthritis, 
Psoriasis, Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Ankylosing Spondylitis. These JAK  inhibitors 
can be give n orally, which could be an advantage compared to the intravenously given biological 
treatments. There is also an advantage of not having the risk of developing loss of response due 
to immunogenicity.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 14  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
Tofacitinib, a ‘ pan-JAK inhibitor’, blocking JAK3 and JAK1 and to a lesser extent JAK2 
has been approved in the US for the treatment of RA. It has recently been approved for the 
treatment of Ulcerative Colitis in the US. Other JAK inhibitors with varying JAK selectivity 
profiles have already shown to be efficacious in RA, and some are under investigation for 
Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s Disease indication. While inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 
contributed to the efficacy of RA treatment, inhibition of JAK2 may contribute to the safety 
concerns of anemia, and thrombocytopenia, by interfering with signaling through  erythropoietin, 
thrombopoietin and colony -stimulating factors such as granulocytemacrophage colony - 
stimulating factor  (5). 
 
SHR0302 is a highly selective JAK1 inhibitor. An in vitro study has demonstrated that its 
selectivity to JAK1 compared to JAK2 is about 16 times more than tofacitinib, and baricitinib, 
while 10 times more than filgotinib. In an animal model study, SHR0302 significantly attenuated 
gross bleeding and stool consiste ncy while also relieved body weight loss in DSS -induced Colitis 
mice. Meanwhile the study has also demonstrated SHR0302’s ability in reducing colon 
inflammation score by reducing crypt score and inflammation score in these mice to the extent 
comparable to tofacitinib, an active comparator. These in vitro and animal studies have 
demonstrated the potential efficacy of SHR0302 in addressing colon inflammation, hence the 
potential for the treatment of IBD. The high selectivity of SHR0302 to JAK1 also makes it a  
favourable candidate from a benefit risk safety perspective  (6). 
 
1.2Objectives  
 
The primary objective is to evalua te the efficacy of SHR0302 at 4mg once daily (QD), 8mg 
QD, and 4mg twice daily (BD) given orally compared to placebo in inducing clinical response  in 
adult subjects with moderate to severe active Ulcerative Colitis at  8-week.  
 
 
1.3 Study  Design  
 
This is an 8+8 weeks, randomized, double -blind, multi -center, placebo controlled, parallel 
group study to include adult patients with moderate to severe active Ulcerative Colitis. The study 
consists of an  8-week blinded treatment phase, followed by 8 -week of blinded active arms 
extension phase. The primary endpoint is assessed at the end of treatment phase at week  8. 
 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either one of the 3 doses of active drugs or plac ebo 
in 1:1:1:1 ratio for 4mg QD, 4mg BD, 8mg QD and placebo group respectively for treatment 
phase. The total number of subjects to be randomized is 152. There will be a total of 9 outpatient 
clinic visits. Subjects randomized into placebo in treatment pha se will also have a pre -assigned 
randomized treatment sequence for extension phase, which are 3 active groups (placebo -> 4mg 
QD, placebo -> 4mg BD, and placebo -> 8mg QD) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects randomized to the 
active arms for treatment phase will re main in the same dose group in the extension  phase.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 15  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
At Visit 1 (screening), subject will be screened and if the subject meets the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject can be consented and enrolled into the study with a 
subject id entifier  number.  
 
At Visit 2 (Day 0), subject will be randomized into the study if there is no further change  to 
subject’s  criteria.  
 
After randomization, the subject will be followed -up at week 1, week 4, and week 8, 
corresponding to Visit 3, Visit 4, and  Visit 5 at treatment phase respectively. At Visit 5 (week 8) 
the primary endpoint assessment will be conducted. Following this treatment phase, subjects 
have the option to enroll into a further 8 weeks of active arms extension  phase.  
 
All subjects that have completed the initial 8 weeks (non -responders or responders) have  the 
option to enter a blinded active arm 8 -week extension phase according to the group they were 
randomized to for extension phase. All subjects have the option not en rolling into the extension 
phase after first 8 weeks of treatment. All subjects in the extension phase are followed -up for 
further 2 weeks until week 18 (last visit). Subjects who have completed the first 8 -week of 
treatment phase, but decided not entering  into extension phase are required to attend the 2 -week 
follow -up visit. Early withdrawn subjects during the first treatment phase cannot enter the 
extension  phase.  
 
The total duration of the study participation, including extension and follow -up, will be 
approximately 18  weeks.  
 
1.4 Study  Endpoints  
 
1.4.1 Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
 
The percentage of subjects that achieve c linical response at week 8, defined as decrease 
from baseline in 9 -point modified Mayo score of at least 2 points and at least 30%, with an 
accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute  subscore 
for rectal bleedi ng of 0 or  1. 
 
(Mayo Score is a scoring system designed to measure UC disease activity. It consists of 4 
subscore, stool frequency, rectal bleeding, endoscopy score - findings of centrally read 
colonoscopy, and physician global assessment (PGA). Each grade d from 0 to 3 with higher 
scores indicating more severe disease. These scores are summed up to give a total score from 0 
to 12, where higher score indicate more severe  disease.  
 
9-point modified Mayo score is the Mayo score excluding physician global  assessment 
(PGA)subscore, hence the maximum is 9 points and minimum 0  point  
 
Partial Mayo score is the Mayo score excluding endoscopy subscore, hence the maximum  is 
9 points and minimum 0  point)

2. Introduction  
2.1 Background  
 
Ulcerative colitis is an autoimmune disease resulting in the chronic inflammation of colon 
mucosal characterized by relapsing –remitting pattern. UC is a lifelong disease that is associated 
with significant morbidity. It can also affect patient’s social and p sychological wellbeing, if 
poorly managed. Current medical approaches focus on treating active disease to address 
symptoms, to improve quality of life, and thereafter to maintain remission. The treatment  chosen 
for active disease is likely to depend on cli nical severity, extent of disease and the patient’s 
preference, and may include the use of aminosalicylates, corticosteroids or biological  drugs.  
These drugs can be oral or topical (per rectum), and corticosteroids may be  administered  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 17  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
intravenously in people with acute severe disease.  Currently the only way to “cure” the disease 
is by total colectomy – the removal of the entir e colon. This is a major surgery which carries risk 
and complications. Surgery is often reserved for those not responding to drug  treatment.  
 
The treatment goal in UC is to induce and maintain remission. Conventional treatments 
include oral glucocorticoids, mesalamine, and methotrexate. The introduction of biological 
treatment such as, anti -TNFα, a IgG monoclonal antibody has changed the treatme nt paradigm 
for moderate to severe UC over the last decade and has now become a gold standard.  However, 
its use is still limited by its cost in some  area.  
 
The understanding of cytokines and intracellular messenger pathway in the pathophysiology 
of Ulcerat ive Colitis has led to the discovery of Janus Kinase (JAK) enzymes, and their role in 
the activation of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) via auto 
phosphorylation. The JAK -STATs pathway regulates the signaling of various interferon  and 
interleukin which are implicated in the pathogenesis of UC. By blocking this pathway, it is 
thought that this immune -regulated inflammation could be halted, hence controlling the disease 
(3,4). 
 
There are a number of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors currently under investigation for the 
treatments of immune -induced dise ases, such as Rheumatoid Arthritis, Psoriatic Arthritis, 
Psoriasis, Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn’s Disease, and Ankylosing Spondylitis. These JAK  inhibitors 
can be given orally, which could be an advantage compared to the intravenously given biological 
treatm ents. Small molecule, unlike biological treatment, has no risk of developing loss of 
response due to  immunogenicity.  
 
2.2 Rationale  
 
Chronic inflammation in Ulcerative Colitis is thought to be caused by the dysregulation of 
the human body immune system. Dysregulation of the immune system decreases immune 
tolerance of intestinal commensal flora, which induces an abnormal immune response in the 
form of the overproduction of pro -inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules, ultimately 
resulting in excessive activation of T cells and a reduction in T cell  apoptosis.  
 
JAK pathway has been well established with evidence showing that if the JA K is inhibited 
the down steam cytokine mediated inflammation could be halted. JAK1 inhibitor such as 
tofacitinib has been demonstrated to be effective in the treatment of RA and Ulcerative Colitis. It 
was recently approved by the US FDA for the induction a nd maintenance treatment of moderate 
to severe acute ulcerative colitis. Other JAK inhibitors, such as upadacitinib, baracitinib and 
filgotinib have been investigated for the treatment of UC and  CD. 
 
SHR0302 is a highly selective JAK1 inhibitor. An in vitro study has demonstrated that its 
selectivity to JAK1 compared to JAK2 is about 16 times more than tofacitinib, and baricitinib, 
while 10 times more than filgotinib. In an animal model study, SHR0302 significantly attenuated 
gross bleeding and stool consistency while also relieved body weight loss in DSS -induced Colitis 
mice ( 6). Meanwhile the study has also d emonstrated SHR0302’s ability in reducing colon 
inflammation score by reducing crypt score and inflammation score in these mice to the  extent  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 18  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
comparable to tofacitinib, an active comparator. These in vitro and animal studies have show n 
the efficacy of SHR0302 in addressing colon inflammation, hence the potential for the  treatment 
of IBD. Its high selectivity to JAK1 also makes it a favourable candidate from a safety 
perspective.  
2.3 Dose Selection  Rationale  
 
In this phase II study, enrolled subjects will be randomized to receive 3 different daily 
active doses of SHR0302, 4mg, 8mg once daily, 4mg twice daily or placebo for the treatment 
phase. The choice of the doses is based on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety data derived  from 
three completed phase I, and one ongoing phase II studies in RA  patients.  
 
Phase I single ascending dose (SAD) study investigated the oral dose range from 1mg to 
100mg in healthy volunteers. 64 subjects were enrolled and completed the study with no early 
withdrawal. Within the investigated dose range, SHR0302 was well tolerated. All 64 subjects 
were included for safety analysis, where 16 subjects (25%) reported Adverse Events (AEs), of 
which majority of cases were Grade I to II AEs with neutrophils reduction and lymphocytes 
increase, except for a case of grade III neutrophils reduction in the 100mg group. All the AEs 
resolved and all patients recovered. There was no serious adverse events (SAEs)  reported.  
 
Phase I Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) study investigated 2mg, 5mg and 10mg given 
orally once daily for 7 days in subjects with Rheumatoid Arthritis. The study revealed SHR0302 
is well tolerated among these patients. SHR0302 and its metabolite, SHR161279, plasma 
concentration reached  stable state after 4 days dosing. After repeat dosing, SHR0302 C max and 
AUC ss showed a linear dose proportionality. Repeat dose after 7 days does not cause 
accumulation. There is no significant difference in PK characteristic between healthy volunteer 
and RA patients. From the pharmacodynamics (PD) perspective, SHR0302 has demonstrated 
various degree of improvement in PD parameters e.g. DAS28 -3, CRP, and pSTAT3 between 
active drug and placebo. The dose dose -response effect between 5mg and 10mg groups was n ot 
well demonstrated, however there is numerical difference between the 5mg/10mg and 2mg 
groups. Out of the total 36 RA patients randomized into this study, 20 subjects (55.6%) reported 
AEs. All were regarded as Grade I AE with full  recovery.  
 
Overall the Phase I SAD, and MAD studies demonstrated SHR0302 is readily absorbed 
after oral administration. Median T max is 1.0hr, and the half -life (T 1/2) increases slightly with 
increasing dose, it is between 8.33h – 9.87h. Its main metabolite SHR161279 (M3 -4) has a  Tmax 
between 2.0h – 3.0h, and half -life of 8.00h – 9.50h. The metabolite SHR161279 (M3 -4) total 
exposure is 9.09% - 11.54% of its parent compound. Within the 1 -100mg dose range,  SHR0302 
exhibits linear dose proportional pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristic . Its metabolite 
(SHR161279 (M3 -4)) also exhibits similar linear dose proportional PK characteristic at 5mg - 
25mg dose range. There is no significant difference in PK characteristic between these two 
compounds. SHR0302 within dose range 2 -10mg were tolerat ed with no SAEs reported, or 
subject withdrawn due to  AE. 
 
Based on these information, we aim to carry forward 4mg, 8mg once daily and 4mg twice 
daily in the 8 -week phase II study in UC subjects. This phase II study will further characterize 
SHR0302’s efficacy and safety in inducing response in moderate to severe active UC  patients.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 19  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
The dose interval with increment of a fold should enable sufficient exposure variability to 
distinguish efficacy differences between the treatment  groups.  
 
SHR0302 with a half -live of about 8 -9 hours will enable sustained JAK1 inhibiti on over a 
24-hour period and enable a once daily dosing regimen. This was supported by PD evidence 
from the SAD study where pSTAT3 inhibition could be sustained for 24hr after once daily 
dosing. The study has also included a 4mg twice daily dose to further  determine this dosing 
regimen. This phase II proof -of-concept and dose -ranging study in UC patients aims to evaluate 
the efficacy in clinical practice providing further clinical evidence to support the dose  selection.  
 
The selection of 8 weeks as study du ration was based on the reported clinical practice 
experience where 8 -12 weeks are sufficient to observe the clinical benefit of treatment  induction 
in acute management. This was evidenced in similar class of medicine; where tofacitinib uses 8 
weeks ( 7,8) and filgotinib 10 weeks to demonstrate the induction period for UC (9). Hence the 
selection of 8-week induction period is  reasonable.  
 
In conclusion, Reistone is of the opinion believes that with the wealth of scientific  evidence 
on JAK/STAT involvement in IBD, the data from similar class of new drugs and the current 
early phase data on SHR0302, support the rationale to proceed with phase II studies to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of SHR0302 in patients with moderate to severe active  UC. 
 
2.4 Risk: Benefit  Assessment  
 
At present, there is no pharmacological therapy that is curative of UC and the current 
treatment goal is to induce remission followed by maintaining remission. To strike the balance 
between maintaining remission with the conventional immunosuppressant and  preventing the 
side effects of these therapies have always been a challenge to the treating physicians. Therefore, 
identification of new effective and safe therapies is an important area of  research.  
In the phase I studies to date, SHR0302 has been well tolerated without any reported SAEs 
or death. There were AEs that are consistent with the drug mechanism of action. In the MAD 
study, there were subclinical TSH elevation found on laboratory blood chemi stry, but were 
reversed towards baseline after stopping the trial medication. The reversibility was not confirmed 
due to limited follow -up duration. Subjects were asymptomatic with no residual clinical 
complication. Based on the available PK, PD, safety an d tolerability of single and repeat doses of 
SHR0302, doses of 4mg, 8mg QD and 4mg BD have been selected for investigation in this 
proposed  study.  
It is recognised that the phase I studies were short in duration, hence in this proposed phase 
II study, subj ect’s laboratory blood chemistry will be closely monitored. The clinical team will 
review the blinded safety data and laboratory parameters closely if any potential safety signal is 
suspected. The risk of adverse effects in the proposed study is being mini mised by careful 
selection of subjects through detailed inclusion criteria, particularly in terms of risk of infection, 
previous history of liver or thyroid  disease.  
The doses of SHR0302 have been selected for which the predicted exposure is supported by 
previous safety and tolerability data in phase I healthy volunteers and patients, and allows  an 
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 20  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
appropriate safety margin below the NOAEL limits in animal toxicological studies. The duration 
of 8+8week study has also been covered by th e long -term repeat -dose toxicology  study.  
The efficacy, safety, tolerability, and anti -inflammatory data generated by this proposed 
phase II study will be essential for evaluating the potential of this promising, novel anti - 
inflammatory agent as a treatme nt for moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis so that one or 
two doses can be selected to progress into further clinical  development.  
In consideration of the risk factors outlined above and steps taken to mitigate these risks, the 
potential benefit o f this study still outweighs the risks associated with the conduct of this Phase II 
study.

4.2 Discussion of the  design  
 
This is a multi -national, mul ti-center, double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled phase  II 
dose- ranging study to include 152 subjects with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis. The 
study consists of an 8 -week blinded treatment phase, followed by an 8 -week active arms 
exten sion phase. Subjects will be screened between -28 days to -1 day before baseline visit (visit 
2 at Day  0). 
 
At the baseline visit, subjects with moderate -to-severe active ulcerative colitis, with a 
modified 9 -point Mayo score of 5 to 9 points and endoscopi c subscore of 2 to 3, and fulfilling all 
the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized into one of the four treatment arms for the 
treatment phase; three active and one placebo; 4mg QD, 8mg QD, 4mg BD of SHR0302 or 
placebo. Subjects randomized into p lacebo in treatment phase will also have a pre -assigned 
randomized treatment sequence for extension phase, which are 3 active groups (placebo -> 4mg 
QD, placebo -> 4mg BD, and placebo -> 8mg QD) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects randomized to the 
active arms for treatment phase will remain in the same dose group in the extension  phase.  
 
All the subjects will be stratified according to whether they have previously exposed to anti - 
TNFα/biological treatment. The double -blind treatment period will last for 8 weeks. P rimary 
endpoint is collected at week 8. At the completion of treatment period, all subjects, responders or 
non-responders, have the option to enter a blinded active arms 8 -week extension phase according 
to the group they were randomized to for the extensio n phase. All subjects are followed -up for 
further 2 weeks until week 18 (last visit). All the subjects have the option not enrolling into the 
extension phase after first 8 weeks of treatment. Early withdrawn subjects during the first 
treatment phase cannot  enter the extension phase. The end -of-study is defined as the date of the 
last subject’s last visit or the actual date of follow -up visit/contact, whichever is  later.

105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
Female subjects of childbearing potential and their male partner must use at least 1  highly 
effective contraceptive method from the following  list: 
 
a. Combined (oestrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception  associate d 
with inhibition of ovulation (oral, intravaginal or  transdermal).  
b. Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  (oral, 
injectable or  implantable).  
c. Placement of intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone -releasing system  (IUS)  
d. Documented bilateral tube occlusion at least 4 weeks before  screening.  
e. Vasectomised partner with medical confirmation of absence of sperm in the ejaculate  at 
least 4 weeks before  screening.  
 
Female subjects and their male partners must be willing to continue use of these 
contraceptive methods from signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study, 
and for 1 month after last dose of study medication. W ithin these limits, the specific forms of 
contraception employed are left to the discretion of the subject, the principal investigator, and/or 
the subject’s  physician.  
 
Absolute sexual abstinence, when this is consistent with the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the subject, may be considered an acceptable method of contraception at the discretion of the 
investigator.  
 
5.4.3 Pregnancy  Testing  
 
Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for serum beta ‐human chorionic 
gonadotropin (β -hCG) at screening visit. In addition, urine β -hCG test will be done  at 
baseline and at each study visit until the end of follow ‐up period. If at any point there is a case of 
a positive urine β -hCG test, and this is confirmed by serum β -hCG, the subject will be  withdrawn 
from the study and all the necessary follow up will be  conducted.  
 
5.4.4 Males  
 
Non-vasectomized males with female partners of childbearing potential must be willing to 
use a condom, from signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study, and for 1 
month after last dose of study medication, in ad dition to having their female partner use a highly 
effective form of contraception as described in Section  5.4.2 : 
 
Vasectomized males with female partners of childbearing potential are not required to use 
an additional form of contraception providing that surgical sterilization has been successful 
and an absence of sperm in the ejaculate has been confirmed at least 4 w eeks before  screening.  
 
5.5 Randomization  Criteria  
 
Subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to SHR0302 8mg 
QD, placebo, SHR0302 4mg BD or SHR0302 4mg Q D for the treatment phase provided they 
have satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria at randomization visit (Visit 2). Subjects will  be 
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 28  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
stratified according to whether or not they have had previous exposure to anti -TNFα/biological 
treatment.  A computer -generated randomization schedule will be used to assign subjects to the 
treatment sequences. Subjects will be assigned a subject number in the order of their acceptance 
into the study. This identifying number will be retained througho ut the study. Subjects 
randomized into placebo in treatment phase will also have a pre -assigned randomized treatment 
sequence for extension phase, which are 3 active groups (placebo -> 4mg QD, placebo -> 4mg 
BD, and placebo -> 8mg QD) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Sub jects randomized to the active arms for 
treatment phase will remain in the same dose group in the extension  phase.  
 
After the completion of treatment phase, subject may choose to enroll into the extension 
phase according to the group they were randomized t o for the extension phase. All the subjects 
have the option not entering into the extension phase after first 8 weeks of treatment phase.  Early 
withdrawn subjects during the first treatment phase cannot enter the extension  phase.  
 
5.6 Withdrawal  Criteria  
 
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Reistone Biopharma for  behavioral 
or adm inistrative  reasons.  
 
If a subject develops a serious infection during the study, defined as any infection  (viral, 
bacterial, and fungal) requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobials, he/she must be 
discontinued from the  study.  
 
All abnormal laboratory events of clinical significance should be followed until the 
laboratory values have returned to norm al or baseline levels. In addition, any subject with a 
confirmed increase in serum creatinine at the end of study or at discontinuation of at least 0.2 
mg/dL and at least 10% above the average of screening and baseline value will be followed up 
with retest ing every one to two weeks until the creatinine elevation has fully reversed to within 
10% of the subject's baseline value or has  stabilized.  
 
If a subject has any clinically significant, study -related abnormalities at the conclusion of 
the study, the medi cal monitor (or designated representative) should be notified and every effort 
should be made to arrange follow -up evaluations at appropriate intervals to document the course 
of the  abnormalities.  
 
The reason for a subject discontinuing from the study will  be recorded in the eCRF. A 
discontinuation occurs when a randomized subject ceases participation in the study, 
regardless of the circumstances, prior to completion of the protocol. The investigator must 
determine the primary reason for discontinuation. Wi thdrawal due to adverse events should 
be distinguished from withdrawal due to insufficient response according to the definition of 
adverse event noted in Section 7.3.11 . The final evaluation required by the protocol will be 
performed at the time of the study discontinuation. The investigator will record the reason for 
study discontinuation, provide or arrange for appropriate follow -up if required.

105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
5.7 Pre-Screen and Screen  Failure  
 
Subjects will be assigned a subject number after completing written informed consent and 
completing at least one a dditional study procedure (study procedures do not include washout  of 
any medication).  
 
A screen failure is defined as any subject who has been assigned a subject number, but does 
not continue in the study beyond Visit 1 (Screening) or any subject who completes Visit 1 and 
enters the run -in period but is subsequently found to be ineligible for the study based procedures 
(e.g., laboratory, ECG, or Endoscopy) conducted at Visit 1. The study interactive voice response 
system (IVRS) used to track study enrolment, will be contacted to report screen  failures.  
Additionally, the following information will be collected in the eCRF for screen  failures:  
 
• Date of Screening  Visit  
• Subject  number  
• Demography information including race, age, and  gender  
• Inclusion/exclusion  criteria  
• Reason subject failed  screening  
• Primary method of subject  recruitment  
• Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) information,  if any 
In most circumstances, subjects who are screen failures cannot be re -screened. In rare 
instances, subjects may be eligible for re -screening. However, the re -screening of subjects must 
be approved by the st udy Medical Monitor prior to  re-screening.  
Subjects who meet all the Visit 1 eligibility criteria, but are not randomized will be 
considered Run -In failures. In addition to the information described above for screen failures,  the 
reason for the Run -In fail ure will be recorded in the eCRF for Run -In failures.  
 
5.8 Early  Withdrawal  
 
The definition of an early subject withdrawal from the study will be any subject who is 
randomized to double -blind medication and, for any reason, is withdrawn prior to completion of 
the Visit 5  procedures.  
 
A subject may voluntarily discontinue participat ion in the study at any time.  The 
investigator may also, at his/her discretion; discontinue the subject from participating in the 
study at any time. In addition, the investigator must make every effort to have the subject return 
to the clinic as soon as p ossible after discontinuation of study drug for an Early Withdrawal 
Visit. An Early Withdrawal Visit may occur at a regular scheduled clinic visit or between clinic 
visits.  The following evaluations and procedures should be completed and recorded in the  eCRF.  
• Concomitant medication  assessment  
• AE/SAE  assessment  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 30  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
• Physical examination (recorded in source documents  only)  
• Vital  signs  
• Collect and review electronic  diary  
• Collect used study medication (blinded study  medication)  
• Assess compliance with investigational  drug  
• 12-Lead  ECG  
• Laboratory assessments (including chemistry, haematology, and pregnancy test for females 
of childbearing potential and routine  urinalysis)  
• Call IVRS to report subject’s early withdrawal from the  study  
• Endoscopy, Mayo score, 9 -point modified Mayo score, and partial Mayo score, if  feasible.  
A subject that is withdr awn from the study after being randomised to treatment cannot be 
re-screened and subjects who are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. If the subject 
withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information,  no 
further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor 
may retain and continue to use any data collected  before.  
Thyroid specific  criteria:  
Subjects with deranged TSH level (outside of normal range) only, but normal free T4 or  free 
T3. Investigator can follow -up the subject with thyroid function test and assess clinically in 4 
weeks.  
Deranged TSH level, with associated deranged free T4 and/or free T3(outside of normal 
range), the investigator should assess subject’s c linical condition and decide if the subject should 
be withdrawn.  
Subject with signs and/or symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism 
should have laboratory thyroid function performed. If any of the thyroid parameters (TSH, free 
T4, or free T 3) were outside of normal range, the subject is to be  withdrawn.  
 
 
5.9 Stopping  Criteria  
 
The stopping safety criteria are as below: Subject who fulfil the following criteria  should 
discontinue the  study.  
• Liver chemistry threshold stopping criteria have been designed to assure subject safety and  to 
evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing clinical liver safety 
guidance) Study treatment will be stopped if the liver chemistry stopping criteria is met. 
Refer to Section 7.3.9 Live r Chemistry Stopping and Follow -up Criteria . 
• A subject that meets the QTc criteria below will be withdrawn from the study. The  QT 
correction formula used to determine discontinuation should be the same one used 
throughout the  study.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 31  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
-QTc, QTcB/QTcF > 500  ms 
-Change from baseline: QTc >60  ms 
Use the  averaged QTc values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the subject should be 
discontinued from the  study.  
• Abnormal laboratory values of interests. (modified from CTCAE 5.1  criteria)  
 
➢ Hemoglobin (Hgb) <7.0 g/dL; or when blood transfusion is  indicated.  
➢ Neutrophil count <  500/mm3  
➢ Platelet count <  25,000/mm3  
➢ Lymphocyte count <  200/mm3  
➢ Leukocyte count <  2000/mm3 
 
• Subject who develops Venous Thrombosis (eg Deep Vein  Thrombosis).  
 
• Subject who develops Pulmonary  Embolism.  
 
• Subject who develops Cerebrovascular Events (eg Thromboembolic Stroke,  Transient 
Ischemic Attack (TIA), Myocardiac  Infarction)  
• An unacceptable adverse event, as determined by the Investigator and the medical  monitor.  
• Any unacceptable adverse event that  is thought to be related to the investigational  product 
may result in the study being  terminated.  
• Significant protocol deviation. The discovery that post -randomization the subject failed  to 
meet protocol entry criteria or did not adhere to protocol requ irements, and continued 
participation poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s  health.  
• If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately. The 
procedure is described in Section  7.3.10 . 
 
 
5.10 Premature Study  Termination  
 
The sponsor may discontinue the study if the study becomes unjustifiable for medical  ethical 
reasons, for poor enrollment, or because of discontinuation of clinical development of the 
investigational  product.  
The clinical study may be terminated prematurel y or suspended at the request of health 
authorities or if new safety or efficacy information leads to an unfavorable risk benefit judgment 
for the investigational  product.  
If a study is prematurely terminated or discontinued, Reistone will promptly notify the 
investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the 
hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 7 days. As directed by Reistone, all study materials 
must be collected and all eCRFs completed to the greatest e xtent  possible.

105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
5.11 Safety Review Committee  (SRC)  
 
An SRC will be established in this study to assess overall safety data and early safety signal  in 
order to protect the ethical and safety interests of the subjects recruited into the study, while 
maintaining, as far as possible, the scientific validity of the study. The SRC is independent of  the 
study team and will comprise of at least one external  independent statistician and an external 
independent  physician.  
 
During the study, the SRC will convene at least twice to review the safety and tolerability data 
after the study recruited the 50th and 100th subject treated for first 8 weeks of treatment  phase. 
Based on the safety information, the SRC has the discretion to make recommendation to the 
study team based on predefined SRC  Charter.

1. Written  informed  consent  must  be obtained  prior  to performing  any Visit  1 procedures  or initiating  any alterations  in a subject’s  medications  
2. Only  to be performed  if there  is no chest  X-ray or CT scan available  within  3 months  of Visit  1 
3. IVRS is a randomisation machine used to record all the patient  visit.  
4. Colonoscopy  is completed  by baseline  (visit  2 – Day 0). The duration  of time between  endoscopy  and baseline  is no more  than -10 days.  
5. Subject  use an electronic  diary  to record  disease  related  medical  problems  experienced  during  the study.  
6. Vital  signs  include  resting  blood  pressure,  heart  rate, and body  temperature.  It is advised  to measure  them  before  any procedures  or questionnaires.  
7. Adverse events and Serious Adverse Events to be collected from the start of the study drug (visit 2) until the Follow -Up contact. However, any serious 
adverse events will be recorded from the time of  consent.  
8. Investigator has the option to use PPD test, QuantiFERON Gold test or T -Spot for TB screening. Subjects who have previously receive BCG vaccination 
will be tested  by QuantiFERON  Gold  test/or  T-Spot test, and the result  will determine  the subject  eligibilit y for participation.

6. Study  Treatments  
 
6.1 Investigational Product/Placebo  Supply  
 
SHR0302 and matching placebo tablets will be provided by the sponsor and dispensed for 
oral administration. Subjects will be randomized to receive 4mg QD, 4mg BD, 8mg QD or 
Placebo in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 respectively for the first 8 week of treatment phase.  Subjects 
randomized into placebo in treatment phase will also have a pre -assigned randomized  treatment 
sequence for extension phase, which are 3 active groups (placebo -> 4mg QD, placebo -> 4mg 
BD, and placebo -> 8mg QD) in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects randomi zed to the active arms for 
treatment phase will remain in the same dose group in the extension  phase.  
 
SHR0302 will be provided as combination of 4mg tablets, including the matching placebo 
by the Sponsor. At study visits on Day 0, and Week 4, sufficient t rial medication will be 
dispensed to complete dosing for four  weeks.  
 
For subjects enrolled into the blinded active arm extension phase, trial medications will be 
dispensed at week 8 and week 12, where trial medications will be dispensed sufficient for 4 
weeks. At visits Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 (end of extension phase), or at  follow - 
up visit/contact if the subject is withdrawn, the subject must return all trial medication and the 
amount returned will be  recorded.  
 
Note that only those patients  enrolled into the extension phase will be dispensed with  trial 
medications at week 8 and week  12. 
 
6.1.1 Study Drug  Dispensing  
 
Investigational product will be assigned to subjects at the baseline visit once successfully 
randomized through the tele -randomization system. The investigator or appropriate delegate  at 
the site will access the tele -randomization system (IVRS) at baseline  visit to receive correct 
container numbers to be dispensed to the subject. All medication dispensed or returned will  be 
documented in the  eCRF.  
 
After the completion of first 8 -week treatment phase, all completers may be enrolled  into 
the extension phase according to the group they were randomized to for the extension  phase.  
 
6.1.2 Study Drug  Administration  
 
Study medication will be self -administered by the subject twice dail y, one (2 tablets) in the 
morning, another (2 tablets) in the afternoon. Approximately 8 - 12 hours between the morning 
and afternoon  doses.  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 37  of 
105  
  
However, at baseline (Day 0) the first dose will be taken in the clinic. At Week 4 and a t the 
end of treatment (Week 8) subjects should take their morning oral dose at the clinic. Study 
medication may be taken with or without  food.  
6.2 Treatment  Assignment  
 
Subjects will be randomized into the trial in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio to SHR0302 8mg QD, 
placebo, SHR0302 4mg QD or SHR0302 4mg BD for the treatment phase provided they have 
satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects will be stratified accordi ng to whether or not 
they have had previous exposure to anti -TNFα/biological treatment and randomized at baseline 
according to a computer generated pseudo random code using the method of permutated blocks 
balanced within each randomization strata. Subjects  randomized into placebo in treatment phase 
will also have a pre -assigned randomized treatment sequence for extension phase, which are 3 
active groups (placebo -> 4mg QD, placebo -> 4mg BD, and placebo -> 8mg QD) in a 1:1:1 
ratio. Subjects randomized to th e active arms for treatment phase will remain in the same dose 
group in the extension  phase.  
After the completion of treatment phase, subject may choose to enroll into the extension 
phase according to the group they were randomized to for the extension pha se. All the subjects 
that have completed the first treatment phase have the option not entering into the extension 
phase after first 8 weeks of treatment. Early withdrawn subjects during the first treatment  phase 
cannot enter the extension  phase.  
 
6.3 Blinding  
 
Investigational product taken during the 8 -week treatment period will be double -blind. 
Neither the subject nor the study physician will know which study medication the subject is 
receiving. In the s ubsequent 8 -week extension phase, although subjects are given active 
treatments, both the subjects and investigators are blinded to which dose of SHR0302 they are 
randomized  to. 
 
In order to preserve blinding and ensure patients compliance throughout the s tudy, the study 
drug packaging has been designed with detailed consideration. All the arms are administered 
under twice daily (BD) dosing regime and placebo is used according to the schedule in the table 
below. (Table  2) 
 
Table 2. Study drug packaging design for treatment  arms  
 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 38  of 
105  
  
At each dosing time (morning, am or afternoon, pm), subject will be taking two tablets. In 
one day, a subject will take a total of four tablets, two tablets in the morning and two tablets in 
the afternoon.  
 
The investigator or treating physician may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only in 
the case of an emergency , when knowledge of the study treatment is essential for the 
appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. Whenever po ssible, the investigator 
must first discuss options with the Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO Medical Monitor or 
appropriate Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO study personnel before unblinding the 
subject’s treatment assignment. If this is impractical, th e investigator must notify Reistone 
Biopharma/designated CRO as soon as possible, but without revealing the treatment assignment 
of the unblinded subject, unless that information is important for the safety of subjects currently 
in the study. The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the appropriate data 
eCRF.  
 
Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO staff may unblind the treatment assignment for  any 
subject with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or 
more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identifying the subject’s treatment assignment, 
may be sent to clinical investigators in accordance with local  regulations.  
Subjects will be withdrawn if the treatment code becomes unblinded. The primary reason  for 
discontinuation (the event or condition which led to the unblinding) will be recorded in the 
eCRF.  
 
6.4 Drug Storage and  Accountability  
 
SHR0302 must be stored according to the labeled storage conditions in a locked area with 
restricted access. The investigator or appropriate delegate at the site (eg pharmacist), will  ensure 
that all study drug is stored in a secured area, under recommended  storage condition, and in 
accordance with regulatory  requirements.  
 
The investigator must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or  other 
disposition of the investigational product(s). To ensure adequate records, all drug supplies w ill 
be accounted for in the drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Reistone 
Biopharma/designated CRO and will be monitored by counting of unused medications returned 
by the subject at Week 4, 8, 12 and 16 or at follow -up visit/contact if the subject is  withdrawn.  
 
At the end of trial, Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO will provide instructions as to the 
disposition of any unused investigational product. If Reistone/designated CRO authorizes 
destruction at the trial site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in 
compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special 
instructions provided by Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO. Destruction must be adequately 
documented. SHR0302 will not b e made available to subjects at the end of  study.  
 
6.5 Treatment  Compliance  
 
Investigational product compliance will be assessed by the site at each clinic visit  following  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 39  of 
105  
  
baseline (Day 0) up to the end of treatment. Non -compliance is defined as  taking  
less than 80% of study drug products as directed by the do sing instructions. The investigator has 
the discretion to withdraw any subject from the study for reasons of non -compliance with the 
dosing regimen. Investigators should indicate on the appropriate eCRF page noncompliance with 
study treatment and provide a n explanation.  
 
Inventory control of all study medications must be rigorously maintained throughout  the 
duration of the study until all medication has been accounted for and returned to the sponsor. 
Any discrepancies noted between drug dispensing records a nd the drug inventory must be 
reported to Reistone Biopharma/designated  CRO.  
 
6.6 Concomitant  Medications  
 
6.6.1 Permitted Concomitant  Medications  
 
All concomitant medication(s) taken during the trial must be recorded with indication, daily 
dose, and start and stop dates of administration. All subjects will be questioned about 
concomitant  medication at each clinic visit. Following therapy for ulcerative colitis  are 
allowed providing they are stable for the specified period of  time:  
 
• Oral 5 -ASA or sulfasalazine are allowed providing that the dose is stable for at least 2 
weeks prior to ba seline and during the study treatment  period.  
 
• Oral steroids are allowed during the study up to the dose of 30 mg/day of prednisolone or 
equivalent, providing that the dose has not been commenced or changed within 2 weeks 
of baseline and until to the end of treatment phase (Week 8). During the treatmen t phase, 
if the subject cannot tolerate the oral steroids dose or there is a significant safety risk 
associated with continued use of the steroids, the dose may be reduced at the discretion  of 
the investigator and the reasons for dose reduction need to be documented in the medical 
records. During the extension phase, tapering of the oral steroid dose can be commenced 
for subjects at investigator’s discretion. Tapering scheduled treatment is provided as 
below:  
 
− Subjects receiving > 10 mg/day prednisolone o r equivalent: taper dose by 5 
mg/week until a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is reached, then continue  tapering 
at 2.5 mg/week until 0  mg/day.  
− Subjects receiving ≤ 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent: taper dose by 2.5 
mg/week until 0  mg/day.  
 
If subjec t experiences worsening of signs or symptoms during the tapering schedule, in the 
opinion of the investigator, due to reduction in oral steroid daily dose, the daily oral steroid 
dosage for the subject could be reverted to the preceeding daily dosage instr ucted by the 
investigator, but should not exceed Baseline  dose.

ASA.  
• Oral JAK inhibitors (except the trial  medication)  
 
In addition, concomitant administration of CYP3A inducers and moderate to potent CYP3A 
inhibitors with systemic effects should be avoided for the duration of the  study.  
Examples of medications that are prohibited from use from 28 days prior to the first do se of 
study medication until completion of follow up period, due to potential for drug interactions  or 
confounding of data interpretation, are listed in Appendix  4. 
 
All live vaccines immunization are prohibited from signing of informed consent,  throughout 
the duration of the study, and for 1 month after last dose of study  medication.  
6.6.3 Traditional Chinese and Herbal  Medicines  
 
The following categories of traditional or herbal medicines are prohibited at Visit 1 and any 
time during the  study:  
• Traditional or herbal medicines used for the treat ment of UC, including those that 
investigator believe to contain  corticosteroids.  
• Traditional or herbal medicines that have known effects on platelets and that increase the 
tendency to cause  bleeding.  
 
6.7 Treatment after study  completion  
 
The inves tigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - 
study care of the patient’s medical condition whether or not Reistone Biopharma/designated 
CRO is providing specific post study treatment after week 16. Reistone Biopharma/d esignated 
CRO has provided an 8 -week extension phase of active therapy, and will not provide post -study 
treatment after the extension phase. Post -treatment UC therapy should not be entered into the 
eCRF.  
 
6.8 Study Drug Overdose  Management  
 
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total doses described above which  results 
in clinical signs and symptoms. These sh ould be recorded by the investigator on the AE/SAE 
pages. In the event of an overdose of study medication, the investigator should use clinical 
judgment in treating the overdose and contact the study medical  monitor.  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 41  of 
105  
  
Reistone Biopharm a/designated CRO is not recommending specific treatment guidelines for 
overdose and toxicity management. The investigator is advised to refer to the relevant 
document(s) for detailed information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse 
events, and other significant data pertaining to the study drug being used in this study. Such 
documents may include, but not be limited to, the IB or equivalent document provided by 
Reistone Biopharma/designated  CRO.  
7. Study Assessments and  Procedures  
7.1 Critical Baseline  Assessments  
 
The following critical baseline assessments will be conducted at Visit  1: 
 
• Demographic history (including gender, ethnic origin, date of birth, height and  weight)  
• Medical history of Ulcerative Colitis comprised of date of diagnosis (year of diagnosis i s 
acceptable) and previous and/or current medical  conditions  
• Physical  examination  
• Heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature  measurement  
• 12-Lead  ECG  
• Chest x -ray (or historical chest x -ray/CT -Scan obtained within 3 months of Screening 
(Visit  1)) 
• Clinical laboratory assessments (including chemistry, hematology,  pregnancy  test) 
• Mayo Score – Mayo Scoring System for Ulcerative Colitis. 9 -point modified May o score 
will be used to confirm patient eligibility for the study at baseline. The duration of the 
time between endoscopy and baseline should not exceed 10 days. Mayo score and Partial 
Mayo score will also be calculated and collected prior to  randomization . 
 
7.2 Efficacy Endpoints  Assessments  
 
7.2.1 Primary Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
The percentage of subject achieve clinical response at week 8, defined as decrease from 
baseline in 9 -point modified Mayo score of at least 2 points and at least 30%, with an 
accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at least 1 point or absolute  subscore 
for rectal bleeding of 0 or  1. 
 
7.2.2 Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
• The percentage of subjects achieve clinical remission per 9 -point modified Mayo score  at 
week 8, where stool frequency subscore ≤ 1, rectal bleeding subscore of 0, and 
endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 42  of 
105  
  
• The percentage of subjects achieve clinical remission at week 8 as per total Mayo  score 
of 2 points or lower than 2, w ith no individual subscore exceeding 1point and a rectal 
bleeding subscore of  0. 
• The percentage of subjects achieve endoscopic remission (mucosal healing) at week  8, 
defined by Mayo endoscopic subscore ≤ 1 point.  
• Change from baseline in 9 -point modified Mayo score at week  8. 
• Change from baseline in total Mayo score at week  8. 
• Change from baseline in partial Mayo score (Mayo score without endoscopy) at week  1, 
4, 8, 9, 12 and  16. 
• Change from baseline in the level of biomarkers CRP, fecal  calprotectin.  
• The systemic exposure of SHR0302 in steady state in Ulcerative Colitis patients (i.e. 
concentration and area under the  curve).  
 
7.2.3 Safety  Endpoints  
 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability by laboratory  parameters.  
 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability by collection of AE/SAE  incidence  
 
• To measure the vital signs (BP, HR, and Body  temperature)  
 
• To measure subject’s total lipid profile, which includes Triglyceride, LDL and  HDL.  
 
• To measure subject’s thyroid profile: TSH, free T4 and free  T3. 
 
• 12 –lead ECG.  
 
7.2.4 Patient Diary  Assessment  
 
Subjects will be provided with an electronic diary at screening visit in order to collect the  
patient reported outcome components of the total Mayo score (see Appendix 1 ), including the 
following  information:  
 
• ‘Normal’ number of stools per day, when not  having a flare, and will be collected  only 
once.  
• Number of stools currently per  day. 
• Presence of rectal bleeding currently (if  any).  
 
Diary data will be assessed at the clinic, at each study visit from baseline (Day 0) until the 
end of follow up period (Week 18). The information extracted will be used for calculation of 
Mayo score taking into account the data recorded over the last 3 day s prior to each  study  
visit. Should any bowel preparation be required to perform the endoscopy examination 
(colonoscopy), last 3 days patient diary must be completed and assessed prior to any  bowel  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 43  of 
105  
  
preparations. If data on any of thes e days is missing, the last 3 days closer to that day of bowel 
preparation/visit within the last 7 days before the day for bowel preparation/visit will used for 
calculation. In order to encourage consistent diary recording, subjects are required to enter d iary 
data continuously throughout the  study.  
 
7.2.5 Mayo Score  Assessment  
 
Mayo score is an instrument designed to measure disease activity of ulcerative colitis.  Mayo 
score ranges from 0 to 12 points. It consists of 4 subscores, each graded from 0 to 3  with 
higher scores indicating more severe disease (see Appendix  1) 
 
• stool frequency  (0-3) 
• rectal bleeding  (0-3) 
• findings of colonoscopy  (0-3) 
• physician global assessment (PGA)  (0-3) 
 
Mayo score is assessed at baseline and Week 8. If the subject scores ≥2 on the endoscopic 
sub-score of the Mayo Score at baseline and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, the 
subject will be randomized. Should any bowel prep aration be required to perform the 
colonoscopy, 3 -day patient diary must be completed and assessed prior to any bowel  preparation. 
For the baseline endoscopy, the duration of the time between endoscopy and baseline should  not 
exceed 10 days .Baseline (Day 0 -Visit 2) endoscopy images/films (eligibility assessment)  and 
Week 8 endoscopy images/films will be submitted to central lab for central reading. The  central 
lab will send eligibility report to confirm  eligibility.  
 
The physician global ass essment (PGA) acknowledges the three other criteria: the patient’s 
daily recollection of abdominal discomfort and general sense of wellbeing, and other 
observations, such as physical findings and the patient’s performance  status.  
 
Clinical response is defined as a decrease from baseline in Mayo score of at least 3 points 
and at least 30 percent, with an accompanying decrease in the subscore for rectal bleeding of at 
least 1 point or absolute subscore for rectal bleeding of 0 or 1. C linical remission is defined as a 
total Mayo score of 2 points or lower, with no individual subscore exceeding 1  point.  
 
Endoscopic response is defined as decrease from baseline in the findings of the colonoscopy 
subscore of the Mayo Score ≥ 1. Endoscopic remission is defined as the findings of  colonoscopy 
subscore of the Mayo score equals  0. 
 
7.2.6 9-point Modified Mayo  Score  
 
9-point modified Mayo score is the Mayo score  excluding physician global assessment 
(PGA)subscore, hence the maximum is 9 points and minimum 0 point. By removing the PGA, it 
removes the subjective view/assessment from the physicians hence reducing bias. It is also a 
recommended assessment by the regu lators. 9 -point modified Mayo score will be collected as a 
primary endpoint at baseline (Visit 2) and week 8 (Visit 5). This has been advised by the US 
FDA according to FDA guidance on ulcerative colitis trial  (10). 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 44  of 
105  
  
 
7.2.7 Partial Mayo Score  Assessments  
 
A pa rtial Mayo score (Mayo score without endoscopy component) will be assessed at 
baseline, week 1, week 4, week 8, week 9, week 12, week 16 and week 18, as secondary 
endpoints.  
 
7.2.8 Colonoscopy  
 
Endoscopy examination (colonoscopy) will be required at baseline and Week 8 and it will 
be performed in order to establish Mayo endoscopic subscore and confirm patient eligibility for 
the study at baseline. The duration of the time between end oscopy and baseline should not 
exceed 10 days. As per Surveillance Guidelines for patients with ulcerative colitis, all subjects 
who have not had colonoscopy performed within last 10 years from onset of symptoms will 
require colonoscopy procedure for scree ning surveillance. An appropriately trained  endoscopist 
should perform the colonoscopy. Where possible the same endoscopist should perform the 
endoscopy for both baseline and Week 8 visits, where this is not possible it should be clearly 
documented who per formed each endoscopy  procedure.  
 
7.3 Safety  Assessment  
 
7.3.1 Vital  Signs  
 
Vital signs measurements will include heart rate and systolic an d diastolic blood pressure, 
and body temperature. Vital signs will be obtained after subjects have rested for approximately 5 
minutes and before performing ECG. A single set of values will be  obtained.  
 
Vital signs will be performed using equipment provide d by investigational sites and will be 
obtained at visits and time points as detailed in the Section 5.12 –Time and Event  Table . 
 
7.3.2 12 lead  ECG  
 
12-lead ECG measurement and  rhythm strip (10 seconds) will be obtained after 
measurement of vital signs. Triplicate ECG measurements are collected at rate of 3 ECGs over 5 
minutes period. After vital signs are obtained subjects should be placed in the supine position for 
the ECG  measurements.  
ECG measurements will be taken at various visits and time points as detailed in Section 
5.12 –Time and Event Table . The investigator, a designated sub -investigator, or other 
appropriately trained site personnel will be responsible for performing 12 -lead ECG  assessments. 
The investigator must provide his/her dated si gnature on the original paper tracing, attesting to 
the authenticity of the ECG machine interpretation. The investigator will review the ECG and 
determine if the subject should continue the  study.

7.3.3 Tuberculin Test  (PPD)  
 
Subjects must have a screening tuberculin test (PPD) administered and then evaluated by a 
health care professional (nurse or doctor) 48 to 72 hours later in order to be eligible for the 
study, unless performed and documented within the last 3 months. The test consists of 
intracutaneous injection of Tuberculin, concentration as per local medical standard  of 
practice, on the volar aspect of the forearm, using a short beveled 26 - or 27 - gauge ne edle 
(Mantoux test). The test is positive if the induration’s diameter (not erythema) is ≥5 mm 48 
to 72 hours after injection. Subjects who have previously received BCG vaccination will be 
tested by QuantiFERON Gold/or T -Spot test in place of Mantoux PPD a nd have these  results 
determine patient eligibility for  participation.  
 
7.3.4 QuantiFERON test/or T -Spot test 
 
At the discretion of the investigator, a QuantiFERON Gold®™ ( 11) test /or T -Spot test ( 11) 
conducted in local lab may be substituted for the PPD skin test. A description of the 
QuantiFERON Gold test follows: “This Enzyme -linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test 
detects the release of Interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) in fresh hepar inized whole blood from 
sensitized persons when it is incubated with mixtures of synthetic peptides simulating two 
proteins present in M. tuberculosis : Early Secretory Antigenic Target -6 (ESAT -6) and 
Culture Filtrate Protein -10 (CFP -10). ESAT -6 and CFP -10 are secreted by all  M. 
tuberculosis and pathogenic M. bovis strains. Because these proteins are absent from all Bacille 
Calmette -Guérin (BCG) vaccine strains and from commonly encountered  Non 
Tuberculous. Mycobacteria (NTM) except M. kansasii , M. szulgai, and M. marinum , QFT -G is 
expected to be more specific for M. tuberculosis than tests that use tuberculin Purified Protein 
Derivative (PPD) as the  antigen”.  
T-Spot is another IFN -γ release assays in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection. For this test, 
perip heral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are incubated with two mixtures of peptides, one 
representing ESAT -6 and the other representing CFP -10. The test uses an enzyme -linked 
immunospot assay (ELISpot) to detect increases in the number of cells that secrete  IFN-γ. 
In the situation QFT -G or T -Spot is unavailable by local testing, incubated whole blood sample 
could be sent to central lab for QFT -G testing. If QFT -G/or T -Spot result is indeterminate, a 
retest is required at earliest to determine the eligibility of the subject. If retest is indeterminate or 
positive, the subject should be screen failed. If retest is negative, the PI should assess the 
subject’s clinical condition and decide if the subject could be  included.  
 
7.3.5 Clinical Laboratory  Testing  
 
Routine, non -fasting clinical laboratory (hematology and chemistry and urinalysis) tests will 
be performed as detailed in Section 5.12 –Time and Event Table . At the discretion of the 
investigator, additional samples may be taken for safety reasons. All blood samples will be 
measured at a designated central  laboratory.  
 
A urine pregnancy test will be performed for all females of child bearing potential as detailed  in 
Table  3.

7.3.6 C-Reactive Protein  (CRP)  
 
C-reactive protein is considered an acute -phase protein which provides an objective 
criterion of inflammatory activity. CRP has a short half -life (19 hours) and therefore rises early 
after the onset of inflammation and rapidly decreases after resolution of the  inflammation ( 12). It 
is induced by interleukin -6, TNF -α and other proinflammatory cytokines that are  produced  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 48  of 
105  
  
within the intestinal lamina propria. CRP measurements will be collected at screening,  baseline, 
Week 1, 4, 8, 9, 12, 16 and 18 and will be analyzed by a central  laboratory.  
 
7.3.7 Fecal  Calprotectin  
 
Fecal calprotectin is a 36kDa calcium and zinc binding protein which is neutrophil derived 
and it represents 60% of cytosolic proteins in granulocytes. It is considered as a measurement of 
neutrophil migration to the gastrointestinal tract. Fe cal calprotectin is a very stable marker  (stable 
for one week at room temperature). There is a growing body of evidence that fecal calprotectin 
correlates well with disease activity and making it a useful tool in monitoring disease and 
treatment ( 13). Fecal calprotectin measurement will be collected as detailed in Section 5.12  – 
Time and Event table , from screening until the end of study visit (week 18) and will be analyzed 
by a central  laboratory.  
 
Subjects will be supplied with stool sample collection kits in advance and will be instructed 
to collect the sample at home, 1 day before the upcoming vis it at which they have to provide the 
sample. Fecal samples (~20 g) for analysis of fecal calprotectin will be collected into the labeled 
stool collection containers, at protocol specified times (see Section 5.12 –Time and Event table ) 
and shipped to central laboratory based on the laboratory manual . Samples will be analyzed using  a 
validated analytical  method.  
 
7.3.8 Lipid Profile  Testing  
 
A fasting lipid profile blood collection, as per Section 5.12 –Time and Event table , will 
require subjects to refrai n from all food and liquids (water and non -study medications permitted) 
for at least 10 hours prior to scheduled laboratory  tests.  
 
7.3.9 Liver Chemistry – Stopping and Follow -up Criteria  
 
Phase II liver chemistry stopping and follow up criteria have been designed to assure 
subject safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety  guidance ). 
 
Phase II liver chemistry stopping criteria 1 -5 are defined  below:  
 
1. ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT  ≥3xULN  
and INR>1.5, if INR  measured).  
 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, study drug should be 
discontinued if ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dip stick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver  injury.  
 
2. ALT ≥ 5xULN.  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 49  of 
105  
  
3. ALT ≥ 3xULN if associated with the appearance or worsening of symptoms of 
hepatitis or hypersensitivity such as fatigue, nausea, vomitin g, right upper  quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash or  eosinophilia.  
 
4. ALT ≥ 3xULN persists for ≥ 4 weeks.  
 
5. ALT ≥ 3xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for 4  weeks  
 
When any of the liver chemistry stopping criteria 1 -5 is met, do the  following:  
 
• Immediately withdraw investigational  product.  
 
• Report the event to Reistone/designated CRO within 24 hours of learning its 
occurrence.  
 
• Complete the liver event eCRF and  SAE data collection tool if the event also  meets 
the criteria for an SAE. All events of ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN (>35% 
direct bilirubin) (or ALT ≥3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured;  INR 
measurement is not required and the threshold value stated wil l not apply to patients 
receiving anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy’s Law’, must be reported as an SAE 
(excluding studies of hepatic impairment or  cirrhosis) . 
 
NOTE: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, study drug should be 
discontinued  if ALT ≥ 3xULN and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation 
should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of 
detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick , indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury.  
 
• Complete the liver imaging and/or liver biopsy eCRFs if these tests are  performed  
• Perform liver event follow up assessments, and monitor the subject until  liver 
chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described  below.  
 
• Withdraw the subject from the study (unless further safety follow up is  required) 
after compl etion of the liver chemistry monitoring as described  below.  
 
• Do not re -challenge with investigational  product.  
 
In addition, for criterion  1: 
 
• Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24 hours for 
repeat liver chemistries,  liver event follow -up assessments (see below), and close 
monitoring.  
 
• A specialist or hepatology consultation is  recommended.  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 50  of 
105  
  
• Monitor subjects twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilise or return to within baseline  values  
 
For criteria 2, 3, 4 and  5: 
 
• Make every reasonable attempt to have subjects return to clinic within 24-72 hrs for 
repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow up assessments (see  below)  
 
• Monitor subjects weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, 
bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values; criterion 5 subj ects 
should be monitored as frequently as  possible.  
 
Subjects with ALT ≥3xULN but <5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN, without hepatitis 
symptoms or rash, and who can be monitored weekly for 4  weeks:  
 
• Notify the Reistone/designated CRO medical monitor within 24 hours of learning of 
the abnormality to discuss subject  safety.  
 
• Can continue investigational  product.  
 
• Must return weekly for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline  phosphatase, 
bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilise or return to within  baseline.  
 
• If at any time these subjects meet the liver chemistry stopping criteria, proceed as 
described  above.  
 
• If, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xULN and bilirubin <2xULN , monitor 
subjects twice monthly until liver chemistries normalize or return to within baseline 
values.  
 
For criteria 1 -5, make every attempt to carry out the liver event follow up  assessments  
described  below:  
 
• Viral hepatitis serology  including:  
− Hepatitis A IgM  antibody;  
− Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody  (IgM);  
− Hepatitis C  RNA;  
− Cytomegalovirus IgM  antibody;  
− Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtai n heterophile 
antibody or monospot  testing);  
− Hepatitis E IgM  antibody  
 
• Blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, obtained within 24 hours of last dose. 
Record the date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of 
investi gational product prior to blood sample draw on the eCRF. If the date or time of  the 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 51  of 
105  
  
last dose is unclear, provide the subject’s best approximation. If the date/time of the  last 
dose cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be co llected in the time period 
indicated above, do not obtain a PK sample. Instructions for sample handling and 
shipping are in the  SPM.  
 
• Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase  (LDH).  
 
• Fractionate bilirubin, if total  bilirubin ≥2xULN.  
 
• Obtain complete blood count with differential to assess  eosinophilia.  
 
• Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right  upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report  form.  
 
• Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over  the 
counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins, on the concomitant med ications report 
form.  
 
• Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake  eCRF.  
 
The following are required for subjects with ALT ≥3xULN and bilirubin ≥2xULN  (>35% 
direct) but are optional for other abnormal liver  chemistries:  
 
• Anti-nuclear antibody,  anti-smooth muscle antibody, and Type 1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal  antibodies.  
 
• Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to  evaluate 
liver disease.  
 
7.3.10  Pregnancy  
 
If the subject is found to be pregnant, the subject must be withdrawn immediately, and any 
sponsor -supplied drug (SHR0302, placebo) should be immediately discontinued. In addition, any 
pregnancies in the partner of a male subject during the stud y, should also be recorded following 
authorization from the subject’s partner. Any pregnancy that occurs after the first dose of 
investigational drug must be reported using a clinical trial pregnancy form. To ensure subject 
safety, each pregnancy must be r eported to Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO within 24 hours 
of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome 
(including premature termination) and status of mother and the newborn should be followed up 
to 1 month after  birth. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical reasons 
must be reported as an AE or SAE. Pregnancies will remain blinded to the study  team.  
 
Should the pregnancy occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the investigator 
must inform the subject of their right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses  to 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 52  of 
105  
  
receive unblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken by the 
investigator. Subjects randomized to placebo need  not be followed in the treatment  phase.  
 
If the female subject and/or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care 
physician being informed, the investigator should notify the primary care physician that the 
subject/female partner of the subject was participating in a clinical stud y at the time she became 
pregnant and provide details of treatment the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as 
applicable).  
 
Spontaneous abortions must be reporte d as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with 
a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the subject has completed the study and 
considered by the investigator as possibly related to the study treatment, must be promptly 
reported to Rei stone Biopharma/designated  CRO.  
 
7.3.11  Adverse  Events  
 
The investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting 
events that meet the definition of an AE or  SAE. 
 
7.3.12  Definition of  AE 
 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject, temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not conside red related to the 
medicinal  product.  
 
Note: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use 
of a medicinal product. For mark eted medicinal products, this also includes failure to produce 
expected benefits (i.e., lack of efficacy), abuse or  misuse.  
Events meeting the definition of an AE  include:  
 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either  an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the  condition  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it 
may have been present pr ior to the start of the  study  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected  interaction  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be repo rted as  an 
AE/SAE).  
“Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and symptoms and/or clinical sequelae  resulting 
from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the  definition of an AE or  SAE.  
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 53  of 
105  
  
Events that do not meet the definition of an AE  include:  
 
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy); the condition that  leads 
to the procedure is an  AE 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a  hospital)  
• Anticipated day -to-day f luctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not  worsen  
• The disease/disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/disorder being studied, unless more sev ere than expected for the subject’s 
condition  
AEs which meet all of the following  criteria:  
• Serious  
• Unexpected (as per assessment according to safety information in Investigator  Brochure)  
• There is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a cau sal relationship between  the 
event and the medicinal  product  
will be classified as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs ) and should be 
reported to the relevant ethics committee and to the relevant Health Authorities in accordance 
with app licable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting. Sponsor/designated CRO will 
report SUSARs to the ethics committee and relevant health  authorities.  
 
7.3.13  Definition of  SAE  
 
A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any  dose:  
 
a. Results in  death  
b. Is life-threatening  
NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more  severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization  
NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or trea tment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office  or 
out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a 
complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. W hen in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered  serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen  from 
baseline is not considered an  AE. 
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 54  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
d. Results in disability/incapacity,  or 
NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experience s of relatively 
minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial  disrupt ion. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
f. Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in  death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other  outcomes 
listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such 
events are invasive or m alignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug  abuse.  
g. All events of possible drug -induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as ALT  ³ 
3xULN and bilirubin ³ 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ³ 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR 
measured) termed ‘Hy’s Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and the threshold 
value stated will not apply to patien ts receiving  anticoagulants).  
 
NOTE: bilirubi n fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, 
record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations 
and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets t he criterion of total 
bilirubin ³ 2xULN, then the event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include  values 
on the SAE form. INR elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver  injury.  
 
7.3.14  AE and SAE reporting requirement and  timeline  
 
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the star t of study  treatment 
(Visit 2) and until the follow up contact. SAEs will be collected from the time a subject consent 
to participate in the study up to and including any follow up  contact.  
 
All SAEs will be reported to Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO wi thin 24 hours. Prompt 
notification of SAEs by the investigator to Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects are met. All SAEs 
will be followed up until resolution, u ntil the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up. Once resolved, the SAE eCRF page will be 
updated. The investigator should report SAE/serious incident per local regulations and local EC 
requi rement.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examina tions, or 
consultation with other health care  professionals.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 55  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO has a legal responsibility to notify both the local 
regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation according to local regulations. Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO will comply 
with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory 
authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics  Committee (IEC) and 
investigators.  
 
Investigator safety report s are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO policy and 
are forwarded to investigators as  necessary.  
 
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other 
specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from Reistone 
Biopharma/designated CRO will file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local  requirements.  
 
7.3.15 Adverse Event of Special Interest  (AESI)  
 
The AE of special interest (AESI) (serious or non -serious) are determined based on previous 
knowledge about the disease and the mechanism of a ction of the investigational drug, as well as 
safety information from a similar class of drug. AESI is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific  to the product  or program,  for which  ongoing  monitoring  and rapid  communication  by the 
investigator to the sponsor may be appropriate. Such events require heightened surveillance and 
further  investigation  in order  to characterize  and understand  them.  The AESI  will be managed  and 
follow -up according to the SAE timeline and procedure. The study’s AESI  includes.  
 
• Serious infection: Serious infection is defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) 
requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobials for more than 3  days.  
 
• Thromboembolic  event:  Thromboembolic  events  are divided  into two major  groups  which  are 
venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary 
embolism (PE), and arterial thromboembolic events, including arterial thrombosis and 
cerebrovascular accident  (CVA).  
 
 
 
7.4 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic exposure -response analysis of SHR0302 will be  collected 
from randomized subjects at the following time points ( Table  4): 
 
Table 4 Pharmacokinetic Sampling  Schedule  
Week 4 (Visit  4) Week 8 (Visit  5) 
In all  subjects;  In all  subjects;  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 56  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
-One Pre -dose PK blood sample (within  1 
hour before  dosing).  
-One Post -dose PK blood sample  (1-2 
hours post  dose).  -One Pre -dose PK blood sample (within 
1 hour before  dosing).  
-One Post -dose PK blood sample (at any 
time between 2 to 8 hours post  dose).  
 
 
For the clinic visits at which blood samples for PK analysis are taken, the exact times and 
dates that the study medication is taken at the visit should be recorded on the sour ce document 
and in the eCRF. The exact time and date of the blood sample collection should also be 
documented in the eCRF. For details regarding PK blood samples collection, processing  and 
shipping are provided in the laboratory manual. For SHR0302 pharmac okinetics evaluation, the 
following windows for blood sample collection time are  allowed:  
• At Week 4 (Visit 4): a sample within 1 hour prior to dosing and a sample between 1 to  2 
hours post  dose 
• At Week 8 (Visit 5): a sample within 1 hour prior to dosing and a sample at any time 
between 2 to 8 hours post  dose 
 
On the days of PK samplin g at Week 4 and 8, subjects are to take the first dose of study 
medication for the day at the study  site. 
Samples will be analyzed using a validated analytical method. Only samples from subjects 
who have received active treatment (i.e., SHR0302 tablets) wi ll be measured for the analytes 
(SHR0302). Contracted PK analysis laboratory personals will be unblinded for the analysis 
purpose. Samples from subjects receiving placebo will not be  analyzed.  
8. Data  Management  
 
For this study subject data will be entered into Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO 
defined electronic case report forms (eCRFs), transmitted electronically to Reistone  Biopharma  
/designated CRO and combined with data provided from other source s in a validated data 
system. Management of clinical data will be performed in accordance with applicable Reistone 
Biopharma/designated CRO data review, verification and cleaning procedures to ensure the 
integrity of the data, e.g., removing errors and inc onsistencies in the data. Adverse events and 
concomitant medications terms will be coded using MedDRA. An appropriate medical dictionary 
that covers all approved drugs in the region will be referenced. eCRFs (including queries and 
audit trails) will be ret ained by Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO, and copies will be sent to 
the investigator to maintain as the investigator copy. In all cases, subject initials will not be 
collected or transmitted to Reistone Biopharma/designated  CRO.  
9. Data Analysis and Statistical  Considerations  
9.1 Hypothesis  
 
The primary objective of the study will be evaluated for SHR0302 dos e groups (8mg  QD, 
4mg BD, 4mg QD) compared to placebo group with respect to the percentage of patients with 
clinical response at week  8. 
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 57  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
 No 
Yes Reject all null 
hypotheses and  stop  
 
Test if p  (2)>0.05  
 
Test if p  (1)>0.1/3  No 
Yes 
Yes Reject H (02) and H  (01)  
and stop   
 
The Hochberg me thod will be used to maintain the 2 -sided study -wise Type I error rate  at 
0.1. The null and alternative hypothesis for the primary endpoint that will be tested  are: 
 
H01: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 8mg group – the 
percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group =  0; 
H11: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 8mg group – the 
percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group ≠ 0. 
 
H02: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 4mg BD group – 
the percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group =  0; 
H12: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 4mg BD group  – 
the percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group ≠ 0. 
 
H03: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 4mg QD group – 
the percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group =  0; 
H13: The percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in SHR0302 4mg QD group – 
the percentage of patients with clinical response at week 8 in placebo group ≠ 0. 
 
Two-sided p -values for the treatment group differences will be provided for all comparisons by 
using CMH test. Thus, 3 p -values will be gained and start with the least significant comparison 
and continue as long as tests are not significant until the first  time when a significant  comparison 
occurs and all remaining hypotheses will be rejected. Order the three p values as (p (3), p(2), p(1)), 
where p (3) ≥ p(2) ≥ p(1). The decision rules are provided in below figure ( Figure  2).

9.2 Study Design  Considerations  
9.2.1 Sample Size  Assumptions  
 
The sample size calculation is based on pairwise comparison of clinical response at week 8 
among SHR0302 8mg, 4mg QD, 4mg BD dose group and placebo group at the 2 -sided 0.1 
significance level. 57%, 57%, 50%, 30% clinical response are assumed for 8mg QD, 4mg BD 
and 4mg QD dose group, placebo group at week 8 respectively. The planned sample size of 35 
evaluable subjects per treatment group will provide 80% global powe r to detect at least 1  dose None of the 
hypotheses  were 
rejected   
Reject H (01)   and stop   
p (3)>0.1  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 58  of

group is different from placebo group by using Hochberg’s step up test. The total sample size  is 
152 randomized subjects with consideration of 8% drop out  rate. 
 
9.3 Data Analysis  Considerations  
 
9.3.1 Analysis  Dataset  
 
• Full analysis set  (FAS)  
 
Full analysis set (FAS) will comprise of all randomized subjects who have received any 
amount of IP and have observed analysis data in at least one valid Mayo related score. All 
summaries of baseline and demogra phic data and all listings will be produced for the FAS 
population. In the full analysis set, subjects will be analyzed according to randomized treatment, 
regardless of the treatment  received.  
 
• Per protocol Analysis set  (PPS)  
 
Per protocol set (PPS) is defined as all subjects from FAS who do not have  significant 
protocol  violation.  
• Safety analysis Set  (SS) 
 
The Safety analysis set will comprise all subjects who received any amount of 
investigational product (IP) and will be based on the actual treatment received, if this differs 
from that to which the subject was randomized to. The Safety analysis set will be  used for all 
summaries of safety  data.  
9.3.2 Treatment Comparison of interest: Primary and others 
Primary  comparison:  
SHR0302 8mg QD versus placebo, Week  8; 
SHR0302 4mg BD versus placebo, Week 8; 
SHR0302 4mg QD versus placebo,  Week8.  
 
9.3.3 Interim  Analysis  
 
The primary analysis will occur after all subjects have the opportunity to complete the  8- 
week treatment phase study  visit 
 
9.3.4 Key Elements of Analysis  Plan 
 
9.3.4.1  General  Approach  
In general, continuous variables will be summarized using number of non -missing 
observations, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum. Categorical 
variables will be summarized using frequency counts and  percentages.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 59  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
9.3.4.2  Missing  Data 
 
Binary data: Non -completers considered failure (NCF) will be  used.  
Continuous data: Last -observation -carried -forward (LOCF) approach will be  used 
 
9.3.4.3  Efficacy  Analysis  
 
Analysis of the Primary Efficacy  Endpoint  
 
The primary analysis will be based on the FAS population. In addition, an analysis of the PPS 
population will be used to support the primary efficacy  analysis.  
 
For clinical response at week 8, the comparisons of the percentage of subjects achieving clinical 
response in each treatment versus placebo will be made using a stratified Cochran -Mantel - 
Haenszel (CMH) test with stratification according to prior anti - TNFα/biological treatment (with 
or without). Missing data will be imputed as Non -completers considered failure  (NCF).  
 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint include: (1) the same analysi s using  the 
per-protocol analysis set (2) using last -observation -carried -forward (LOCF) imputation for 
subscore other than endoscopy of Mayo  score.  
 
Analysis of the Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
 
Dichotomized secondary efficacy endpoints listed below will b e analyzed by using a CMH Chi - 
Square test with stratification according to prior anti - TNFα treatment (with or without). Missing 
data will be imputed as Non -completers considered failure  (NCF).  
 
✓ The percentage  of subjects  with clinical  remission  (per 9-point  modified  Mayo  score)  at week 
8 
✓ The percentage of subjects with clinical remission (per total Mayo score) at week  8 
✓ The percentage of subjects achieve endoscopic remission at week  8 
 
The continuous secondary endpoints listed below  will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model including treatment group, baseline value, with/without previous 
exposure to anti -TNFα treatment as main effects. Missing data will be imputed by using Last - 
observation -carried -forward (LOCF ) approach for subscore other than endoscopy of Mayo  score.  
 
✓ Change from baseline in 9 -point modified Mayo score at week  8 
✓ Change from baseline in total Mayo score at week  8 
✓ Changes from baseline in partial Mayo score (Mayo score without endoscopy) a t week 1, 4, 
8, 9, 12 and  16. 
✓ Change from baseline in the level of biomarkers CRP, fecal  calprotectin.  
 
9.3.4.4  Safety  Analysis  
 
Summaries of safety data will be based on the safety analysis  set. 
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 60  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
 
Adverse events will be grouped by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT) and summarized by actual  treatment.  
Treatment emergent AEs are defined as AEs which commence on o r after the time of start of IP 
administration.  Adverse  events  without  an onset  date or time or AEs with an onset  date of the date 
of IP administration but without an onset time will be defined as treatment emergent, except if an 
incomplete  date (e.g.,  month and year)  clearly  indicates  that the event  started  before  administration 
of IP or if the AE stop date indicates that the event stopped before administration of  IP. 
 
Treatment emergent AEs will be summarized for each SHR0302 dose level and placebo. The 
number  and percentage  of subjects  experiencing  AEs and the number  of TEAEs  will be tabulated.  
 
The following summaries will be  presented:  
✓ Overall summary of  TEAEs.  
✓ All TEAEs by SOC and  PT. 
✓ All TEAEs by SOC, PT, and  severity.  
✓ All TEAEs by SOC, PT, and relationship to  IP. 
✓ Serious AEs by SOC and  PT. 
 
 
 
 
Separate listings will be prepared for deaths and AEs leading to study  discontinuation.  
Observed values and actual changes from baseline of continuous laboratory parameters 
(hematology and biochemistry), dipstick urinalysis results evaluation (Normal, Abnormal Not 
Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant), vital signs, and E CG parameters will 
be summarized at each protocol scheduled time point, by actual treatment at each time point. 
Actual values and actual changes from baseline will be presented. Categorical outcomes will be 
summarized by frequency tabulations. Abnormal lab oratory values will be flagged and will be 
identified in the listings. Microscopy data, if available, will be  listed.  
Shift tables representing categorical change of laboratory results from baseline to each post 
baseline visit will be presented. QTcF prolo ngation and ECG interpretations will be summarized 
by frequency  tabulations.  
 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary and will be grouped by PT. The summary tables will show the number and percent age 
of subjects by PT, for all subjects overall. Prior medications are those medications that were 
stopped  prior  to first study  treatment.  Concomitant  medications  are medications  taken  at least once 
after first study treatment. Medications stopped on the same day as first study treatment will be 
considered as prior medication only. Only concomitant medications will be summarized. Prior 
medications will be listed only. Prior and concomitant medica tions will be listed separately. For 
the summaries of concomitant medications, subjects who take the same medication (in terms of 
the PT) more than once will only be counted once for that  medication.  
 
Physical examination and pregnancy data will be listed  only.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 61  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
Pharmacokinetic  Analysis  
 
Plasma concentrations of SHR0302 will be summarized by treatment group and time point. 
The population pharmacokinetic analysis will be used to derive the pharmacokinetic parameters 
such as area under the curve (AUC), steady -state drug concentration (C ss), maximum 
concentration (C max) and minimum concentration  (Cmin). 
Pharmacodynamic parameters such as area under the effect curve (AUEC), minimum 
concentration (C min) and maximal percentage reduction (PR max) for the various biomarkers (e.g. 
CPR and Fecal Calpr otectin), efficacy and safety outcomes will be generated and summarized  by 
treatment  group.  
Relationships between the systemic exposure of SHR0302 and pharmacodynamic 
parameters may be explored by treatment group in table format and graphically. If data pe rmit, 
the model will be used to evaluate the correlation between pharmacokinetics and efficacy,  safety; 
these analyses and results will be reported separately from the study  report.  
10. Study Conduct  Considerations  
10.1 Regulatory and Ethical Consideration to GCP  standard  
 
Prior to initiation of a study site, Reistone/designated CRO will obtain approval from  the 
appropriate regulatory agency to conduct the study in accordance with ICH Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) and applicable country -specific regulatory  requirements.  
 
The study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable regulatory  requirements . 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ICH GCP, all applicable subject privacy 
requirements, and the ethical principles that are outlined in the Declaration of H elsinki 2008, 
including, but not limited  to: 
 
• Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) review and 
approval of study protocol and any subsequent  amendments.  
• Subject informed  consent.  
• Investigator reporting  requirements.  
Reistone/designated CRO will provide full details of the above procedures, either  verbally, 
in writing, or both. Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to 
participation in the  study.  
 
10.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC)  
 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study  protocol, 
protocol amendments, molecular profiling supplement, informed consent forms, and other 
relevant documents, eg, recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All 
correspondence with the IRB/IEC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC 
approvals should be forwarded to Reistone/designated  CRO.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 62  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated pri or to IRB/IEC approval is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In  that 
event, the investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Reistone/designated CRO in writing 
immediately after the  implementation.  
 
10.3 Informed Consent  Process  
 
All parties will ensure protection of subject personal data and will not include subject names 
on any sponsor forms, reports, publ ications, or in any other disclosures, except where required by 
laws.  
 
In case of data transfer, Reistone/designated CRO will maintain high standards of 
confidentiality and protection of subject personal data. The informed consent form must be in 
complianc e with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements. The  informed 
consent form used in this study, and any changes made during the course of the study, must be 
prospectively approved by both the IRB/IEC and Reistone/designated CRO before  use. 
 
The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature  and 
objectives of the study and  possible  
risks associated with participation. The investigator, or a person designated by the 
investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any  study -specific 
activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each sub ject's signed consent 
form.  
 
10.4 Study Monitoring and Quality  Control  
 
During study conduct, Reistone/designated CRO will conduct periodic monitoring visit s to 
ensure that the protocol and GCPs are being followed. The monitors may review source 
documents to confirm that the data recorded on eCRFs is accurate. The investigator and 
institution will allow Reistone/designated CRO monitors or its agents and appro priate  regulatory 
authorities direct access to source documents to perform this  verification.  
The study site may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/independent 
ethics committee (IEC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed b y Reistone, or companies 
working with or on behalf of Reistone, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory  authorities. 
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the 
monitoring visits and possible audits  or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the 
process.  
 
10.5 Study Site  Closure  
 
Upon completion or termination of the study, the Reistone/designated CRO monitor will 
conduct si te closure activities with the investigator or site staff (as appropriate), in accordance 
with applicable regulations, and GCP requirement. Reistone/designated CRO reserves the  right 
to temporarily suspend or terminate the study at any time for reasons inc luding (but not limited 
to) safety issues, ethical issues, or severe non -compliance.  If Reistone/designated  CRO  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 63  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
determines that such acti on is required, Reistone/designated CRO will discuss the reasons for 
taking such action with the investigator or head of the medical institution (where applicable). 
When feasible, Reistone/designated CRO will provide advance notice to the investigator or h ead 
of the medical institution of the impending  action.  
 
If a study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons , Reistone/designated CRO will 
promptly inform all investigators, heads of the medical institutions (where applicable), and/or 
institutions con ducting the study. Reistone/designated CRO will also promptly inform the 
relevant regulatory authorities of the suspension/termination along with the reasons for such 
action. Where required by applicable regulations, the investigator or head of the medical  
institution must inform the IRB/IEC promptly and provide the reason(s) for the 
suspension/termination.  
 
10.6 Record  Retention  
 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Reistone/designated 
CRO, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects 
(sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed 
informed consent forms, copies of all CRF s, serious adverse event forms, source documents,  and 
detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant 
correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, telephone calls reports). The records should be 
retained by the investigat or according to ICH, local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical 
Study Agreement, whichever is longer. If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to 
continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), 
Reisto ne/designated CRO should be prospectively notified. The study records must be 
transferred to a designee acceptable to Reistone/designated CRO, such as another investigator, 
another institution, or to Reistone/designated CRO. The investigator must obtain 
Reistone/designated CRO’s written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been  met. 
 
10.7 Independent Data Monitorin g Committee  (IDMC)  
 
A data monitoring committee for efficacy is not required for this study. Data safety 
monitoring will be conducted on an ongoing basis by the Sponsor study  team.  
 
 
10.8 Provision of study results to Investigators, posting to the Clinical  Trial 
Registry and  Publication.  
 
Where required by applicable regulatory require ments, an investigator signatory will be 
identified for the approval of the clinical study report. The investigator will be provided 
reasonable access to statistical tables, figures, and relevant reports and will have the  opportunity 
to review the complete  study results at a Reistone/designated CRO site or other mutually - 
agreeable  location.  
v3.1 20AUG2020  Page 64  of 
105 Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101   
  
Reistone/designated CRO will also provide the investigator with the full summary of the 
study results. The investigator is encouraged to share the  summary results with the study 
subjects, as appropriate. Reistone/designated CRO will provide the investigator with the 
randomization codes for their site only after completion of the full statistical  analysis.  
The results summary will be posted to the Cl inical Study Register when appropriate  determined 
by Reistone.  
 
In addition, a manuscript will be submitted to a peer -reviewed journal for  publication.  
The results summary will be posted to the Clinical Study Register if required by legal  agreement, 
local law or  regulation.

4. Subjects previously not exposed to anti -TNF treatment (e.g., anti -TNF -naïve) or subjects 
previously exposed to anti -TNF therapy (eg; infliximab, adalimumab or certolizumab pegol) 
or other biological treatment (eg Vedolizumab) at a dose registered for the treatment of UC. 
The patients previously exposed to biological therapy should have discontinued the  treatment 
for a minimum of 12 weeks prior to baseline. Subjects deemed by the treating ph ysician as 
having inadequate response or intolerance to the conventional immune -suppressants (eg 
azathioprine, 6 -mercaptopurine), anti -TNF or other biological treatments, or unable to 
receive these treatments for other  reasons.

response or intolerance to the conventional treatment (immune -suppressants or 
corticosteroids),  AND  
 
− Naïve to anti -TNF treatment (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab or certo lizumab

15. FSH to confirm postmenopausal status at screening visit  only. 
 
Rationale: Correct the typos in Table 1 in Section 5.12 Time and Event Table, and the footnotes to ensure the procedures are 
consistent with subject selection criteria. Clarify chext X -ray to be performed if no chest X -ray or CT scan available within 3 months 
of Visi t 1 instead of 6 months in footnote 2. Typo correction to clarify the follow up visit is not a phone -call contact and clarify any 
SAEs will be recorded from the time of consent in footnote 7. Allow T -Spot as an alternative test for TB infection screening.C larify 
only serum β -Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (β -HCG) is requested for pregnancy testing at screening visit and urine test is to be 
done from baseline. Clarify concurrent medication assessment should be done in Follow up/EW visit, in order to keep cons istent with 
Section 6.6 Concomitant Medications. Clarify the early withdrawal visit should be done within 2 weeks after last dose/decisio n of 
withdrawl rather than after 2 weeks of last dose/decision of withdrawl in footnote 11. FSH test is listed in the t able to confirm 
postmenopausal status at  screening.

• Oral steroids are allowed during the study up to the dose of 30 mg/day of prednisolone  or 
equivalent, providing that the dose has not been commenced or changed within  2 weeks 
of baseline and until to the end of treatment phase (Week 8). During the extension 
phase, tapering of the oral steroid dose can be commenced for subjects at 
investigator’s discretion, in accordance with the predefined tapering scheduled 
treatment:  
 
− Subjects receiving > 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent: taper dose by 5 
mg/week until a 10 mg/day dose (or equivalent) is reached, then continue 
tapering at 2.5 mg/week until 0  mg/day.  
− Subjects receiving ≤ 10 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent: tap er dose by 2.5 
mg/week until 0  mg/day.  
If subject experiences worsening of signs or symptoms during the tapering 
schedule, in the opinion of the investigator, due to reduction in oral steroid  daily

• intravenous corticosteroids or rectally administered formulation of corticosteroids or  5- 
ASA within 2 weeks prior to  baseline . 
• Oral JAK inhibitors (except the trial  medication)  
 
In addition, concomitant administration of CYP3A inducers and moderate to potent  CYP3A 
inhibitors with systemic effects should be avoided for the duration of the  study.  
 
Examples of medications that are pr ohibited from use from 28 days prior to the first dose of 
study medication until completion of follow up period, due to potential for drug interactions  or

the Mayo score excluding the endoscopy sub -score, appropriate endoscopy examination 
(colonoscopy) will be performed. If the subject scores ≥2 on the endoscopic sub -score of the 
Mayo Score at baseline and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject will be 
randomized. Should any bowel preparation be required to perform the colonoscopy, 3 -day 
patient diary must be completed and assessed prior to any bowel preparation. For the  baseline  
endoscopy, the duration of the time between endoscopy and baseline should not  exceed 10  days.

score of the Mayo Score at baseline and meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria, the subject 
will be random ized. Should any bowel preparation be required to perform the colonoscopy, 3 -

8 endoscopy images/films will be submitted to central lab for central reading. The central 
lab will send eligibility report to confirm  eligibility.  
 
Rationale: According the study procedure, endoscopy is completed by baseline, remove the 
requirement of “If at baseline the subject scores ≥ 4 points on the Mayo score excluding the 
endoscopy sub -score, appropriate endoscopy examination (colonoscopy) will be performed”, to 
avoid misunderstanding. Clarify that the images/films of endoscopy will be sent to central lab for

7.3.4 QuantiFERON  test 
 
At the discretion of the investigator, subject to local testing availability, a QuantiFERON 
Gold®™ ( 11) test may be substituted for the PPD skin test. A description of the 
QuantiFERON Gold test follows: “This Enzyme -linked Immunosorbent Ass ay (ELISA) test 
detects the release of Interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) in fresh heparinized whole blood from 
sensitized persons when it is incubated with mixtures of synthetic peptides simulating two 
proteins present in M. tuberculosis : Early Secretory Antigenic Target -6 (ESAT -6) and 
Culture Filtrate Protein -10 (CFP -10). ESAT -6 and CFP -10 are secreted by all  M. 
tuberculosis and pathogenic M. bovis strains. Because these proteins are absent from all Bacille 
Calmette -Guérin (BCG) vaccine strains and from commonly en countered  Non 
Tuberculous. Mycobacteria (NTM) except M. kansasii , M. szulgai, and M. marinum , QFT -G is 
expected to be more specific for M. tuberculosis than tests that use tuber culin Purified Protein 
Derivative (PPD) as the  antigen”.

tuberculosis than tests that use tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) as the  antigen”.  
T-Spot is another IFN -γ release  assays in diagnosing M. tuberculosis infection. For this 
test, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are incubated with two mixtures of 
peptides, one representing ESAT -6 and the other representing CFP -10. The test uses an 
enzyme -linked immunospot ass ay (ELISpot) to detect increases in the number of cells that 
secrete  IFN-γ. 
In the situation QFT -G or T -Spot is unavailable by local testing, incubated whole blood 
sample could be sent to central lab for QFT -G testing. If QFT -G/or T -Spot result is 
indeterminate, a retest is required at earliest to determine the eligibility of the subject. If 
retest is indeterminate or positive, the subject should be screen failed. If retest is  negative, 
the PI should assess the subject’s clinical condition and decide if the subject could be 
included.  
 
Rationale: Allow T -Spot as an alternative test for TB infection screening according to  local 
availability. And provide the guidance on initial QFT -G/or T -Spot is  indeterminate.

Rationale: According to the FDA’s recommendation, add the abnormal laboratory values of 
interest (e.g., at minimum, for anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and abnormal 
coagulation  profile).

7.3.14 AE and SAE reporting requirement and  timeline  
 
The investigator or site staff is responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events 
that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. AEs will be collected from the start of study treatment 
(Visit  2) and until the follow  up contact.  SAEs  will be collected  from  the time a subject  consent  to 
participate in the study up to and including any follow up  contact.  
 
All SAEs will be reported to Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO within 24 hours. Prompt 
notification of SAEs by the investigator to Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO is essential so 
that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of s ubjects are met. All SAEs 
will be followed up until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise 
explained, or until the subject is lost to follow -up. Once resolved, the SAE eCRF page will be 
updated. The investigator should rep ort SAE/serious incident per local regulations and local EC 
requirement.  The investigator  will ensure  that follow -up includes  any supplemental  investigations 
as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the SAE. This may include 
addition al laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with 
other health care  professionals.  
Reistone Biopharma/design ated CRO has a legal responsibility to notify both the local 
regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical 
investigation according to local regulations. Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO will comply 
with co untry specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory 
authority, Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) and 
investigators.  
 
Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serio us adverse reactions 
according to local regulatory requirements and Reistone Biopharma/designated CRO policy and 
are forwarded to investigators as  necessary.

7.3.15  Adverse Event of Special Interest  (AESI)  
 
The AE of special interest (AESI) (serious or non -serious) are determined based on previous 
knowledge about the disease and the mechanism of action of the investigational dru g, as well as 
safety information from a similar class of drug. AESI is one of scientific and medical concern 
specific  to the product  or program,  for which  ongoing  monitoring  and rapid  communication  by the 
Reistone  Biopharma  Confidential  RSJ10101

investigator to the sponsor may be appropriate. Such events require heightened surveillance and 
further  investigation  in order  to characterize  and understand  them.  The AESI  will be managed  and 
follow -up according to the SAE timeline and procedure. The stud y’s AESI  includes:  
 
• Serious infection: Serious infection is defined as any infection (viral, bacterial, and 
fungal) requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobials for more than 3  days.  
 
• Thromboembolic event: Thromboembolic events are divided into two major groups 
which are venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and 
pulmonary embolism (PE), and arterial thromboembolic events, including arterial 
thrombosis and ce rebrovascular accident  (CVA).  
 
Rationale:  According  to the FDA’s  recommendation,  add the AEs of special  interest  (e.g.,  serious 
infection associated with all  JAK-inhibitors).

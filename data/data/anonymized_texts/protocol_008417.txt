tobacco)  
Study Title:  
Evaluation of the Abuse Liability of Very Low Nicotine (VLN) Mentholated Cigarettes with 
Characterization of Nicotine Exposure Profiles in Adult Smokers  
Principal Investigator:  
Debra Kelsh, MD  
Study Center:  
Vince & Associates Clinical Research, Inc.  
10103 Metcalf Avenue  
Overland Park, Kansas, 66212, USA  
Phase of Development: I  
Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the abuse liability of VLN  mentholated  cigarettes (0.4 mg nicotine/gram of 
tobacco) relative to own -brand mentholated cigarettes and  4 mg nicotine polacrilex gum  
under controlled use and uncontrolled  (ad libitum) use conditions.  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To compare the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of VLN mentholated  cigarettes 
relative to own -brand mentholated  cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum  under controlled 
use and uncontrolled use conditions.  
• To characterize product use behavior of VLN mentholated  cigarettes, own -brand 
mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum.  
Methodology:  
This study will be a randomized, two-part, 3-way crossover designed to evaluate the abuse liability, 
PK, and product use behavior associated with study products, including VLN mentholated  cigarettes, 
subjects ’ own-brand  mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum in healthy adult male and 
female exclusive smokers.  Subjects will participate in a standard Screening visit and one 7-day 
Confined Assessment Phase , which will include a product trial session (Day -1), and two study parts 
(Part A and Part B).  Following the Screening visit, eligibl e subjects will check -in to the study site on 
Day -1. Following the polacrilex  gum training session , subjects will be required to abstain from 
nicotine - and tobacco -containing products for approximately 20 hours until the first product use 
session on Day s 1 to 3; use of other nicotine -containing products will be prohibited  throughout the 
study.  No additional tobacco or nicotine products will be provided after the second product use on 
Days 4 to 6.

On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to one of three  produ ct sequence groups in Part A, which will 
consist of an ad libitum product use session for each of the following study products for 4 hours in a 
randomized crossover manner (Days 1 to 3; one product per day):  
▪ Product A: VLN Menthol cigarette  
▪ Product B : Own -brand menthol  filtered standard king size cigarette   
▪ Product C : 4 mg Nicotine polacrilex gum ( Nicorette® White Ice  Mint ™) 
A pharmacodynamic measure (“use product again ” visual analog scale [VAS]) will be administered at 
the end of each ad libitum product use period . Product use behaviors (i.e.,  number of units  consumed,  
duration of gum in mouth) will be collected throughout each ad libitum product use period.  
Upon completion of Part A, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups in 
Part B, which will consist of  3 study days (Days 4 to 6), with one product per day. Each study day will 
consist of : 1) Controlled Product Use Session (10 puffs from their own -brand menthol cigarette or 
VLN  menthol  cigarette [maximum 3  ± 2 seconds per puff]  at approximately  30 ± 5-second interpuff 
intervals, or chew the nicotine polacrilex gum using the “chew and park ” method for 10 minutes); and 
2) Uncontrolled Product Use Session (ad libitum use for 10 minutes). The Controlled Product Use 
Session and Uncon trolled Product Use Session will be separated by approximately 6 hours. During 
Part B, pharmacodynamic measures, PK, and product use behavior (Uncontrolled only) will be 
collected at various time points each day (See Table  1).  
Safety assessments  including adverse events  (AEs) , physical examinations, vital signs (respiratory rate, 
pulse rate, blood pressure, and oral temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory tests 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), and urine drug and alcohol screens w ill be 
collected at designated time points throughout the study. Subjects will be  discharged from the clinic on 
Day 6, once all  procedures are completed  (or at Early Termination).  
Number of Subjects  (Planned):  
An appropriate number of subjects  will be randomized on Day 1 (Part A) to ensure that a minimum of 
54 subjects complete the study. Replacement subjects may be enrolled to ensure that the minimum 
number of subjects complete the study.  
Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:  
Subjects will be required to meet each one of the following inclusion criteria in order  to be eligible for 
participation in the study:  
1. Must provide written informed consent prior to the initiation of any protocol -specific 
procedures.

A linear mixed effects m odel for analysis of variance/ covariance (Proc Mixe d) will be  performed on 
Emax_ urge(controlled)  and E max_plst(controlled) . The model will include  Emax as the response variable, sequence, 
study product, and period as fixed model effects, baseline score as a covariate (for E max_urge only) and 
subject nested -within sequence as a random effect. Sequence will be tested using subject  nested -
within -sequence as the error term. L east square mean (LSM) and 95% confidence interval  (CI) for each 
Study Product group will be provided. Comparisons will be  made for Product A vs . B, A vs. C and  B 
vs. C. The comparison between Product A and Product C  will be  used as a comparison for internal 
validity . The LSM  difference, p value and 95% CI of the difference will be provided.  
The same model will be used for E max_urge(uncontrolled ) and E max_plst (uncontrolled ), and all E max of other questions 
in the Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal Questionnaire and Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire for the 
controlled and uncontrolled  product  uses in Part B.  
Product use behavior  will be summarized by product using descriptive statistics.  
Pharmacokinetics : 
Descriptive statistics of plasma nicotine concentrations will be tabulated by time point for each study 
product and product use condition. Derived PK parameters (both unadjusted for baseline and baseline -
adjusted)  will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summaries and individual data will be 
provided for plasma nicotine -adjusted concentrations.  
A linear mixed model for analysis of variance (Proc Mixed) will be performed on the baseline -adjusted 
log transformed nicotine PK parameter s in Part B . The model will include sequence, study product, and 
period as fixed effects and subject nested within sequence as a random effect. Sequence will be  tested 
using subject nes ted-within sequence as the error term. From each  model , the geometric LSM and 95% 
CI will be calculated for each  study product. Separate analyses will be performed on the parameters 
calculated for the controlled  and uncontrolled  product use  sessions . Geome tric mean ratios for each 
pair comparison, 95% CI and p value will be provided.  
The same linear mixed effect model as used for the analysis of C max( controlled ) will be  used for 
Cmax( uncontrolled ) of second product use in Part B, and  for AUC following all product uses.  The Hodges -
Lehmann ’s method will be used to estimate the median differences and the 95% CI of T max and T ½ 
between the product s.

 5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background  
With the introduction  of the  2009  Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was granted the authority to regulate tobacco products 
including the nicotine content of cigarettes. In July 2017, FDA Commissioner  Scott Gottlieb, 
M.D., announced the FDA’s intention to limit nicotine in cigarettes to minimally or non -
addictive levels. During his announcement, Dr. Gottlieb stated that it has long been known that 
nicotine is the primary addictive component of cigarett es and that if smokers lose their addiction 
to cigarettes, they will be free to choose when and how often to smoke.  A key component in the 
FDA’s announced plan is to provide current smokers who are unable or unwilling to quit using 
nicotine with other, les s harmful , means to obtain it. In other words, to provide a migration route 
away from traditional cigarettes to other types of tobacco or nicotine products such as cigarettes 
based on heat not burn technology, traditional smokeless, Snus, or electronic nic otine delivery 
system (END S) products.  
Historically, tobacco harm reduction initiatives have focused on efforts to prevent or reduce 
tobacco initiation rates, increase quit rates , and decrease recidivism. The proposed r educ tion of 
nicotine  cigarettes is believed to represent a viable policy tool to impact cigarette initiation rates 
and cigarette quit rates . Studies conducted to date indicate that reducing the nicotine content of 
cigarettes to non -addictive levels would potentially limit the reinforcing  effects of cigarettes. A 
number of recent studies  suggest s that cigarettes with very low nicotine (VLN) content are 
associated with a positive set of outcome s, including reduc tions in the number of cigarettes  
smok ed, reduction s in nicotine exposure  and nicotine dependence, increase d abstinence from 
smoking, reduced exposure to toxicants , and fewer adverse events  (AEs)  (Rupprecht et al., 2017  
; Donny et al ., 2007 ; Donny et al., 2015 ; Benowitz et al., 2007 ; Benowitz et al.,  2009 ; Benowitz 
et al.,  2012 ; Hatsukami et al., 2013 ). These studies  evaluate d cigarettes with nicotine content 
ranging from 0.4 to 15.8 mg nicotine per g ram of tobacco  with the typical combustible cigarette 
tobacco content ranging from approximately 8  mg to 20  mg.   
The cigarettes included in the reported studies were man ufactured by 22nd Century Group , Inc. 
under contract to RTI/ National Institute on drug Abuse (NIDA) .  22nd Century Group , Inc. is 
currently evaluating the commercial potential of a menthol and non -menthol VLN  cigarette (0.4 
mg nicotine/gram of tobacco) . It is anticipated that these cigarettes will provide similar benefits 
to a consumer that switches from their usual brand to the VLN cigarette as those reported in the 
literature (Rupprecht et al., 2017 ; Donny et al., 2007 ; Donny et al., 2015 ; Benowitz et al., 2007 ; 
2009 ; 2012 ; Hatsukami et  al., 2013 ).  
5.2. Study Rationale  
The purpose of the current study is to provide an abuse liability assessment of VLN mentholated 
cigarettes compared with own -brand mentholated cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum in 
current manufactured filtered king size cigarette smokers , as recommended in “ FDA  Draft 
Guidance for Industry Modified Risk T obacco Products ( March 2012 )”. Results of this study

 7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Study Design  and Plan  
This study will be a randomized,  two-part, 3-way crossover designed to evaluate the abuse 
liability, PK, and product use behavior associated with study products, including VLN 
mentholated  cigarettes, subje cts’ own-brand mentholated  cigarettes, and nicotine polacrilex gum in 
healthy adult male and female exclusive smokers. The study will consist of 3 phases: Screening, 
a Confined Assessment  Phase consisting of product training session , Part A, and Part B , and an 
End of Study  Phase .  
7.1.1.  Screening  Phase  (Visit 1)  
The Screening Phase will be completed during a clinic  visit within 28 days of the Confined 
Assessment P hase and will consist of a standard medical screen . 
7.1.2.  Confined Assessment Phase (Visit 2)  
7.1.2.1.  Check -in and Product  Trial (Day -1) 
Subjects who successfully complete the Screening Phase will return to the clinical unit on Day -1 
for check-in and to complete a product trial session. Subjects will engage in a 10-minute product  
training session with the nicotine polacrilex gum in order to familiarize themselves with the 
“chew and park ” method , which requires subjects to chew the gum until they experience a 
tingling sensation, park the gum between the cheek and gum until the tingling subsi des, and then  
begin chewing again. On Day -1, subjects will also complete a training session on the 
pharmacodynamic  questionnaires. Subjects will be required to abstain from using nicotine - and 
tobacco -containing products for approximately 20 hours prior t o each product use session in Part 
A. 
7.1.2.2.  Part A (Day 1 to 3)  
On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups in Part A, which 
will consist of an ad libitum product use session of each of the following study products for 4 
hours i n a randomized crossover manner (one product per day):  
▪ Product A: VLN menthol cigarette  
▪ Product B: Own -brand menthol cigarette  
▪ Product C: Nicorette® White Ice  Mint ™ 
A pharmacodynamic measure (“use product again ” visual analog scale [V AS]) will be 
administe red at the end of each ad libitum product use period and product use behaviors (i.e.,  
number of units consumed, duration of gum in mouth ) will be collected throughout each ad 
libitum product use period  (See Table  1).

Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 20 of 62  
 7.1.2.3.  Part B (Day 4 to 6)  
Upon completion of Part A, subjects will be randomized to one of three  product sequence groups 
in Part B, which will consist of  3 study days (Days 4 to 6), with one product per day. Each study 
day will consist of : 1) Controlled Product Use Session (10 puffs from their own -brand menthol 
cigarette  or VLN  menthol  cigarette [maximum 3 ± 2 seconds per puff] at approximately 30  ± 5-
second interpuff intervalsa, or chew the nicotine polacrilex gum using the “chew and park ” 
method for 10 minutes); and 2) Uncontrolled Product Use Session ( use of one unit of a product 
ad libitum for 10 minutes). The Controlled Product Use Session and Uncontrolled Product Use 
Sessio n will be separated by approximately 6 hours. During Part B, pharmacodynamic measures, 
PK samples , and product use behavior (Uncontrolled  Product Use Session  only) will be collected 
at various time points each day (See Table  1). 
Safety assessments, including AEs, physical examinations, vital signs (respiratory rate, pulse 
rate, blood pressure, and oral temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical lab oratory tests 
(clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology), urine drug screen (UDS) , and alcohol 
test will be collected at designated time points throughout the study.  
7.1.3.  End of Study or Early Termination  
Subjects will be discharged from the cl inic on Day 6 once all procedures are completed (or at 
Early Termination).  
The maximum duration of subject participation, including Screening will be approximately 5  
weeks.  
An overview of the study design is provided  in Figure  1. 
Study assessments and procedures will be performed at the visits and time points outlined in the 
Schedule  of Assessments ( Table  1). 
 
a In the event that the subject completes the cigarette in less than 10 puffs, no additional cigarette will be provided.

 7.2. Discussion of Study Design  
The overall study design i s consistent with similar publicly  available clinical studies conducted 
with cigarettes, non -combustible nicotine products (i.e., e -cigarettes) or nicotine replacement 
therapy in that it will be conducted using a randomized, cross -over design . This approach 
controls for inter -individual variability with each subject acting as his/her own control ( Vansickel 
et al., 2010 ; McPherson et al., 2016 ; Stiles et al., 2017 ). Randomization will be used to avoid 
bias in the assignment of subjects to order of product use, to increase the likelihood that known 
and unknown subject attributes (e.g., demograph ics and baseline characteristics) are evenly 
balanced across groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across groups.  
Subjects will be healthy current co mbustible manufactured filtered king size menthol cigarette 
smokers , using their own -brand of menthol cigarettes as the positive control . This should serve 
as the most highly reinforcing product for cigarette smokers  and is more representative of a 
“real-world ” scenario . Consistent with the “continuum of risk” of tobacco a nd nicotine products , 
which suggests that nicotine replacement therapies provide a lower risk of abuse  (Fagerstrom 
and Eissenberg, 2012 ), addiction and harm  relative to combustible cigarettes , this study will also 
include  nicotine polacrilex gum as the negative control comparator . Nicotine polacrilex gum  has 
been shown to have low to moderate reinforcing effects compared with combustible cigarettes 
(Stiles et al., 2017 ). Although  traditional  abuse liability studies of pharmaceutical products 
include a placeb o comparator, the nature of the products in the current study will be apparent to 
the subjects , therefore , it is not possible to implement a true placebo control . Rather , the study 
includes b oth a positive and a negative control to test the sensitivity of the model , and to achieve 
a direct relative comparison  of the abuse liability of VLN mentholated cigarettes to own -brand 
mentholated cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum.  
The current study will include a pre -specified period of abstinence prior to each study product 
administration day (approximately 20 hours  in Part A and prior to controlled -use session in Part 
B, and 6 hours between controlled and uncontrolled -use sessions  in Part B ) to minimize the 
impact that residual nicotine concentrations may have on baseline pharmacodynamic , PK and 
physiological measurements. Consistent with previously published studies, the current study will 
include an ad libitum product use session , which will allow the subject to use the product as they 
would in a “real-world ” scenario with no limitation on amount of product used , for up to 4 hours . 
Controlled and uncontrolled product use session s are also included in order  to compare the 
pharmacod ynamic  effects and patterns of use under condition s where subjects are instructed on 
how to use the product (i.e., [maximum 3 ± 2 seconds per puff] at approximately  30 ± 5-second 
interpuff intervals ) versus how they would use the product in a typical situa tion.  
The current study will use measures of urge to smoke, positive effects, intent to use the product 
again, and negative effects as proxy measures for the relative reinforcing efficacy of VLN 
mentholated cigarettes , own-brand mentholated cigarettes  and 4 mg nicotine polacrilex gum . The 
ability of the VLN mentholated cigarettes to satisfy the urge to smoke over the short term will be 
assessed using the “Urge to Smoke” question in the Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal Questionnaire 
measure and positive effe cts will be assessed using the “ Is the product ‘Pleasant ’ right now? ” 
question in the Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire ; both will be administered as 100 -point

 VAS . The “ Use Product Again” bipolar VAS has been included at the end of the ad libitum us e 
session  in Part A and 90 minutes after product use in Part B to evaluate overall reinforcement 
effects of the test products. Additional subjective effects will be assessed with “at -the-moment” 
VAS ( Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire , Tobacco/Nicotin e Withdrawal  Questionnaire) 
during the Controlled and Uncontrolled Use Sessions to evaluate the magnitude, onset, and offset 
of product effects and withdrawal symptoms during and after controlled use of the study 
products.

▪ Product  B: Subjects ’ Own -brand menthol filtered standard king size cigarette s (reference 
product)   
▪ Product C:  Nicorett e® White Ice  Mint ™ nicotine polacrile x gum (4 mg; reference 
product)  
9.2. Identity of Investigational Product (s) 
The VLN menthol cigarettes will be provided by the Sponsor. Subjects will supply their own -
brand  menthol  cigarettes with 2 unopened packs (20 cigarettes/pack x 2). The nicotine polacrilex 
gum will be acquired by the study site pharmacy. The study site will coordinate shipping of the 
study products from the Sponsor.  
9.2.1.  Handling, Storage, and Accountability  
Study products  (not including own-brand  menthol  cigarettes)  will be transported, received, 
stored, and handled strictly in accordance with the container or p roduct label, the instructions

Appropriate storage temperature and transportation conditions will be maintained for the study 
product  from the point of manufacture up to delivery of the product .  
9.2.2.  Dispensing  and Administration  
Individual study product dispens ing records  will be maintained by the site pharmacy for each 
subject. Study products for  dispensing to subjects will be prepared each day. Fresh packs of 
cigarettes will  also be used each study day from which the cigarettes will be provided (Product A 
and Product B). For product use on Days 1 through 3, the pharmacy will maintain  records of the 
number of VLN and own -brand menthol  cigarettes  or nicotine polacrilex gum  pieces dispensed 
for each subject.  
Opened and unopened packages of VLN menthol cigarettes a nd nicotine polacrilex gum products  
will be returned to the Sponsor or destroyed at the direction of the Sponsor. All  returns or 
destruction of study products will be documented. Unused subjects ’ own-brand  menthol  
cigarettes may be returned to subjects at End of Study  or Early Termination.  
9.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Study  Groups  
Each potential subject will be assigned a unique number in the screening process ( subject 
number). This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study.  Algorithme

CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 32 of 62  
 Pharma Inc. will prepare the randomization schedule  with a computer program according to the 
study design, the number of subjects and the sequence of product use .  
On Day 1 , subjects will be randomized to one of three  sequence  groups (ABC, BCA,  CAB , 
where A = VLN menthol cigarette , B=subject ’s own -brand  menthol  cigarette; and C= nicotine 
polacrilex gum ), with approximately the same number of subjects per sequence group . On Day 4, 
subjects will be re -randomized into one of three  sequence  groups ( ABC, BCA, CAB) , with 
approximately the same number of subjects per sequence group .   
9.4. Selection and Timing  of Product Use  
First product administration will occur in the morning on each study day (Day s 1 through 6), 
after approximately 20 hours of nicotine abstinence.  Subjects will be segregated in different 
areas of the facility based on the product that they are receiving so that odors and sight of 
products will not interfere with the subjects ’ assessments.  
9.4.1.  Part A (Days 1 to 3)  
On each of the 3 days, subje cts will use only one of the 3 study products according to their 
randomization sequence. No other use of tobacco - or nicotine -containing products will be 
allowed from check -in on Day -1 through to End of Study discharge except as required by this 
protocol,  and subjects will be instructed to not bring to the study site any form of tobacco - or 
nicotine -containing products except 2 unopened packs of their own cigarettes.  
9.4.1.1.  Product A: VLN  Menthol  Cigarettes  
Subjects will be assigned an unopen ed pack of VLN mentho l cigarettes. They will be presented 
to the subjects unbranded. Subjects will have open access to the cigarettes and may smoke the 
cigarettes as desired  during the 4 -hour session . Study staff will record the number of cigarettes 
dispensed, time dispensed , and number of butts returned.  
9.4.1.2.  Product B: Own -brand Menthol Cigarettes  
Subjects will be assigned a n unopened  pack of their own -brand menthol  cigarettes. Subjects will 
have open access to the cigarettes and may smoke the cigarettes as desired  during the 4 -hour 
session . Clinic staff will record the number of cigarettes dispensed, time dispensed, and number 
of butts returned.  
9.4.1.3.  Nicotine Polacrilex Gum  
Subjects will be assigned unopened  pack of 4 mg nicotine polacrilex gum. Subjects will have 
open access to nicotine polacrilex gum and may chew the gum as desired  during the 4 -hour

 9.4.2.  Part B (Days 4 to 6)  
On each of the 3 days, subjects will use only one of the 3 study products according to their 
randomization sequences. No other use of tobacco - or nicotine -containing products will be 
allowed.  
9.4.2.1.  Product A: VL N Menthol Cigarettes  
During the first product use session (i.e., Controlled Use), subjects will take 10 puffs of one of 
the VLN menthol cigarettes at approximately 30 -second intervals  (± 5 seconds) based off the 
start of inhalation , inhalation duration  will not exceed 3  ± 2 second s per puff . The clinic staff will 
indicate to the subjects when to start each inhalation at each 30 -second interval, will document 
the total number of inhalations (if less than 10) and any reasons for missed inhalations.  During  
the second product use session (i.e., uncontrolled use), subjects will smoke one VLN  menthol  
cigarette ad libitum for 10 minutes and the clinic  staff will document the total number of 
inhalations and the duration of inhalations.  The used butts may be disc arded after adequate 
accountability has been completed.  
9.4.2.2.  Product B: Own -brand Menthol Cigarettes  
During the first product use session (i.e., Controlled Use), subjects will take 10 puffs of one of 
their own -brand menthol cigarettes at approximately 30 -second intervals (± 5 seconds) based off 
the start of inhalation, inhalation duration will not exceed 3 ± 2 seconds per puff . The clinic staff 
will indicate to the subjects when to start each inhalation at each 30 -second interval, will 
document the total number of inhalations  (if less than 10) and  any reasons for missed inhalations. 
During the second product use session (i.e., Uncontrolled U se), subjects will smoke one own -
brand menthol cigarette ad libitum for 10 minutes and the clinic staff will document the total 
number of inhalations and the duration of inhalations . The used butts may be discarded after 
adequate accountability has been completed.  
9.4.2.3.  Product C: Nicotine Polacrilex Gum  
During the first product use session (i.e., Controlled Use), subjects will  chew the 4 mg nicotine 
polacrilex gum product according to the package instructions: The gum is to be chewed slowly 
until a tingling sensation is felt in the mouth, “parked ” between the cheek and gum until the 
tingling sensation subsides, and then resume chewing. Subjects will follow this chewing regimen 
for the 10 -minute product use session. During the second product u se session (i.e., Uncontrolled 
Use), subjects will chew the nicotine polacrilex ad libitum for 10 minutes. The chewed gum may 
be discarded upon completion of each product use session, after adequate accountability has been 
completed.  
9.5. Meal Schedule  
On Day -1, meals and snacks will be served at appropriate times as determined by the clinic 
based on the time of Check -in. Standard meals will be s erved on Days 1 to 3.  
Subjects will be served a light breakfast each morning and must complete breakfasts on the 
mornings of Days 4 to 6 at least 1 hour prior to the first study product use session. The breakfast 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.

Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 34 of 62  
 menu should be consistent (same menu items ) on Days 4 to 6. Lunch, dinner, and snacks will be 
served at appropriate times as determined by the study site, with lunch scheduled to be served at 
some point after completion of the final blood draw of the first product use session or end of the 
ad libi tum session on each day.  
Subjects may not consume beverages of any kin d during each Controlled and Uncontrolled 
Product Use S ession on Days 4 to 6.  Water will be provided in 125 mL increments at the 
discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects will also be pe rmitted to consume hard candy during the confinement period at the 
discretion of the investigator. Hard candy will not be permitted during any product use sessions 
in Part A or Part B.  
Fasting requirements and dietary restrictions are described in Section 8.4. 
9.6. Blinding  
The study design is not blinded since subjects will know if the product is a VLN menthol 
cigarette , their own menthol cigarette or a nicotine polacrilex gum . The study product codes w ill 
be open to all study staff and to the Sponsor.  The randomization code will not be available to the 
personnel of the bioanalytical facility until the bioanalytical tables have been finalized and 
audited by the Quality Assurance (QA) department.  
9.7. Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications, including prescription, over -the-counter, or herbal therapies  used by the subject s 
will be documented for the 30 days prior to Screening and throughout the study. An investigator  
will determine if the prior/concomitant medication(s) affect the subject ’s eligibility to participate 
or continue to participate in the study.  
On a case -by-case basis, an investigator  is permitted to allow the use of some concomitant 
medicatio ns, for example, to treat an AE, as long as an investigator  determines that the 
medication will not affect the subject’s safety or study integrity (e.g., topical medications).  
Wherever possible, an investigator  should obtain approval from the Sponsor’s medical monitor 
prior to administering the medication.  Stable doses ( i.e., no dosage adjustments within 30 days 
prior to Day -1) of prescription or over -the-counter medications required to treat an investigator -
approved disease or condition will be permitt ed at the discretion of an investigator .  
9.8. Product  Compliance  
Study products  will be administered under the supervision of study personnel , and compliance 
with protocol -specified procedures during the Controlled Use S essions will be monitored by 
study personnel.

 10. STUDY PROCEDURES AND  ASSESSMENTS  
All study assessments will be p erformed at the visits and time points outlined in the Schedule of 
Assessments  (Table  1); the following sections outline the details and procedures associated with 
the assessments.  Other logistical considerations (e.g., sequence of events, assessment windows) 
will be outlined in study -specific procedures.   
10.1. Demographics  and Other Ba seline Characteristics  
10.1.1.  Informed  Consent  
The nature of the study and its risks and benefits will be explained to the subject by an 
investigator  or designated study personnel . The subject  must provide written informed consent 
on an ethics -approved informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any study -related 
procedures. A copy of the ICF will be provided to the subject.  
10.1.2.  Demographics  
The following demographics will be recorded: age (birthdate),  sex, race, and ethnicity.   
10.1.3.  Medical History  
The c omplete medical history will include histories of acute, chronic, or infectious disease; 
surgical or oncologic histories; and any reported conditions affecting major body systems. All 
findings o n medical history will be evaluated by an investigator  for clinical significance. Medical 
histories will be obtained according to the site ’s standard operating procedures.  
10.1.4.  Medication  and Smoking History  
All medications (prescription and non -prescription, herbal medications/natural health products, 
or investigational drugs) taken by the subjects during the 30 days prior to Screening will be 
recorded in the source documentation as medication history.   
A history of  tobacco use/history and smoking history will  be recorded for each subject.  
DSM -IV-TR modules will be included as a part of the recreational drug/alcohol use history and 
used to screen for alcohol and substance dependence.  
10.2. Pharmacodynamic Measures  
On Day -1, subjects will complete a training session  during which they will complete  the 
subjective questionnaires in order to familiarize themselves with the questions, appropriate use 
of the V AS, and use of the computerized tablet system.  
10.2.1.  Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal Scale  
The Tobacco/Nicotine Withdrawal i tems are administered as 100 point V AS, and are intended to 
measure withdrawal symptoms and craving  (adapted from Hughes & Hatsukami , 1986 ; 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 36 of 62  
 Appendix  17.2.1 ). The VAS is anchored with “Not at All” on the left and “Extremely ” on the 
right. The questionnaire items are as follows:  
1. Urges to Smoke  
2. Anxious  
3. Difficulty Concentrating  
4. Impatient  
5. Craving a Cigarette  
10.2.2.  Direct Effects of Product Questionnaire  
The Direct Effects of Product items are administered as 100 point V AS, and are intended to 
measure the effects of the product being sampled at the moment  (Appendix 17.2.2 ). The V AS is 
anchored with “Not at All” on the left and “Extremely ” on the right. The questionnaire items are 
as follows:  
1. Is the product “Pleasant ” right now?  
2. Is the product “Satisfying ” right now ? 
3. Is the product making you feel “Calm ” right now ? 
4. Is the product helping you “Concentrate ” right now ? 
5. Is the product making you feel more “Awake ” right now ? 
6. Is the product making you feel “Sick” right now?  
7. Is the product reducing you r “Hunger ” for food right now?  
8. Would you like “More ” of the product right now?  
Items are  selected based on measures of product effec ts used in previous trials with tobacco 
products  and conventional cigarettes  (Hanson, Connor &  Hatsukami 2009 ).  
10.2.3.  Use the Product Again Questionnaire  
The Use the Product Again questionnaire is a bipolar 100 point V AS used to assess how much a 
subject would be willing to use the sampled product again  (Appendix 17.2.3 ). The V AS is 
anchored by “Definitely Would Not” on the left and “Definitely Would” on the right; t he neutral 
point is also labeled with an anchor (“Don’t Care”). The VAS is adapted from the Take Drug 
Again V AS administered in human abuse potential studies of pharmaceutical products  (Griffiths, 
Bigelow  & Ator, 2003 ).  
10.2.4.  Product Use  
Number of own -brand menthol cigarettes and VLN menthol cigarettes smoked  and number of 
nicotine polacrilex gum pieces chewed and duration of gum in mouth will be recorded during the 
ad libitum product use sessions in Part A.  During the Uncontrolled Use Sessions in Part B, 
number of inhalations and dura tion of each inhalation  will be recorded  for own -brand menthol 
cigarettes and VLN menthol cigarettes ; duration of gum in mouth will be recorded  for nicotine 
polacrilex gum .

 10.3. Safety Assessments  
10.3.1.  Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
An investigator  and research site staff are responsible for the detection, documentation, 
classification, reporting, and follow -up of events meeting the definition of an AE or serious 
adverse event (SAE). All AEs will be recorded following informed consent (at Screening) until 
the End of Study (or the required follow up period for a specific AE or SAE) .  
10.3.1.1.  Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
product and may not necessarily have a causal relationship with the administered treatment. An 
AE can , therefore , be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant 
laboratory abnormality), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not relat ed to the investigational product. During the study, 
an AE can also occur outside the time that the investigational product(s) was given (e.g., during a 
washout period). Pre -existing conditions, diseases, or disorders are not considered AEs unless 
there is  a change in intensity, frequency, or quality.  
10.3.1.2.  Serious Adverse Events and Serious Unexpected Adverse Events  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any product use : 
▪ Results in death;  
▪ Is life -threatening (at the time of the event);  
▪ Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
▪ Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or  
▪ Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or requi re 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse product  experience when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the study subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the def inition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A serious and unexpected AE is an SAE that is not identified in nature, intensity, or frequency in 
the risk information generally known for nicotine gum and cigarettes.  
Any SAE —expected or unexpected, irrespective of relationship to study treat ments, including 
death due to any cause —experienced by a study subject  will be reported  to 22nd Century Inc. or 
designee by an investigator  within 24 hours of learning of the event. Information regarding the 
SAE will be transmitted to 22nd Century Inc. or designee, as follows:

22nd  Century Inc. or designee assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the 
regulatory authorities. 22nd Century Inc. or designee will also report to an investigator all SAEs 
that are unlisted and associated with product use . The investigator (or 22nd  Century Inc. , where 
required) must report these events to the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB) that 
approved the protocol (unless otherwise required and documented by the IRB). Follow -up 
evaluations for SAEs will also be reported to 22nd Centu ry Inc. or designee.  
10.3.1.3.  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments  
Abnormal clinical laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis) or 
other abnormal assessments (e.g., from vital signs or ECG), judged as clini cally significant by an 
investigator  will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, if they meet the definitions provided previously. 
Abnormal laboratory or other findings present at baseline that significantly worsen following the 
start of the study will be reported as  AEs or SAEs. However, abnormal findings present at the 
start of the study that do not worsen will not be reported as AEs or SAEs, unless an investigator  
or designee judges them as more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition.   
10.3.1.4.  Classification of A dverse Event Intensity and Causality  
For each recorded AE or SAE, an investigator must make an assessment of intensity based on the 
following criteria:  
Mild:  An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment 
or therapeutic intervent ion. The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate:  An event that is alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to 
the subject . 
Severe:   An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention. The event 
interrupts usual activities of daily living or significantly affects clinical 
status. The event poses a significan t risk of harm to the subject  and 
hospitalization may be required.  
An investigator  must make an assessment of causality based on the following criteria to 
determine the relationship between the AE/SAE and study product : 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 39 of 62  
 Unrelated:  Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes (e.g., disease, 
environment, etc.) and does not meet the criteria for study product  
relationship listed under probable, possible, or unlikely.  
Unlikely:  ▪ Does not follow a reasonable temporal seque nce from 
administration of the study product ;  
▪ May readily have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ;  
▪ Does not follow a known pattern of response to the study  product ;  
▪ Does not reappear or worsen when the product is used again . 
Possible:  The connection to the product  appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with 
certainty:  
▪ Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study product ; 
▪ May ha ve been produced by the subject ’s clinical state, 
environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; 
▪ Follows a pattern of r esponse to the suspected study product . 
Probable:  The connection to the product  can be made with a high degree of certainty:  
▪ Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study product ; 
▪ Cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
subject ’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administered to the subject ;  
▪ Disappears or decreases upon cessation or reduction in use of the 
product  (note that there are important exceptions when an AE or 
SAE does not disappear upon discontinuation of use the study 
product, yet  relatedness to study product clearly exists, e.g., bone 
marrow depression or tardive dyskinesias);  
▪ Follows a known pattern of response to the study product ; 
▪ Reappears upon re -challenge.  
 
10.3.1.5.  Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All unresol ved AEs will be followed for a minimum of 14 days after the subject ’s final Study 
Day, unless an investigator ’s judgment dictates otherwise, the event has resolved or stabilized 
before the 14 -day period, or the subject  is lost to follow -up.  
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 40 of 62  
 All AEs that result in discontinuation and SAEs will be followed until the event resolves, 
stabilizes (according to the judgment of an investigator ), returns to a baseline value (if a baseline 
value is available), or can be attributed to agents other than the study product  or to factors 
unrelated to study conduct.  
When it becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (e.g., subject  or health 
care practitioner refuses to provide additional information, the subject  is lost to follow -up), an 
investigator  or designee will ensure that the follow -up includes any pertinent supplemental 
investigations (e.g., laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or 
consultation with other health care professionals) to elucidate the nat ure and/or causality of the 
AE or SAE.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in former study subject s that occur 
following the AE or SAE Follow -up period. However, if an investigator  learns of any AE or SAE 
at any time after a subjec t has been discharged from the study and the event is considered as 
reasonably related to the study product , an investigator  will notify 22nd  Century Inc . 
For each recorded AE or SAE, an investigator  must make an assessment of outcome at the time 
of last observation, as follows:  
Fatal:  The subject  died.  
Resolved  The AE or SAE has ended.  
Resolved with 
Sequelae  The AE or SAE has ended but changes are noted from baseline.  
Unresolved – 
Ongoing:  The AE  or SAE  has not ended and is ongoing at the end of the 
reporting period (i.e., 14 days after the final Study Day ) and an 
investigator  deems that further follow up is not medically required  
Unresolved – Lost to 
Follow:  Lost to follow -up after repeated unsuccessful attempts to contact the 
subject . 
10.3.2.  Pregnancy  
If a subject  becomes pregnant during the study or for 14 days after the final Study Day , an 
investigator  will report the pregnancy to 22nd  Century Inc. or designee within 24 hours of 
learning of the event. Any subject  who becomes pregnant during  the study will be immediately 
withdrawn from the study.  
Follow -up information will be obtained where possible (with the consent of the subject  or their 
partner) regarding the course and outcome of the pregnancy, including any pos t-natal sequelae in 
the infant . 
10.3.3.  Clinical Laboratory  Assessments  
Blood and urine samples will be collected, processed, and shipped according to the research 
site’s standard operating proced ures and instructions from the saf ety laboratory. Samples will be

 10.5. Appropriateness of Measures  
The selection of abuse liability measures in this study, including the primary end points of “Urges 
to Smoke” and “ Pleasant ” E max during the Controlled Use Session  are consistent with previous 
studies of this type. The Use the Product Again VAS is being used as this is thought to indicate 
the subject’s willingness to use the product agai n and to reflect the user’s overall impression of 
the product. Other subscales of the Tobacco/Nicotine  Withdrawal Questionnaire and the Direct 
Effects of Product Questionnaire will measure positive, negative and other subjective effects 
including craving to assess the subjective effects of the products for comparative purposes.  
Measures of product use behavio r have been included during the ad libitum session s and the 
Uncontrolled Use S ession s in order to evaluate the amount and duration of product used under 
both conditions.  
Standard safety assessment s have been included to evaluate the safety profile of VLN menthol 
cigarettes . PK blood sampling  has been included to evaluate the PK profile of nicotine following 
controlled and uncontrolled use of VLN  menthol  cigarettes , in comparison with own -brand 
menthol cigarettes and nicotine polacrilex gum .

 11. DATA QUALITY ASSURAN CE 
This study will be conducted under Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory 
requirements. To ensure compliance, the Sponsor or designee ma y conduct a quality assurance 
audit, as outlined in Section 11.2.  
Actions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified 
Investigators and appropriate study centers; the review of protocol procedures with an 
investigator  and study personnel prior to study start; the design of suitable source documents 
with appropriate instructions for use (where applicable); the internal audit of source data 
according to GCP and internal procedures to ensure their accuracy, completeness, and 
verifiability; as well as the periodic site monitoring by the Sponsor. Written instructions will be 
provided for collection, preparation, and shipment of blood, plasma, and urine samples. The 
Sponsor or designee will review source documents for accurac y and completeness during on -site 
monitoring visits and after their return to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved  with an 
investigator , as appropriate.  
Significant and/or repeated non -compliance will be investigated , and remedial action instit uted 
when appropriate. Failure to comply with remedial actions may result in investigator  site 
termination and regulatory authority notification.  
11.1. Data Collection  
Source documents include but are not limited to original documents, data and records such as 
hospital/medical records (including electronic health records), clinic charts, lab results, subject  
diaries, data recorded in automated instruments, microfilm or magnetic media, and pharmacy 
records, etc. This study will use electronic data capture (EDC) o r paper case report forms 
(CRFs ). At a minimum, all data required by the protocol should have supporting source 
documentation for entries in the EDC system, unless that data can be recorded directly in the 
EDC system or other device.  
All CRFs will be completed by the site staff prior to review by the Sponsor ’s monitor or 
designated representative. The Sponsor ’s monitor or designated representative will review all 
source records on -site and compare them to the data collected on the CRF.  All entries, 
corrections, and alterations will be made by an investigator  or other authorized study personnel. 
All data entries will be verified for accuracy and correctness by independent monitors. The EDC  
system maintains a full audit trail.   
11.2. Study Auditing and Monitoring  
Monitoring of the study site (including, but not limited to, reviewing CRFs for accuracy and 
completeness) will be performed by the Sponsor ’s monitor. The extent, nature, and frequency of 
on-site visits will be based on such conside rations as the study objectives and/or endpoints, the 
purpose of the study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate. By signing the protocol, an 
investigator  agrees that, within local regulatory restrictions and institutional and ethical 
consideration s, authorized representatives of the Sponsor, a regulatory authority, and/or an IRB 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.

 may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including the product  storage area, study 
product  stocks,  product  accountability records, subject  charts and source doc uments, and other 
records related to study conduct. The purpose of the Sponsor audit or inspection is to 
systematically and independently examine all study -related activities and documents to 
determine whether the study -related activities were conducted, a nd data recorded, analyzed, and 
accurately reported according to the protocol, the site ’s standard operating procedures, GCP 
guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), and any applicable 
regulatory requirements.  An investigator  should contact the Sponsor immediately if contacted by 
a regulatory  agency regarding an inspection .

 12. STATISTICAL  METHODS AND DETERMI NATION OF 
SAMPLE SIZE  
12.1. Statistical and Analytical  Plans  
Complete details of the statistical analyses to be performed will be docu mented in a statistical 
analysis plan  (SAP) , which will be finalized  prior to completion of the study . This document will 
include more detail of analysis populations, summary strategies, and any amendments to the 
proposed analyses listed here, if necessary. Any changes to the SAP will be outlined in the final 
study report.  
12.2. Determination of Sample Size  
Sample size estimation was performed on both pharmacodynamic endpoints.  
Using a 2-sided Type I error rate at α=0.05 and assuming a mean difference in E max_urge(controlled) 
between own -brand  menthol  cigarette and nicotine polacrilex gum of 15.85 points and  standard 
deviation  (SD) of 28.44, 54 completed subjects will be required to detect a significant difference 
between own -brand menthol  cigarette and nicotine polacrilex gum with greater than 80% power.  
Using a 2-sided Type I error rate at α=0.05 and assuming a  mean difference in Emax_plst (controlled) 
between own -brand menthol  cigarette and nicotine polacrilex gum of 35.21 points and SD of 
31.82, estimate based on data obtained from the study site, 16 completed subjects will be 
adequate to detect a significant d ifference between own -brand menthol  cigarette and nicotine 
polacrilex gum with greater than 80% power.  
An appropriate number of  subjects will be randomized on Day 1 (Part A) to ensure that a 
minimum of 54 subjects complete the study. Replacement subjects may be enrolled to ensure 
that the minimum number of subjects complete the study.  
12.3. Analysis Populations  
The study analysis popul ations will consist of  
▪ Randomized P opulation  (Part A) : All subjects who are randomized into Part A.  
▪ Randomized P opulation  (Part B) : All subjects who are randomized into Part B.  
▪ Safety Population:  All randomized subjects who use at least one of the study products.

nicotine -adjusted concentrations.  
A linear mixed model for analysi s of variance (Proc Mixed) will be performed on the baseline -
adjusted log transformed nicotine PK parameters in Part B. The model will include sequence, 
study product, and period as fixed effects and subject nested -within sequence as a random effect. 
Seque nce will be tested using subject nested -within sequence as the error term. From each 
model, the geometric LSM and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for each study 
product. Separate analyses will be performed on the parameters calculated for the Controlled and 
Uncontrolled Use sessions. Geometric mean ratios for each pair comparison, 95% confidence 
interval and p value will be provided.  
The same linear mixed effect model as used for the analysis of C max(controlled) will be used for 
Cmax(uncontroll ed) of second product use in Part B, and for AUC following all product uses. The 
Hodges -Lehmann ’s method will be used to estimate the median differences and the 95% 
confidence interval of T max and T ½ between the products.

 13. STUDY ADMINISTRATION  AND INVESTIGATOR 
RESPONSIBILITIES  
Additional details may be outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA) between the Sponsor 
and the investigational site.  
13.1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
13.1.1.  Ethical Conduct of the Study  
An investigator  will conduct the study in accordance with GCP and  all applicable regulations, 
including, where applicable, the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will also be carried out in 
keeping with applicable national and local laws and regulations. This may include an inspection 
by the Sponsor ’s representatives an d/or regulatory authority ’s representatives at any time.  
13.1.2.  Regulatory Authority and Ethics Approval  
The investigational site ’s IRB must meet all relevant regulatory requirements. The study protocol 
and ICF will be reviewed by the IRB prior to enrolling subje cts into the study; written approval 
from the committee must be received by the Sponsor before study product  will be released to an 
investigator .  An investigator  is responsible for submitting all protocol or ICF cha nges and SAE 
reports to the IRB accordin g to local procedures.  
In accordance with applicable local regulatory requirements, an investigator  may be obligated to 
provide periodic safety updates on the conduct of the study at his /her research site and 
notification of study closure to the IRB. Such  periodic safety updates and notifications are the 
responsibility of an investigator  and not of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will be provided with 
copies of all notifications sent to the IRB.  
All relevant correspondence from the IRB will be forwarded by the re spective study site to the 
Sponsor in a timely fashion.  
13.1.3.  Subject Informed Consent  
An investigator  (or authorized designee) will ensure that the subject  (or the subject ’s legal 
representative) is given full and adequate oral and written information about the  nature, purpose, 
potential and possible risks and benefits of the study. Each prospective subject will receive an 
IRB-approved ICF that summarizes the pertinent study information and will be given ample time 
to read the form and ask questions about the st udy. All information is to be provided in a 
language understandable to the subject  and must not include any language that waives the 
subject ’s legal rights. Prospective subject s must also be informed of their right to withdraw 
consent without prejudice at any time during the study. If the subject  chooses to participate, 
he/she must sign and date the ICF before any study -related procedures are performed. The time 
of signing will be recorded on the ICF  
Significant changes to the protocol or product safety information may require a revision of the 
ICF, which must be reviewed and signed by all applicable study subject s. 
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 53 of 62  
 The time that informed consent is obtained must be documented. An investigator  must mai ntain 
the original, signed ICF in the subject ’s source documents. A copy of the signed ICF must be 
given to the study subject . 
13.2. Privacy and Confidentiality  
An investigator  is responsible for complying with applicable privacy regulations, per his or her 
jurisdiction. Only information identified in this protocol will be collected. The information 
collected will only be used for the purposes identified in this protocol.  
To ensure anonymity and to limit disclosure, subject s will be assigned a unique identifier a t their 
first assessment. This identifier will be cross -referenced in the subject ’s chart. The identifier will 
not contain any potentially identifiable information. An identifier log will be maintained, linking 
each subject ’s name to the corresponding iden tifier. This log will be stored at the research site in 
a secure location.  
The knowledge gained through this study is the property of the Sponsor. The Sponsor, 
representatives and affiliated companies of the Sponsor, the IRB, and regulatory agencies (such 
as the United States FDA ) may inspect medical records related to the study to check the validity 
and accuracy of the data gathered in this study. Subject  medical records (with subject ’s initials 
and/or date of birth) may be copied. Confidentiality of subje ct records will be maintained except 
where release of information is required by law.  
The results of this study will be reported in such a manner that subject s will not be identifiable in 
any way. Published reports or presentations will refer to grouped d ata or coded individual data 
and not to any identifiable individuals. Study reports sent to the Sponsor or drug regulatory 
agencies will not include subject  names.  
By signing the ICF, the subject  consents to the collection, access, use, and disclosure of h is or her 
information as described in the ICF document. If a subject  withdraws consent, some of the 
subject ’s information may still be collected, used, and disclosed by those involved in this study, 
per applicable laws.  
By signing this protocol, an invest igator  affirms that he /she will maintain in confidence 
information furnished to him or her by the Sponsor and will divulge such information to his or 
her respective IRB or Independent Ethics Committee under an appropriate understanding of 
confidentiality w ith such board. All data will be considered the sole property of the Sponsor. 
Please refer to the CSA for details.  
13.3. Study and Site Closure  
Upon completion of the study, all study data will be provided to the Sponsor following review of 
site study records for completeness, and data clarifications and resolutions. Accounting, 
reconciliation, and final disposition of used and unused study products will be performed, as 
applicable.  
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 54 of 62  
 In addition, the Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this 
study at any time and for any reason. If such action is taken, the Sponsor will discuss this with an 
investigator  (including the reasons for taking such action) at that time. The Sponsor will 
promptly inform any other investigator s and/or institutions conducting the study, if the study is 
suspended or terminated for safety reasons and will inform the regulatory authorities of the 
suspension or termination of the study and the r eason(s) for the action. If required by applicable 
regulations, an investigator  will inform the IRB promptly and provide the study subject s with the 
reason for the suspension or termination. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study data 
will be returned to the Sponsor.  
13.4. Regulatory Documents and Records Retention  
An investigator  is responsible for creating and/or maintaining all study documentation required 
by 21 CFR 50, 54, 56 and 312, ICH E6 section 8, as well as any other documentation defined in 
the protocol or CSA. An investigator  must provide key documents to the Sponsor prior to the 
start of the study .  A complete list of required regulatory documents will be supplied by the 
Sponsor or its representative.  
Federal and local regulations requir e that an investigator  retain a copy of all regulatory 
documents and records that support the data for this study for whichever of the following is the 
longest period of time:  
▪ A period of 2 years following the final date of approval by the FDA or other reg ulatory 
agency of the study product for the purposes that were the subject of the investigation; or  
▪ A period of 5 years following the date on which the results of the investigation were 
submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agency in support of, or as p art of, an 
application for a research or marketing permit for the study product  for the purposes that 
were the subject of the investigation.  
The Sponsor will notify investigator s once one of the above two timeframes has been satisfied.  
If the investigation  does not result in the submission of the data in support of, or as part of, an 
application for a research or marketing permit, records must be retained for a period of 2 years 
following notification by the Sponsor that the entire clinical investigation (n ot merely an 
investigator ’s portion) is completed, terminated, or discontinued.  
If an investigator  retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will ac cept the 
responsibility. The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian. Study records should not be destroyed without consultation with the Sponsor.  
13.5. Delegation of Responsibilities and Adequate Resources  
An investigato r should have adequate time to conduct the study properly and should have an 
adequate number of qualified staff to assist with the conduct of the study.  
Clinical Trial Protocol  22nd Century Group, Inc.  
CEG -P1-078 CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version: Final  1.0, 04APR2018  Page 55 of 62  
 The term “investigator ” used throughout this protocol refers to the principal investigator  and/or 
qualified sub -investigator s. However, the investigator may delegate responsibilities to other 
investigational site personnel. An investigator  shall delegate tasks only to individuals qualified 
by education, training and experience to perform the delegated tasks. An investigator  shall have 
direct oversight of all delegated activities and shall document delegation of responsibilities. An 
investigator  is responsible for ensuring all delegated staff have been properly trained on the 
protocol and their assigned study responsibilities. A delegation log identifying all delegated 
duties and the individual to whom they have been delegated will be maintained at the 
investigational site.  
13.6. Protocol Amendments  
Approval of a protocol amendment by an investigator ’s IRB mus t be obtained before 
implementation of the protocol amendment, unless a change is necessary to eliminate an 
apparent immediate hazard to the subject  or when the change involves logistical or 
administrative aspects of the study. The protocol amendment must be signed and dated by both 
the Sponsor and an investigator . The Sponsor or designee will submit protocol amendments to 
the appropriate regulatory authorities, if required.  
13.7. Financial Disclosure  
Clinical investigator s are required to provide financial discl osure information for the submission 
of certification or disclosure statements required under 21 CFR § 54. As defined in 21 CFR § 
54.2, a clinical investigator  is a listed or identified investigator  or sub -investigator  who is directly 
involved in the treat ment or evaluation of research subject s. The term also includes the spouse 
and each dependent child of an investigator . In addition, investigator s must promptly update 
financial disclosure information if any relevant changes occur during the course of the 
investigation and for 1 year fo llowing completion of the study .

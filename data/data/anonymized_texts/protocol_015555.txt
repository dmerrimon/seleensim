1 Prior to any study related procedure
2Results of a MRI or CCT -scan have to be available before visit 2. Please refer to exclusion #1 (section 3.3.3 )for further details.
3The baseline vital signs (supine pulse rate after 5 minutes of rest and systolic/diastolic blood pressure) wi ll be measured before the first 
dose is taken and at 70-110 minutes post dose . Additional supine pulse rate assessments will be performed at the time points of post -dose 
PK sampling given in table 10.1.1:1 until 70-110minutes post -dose ( See section 5.2.5 .2and section 6.2 for details).
4At all visits, the respective kit number has to be allocated to the patient via I RT
5Only for patients with antidiabetic therapy (see section 6.2 for details) .
 
8Local urine pregnancy test (or blood test if re quired by local regulations) in women of child bearing potential. More frequent testing may 
be performed if required by local regulations.
9 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale baseline/screening scale
10 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale baseline since -last-visit scale
11Also to be completed for patients who are withdrawn or who have discontinued the trial early: in case of early termination vi sit 7should 
be performed no later than 7 days after the last study drug intake (visit FUfour weeks later).
12 Ifthe assessments at visit 4a do not show clinically relevant findings compared to baseline and if deemed clinically acceptable by the 
investigator then visits 4b and 4c may be performed as phone contacts. Attendance of the study partne r is not necessarily required during 
visits 4 a -c. ECG and vital signs are only to be performed at clinic visits.
13Lumbar puncture or PET scans should only be performed after general eligibility is most probably given based on medical status and 
results 
of neuropsychological screening assessments. Results from CSF sampling or PET scans must be available before start of visit 2
(run-in period). CSF samples collected in the past 4 months prior to informed consent can be considered for use in the study and f or 
further details please refer to section 3.3.2 , section 5.6.1 and appendix 10.2 . Results of a PET scan performed in the past according to the 
recommendations in section 5.3.2.1 can be used .
14The neuropsychological assessments may be done on the day before the randomisation visit (last day of the screening period) i f agreed 
between site staff and patient. I n any case it needs to be ensur ed that the recommendations for the conduct of the neuropsychological 
assessments (refer to section 6.2 for details) are followed.
15Back -up test for patients that do not reach the required scores in FSCRT

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic progressive mental disorder, is the most common cause 
of dementia and accounts for 50 to 70 % of all cases. AD is mainly  a disorder of the elderl y; 
however it can also affect patients below the age of 60. More than 36 million people (R14-
0163 )in the world are currentl y affected b y dementia, most of them suffering from AD, with 
around 5 million new cases occurring every  year (R10-5095; R10- 5106). The age - specific 
prevalence of AD almost doubles every  5 years after age 65. Among developed nations, 
approximately  1 in 10 elderly  people (65+ y ears) is affected by  dementia to some degree, 
whereas more than one third of th e very  old people (85+ y ears) may  have dementia-related 
signs and s ymptoms (R10-5105).
In the prodromal stage of the disease ,clinical symptoms may include impairment of episodic 
memory  and/orother cognitive domains, like executive function, orientation and judgment. 
Patients with t hese prodromal clinical sy mptoms showed an increased riskof developing 
Alzheimer ’sdementia with progressive decline in the ability  to perform activities of daily  
living and the appearance of behavioral c hanges and/or psy chiatric s ymptoms (mood 
disturbances, hallucinations, personality  changes). Subsequently and in accordance with the 
further progression of the disease there is an increasing utilization of resources and medical 
care finall y leading to the need for full-time assisted living or nursing home care before 
death. The median time from onset of sy mptoms to death is estimated to be arou nd 10 y ears.
The pattern of cognitive and functional decline is not uniform over the course of the disease 
and differs according to the measure in question and the scales used. Cognitive decline, for 
example, seems to be more rapid in the moderate and seve re stages than in the mild and very  
severe stages, yielding a sigmoid curve of progression.
On the cellular level ,AD is characterized by  a progressive loss of s ynapses and neurons. 
Affected transmitter s ystems mainly  include cholinergic and glutaminergic neurons. 
Glutamate as the major excitatory  neurotransmitter in the human brain is most prominently  
associated with functions of memory  formation and learning. Glutaminergic transmission is 
mediated by various receptors with the post- synaptic N-methy l-d-aspartate (NMDA )receptor 
playing an essential role. Upon activation, a cascade of intracellular, post -synaptic signaling 
events is triggered through elevation of second messengers such as cAMP and cGMP with 
subsequent activation of protein kinases and manife station of long -term potentiation (L TP) 
and sy naptic plasticity . LTP is regarded as a validated phy siological model for cellular 
processes underl ying learning and memory  formation ( R10-5109; R10- 5092; R10- 5102).
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI409306 - a potent selective phosphodiesterase 9 (PDE9A) inhibitor –is being developed 
for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment associated
with schizophrenia (CIAS).

Clinical safety
In health y volunteer trials [U12-1034 -01, U13 -1182 - 01, U12 - 2165-01 , U13-1303 -01, 
c02098989-02] , the most frequent drug related adverse events were visual side effects (such 
as sensation of flashing lights, altered color percepti on, photophobia / increased sensitivity  to 
light or blurred vision) that occurred shortl y after dosing and mostly resolved within 1 h, i.e., 
in close connection to maximum BI  409306 plasma concentrations as the concentration- time 
profile sharpl y and steep ly peaks within the first 1 -2 hours and then rapidly declines 
afterwards. Overall, there were no relevant changes observed for laboratory, ECG recordings, 
and vital signs following treatment with BI 409306 when compared to placebo. Only  a rapid 
and short l asting increase in supine pulse rate of 12.9 ± 4.4 bpm was detected in Chinese 
CYP2C19 poor metabolizers subjects treated with BI 409306 (100 mg single dose) in study  
1289.4 [ c02098989-02]. Following this observation, pharmacometric analysis of all available 
human data revealed a BI 409306 plasma concentration dependent increase in supine pulse 
rate reaching a maximum of 7 -13 bpm (median) at high exposure end in CYP2C19 poor 
metabolizers treated with BI409306 at 100 mg. The maximum ef fects of BI 409306 on pulse 
rate were generally  achieved at maximum BI  409306 plasma concentrations (20 -30 minutes 
post dose) and disappeared rapidl y with declining concentrations. Altogether, good to 
satisfactory  safet y and tolerability were observed in single doses of BI 409305 (up to 350mg 
in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EM); up to 100mg in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers 
(PM)) in health y young volunteers and multiple doses (14 days up to 100mg EM/50mg PM) 
of BI 409306 in healthy  young and elderl y subjects. None of the safet y data presented a 
safet y issue for further clinical trials.

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
Currently  approved AD treatment is purel y symptomatic. Registered s ymptomatic treatment 
consists of acet ylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE- Is) and memantine. AChE -Is in general and 
donepezil in particular can be currently  regarded as gold standard for treatment of mild -to-
moderate DAT and is considered as reference drug. This treatme nt isn’t approved for 
prodromal stages of the disease. 
Prodromal AD 
isdescribed as a slight but noticeable and measurable decline in cognitive 
abilities, including memory and thinking skills. These declines of functional capabilities in 
patients with pro dromal AD are not severe enough to allow the diagnosis ofdementia
according to the current guidelines . However, those with prodromal AD have an increased 
risk of eventuall y developing Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, a s ymptomatic treatment that 
delay s the progress of these first symptoms cause dby the underl ying pathology might 
provide a substantial benefit to such patients.
In addition to the ongoing efforts in the development of more effective s ymptomatic 
treatment options, new compounds with a disease- modify ing potential are in the center of 
interest in the AD research field. However, no drug with a proven disease modify ing potential 
is presently  available. Furthermore, it cannot be expected that a putative disease modify ing 
drug would have the potentia l to restore lost cognitive function. Therefore, a sy mptomatic 
treatment that proves to be more efficacious than the currently  available compounds (AChE -
Is, memantine) in improving both existing cognition deficits and the ability to better perform 
activiti es of daily  living would provide a substantial benefit to patients.
The study  is designed to compare the effects of 4 different doses of orally  administered BI 
409306 to placebo (see section 3.2 for further details) because there is no approved treatment 
for prodromal AD available so far.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The p rimary  objective of this study  is to assess efficacy  and safety  of BI 409306 at doses of 
10mg, 25 mg and 50 mg once dail y, 25 mg twice daily  compared to placebo over a 12- week 
treatment period in male andfemale patients at least 55 y ears of age with prodromal AD who 
have not received prescribed drugs for treatment of AD including acety l cholinesterase 
inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, phenserine) a nd memantine) within 
three month sprior to screening .The criteria for inclusion of these patients will consist of an
MMSE score of 24or higher , an CDR -score of 0 or 0.5 ,andan FCSRT score of 20 or lower 
for the 
free recall and of 42 or lower for the total recall and, if the FCSRT fails; performing
the Wechsler Memory  Visual Paired Associates test. Evidence of A -ß and tau protein 
pathology in the brain 
is based on measurements in CSF or ,alternativel y,onamyloid 
deposition in PET scan. The study  endpoints are listed in section 5.1.1.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
The currently  available safet y data, including first results from a recentl y performed phase I 
trial with single doses orally
 administered up to 350 mg in health y subjects, indicate that 
BI409306 has a broad safety  margin and is well tolerated. 
In summa ry, the toxicological profile of BI 409306 is characterised b y cardiac effects which 
seem to be consistent with those described for phosphodiesterase inhibitors in general. All 
adverse effects were generall y restricted to high dose levels and were reversib le. It is 
recommended to carefully  monitor cardiac function in clinical trials. 
Consistent with the FDA draft guidance entitled "Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: Prospective 
Assessment of Occurrence in Clinical Trials", prospective assessment of suicidal i deation and 
behavior is included in this study  using the C -SSRS.
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  is under constant surveillance by
sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study  requires timely  detection, evaluation and
follow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laborato ry parameters to ensure patient
safet y.
This is an experimental drug at an earl
y stage of testing and therefore an individual benefit 
canno t be guaranteed. Only  patients who have not received prescribed drugs for treatment of 
AD including acet yl cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, tacrine, 
phenserine) and memantine) within three month sprior to screening will be included in this 
trialof short 
duration. Therefore, the assignment to the placebo arm is not associated with a 
higher risk for the patient .Also all study  procedures (e.g. AD assessment, safet y and 
suicidality  monitoring etc.) may  be a benefit for the patient e.g. intensive medical care , a 
potentially  better knowledge of the underly ing disease which may  lead to a better handling of 
this disease. As stated above prodromal AD has an increased risk for developing into AD. 
AD is not reversible and can last more than 20 years. Even if there i s no direct benefit for the 
patient during participation in this trial ,it can be assumed that the trial results may  contribute 
to better drug development in future. In addition due to the long duration of AD the patient 
may directl y benefit from the drug development based on the results of this trial.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is a 12- week, multi -center, randomi zed, double -blind, double dummy  placebo 
controlled, parallel group study  in patients with prodromal AD .
In total, 288 patients with prodromal AD who meet the entry  criteria are planned to be 
randomiz ed in this trial. The randomi zed treatment will be double blind. Each patient will 
receive active treatment with BI 409306 (each patient will receive one active treatment and 
placebos to match the alternative active treatment) or placebos (each patient will receive 
placebos to match each of the active treatments).
After obtaining informed consent, patients will undergo ascreening pe riodofa maximum of
5weeks . All patients who successfull y complete the screening period and are eligible for the 
study , then enter a minimum of 2 weeks of single blinded placebo run- in before 
randomization. 
Patients who successfully  complete the single -blinded phase and who fulfil both the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria will be randomiz ed to the 12 -week double blind treatment period at 
visit 3 and will be assigned to one of the 5 treatment groups namely : once daily  (QD) 10 mg, 
25mg, or 50 mg BI409306, or 25 mg BI 409306 twice dail y (BID), or placebo.
Figure 3.1:1 Study  design
After the end of the double
-blind treatment period ,patients will be followed up for an 
additional 4weeks without study  medication. Patients will be evaluated for efficacy  at 
randomization
, at visit 5 (week 4) and at visit EOT (week 12 ). Safet y will be formall y 
evaluated at each visit until end of the observational period which is 28 days after end of 
treatment or for an appropriately  longer time in case of unresolved adverse events.

The trial is sponsored b y Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). Boehringer Ingelheim will appoint a 
Trial Clinical Monitor (TCM), responsible for coordinatin g the activities required in order to 
manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOPs), directing the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct and reporting 
of the trial, order the materials as needed for the trial, ensures appropriate training and 
information of local clinical monitors (CML s), CRAs and investigators in participating 
countries. 
Data management and statistical evaluation will be done b y BI according to BI SOPs. For 
these act ivities, a Trial Data Manager and a Trial Statistician will be appointed. Tasks and 
functions assigned in order to organize, manage, and evaluate the trial will be defined 
according to BI SOPs. A list of responsible persons will be given in the Clinical Tr ial Master 
File (CTMF) document.
 has been selected as a
service provider to support the following tasks related to the neurops ychological assessments: 
rater prequalification, rater training (online and at investigator meeting), provision of rater 
materials and central review of assessments (see section 5.1.2 and section 8.2 for details).
A central laboratory  and central ECG service vendor will be used for this trial. The 
organization of the trial in the participating countries will be done by  the respective local BI 
organization (OPU) or by  a Contract Research organization (CRO) with which the 
responsibilities and tasks have been agreed and a written contract has been filed before 
initiation of the clinical trial. I n each local BI -organisation (OPU) participating in this study , 
a local clinical monitor (CML ) will be appointed who will be responsible for coordinating the 
activities re quired in order to manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and 
internal SOPs in the countries covered b y the respective BI OPU.
A Coordinating Investigator will be nominated to coordinate investigators at different sites 
participating in this multi -centre trial. Tasks and responsibilities for the Coordinating 
Investigator will be defined in a contract filed before initiation of the trial. Documents on 
participating (Principal) investigators and other important participants as defined in t he 
monitoring manual , especially  their curricula vitae, will be filed in the CTMF.
The Investigator Site File (I SF) will be kept at the sites as far as required by local regulations 
and BI SOPs. A cop y of the I SF documents will be kept as an electronic Cl inical Trial Master
File.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
All patients who successfully complete screening and are eligible for the study will undergo a 
single blinded placebo run- in phase in order to generall y fami liarize with the clinical setup of

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.A parallel group design is the appropriate design as the inherent within -patient variability  and 
the pro gressive nature of the disease makes it difficult if not impossible to employ  a cross-
over design .
To assess a comparative benefit/risk ratio treatment BI 409306 patients will randomly  be 
allocated to one of 4 active doses or placebo onl y in a 1:1:1:1:2 ratio (for rational eof 
allocation of treatments refer to section 7.1 and for justification of doses refer to section 
4.1.3 ).
In order to estimate the absolute drug effect on cognition and function, a double -blind 
comparison against placebo is included in this trial. With this approach we follow the EMA 
guideline on medical products for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias 
(CPMP/EWP/553/95 Rev. 1, 2008).
The current standard treatment of cognitive and functional impairment in AD shows 
substantial treatment effects during the first three months of treatment. Therefore, a 12 -week 
treatment period is considered to also be sufficient to assess the efficacy , safet y and 
tolerability  of BI 409306 in prodromal stages of this disease.
The data collected in this double- blind, randomized, placebo -controlled trial are standard in 
diagnosed Alzheimer ’sdisease and therefore regarded to also provide important i nformation 
in terms of efficacy , safety  and tolerability  on the use of BI 409306 maintenance treatment in 
patients with prodromal AD.
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
About 1000 patients will be screened for the stud y in approximately  12 countries. About 60 
study  centres will be particip ating to ensure approximately  288 patients are randomised to 
study  treatment .
Recruitment will be competitive and participating sites are expected to randomi ze at least 288
patients. Patients who fail to complete all assessments in terms of primary  and sec ondary  
endpoints according to the study  protocol will not be considered study  completers (see 
section 6.2and section 7.3for details). Patients wh o discontinue following randomi zation 
may not be re -enrolle d at a later date. A record is kept of all patients failing to complete all 
trial visits and their reasons for discontinuation. 
This trial (1289.5) investigates patients with cognitive impairment caused by the Alzheimer’s 
disease. In parallel BI is investigating the effect of BI 409306 in patients with mild 
Alzheimer’s dementia in the study  1289.7. It is expected that both trials s hare a high 
percentage of trial sites. The Mini Mental Stage Examination (MMSE) evaluates the severit y 
of cognitive impairment and t his assessment is used in both trials as part of the eligibility  
assessments with the following requirements:
1. 1289.5 – MMSE score ≥ 24
2. 1289.7 – MMSE score ≥ 18 - 26

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Patients who do not reach the required scores of ≥24 in MMSE and CDR total score 0 or 0.5
are not eligible for this study  and must be registered as screen failure in IRT. If the result of 
the MMSE and CDR fulfill t he requirements of the parallel trial 1289.7 and the patient and 
his study  partner agree to alternativel y participate in 1289.7 after giving a new consent then 
the results of the MMSE and CDR can be transferred into the database of 1289.7 without 
repeated performance of the MMSE and CDR and vice versa. This prevents the risk of 
unwanted learning effects which would be a consequence of repeating the MMSE and CDR 
in the same patient . This rule only  applies if the screening visit for 1289.7 is no later than 7 
days after the MMSE/CDR for 1289.5 was performed. The patient will then be registered as a 
new patient in the IRT of 1289.7. This does not apply  to sites participating in only  one of the 
1289.5/1289.7 studies.
Permission to randomi ze more than 15 patients per site must be obtained in writing from the 
TCM at Boehringer Ingelheim. This will only  be allowed after a careful review of the 
enrolment status.
Re-screening of not yet randomised patients can be allowed in exceptional cases bu t should 
be discussed on a case -by-case basis between the study  site, Monitor staff and with the TCM .
A log of all patients included into the study  (i.e. having given informed consent) will be 
maintained in the ISF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.
3.3.1 Main diagnosis for study entry

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.4.1.2 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
Patients eligible for the trial will be assigned at random to one of the five treatment groups at 
Visit 3 by Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Details on randomiz ation are provided in 
section 7.5. Assignment and drug supply  management of study  drug will be done via IRT. 
Note that the medication numbers assigned to the patient by  the IRT are different from the 
patient number; each medication box has a different medication number. The patient number 
is assigned at study  entry, i.e. signing informed consent at Visit 1.
To facilitate the use of IRT, each stud y site will receive an information manual describing the 
steps to randomiz e a patient, to obtain a medication kit assignment and to acknowledge 
receipt of stud y medication. The manual will be part of the ISF. Medication kits (including 
single blinded placebo run- in kits) will be assigned at Visits 2, 3, 5and 6for each patient.
The access to the randomization codes will be controlled, documented and limited to a pre -
specified group of users in order to ensure the blinding of the treatments groups .
4.1.3 Selection of doses in the trial
BI409306 has been tested in animal models to assess cognitive effects. On the basis of the 
described mode of action and the presented experimental efficacy  in these animal memory  
tests, peak levels of BI 409306 in CSF in the range of 1x PDE9 I C50 need to be t argeted for 
memory  enhancing efficacy  in humans. In a PoC study  in health y volunteers [ U12-2165-01 ], 
it was shown that BI 409306 is able to cross the human blood- brain barrier (plasma to CSF) 
with a concentration corresponding to IC 50 (65 nmol/L) in CSF reached at 25 mg in 2 out of 
4 subjects and exceeded IC 50 in all subjects at the higher doses. CSF exposure to BI 409306 
increased with increasing dose and the CSF to plasma ratio for BI 409306 Cmax in humans is 
comparable to the one observed in rats and is constant over the entire dose range tested. CSF 
concentration -time profiles of BI 409306 peak approx. 0.5 to 1 hour later than in plasma and 
decline mono -exponentially  and roughl y in parallel to plasma concentrations afterwards wit h 
BI 409306 concentrations in CSF decreasing bey ond the quantification limit (0.5 nmol/L ) 
after 8 to 14 hours post dosing. 
Therefore, the 25mg dose is anticipated to be the effective dose and will be tested once daily  
(QD) and twice dail y (BID). To study the dose -response relationship, a lower dose (10mg) 
and a higher dose (50mg) will also be tested. For further details to the preclinical data as well 
to the human proof of mechanism study , please refer to the current version of the IB [ U11-
1079].
Patie nts will be randomiz ed to one of five treatment groups as follows during the treatment 
period :
BI 409306 10mg QD (Treatment Group 1)
BI 409306 25mg QD (Treatment Group 2)
BI 409306 50mg QD (Treatment Group 3)
BI 409306 25mg BID (Treatment Group 4)
Placebo (Treatment Group 5)

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
All patients who fulfil both inclusion and exclusion criteria until visit 2 will be assigned to a 
single blinded placebo run- in kit at the beginning of the run -in period (Visit 2) .
The medication assignment will be provided through IRT. The assigned medication number 
must be entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding medication kit must be given to the 
patient. The amount of trial medication dispensed and returned will be recorded on drug 
accountability  forms. 
IRT will allocate medication kit numbers at Visit 2, 3, 5 and 6. 
For blinding reasons all treatments will consist of two tablets of active drug or placebo for the 
morning dose and one tablet of active drug or placebo for the evening dose depending on the 
treatment arm. This will not be changed during the entire stud y.
During the run -in period patients will take 3 placebo tablets daily  (2 tablets in the morning 
and 1 tablet in the evening) to mimic the dosing schedule during thetreatment period.
Following the run -in period patients will be randomiz ed (Visit 3) to one of the 5 treatment 
arms as outlined in figure 3.1:1
The first dose of the study medication will be taken at visit 2 under supervision of the 
investigator or site staff. At all applicable clinic visits the investigational drug will be taken 
during the visit under supervision of the investigator or relevant s ite staff. The actual visit 
date and time of stud y drug administration at the trial visit will be recorded in the eCRF.
Patients should be instructed to take the tablets orally  with water at approximately  the same 
time every  day in the morning and in the e vening with or without food .If a dose is missed by  
more than 4hrs, that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken as scheduled. 
No double doses should be taken and dose reductions are not permitted. Patients should be 
instructed to bring al l unused drug and empt y study  blister / bottles to the study  site.
Patients should be instructed not to take their study  medicati on on the morning of visit day s. 
Patients are allowed to have a light breakfast/meal before the scheduled visit . Patients who 
erroneousl y take the morning dose of stud y medication before coming to the clinic at visit 6 
should have the visit rescheduled as soon as possible, ideally  on the following day  
 The actual date and time of administrat ion of the medication at 
the trial visit will be recorded in the eCRF.
4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for un-blinding
4.1.5.1 Blinding
Administration of the placebo run -in will be single blinded, meaning patients will not know 
during which period of the tri al they  will be receiving placebo.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.This trial incorporates a double -blind, double -dummy  trial design, meaning that t reatments 
are indistinguishable according to the scheme as shown in Table 4.1:1 . Placebo tablets are 
identical in th e size and appearance to the corresponding active tablet and are combined with 
active drug tablets as needed in each treatment group to maintain the blinding.
After randomi zation at visit 3, patients, investigators and every one involved in analy sing or 
with a potential interest in this double -blind trial will remain bli nded with regard to the 
randomiz ed treatment assignments until after database lock. However, due to the 
requirements to report Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), it m ay 
be necessary  for a representative from BI’s drug saf ety group to access the randomiz ation 
code for individual patients during trial conduct. In such cases, access to the code will onl y be 
permitted by  authorised drug safet y representatives. Access to the code will be via the I RT 
system.
The randomiz ation code will be kept secret by  clinical trial s upport at BI up to database lock. 
The access to randomization codes will be controlled, documented and limited to a pre -
specified group of users who are not in volved into the capturing, processing and evaluation of 
the clinical data unless defined differentl y or in case of an emergency  in order to ensure the 
blinding of the treatments. For details of the rules of breaking the codes in case of an 
emergency  refer tosection 4.1.5.2 . The random code will be transferred to the trial data 
manager onl y after the Blinded Report Planning Meeting (BRPM) and after locking of the 
trial database.
The randomiz ation codes will be provided to the sponsor ’s bioanal yticdepartment prior to 
last patient out to allow them to perform appropriate pharmacokinetic analy tical 
determination. Bioanaly tics’will not disclose the randomiz ation code or the results of their 
measurements until the study is official ly unblinded. Prior to unblinding of the trial database , 
any pharmacokinetic results or data may  only  be communicated in a way  that does not 
provide an y direct or indirect link between patient number and treatment.
4.1.5.2 Procedures for emergency  unblindi ng
The IRTwill be available for the unblinding of patients by the investigator in an emergency  
situation.
Detailed information on the IRTun-blinding procedures is described in the IRTmanual that 
will be provided to the sites. The code break may  only  be performed in emergency  situations 
when the identity  of the trial medication must be known to the investigator in order to provide 
appropriate medical treatment or if required to assure the safet y of trial participants.
The reason for un-blinding must be do cumented on the appropriate e -CRF page and in the 
patient source data.
If possible , the m onitor must be contacted and informed prior to the site un-blinding a
patient's treatment.

Wechsler Memory  Scale verbal delay ed (score r ange, 0 -8)
RAVL T delay ed (score range, 0 -30). The RAVLT delay ed measure is composed of 
delay ed recall and recognition performance components that are summed to y ield a 
score ranging from 0 to 30.
Raw scores on each of the 9 NTB tests will be converted to z-scores using the baseline means 
and standard deviations (SDs) for each test. The resultant z -scores will be averaged to obtain 
a total z -score, incorporating all 9 NTB tests [R13-2645 ].
ADCS -MCI -ADL
This is a functional scale based on the information provided b y an informant/caregiver that 
describes the performance of patients in several activities of daily  living for MCI  patients.  
This is a 24 item scale with 6 items related to complex abilities.  The su m score could range 
from 0 to 69.  Higher scores indicate better function [ R13-2647 ].
CDR-SB is obtained through semi structured interviews of patients and informants, and 
cognitive functioning is rated in 6 domains of functi oning: memory , orientation, judgment 
and problem solving, community  affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Each domain 
is rated on a 5 -point scale of functioning as follows: 0, no impairment; 0.5, questionable 
impairment; 1, mild impairment; 2, mode rate impairment; and 3, severe impairment (personal 
care is scored on a 4 -point scale without a 0.5 rating available). The CDR -SBscore is 
computed [R03-0748 ].
ADAS -cog/11 is an 11- item cognitive subscale that objectively  measures memory , language, 
orientation and praxis with a total score range of 0 to 70 [ R96-2608 ].

5.2 SAFETY
5.2.1 Endpoint(s) of safety
No additional study  specific important safet y endpoints will be assessed in this study .
5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.2.1 Definitions of adverse events
Adverse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence, including an 
exacerbation of a pre -existing condit ion, in a patient in a clinical investigation who received a 
pharmaceutical product. The event does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which resul ts in death, is immediately  
life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs 
patient hospitalisation, is a congenital anomaly  / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for 
any other reason if it is an im portant medical event when based upon appropriate medical 
judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may  require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Intensit y of adverse event
The inten sity of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . Assessment of causal relationship should be recorded in the case report forms. 
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administer ed and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE. 
If a SAE is reported from a still blinded trial, the causal relationship must be provided b y the 
investigator for all potential t rial drugs, i.e. the BI trial drug and for all other trial drugs (i.e. 
any active comparator or placebo according to the trial design).
Worsening of the underly ing disease or other pre- existing conditions (except worsening of 
suicidal ideation and behavior)
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions will be recorded as an 
(S)AE in the (e)CRF.
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination, and laboratory  test results
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination a nd laboratory  test results will be 
recorded as an (S)AE in the (e)CRF , if they  are judged clinicall y relevant by the investigator.
Protocol -specified Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury  defined by the alterations of liver parameters as defined below : 
oan elevation of AST and/or ALT >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample.
Patients showing these lab abnormalities need to be followed up according to Appendix 10.4
of this clinical trial protocol and the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF.
Adverse Events of Special Interest are to be reported in an expedited manner similar to 
Serious Adverse Events, even if they  do not meet any  of the seriousness criteria –for details 
please see section 5.2.2.2 .

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.5.2.2.2 Adverse event and serious adverse event rep orting
All adverse events, serious and non -serious, occurring during the course of the clinical trial 
(i.e., from signing the informed consent onwards through the REP/follow -up period) will be 
collected, documented and reported to the sponsor by  the invest igator on the appropriate 
CRF(s) / eCRFs / SAE reporting forms. Reporting will be done according to the specific 
definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event Reporting’ section of the 
Investigator Site File.
For each adverse event, the inves tigator will provide the onset date, end date, intensity , 
treatment required, outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug. The 
investigator will determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as defined in 
section 5.2.2.1 . 
If a patient reports a change in visual perception or any  vision -related AE, site staff must 
record the patient’s verbatim description in the source documents to be reported in the eCRF. 
A local ophthalmology  assessment will be required if any  visual AE that is rated as moderate 
or severe b y the subject or at the discretion of the PI . The ophthalmologist will act as a 
consultant to the I nvestigator and may  offer advice on the proper management and treatment 
for the reacti on.
The residual effect period (REP) for BI 409306 is 7 days and hence the time period for which 
adverse events will still be considered on- treatment, is 7 day sfollowing last intake of trial 
medication. All adverse events will be reported up until the last per protocol visit (follow -up 
visit) which is 28days after the last dose of trial medication. The investigator does not need 
to actively  monitor patients for adverse events once the clinical trial has ended. However, if 
the investigator becomes aware of an SAE(s) that occurred after the patient has completed the 
clinical trial (including any  protocol required REP and / or follow -up), it should be reported 
by the investigator to the sponsor if considered relevant.
If not stipulated differently  in the ISF, the investigator must report the following events 1) if 
using paper process SAE form via telephone/fax or 2) if available for the trial, using the 
electronic submission process (RDC) immediately  (within 24 hours) to the sponsor: SAEs 
and non -serious AEs relevant to the SAE(s) and Adverse Events of Special Interest.
BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In order to support the 
investigator with the identification of these “alw ays serious adverse events”, if a non- serious 
AE is identified to be serious per BI definition, a query  will be raised. The investigator must 
verify  the description and seriousness of the event. If the event description is correct, the item 
“serious” needs to be ticked and an SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion following the 
same procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be found via the RDC- system.
The SAE form is to be forwarded to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI OPU 
(country -specific contact details will be provided in the I nvestigator Site File) or by  using the 
electronic submission process. This immediate report is required i rrespective of whether the

also applies if new information to existing SAEs or Adverse Events of Special Interest 
becomes available. 
Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in clinical trials. Once a female subject has been 
enrolled into the clinical trial, after having taken study  medication, the investigator must 
report immediatel y any drug exposure during pregnancy  to the sponsor. Drug exposure 
during pregnancy  has to be reported immediately  (within 24 hours or next business day  
whichever is shorter) to the defined unique entry  point for SAE forms of the respective BI 
OPU (country -specific contact details will be provided in the I nvestigator Site File) . The 
outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up. In the absence of an (S)AE, onl y the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical 
Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. The I SF will contain the Preg nancy  
Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and Part B).
5.2.3 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
The laboratory  tests listed in Table 5.2.3:1 will be performed at the central laboratory  service 
provider. Pa tients don’t have to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety  laboratory . 
Instructions on collection, handling/ processing, and shipping of the samples will be provided

ECG -recordings will be made at the time points described in the Flow Chart .Twelve -lead 
ECGs (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 - V6) will be recorded using equipment provided by  a 
central ECG vendor. The ECGs will be recorded for at least 10 second duration after the 
subjects have rested for at least 5 minutes in a supine position. Electrode placement will be 
performed according to the method of Einthoven/Goldberger (ankles and wrists). At all-time
points, indicated in the Flow Chart , single ECGs will be recorded. ECG recordings at planned 
time points may  be repeated for qualit y reasons like alternating current artefacts, muscle 
movements and electrode dislocation. 
All lo cally  printed ECGs will be evaluated b y the investigator or a designee. Additional 
(unscheduled) ECGs can be recorded for safet y reasons at any time based on the judgment of 
the investigator. An y ECG abnormalities will be carefull y monitored and if necessa ry the 
subject will be removed from the trial and medically  treated.
All ECGs will be transmitted electronically  to the central ECG vendor in order to enable a 
centralized re -evaluation of all 12 -lead ECGs b y an independent ECG laboratory (onl y if 
needed). Abnormalities detected during this centralized ECG evaluation will not necessaril y 
qualify  as AE.
5.2.5 Assessment of other safety parameters
5.2.5.1 Physical examination (PE) and Neurological Examination
A standard physical examination will be carried out as described in the Flow Chart .
A phy sical examination including, but not limited to, general appearance, skin, neck, ey es, 
ears, nose, throat, breast, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, l ymph nodes and extremities will be 
performed. The ph ysical examination will include examination of known and suspected sites 
of disease. 
A standard neurological examination will be carried out as described in the Flow Chart .
Aneurological examination including, but not limited to, mental status, cranial nerves, 
reflexes, motor strength and coordination will be performed. The neurological examination 
will include examination of known and suspected sites of disease. 
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings noticed after baseline assessment will be reported as 
(S)AEs.
5.2.5.2 Vital signs (orthostatic blood pressure & pulse rate)
Vital signs (orthostatic measurements of s ystolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) will 
be recorded at all the study  visits as described in the Flow Chart , including the earl y End of 
Treatment Visit and the Follow-up visit ( 4 weeks after the end of treatment). Body weight
will be measured at the visits ind icated in the Flow C hartand the same scale has to be used 
for all measurements. The height is measured only at visit 1 (screening ).
Measuring Orthostatic Blood Pressure 
1. Have the patient lie down for 5 minutes.

3. Have the patient stand and immediately  measure blood pressure and pulse rate . 
4. Repeat blood pressure and pulse rate measurements after 3 minutes of standing .
Only  at visit 3 the following additional measurements need to be performed which include: 
pulse rate is to be measured in a supine position after 5 minutes of rest pre -dose 
and at thetime points of post -dose PK sampling until 90±20mins post-dose. Pulse 
rate should be taken before the respective blood for PK sampling is drawn. 
Orthostatic measurements of sy stolic/diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate areto 
be done pre-dose and at 90±20minutes post -dose. 
This procedure is to be performed in a quiet environment and unexpected disturbances have 
to be avoided. In case of an unexpected disturbance (for example slamming door) this 
measurement may  be repeated.
If there is a finding which meets any  withdrawal criterion (See section 3.3.4.1 ), the subject 
should be removed from study  participation. 
Clinically  relevant abnormal findings noticed after baseline assessment will be reported as 
(S)AEs.
5.2.5.3 Suicidal risk assessed b y the C -SSRS 
The C -SSRS® , developed by  leading experts in cooperation with the FDA, is a questionnai re 
assessing both suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation. The medical qualified clinician 
administered interview with the questionnaire has a typical administration time of five 
minutes, can be easily  coupled with evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteri a and causes only  
a low burden on patients and the assessing medical qualified clinician. The interview consists 
of five questions related to suicidal behavior and five questions related to suicidal ideation, 
evaluated as either present or not. Patients pr esenting with an y suicidal behavior or suicidal 
ideation will be excluded from participation in the trial. The C -SSRS® has been widel y used 
in large multinational clinical trials in the past four y ears and it is available in over 20 
languages. The C -SSRS® will be administered by the medical qualified clinician or expert 
clinici an and will be assessed at the screening visit with the aim to exclude patients with 
active moderate or severe sy mptomatology  prior to the screen ingvisit, or recent (or current) 
suicidal or suicide attempt according to the C -SSRS® (baseline /screening version) . 
Subsequently , the C-SSRS® “since last visit” assessment will be performed at each clinic 
visit after visit 3 and asshown in FlowChart. If th ere is a positive response of suicide attempt 
or suicidal ideation b y the patient during the administration of the C -SSRS® during the 
treatment period, the medical qualified clinician is to immediately  interview the patient 
during the clinic visit and determine if the patient will be discontinued from the trial and 
appropriate actions for the patient’s safet y have to b e initiated by  the investigator. For 
assessment of the C -SSRS® paper forms will be used and results will be transcribed into the 
e-CRF.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All trial visits should be initiated preferentiall y in the morning starting before 9:00 AM. 
Patients should be instructed to avoid in take of the morning dose of the study  medication at 
home atscheduled visit day s as they  will be dosed whilst at the study  site.
All patient visits should be scheduled according to the Flow Chart .
If any visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit schedule. 
The trial medication packs contain sufficient medicat ion to allow for these time windows.
The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out”, i.e. last visit completed by  the last patient.
If the reason for removal of a patient from the treatment is an adverse event or an abnormal 
laboratory  test result, the patient must be followed until complete resolution or stabilization 
of the event or until follow -up is agreed to be adequate by  the Investigator and BI CML.
Blood samples for the optional pharmacogenomics evaluation should be collected only  after 
obtaining separate informed consent. 
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PRO CEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
Study  procedures to be performed at each visit are listed in the Flow Chart . Additional details 
regarding visit procedures are provided bel ow. 
The following section describes recommendations for the conduct of the neuropsy chological 
assessments. 
The assessments should be administered in the same sequence found in the flowchart 
and approximately at the same time of the day  at every  applicable visit. 
Assessment of the Neuropsy chological Rating Scales should preferentially  be done by  
the same member of the site staff for a given patient throughout the study  period.
It is strongl y recommended that a member onl y performs independent tests (meaning 
that different assessments of cognition should be performed b y different members of 
the team). The stud y partner contributing to the functional assessments should not 
change during the stud y. If that cannot be avoided this is to be recorded in the source 
data and as a protocol violation. 
The adverse events should be evaluated b y a team member that is not dire ctly 
involved in the neurops ychological and functional assessments (NTB, CDR, MCI -
ADCS -ADL and ADAS -cog 11) to prevent partial unblinding. 
The members of the site staff performing the assessment have to be properly  trained (either at

6.2.1 Screening and run -in period(s)
Visit 1 (screening)
No trial procedures should be done unless the patient and study  partner have consented to 
taking part in the trial.
Once the patient has consented, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial and has 
started screening. The patient should be recorded on the enrolment log and be registered 
in the I RTas a screened patient. 
Informed consent for optional pharmacogenomics sampling, if applicable should be 
obtained.
For diabetic patients with antidiabetic therap y: exclusion of hy poglycemia for the period 
of the neurops ychological assessment (documented plasma glucose concentration ≥ 90 
mg/dl (5mmol/l) at the beginning and directl y after the assessment). If glucose is too low 
patients need to eat a snack and then be retested to confirm that the blood sugar value is 
above 90 mg/dl before the tests are started
The following screening procedures must however be performed in the order of the Flow
Chart: MMSE, FCSRT, ( Wechsler Memory  Visual Paired Associates test , ifapplicable),
CDR, ADAS -cog 11, MRI /CCTand PET / CSF sampling (whichever applicable) to ensure 
that undesirable ,invasive screening procedures are deferred until necessary .
If the patient fails screening due to the results of the MMSE and/or the CDR then an 
alternative participation in study  1289.7 might be considered, where applicable.
Administration of C -SSRS ( baseline/screening scale)
Collection of urine and blood for safet y laboratory testing including testing for HIV, 
Syphilis and vitamin B12 and fol ate levels.
Collection of blood sample sfor optional soluble biomarker evaluation from patients who 
consent.
If patient does not meet inclusion/exclusion criteria at visit 1 then the patient must be 
recorded in IRT and CRFs as a screen failure. 
If the pat ient is eligible according to inclusion/exclusion criteria available at visit 1 , the 
run-in visit ( visit 2) should be scheduled .Patient should be reminded to come for visit 2
in the morning .
Patients are allowed to have a light breakfast/ meal before coming to the study  site. 
Patients should be reminded not to take occasionally  used sleeping aids ( see section

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a phase II multi -centre, double- blind, para llel-group, randomiz ed, placebo -controlled 
study  to investigate efficacy , safet y and tolerability of orall y administered BI 409306 once or 
twice dail y during a 12 -week treatment period compared to placebo in patients with 
prodromal Alzheimer’s Disease . The primary  endpoint is Neuropsy chological Test Battery  
(NTB) response, defined as change from baseline in total z-score after 12-week treatment.
The primary  anal ysis is the restricted maximum likelihood based mixed model repeated 
measurement (MMRM) comparing the change from baseline of NTB total z-score after 12 -
week treatment. Further anal ysis details are provided in section 7.3(Planned Anal yses).
Another design aspect is the ran domization allocation ratio of 1:1:1:1:2 of 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 
mg, 25 mg BID of BI 409306 and placebo. Since the literature suggests that higher placebo 
response is related to the probability  of patients receivin g trial medication, the randomiz ation 
allocation ratio is modified from a traditional equal ratio where onl y about 17 % of patients 
would receive placebo to an allocation ratio of 1:1:1:1:2 where 33 % of patients wou ld 
receive placebo [P10-10921 ]. This is further elaborated in the section 7.5and the impact on 
sample size calculation is provided in section 7.6.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHE SES
The objective of this exploratory  trial is to demonstrate proof -of-concept and also explore the 
dose response of BI 409306 in NTB total score change from baseline (Visit 3) after 12 weeks 
treatment. The h ypotheses testing will be carried in the followi ng steps. No multiplicity  
adjustment will be made; hence all the p -values will be descriptive. All tests will be tested at 
a two -sided alpha 0.05. 
Step 1 for Proof -of-Concept:
H1-0: Mean NTB response of pooled doses of 10 mg QD, 25 mg QD, 25 mg BID and 50 mg 
QD = Mean NTB response of placebo
H1-a: Mean NTB response for pooled doses of 10 mg QD, 25 mg QD, 25 mg BID and 50 mg 
QD ≠Mean NTB response of placebo
If the null hy pothesis H 1-0  is rejected in favour of H 1-a, then the proof of concept is 
establi shed.

A regression model will be fitted first as the following functional form.
μ(d )= β + β d + β d  ,
where μ(d )denotes the mean response of NTB of the dose level i group, d denotes for dose 
levels i, for i = 1, 2,..,5 and β’s are the coefficients. The dose d will be treated as continuous 
variable.
Testing for linear dose response curve 
H2-0:β1= 0, β2 =0
H2-a: β1≠ 0, β2=0
If the null hy pothesis H 2-0is rejected in favour of H 2-a, then the following test will be tested 
for quadratic dose response curve. 
H3-0:β2= 0
H3-a: β2≠ 0
Step 3: 
Once the dose response curve is dete rmined from Step 2, the dose group with peak response
in the selected model will be tested as follows: 
H4-0: The dose group with peak response in the respective model Mean NTB response = 
Mean NTB response of placebo .
H4-a: The dose group with peak response in the respective model Mean NT B response ≠ 
Mean NTB response of placebo .
In addition to the 3 steps ab ove, the confidence intervals of difference in treatment effect 
against placebo will be presented for efficacy  evaluation. 
Note Step 1 and Step 3 the testing will be based on the adjusted means of NTB response from 
the primary  model as described in section 7.3
For the secondary  endpoint, all calculated p- values should be considered as descriptive for 
the anal ysis of secondary endpoint. Therefore, no alpha correction will be carried out.

Analy sis set
Treated set (TS): All patients who were randomized and treated with at least one do se of 
study  medication.
Full analysis set (FAS) : The full anal ysis set (F AS) will consist of all randomiz ed patients 
who were treated with at least one dose of stud y drug and had a baseline and at least one post 
baseline on treatment primary  endpoint NTB assessment. The FAS will be used for the 
primary  anal yses.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
Derivation of primary  endpoint
The primary  endpoint NTB total score will be analysed as change from baseline after 12 
weeks of treatment. The NTB includes 9 tests as described in section 5.1. For each patient 
raw scores on each of the 9 NTB tests will be converted to the standardized z -score using the 
baseline means and standard de viations (SDs) for each test. The baseline means and SDs will 
be calculated using all randomized patients . The resultant z -scores will be averaged to obtain 
a total z -score, incorporating all 9 NTB tests. Change from baseline will be calculated as the 
post-baseline composite z -score minus the pre -treatment z -score, such that a positive change 
indicates an improvement from baseline. The measurements taken at Visit 3 will be 
considered as baseline values [R13-2645 ].
Primary  anal ysismodel
The restricted maximum likelihood (REML ) based mixed effects model with repeated 
measurements (MMRM) will be used for the change from baseline in NTB total score after 
12 weeks of treatment. The model will include fixed, categorical effects of treat ment, visit 
and treatment b y visit interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline and 
baseline -by-visit interaction. Patient will be considered as random effect. The unstructured 
covariance structure will be used to model the within pa tient errors. If this anal ysis fails to 
converge, compound s ymmetry covariance structure might be used. The Kenward -Roger 
approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. Analy ses will be 
implemented using SAS PROC MIXED. The primary  treatment comparisons will be the 
contrast between treatments after 12 weeks of treatment. Adjusted mean values as well as 
treatment contrasts will be presented together with the 95 % confidence intervals.
7.3.2 Secondary analyses
The REML  model as describ ed for the primary  endpoint will be performed for thesecondary
endpoint CDR -SB. An ANCOVA model similar to the primary endpoint model will be 
performed for the ADAS -Cog 11and ADCS -MCI -ADL secondary  endpoints.  Further details 
will be provided in the TSAP.  The adjusted mean values as well as the treatment contrasts 
will be presented together with the 95 % confidence intervals.

Standard safet y analyses will be performed on the TS.
All safet y data will be displayed and analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. No 
formal inferential anal ysis is planned for safet y comparison.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occurring between first drug intake andend of 
residual effect period 7day after last drug intake will be considered ‘treatment -related .
Adverse events that start before first drug intake a nd deteriorate under treatment will also be
considered as ‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical
Dictionary  for Drug Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
Descriptive statistics of laboratory  values over time and for the difference from baseline will 
be provided. Frequency  tables of changes with respect to the reference range between 
baseline and last value on treatment will also be presented.
Vital signs, ECG and other safety parameters at screening , baseline, during the course of the 
trial and at the end -of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes 
compared to findings befor e start of treatment.
The responses to the C -SSRS will be summarized through descriptive statistics. 
More details of these analy ses will be included in the TSAP.
7.3.4 Interim analyses
No interim anal ysis is planned during the course of the study .

7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Every  effort will be made to collect complete data at the specified time points. 
In general, completel y missing visits will be handled through the statistical model.
NTB measurements
For NTB, if more than 3 out of 9 items are missing, the total score will not be derived and 
it will be set to missing [R13-2645 ].
If all data from a visit is missing at random (i.e. the patient withdraw for any reason or a 
visit is missed but the patient has not withdrawn), the likelihood based repeated measures 
mixed effects model described in section 7.3.1 will handle missing data.
Additional details on the imputation of missing data will be specified in the Trial Statistical 
Analy sis Plan (TSAP) prior to un-blinding .
7.5 RANDOMIZ ATION
Eligible patients will be randomly  assigned to one of the 5treatment g roups, with an 
allocation of 2:1:1:1: 1respectively for placebo: BI 409306 10 mg once daily :BI409306 
25mg once daily: BI409306 50mg once daily once dail y:BI409306 25 mg twice daily.
The randomiz ation will not be stratified.
The randomization of patients to the treatment groups will be performed via an interactive 
response technology  (IRT). BI will arrange for the randomization as well as packaging and 
labeling of stud y medication. The randomization list will be generated using a validated 
system, which involves a pseudo-random number generator and a supplied seed number so 
that the resulting allocation of medication numbers to treatment is both reproducible and non -
predictable. The access to the randomization codes will be controlled and documente d.
7.6 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
The primary  efficacy  hypothesis will be tested b y comparing the dose group of BI 409306 
with the peak response in the fitted regression model to the placebo group on the primary

7.2for the details of h ypothesis testing.)
As pr eviously  mentioned, the randomiz ation allocation ratio of 1:1:1 :1:2 of 10 mg, 25 mg, 
50mg, 25 mg BID of BI 409306, and placebo is used so that 33 % of patients will be 
randomized to placebo. Since these results in an unequal allocation of treatment to placebo, 
the sample size required for the active treatment and placebo for various effect size are 
display ed separatel y.The sample size calculations in Table 7.6:1 display s the range of effect 
sizes considered for this trial under these assumptions using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.05 with 
80% power. The two -sample t -test method with unequal n’s in nQuery  Advisor 6.01 was 
used for the calculation.
Table 7.6: 1 Sample size calculations 
Standardized effect size 0.45 0.50 0.55 0.6 0.65
Power 80% 80% 80% 80% 80%
n for each active treatment arm 59 48 40 34 29
n for placebo arm 118 96 80 68 58
Total 354 288 240 204 174
Based on the calculations provided in Table 7.6:1 , a sample size of 48 per active treatment 
arm and 96 for placebo arm was selected as adequate for a phase II proof of concept trial .
This sample size would allow us to detect an effect size of 0.5 with 80 % power or an effect 
size of 0.6 with 92 % power , 2-sided alpha at 0.05 . 
Assuming a 10% dropout rate, this sample size would allow us to detect an effect size of 0.53 
with 80% power and assuming a 20% dropout rate, this sample size would allow us to detect

RECORDS
The trial will be carried out in compliance with the protocol, the principles laid down in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and relevant BI Standard Operating Procedures ( SOPs ). 
Standard medical care (prophy lactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures) remains inthe 
responsibility  of the treating phy sician of the patient.
The investigator should inform the sponsor immediately  of any  urgent safety  measures taken 
to protect the study  subjects against any  immediate hazard, and also of an y serious breaches 
of the protocol/ICH GCP.
The rights of the investigator and of the sponsor with regard to publication of the results of 
this trial are described in the investigator contract. As a general rule, no trial results should be 
published p rior to finalisation of the Clinical Trial Report.
According to local requirements the terms and conditions of the insurance cover are made 
available to the investigator and the patients via documentation in the I SF (Investigator Site 
File).
8.1 STUDY APPR OVAL, PATIENT INFORM ATION, AND INFORMED 
CONSENT
This trial will be initiated only after all required legal documentation has been reviewed and 
approved by the respective Institutional Review Board (IRB) /Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC) and competent authorit y(CA) according to national and international regulations. The 
same applies for the implementation of changes introduced by  amendments.
Prior to patient participation in the trial, written informed consent must be obtained from each 
patient accordin g to ICH GCP and to the regulatory and legal requirements of the 
participating country . Each signature must be personally  dated by  each signatory  and the 
informed consent and any  additional patient -information form retained by  the investigator as 
part of t he trialrecords. A signed copy  of the informed consent and an y additional patient
information must be given to each patient .
The patient must be informed that his/her personal trial -related data will be used by  
Boehringer Ingelheim in accordance with the local data protection law. The level of 
disclosure must also be explained to the patient .
The patient must be informed that his / her medical records may  be examined by  authorised 
monitors (CML /CRA) or Clinical Quality  Assurance aud itors appointed b y Boehringer 
Ingelheim, by  appropriate I RB / IEC members ,and by  inspectors from regulatory  authorities.

10.2 LUMBAR PUNCTURE PROC EDURE AND CEREBROSPINAL FLUID 
(CSF) COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
Evaluation of CSF am yloid is considered a gold standard to support a diagnosis of 
Alzheimer’s disease; it is highly likely that many potential patients would initially  undergo 
CSF sampling before being considered for participation in this study . For the study  it is 
necessary  that the CSF sampling procedure is standardized and the evaluation of CSF 
amyloid as diagnostic inclusion criteria is performed at a central lab to ensure consistency  of 
results. 
CSF sampling is an invasive procedure . To avoid repeated lumbar puncture for diagnosis and 
confirmation of eligibility , patients who initially  underwent CSF s ampling for diagnostic 
workup of cognitive impairment can be considered for inclusion if CSF was collected within 
the last 4 months prior to I nformed Consent and if the sampling and storage was done 
according to the specifications set out in this protocol. The sampling of the CSF should be 
performed under the current medically  accepted standards in the referring country  (for 
instance: separate informed consent and considering potential contraindications like raised 
intracranial pressure, thrombocy topenia an d other bleeding diathesis (including ongoing 
anticoagulant therap y) or suspected spinal epidural abscess. Aliquoting of samples as 
specified in the protocol is not necessary  and it would be considered acceptable if the sites are 
able to provide at least 6 ml of CSF as a single bulk sample or multiple aliquots. Multiple 
thawing of the samples once frozen is not allowed.
In the event the CSF sample provided is considered unacceptable for evaluation by  the central 
lab, it is at the discretion of the investigator to consider taking an additional CSF sample for 
inclusion in the 1289.5 study  or such patients would need to be screen failed or undergo PET 
for demonstration of am yloid pathology .
10.2.1 Positioning
The subject should assume a sitting position and arc hing “like a cat” with his or her back 
flexed to widen the gap between the spinous processes. The lumbar spine should be 
perpendicular to the bed. The point of insertion of the needle will be determined by  palpation 
at the intersection of the midline and a line connecting the superior aspects of the iliac crests.
Deviations should be recorded in the source data as well as in the eCRF.
The needle will be inserted in the interspace between L3 and L4 or L4 and L5. The proper 
position will be indicated with a skin- marking pen.

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.10.2.2 Preparation
The site should follow its local standard procedures for preparation of lumbar puncture. The 
further procedure will be performed in a sterile manner. 
10.2.3 Analgesia
Maximal 5 mL  local anaesthetic ( e.g. Xylocaïne® 2% with epinephrine) will be infiltrated 
subcutaneousl y.
10.2.4 Lumbar puncture and CSF collection
An(preferentially 25G) atraumatic needle with stylet in place will be inserted at the superior 
aspect of the inferior spinous process in the midline and appr oximately  15° cephalad. 
Advance the needle into the spinous ligament (increased resistance). Continue to advance the 
needle within the ligament until there is a fall in resistance. Remove the stylet. Collect the 
first 2 ml of CSF in collection tube 1 and f urther 6 ml in collection tube 2 (collection tubes to 
be used: Sarstedt, cat nr: 62.554.502).
10.2.5 End of Procedure
After all CSF has been collected, the needle will be removed, the site cleaned and a bandage 
applied.
10.2.6 CSF processing and shipment
Freshl y collected CSF must be kept at room temperature (RT) but should be centrifuged 
within 1 hour of collection at 2000 xg, 10 min, R T. Immediately  after centrifugation the 
respective supernatants should be transferred to fresh tubes (Sarstedt, cat nr: 62.554.502) and 
tubes inverted once. The CSF should then be divided into 500 µl aliquots (Sarstedt; tubes cat 
nr: 72.703, lids cat nr: 65.716) and immediatel y stored at approximately -80°C.
Coding of aliquots from collection tube 1: CT1_1, CT1_2, … 
Coding of aliquots from collection tube 2: CT2_1, CT2_2, …
The reason for splitting up the CSF at collection into 2 separate tubes is to ensure that the 
actual CSF sample to be anal ysed is not contaminated with tissue, blood, etc. So all anal yses 
should be perfo rmed from the 2nd collection tube. Nevertheless, CSF from the 1st collection 
tube will still be kept as this might proof valuable for additional anal yses. 
All aliquots (from collection tube 1 and 2) will be shipped on dry  ice to the central laboratory , 
from where they  will be shipped in batches to the biobank.

Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AST, and bilirubin (total and direct) - within 48 
to 72 hours and provide additional blood sample to the central laboratory for automatic reflex
testing of the below listed laboratory  parameters. Only  in case whereb y the central laboratory 
is not immediately  available (e.g. if the logistics are such that the patient´s repeat specimen 
would not reach the central laboratory  in a reasonable timeframe ), ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
(total and direct) will be evaluated by local laboratory and results are made available to the 
investigator and to BI as soon as possible. If in such a case ALT and/or AST ≥ 3fold ULN 
combined with an elevation of total bilirubi n ≥2 fold ULN are confirmed, results of the 
laboratory  parameters described below must be made available to the investigator and to BI 
as soon as possible.

Rationale for change Clarification that the use of strong or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors is prohibited. While the 
contribution of CYP3A4 to the metabolism of BI 
409306 is minor, there is no data available

3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Overview of Psoriasis  
Psoriasis is a chronic immunological disease characterized by infiltration of the skin with activated 
T cells and by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, resulting in marked 
inflammation and thickening of the epidermis.  Psoriasis affects 1-3% of the world population, 
making it one of the most prevalent inflammatory immunological diseases.1  There are several 
clinical subtypes of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, erythrodermic, inverse, and pustular.  Plaque 
psoriasis is the most common type of psoriasis affecting 75-80% of psoriasis sufferers.² It 
presents as raised silvery scale, which can cover large areas, with underlying erythema, itching, 
and discomfort.

3.2  Rationale for Treating Scalp Psoriasis with Corticosteroid Topical Therapy  
Scalp psoriasis can have a significant psychosocial impact on a patient’s quality of life and the 
use of topical therapy has shown an increase in quality of life outcomes.3 Topical steroids play an 
in important role in the long term management of psoriasis.  Data from a study analyzing disease 
severity and patient treatment satisfaction revealed that patients with psoriasis are often 
dissatisfied with available treatments.4  Patient preferences of topical treatments can greatly 
impact compliance rates.  Recent evidence shows that spray is a patient preferred vehicle more 
than 2 to 1 over creams, ointments, lotions, gel and foams.5  This study will analyze improvement 
in scalp psoriasis and patient outcomes.

 5.5 STUDY TREATMENT 
5.5.1 Topicort® Topical Spray 0.25% (desoximetasone) 
5.5.1.1 Topicort ® Description 
Topicort ® Topical Spray is a Class I, super-potent corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of 
plaque psoriasis in patients 18 years or older. Each gram of Topicort® Topical Spray 0.25% 
contains 2.5mg of desoximetasone in a clear, colorless liquid.   
5.5.1.2 Topicort® Dosing Schedule 
Topicort ® will be supplied by Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. Inc. and applied approximately 12 
hours apart twice daily for 4 weeks followed by twice daily two times a week - on consecutive 
days - for 12 weeks (e.g. Saturday, Sunday). Patients will treat other body areas affected by 
plaque psoriasis with Topicort® during the study period (excludes face, groin, axilla).  
5.5.1.3 Topicort® Dispensing and Dosing Record 
Subjects will return all unused Topicort ® to the study site.  Site personnel will keep a record of 
Topicort® dispensed to and returned by each subject and note any missed doses.   
 
5.5.1.4     Topicort Spray® Dosage Adjustments 
If an SAE or an adverse event that is thought to be related to Topicort ® and is not alleviated by 
symptomatic intervention, Topicort® will be discontinued.  Subjects who permanently discontinue 
Topicort® therapy under this protocol should receive standard care of psoriasis treatment as 
prescribed by their physician. 
 
5.5.2  Permitted Concomitant Therapy 
Subjects may use non-steroidal topical medications to face, groin and axilla. Patients may apply 
Topicort Spray® on arms, legs and trunk to treat body psoriasis. Appropriate interventions (e.g., 
prescribed medications) may be performed as the investigator deems necessary to treat 
concomitant illnesses and/or safeguard the subjects’ wellbeing.  No investigational product or 
device may be used during the study.   
5.6 Study Procedures 
5.6.1 Informed Consent 
This Study will be conducted in compliance with CFR Title 21, Part 50 (Informed Consent of 
Human Subjects).  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject in writing before 
participation in the Study.  A signed copy of the Informed Consent Form will be provided to each 
subject.  A provision to obtain a signed authorization to provide protected health information to 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
9 
 the study sponsor, internal quality assurance agencies, health insurance agencies, and other 
parties as specified in the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
privacy regulation will be included in the Informed Consent Document.  HIPAA authorization is 
voluntary.  However, since the use and release of health information is critical to the conduct of 
the study, subjects who do not provide authorization to use and disclose their health information 
will not be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who withdraw their authorization to use and release 
health information during study participation will be formally discontinued from the study.  The 
investigator may use and release at any time all the information collected prior to a subject’s 
withdrawal of the authorization to all authorized parties to satisfy scientific, regulatory, and 
financial concerns. 
5.6.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study will be determined according to the Inclusion and 
Exclusion Criteria during the screening period (0 – 30 days prior to the first dose of the study 
drug).  Subjects who ultimately do not satisfy the eligibility criteria except changing treatments 
and undergoing a washout period, will not be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who need to meet 
eligibility requirements will be asked to make the necessary changes.  Subjects who agree and 
comply will be re-evaluated prior to Baseline.  Subjects who meet the requirements at screening 
may be enrolled the same day. 
5.6.3 Demographics and Medical History 
The following information will be obtained for each subject during screening: date of birth, sex, 
race/ ethnic origin, relevant medical and surgical history, year of diagnosis of plaque psoriasis 
and scalp psoriasis, and current and previous anti-psoriasis treatments within the last 6 months .  
All current therapies for other medical conditions will be documented. Medical history will be 
reviewed and updated at the Baseline Visit to ensure that the patient remains eligible to participate 
in the study. 
5.6.4 Urine Pregnancy Test 
Pregnancy testing (urine β-human chorionic gonadotrophin [β-HCG]) will be conducted in all 
female subjects, except those without childbearing potential (e.g., one year post-menopause, 
post-hysterectomy, post-bilateral oophorectomy, etc) at Screening and Baseline Visit (Week 0) 
prior to the first dose of Topicort®.  An interim urine pregnancy test may be performed if there is 
reason to believe the subject may have become pregnant during the study.  Subjects with a 
positive pregnancy test will not be eligible to participate or to continue to receive study treatment. 
5.6.5 Physical Examination 
A physical examination, including vital signs measurements (blood pressure and pulse), will be 
performed at each study visit. Any clinically significant abnormalities discovered during physical 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
10 
 examinations after the Screening / Baseline (if occurring on the same day) visit should be 
documented and evaluated as potential adverse events. 
 
5.6.6 Investigator Global Assessment (scalp only )  
Investigator Global Assessment for scalp will be determined for all subjects throughout the study.  
Subjects are required to have a score of 2-mild or greater to enter the study.  The Investigator 
Global Assessment is a 5 point scale that records disease severity based on average degree of 
erythema, induration and scaling. Investigator Global Assessment uses a scale of 0 = Clear, 1 = 
Almost Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, and 4 = Severe. See Appendix A 
 
5.6.7 Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) and Scalp Surface Area (SSA) 
The scalp is assessed for erythema, induration and desquamation. The average degree of 
severity of each 3 symptoms is assigned a score of 0-4.  The surface area of scalp psoriasis is 
then estimated as a percentage. The PSSI score is the sum of the erythema, induration and 
desquamation scores multiplied by the area of involvement. Scores range from 0-72.  See 
Appendix B 
5.6.8 Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)  
PGA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. PGA is a 5 point scale that records 
the overal l disease severity at each clinical evaluation based on the average degree of erythema, 
induration, and scaling of areas affected by psoriasis.  PGA uses a scale of 0 = Clear, 1 = Almost 
Clear, 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, and 4 = Severe. See Appendix C 
 
5.6.9  Body Surface Area (BSA) 
BSA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. The subjects palm will be selected 
for the measuring unit of body surface area.  The physician will equate the number of palms 
affected by psoriasis to derive the BSA total. 
5.6.10 Patient Reported Outcomes  
Subjects will complete the Subject Assessment of Pain, Itching and Scaling and Scalpdex at 
weeks 0, 4 and 16. Scalpdex is a self-administered quality of life instrument developed for scalp 
dermatitis. The 23 item survey evaluates the subject across 3 major domains –symptom, 
functional and emotion.6  Pain, Itching and Scaling is a scale of 1-10 which assess pain, itch and 
scale in the past 24 hours.  See Appendix D and E  
 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
11 
 5.6.11   Early Discontinuation Procedures 
Subjects will be prematurely discontinued from the study under the following conditions: 
1. Subject requests to withdraw from the study. 
2. Subject is noncompliant with protocol schedule, restrictions, and/or requirements. 
3. Subject experiences an adverse event that makes it difficult or intolerable for the 
subject to continue treatment, or increases risk to the subject, or interferes with the 
investigator’s ability to clinically evaluate the progress of the subject’s treatment. 
4. Subject begins an unapproved concomitant therapy for psoriasis or another medical 
condition that may increase risk to the subject if continuing study treatment. 
5. Subject cannot be reached / lost to follow- up. 
6. The study investigator suspends or terminates the study. 
7. Other unanticipated reason. 
 
Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study should complete the week 16 (End of Study) 
assessments. Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the study will be removed from 
further treatment and/or study observation immediately upon the date of request.  
6 Adverse Events 
6.1 Adverse Events (AEs) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward occurrence in a subject, whether or not related to the 
product.  An AE does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study treatment.  
AEs include events not present at baseline and events that worsened if present at baseline. 
Hospitalizations for pre-treatment conditions (e.g., elective cosmetic procedures) or surgeries that 
were planned prior to entry into the study are not considered adverse events.  
 
Adverse events, regardless of causality , will be captured from the signing of the Informed Consent 
Form and for the duration of the subject’s participation. 
6.2 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that meets one or more of 
the following criteria according to federal regulations: 
 
a. results in death; 
b. is life-threatening (the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not 
refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe); 
c. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; 
d. requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; 
e. is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; 
JB-02  Version 1      05Apr2016 
 
12 
 f. is considered an important medical event (may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above). 
 
 
6.2 .1 SAE Reporting 
An Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Reaction  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death;  
 A life threatening adverse event; (Note: the term “life-threatening” as used here 
refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; 
it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe);  
 In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization;  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions); 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; 
 Any “other” important medical event. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require 
hospitalization may be considered Serious Adverse Events when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Regardless of the above, any additional adverse events which the Principal Investigator 
considers significant should be immediately reported to Taro’s Drug Safety Department. 
Any Serious Adverse Event, whether deemed drug-related or not, must be reported by the 
Investigator to the Taro’s Drug Safety Department by telephone within 24 hours  after the 
Principal Investigator or Study Coordinator becomes aware of its occurrence.  The Principal 
Investigator or the Principal Investigator’s Designee must complete a Serious Adverse Event 
(SAE) Form and email it to Taro’s Drug Safety Department, along with the patient’s Adverse 
Events Log and Concomitant Medications Log within 24 hours  of notification of the event.  
When appropriate, Taro’s Drug Safety Department will notify the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) of drug related Serious Adverse Events. 
Documentation of serious or unexpected adverse events and follow up information should be 
sent to Taro’s Drug Safety Manager within 24 hours from reporting the event by the Investigator. 
Following is the contact information:

LY30122112.Synopsis
Study Rationale
Necitumumab (IMC -11F8; LY3012211 ; Portrazza®) is a recombinant human mo noclonal  
antibody  (mAb)of the immunoglobulin G, subclass 1 (IgG1) that blocks the ligand -binding site 
of the epi dermal  growth factor receptor (EGFR).   EGFR is detectable in approximately 85% to 
90% of patients wi th advanced, m etastatic non -small  cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Necitumumab 
has show n signals of ant itumor activit y in 2 Phase 1 trials when administered as monotherapy  in 
heavily pretreated patients including but not limited to patients with NSCLC.  Portrazza has 
recent ly been approved in the US and EU for thetreatm ent of  adult patients with metastatic 
squamous NSCLC in co mbination wit h gemcitabine and cisplat in.
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475, Key truda®) is a humanized IgG4 mAb directed against p rogrammed 
death -1 (PD-1) T-cell co -receptor, thus blocking its interaction with ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  
Pembrolizumab is approved for treatment of melanoma in several countries; in the US and EU it 
is approv edfor the treatm ent of advanced ( unresectabl e or m etastati c)melano ma in adult s.  
Pembrolizumab has also been approved for treatment of N SCLC in several countries; in the US 
it is indicated for the treatment of pat ients with metastatic NSCLC whose tum ors express PD -L1 
as determined by  an FDA -approved test and who have disease progression on or after pl atinum -
containing chemotherapy .
The rat ionale for combining both agents is based on clinical single- agent data that show activit y 
of EGFR -directed mAbs and pembrolizumab in NSCLC, and preclinical data suggest ing that the 
antitumor activit y of EGFR ant ibodies can be attributed , at least in part, to various immune 
effector m echanisms .
The individual toxicit y profile sof necitumumab and pembrolizumab suggest that no overl apping 
Grade ≥3 toxicit y is expected; skin rash Grade 1 -2 has been seen with both agents, hence so me 
overl ap is expected.
Different m odesof action, preclinical data, and the clinical efficacy of necitumumab as well as 
other EGFR mAbs and pembro lizumab in NSCLC provi de a rati onale for the invest igation of 
necitumumab in co mbinat ion with pembro lizumab in patients with Stage IV NSCLC.
The purpose of this Phase 1b study  with an expansio n cohort i s to expl ore the safet y and 
preliminary efficacy  of neci tumumab plus pembro lizumab in pat ients with Stage IV NSCLC who 
have progressed after 1 platinum -based chemotherapy  regimen .

I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 7
LY3012211Statistical Methods:  
Efficacy :  The primary Part B outcome variable in this study will be the ORR.  The Part B statistical null 
hypothesis states that the true ORR is 2 0%, whereas the research hypothesis states that the true ORR is 3 5%.  If the 
research hypothesis is true, there is an 83% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis.  If the null hypothesis is true, 
then there is a t most a 10% chance of rejecting the null hyp othesis.   Therefore, the sample size of 54 evaluable 
patients in Part B has a nominal one-sided alpha level of 0.10 , with statistical power of 83 %.
Safety :  Safety analyses will be performed for all patients enrolled in the study who receive any amount of study
drug ( necitumumab or pembrolizumab ).  Numbers and rates of AEs will be reported by National Cancer Institute 
CTCAE terms. Laboratory and nonlaboratory CTCAEs will be summarized by CTCAE term and maximum 
CTCAE grades, including the total for maximum Grade 3 and above . These summaries will be provided for events 
deemed by the investigator to be related to study treatment , and repeated for events regardless of study drug 
causality. Adverse events will be summarized by Medical Dictio nary for Regulatory Activities System Organ 
Class ( MedDRA ™SOC), by decreasing frequency of Preferred Term within SOC.  Other safety parameters will be 
summarized as appropriate.
An interim safety analy sis will be performed after the first 15 evaluable patients in the Part B portion of the trial 
have completed 2 cycles of study treatment (or otherwise discontinued study treatment).  Patients with squamous 
and no nsquamous NSCLC from Part A who received the recommended necitumumab dose for Part B will be 
included in the interim analy ses.  The interim safety analy sis will be conducted to permit evaluation of safety data 
by the sponsor.
Interim efficacy analy ses may  be performed as needed to aid in the planning of future tr ials.There is no plan to 
stop the study for positive efficacy, the type -1 erro r for final primary analysis will not be affected and hence is not 
adjusted.
Immunogenicity :  Incidence of anti -necitumumab antibodies will be tabulated.
Pharmacokinetics:   Summary statistics of necitumumab data will be presented graphically as well as in tabulated 
form.  Additional exploratory analyses using population PK approach may be performed if warranted by data .
Translational research :  Translational research will be performed to analyze relevant biomarker s and to correlate 
them with clinical outcome.

LY30122115.Introduction
5.1. Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Lung cancer is the most commo n cancer worldwide, with an est imated 1.6 millio n new cases per 
year, and the leading cause of cancer -related m ortality with an est imated 1.4 millio n cancer -
related deaths per y ear (Bray  et al . 2012 ;Bunn 2012).
Non-small cell  lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately  85% of  all lung cancers.  
Patients wi th localized di sease have a 5 -year survival rate of approximately  55%; however, 
5-year survival drops significant ly for pati ents wi th regi onal (26.1%) or di stant (3.9%) di sease at
diagnosis (Howl ader et al . 2014 ).
Current standard first -line chemotherapy for patients with Stage IV NSCLC and a good 
perform ance status consi sts of a pl atinum -based doublet, using eit her cisplatin or carboplat in in 
combinat ion with pemetrexed (only  for nonsquamous NSCLC), taxanes, vinorelbine ,or 
gemcitabine. The combinat ion of a plat inum -doublet wi th the anti -vascular endothelial growth 
factor ( VEGF )
antibody  bevacizumab is a treatment option for nonsquamous pat ients only . 
Induct ion chemotherapy may be followed by maintenance therapy , administered ei ther as swi tch 
or continuat ion maintenance. Second- line treatment options after failure of first -line 
chemotherapy wit h or withou t maintenance treatment consist of monotherapy  with either 
docetaxel , erlotinib ,or pem etrexed depending on type of prior treatment. Lately, an anti-
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF R2) antibody ,ramucirumab ,in combinat ion 
with docetaxel  was approved in the United States ( US)and Europe anUnio n (EU) for the second -
line treatment of metastatic NSCLC, including squamous and nonsquamous histologies 
(Cyramza Summary  of Product Characteri stics [SmPC]/ US package insert [ USPI ]). Recently, 
monoclonal antibod ies(mAbs)directed against programmed death -1 (PD -1) T-cell co -receptor , 
nivolumab and pembro lizumab ,have been approved in the US for the treatment of patie nts with 
metastati cNSCLC with progressi on on or after pl atinum -based chemo therapy , whereby  
pembro lizumab was approved for the treatment of those NSCLC patients whose tumors express 
PD-L1 as determined by an FDA -approved test (Opdivo USPI , Key truda USPI ). In the EU 
nivolumab is approved for the treatm ent of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC after prior chemotherapy  (Opdivo Sm PC).  Pembrolizumab has also been approved for 
treatment of patients with NSCLC in EU (Keytruda SmPC). For pati ents wi th tumors harboring 
epidermal  growth factor receptor ( EGFR )-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-activat ing mutati ons, 
monotherapy  with an EGFR -TKI is used upfront ,followed by  osimert inib (Tagrisso USPI) in 
patients wi th EGFR T790M mutati on-positive cancer or a plat inum -based doublet as second -line
treatm ent, or as second -or thi rd-line treatment if not used previously. For pati ents wi th 
anaplast ic lympho ma kinase (ALK) -gene arrangement, treatment should include mo notherapy  
with an ALK inhibitor (Heigener and Reck 2014).
More recent ly, necitumumab has been approved in the US and EU forfirst-line treatment of 
patients wi th metastati c squamous NSCLC (Portrazza SmPC/USPI ).
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 22
LY3012211Despite the advancement of systemic treatments for patients with Stage IV NSCLC, the available 
therapeuti c opti ons rem ain limited and the prognosis of the pat ients is poor, result ing in a 
continued medical need for new treatment options .
5.2. Necitumumab
Necitumumab (LY3012211) i s a recombinant human mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig)G1class, 
which targets EGFR.  Necitumumab demonstrates a high affinit y to i ts target and blocks ligand -
induced receptor phosphorylat ion and downstream signaling.  In vitro studies further 
demonstrate that necitumumab inhibits EGFR- dependent tum or cell pro liferat ion, and can exert 
cytotoxi c effect in tum or cells through ant ibody -dependent cell cy totoxi city.
EGFR is expressed in a variet y of tumors, including col orectal , head and neck, breast, and 
NSCLC (Salo mon et al .1995).  In pati ents wi th advanced and metastatic NSCLC, EGFR is 
detectable in approximately 85% to 90% of patients (Fontanini et al .1995; Pi rker et al . 2009).  
Pharmaco logic inhibit ion of EGFR signaling through co mpet itive inhibit ion of ligand binding 
has been shown to play  a rol e in the treatment of several cancers, leading to registration of 
necitumumab in squam ous NSCLC and 2other anti-EGFR mAbs in a number of other 
indicat ions (Necitumumab/Portrazza PI /SmPC, Cetuximab/ Erbitux PI/Sm PC, 
Panitumumab/ Vect ibix PI/SmPC).  Moreover, another randomized Phase 3 trial, conducted wi th 
cetuximab, show edevidence that the addition o f an EGFR mAb to a plat inum -based doublet can 
significant ly increase survival in pat ients with advanced NSCLC (Pirker et al. 2009).
The necitumumab Pha se1 program  included 2 single -agent dose -escalat ion Phase 1 trials in 
Western ( I4X-IE-JFCE [JFCE]) and Japanese ( I4X-IE-JFCA [JFCA]) patients with advanced 
solid tumors or for which no standard therapy  was available.
Study JFCE included 60 patients and invest igated necitumumab intravenous (I.V.) once a week 
(Arm  A, n=29) or once every  2 weeks (Arm  B, n=31) at sequential absolute dose levels from 
100mg to 1000 mg.  No dose -limit ing toxicit ies (DLTs) were observed in Arm A, which 
included 9 patients treated at 1000 mg.  Grade 3 headache was the major DLT, occurring in 2of 
9patients in the 1000- mg dose cohort of Arm B .Because of the timely  relati onship to the first 
dose of necitumumab, these were considered to be dose- related and the dose leve l of 800 mg was 
defined as the maximum tol erated dose ( MTD) for both schedules.   Grade ≥3 adverse events 
(AEs) considered at least possibly related to necitumumab affected 10.3% (n = 3) of pat ients in 
Arm A and 22.6% (n = 7) of patients in Arm B. Overall, the most comm on related Grade ≥3 
AEs were fat igue (4 patients; 2 patients each in Arm A and Arm B); headache (2 patients in Arm 
B), and acne (2 patients, 1 patient each in Arm A and Arm B); others included anemia, diarrhea, 
nausea, vo miting, hypokalemia, and decreased blo od magnesium (1 pat ient each, all in Arm B). 
No Grade 5 necitumumab -related AE swere observed in this study .
In Study JFCA ,15 pati ents were enrolled and treated (Cohort 1: 600 mg necitumumab on Days 
1 and 8 of a 3- week cycle, n = 3; Cohort 2: 800 mg every  2weeks, n = 6; and Cohort 3 :800 mg 
on Day s1 and 8 of a 3- week cy cle, n = 6).   No DLTs were observed in this study during the first 
3-week cy cle for any  cohort.  The m ost comm on treatm ent-emergent AEs (TEAEs) regardless of 
grade or relationship to study therapy  were headache (n = 11; 73.3%), dry  skin (n = 10; 66.7%), 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 23
LY3012211pruri tus (n = 9; 60.0%), and rash (n = 8; 53.3%).   One pat ient in Cohort 2 experienced 2 related 
Grade 3 TEAEs of dry  skin and rash; a ll other related events observed in the study  were Grade 
≤2.
Signals of ant itumor activit y of neci tumumab m onotherapy  were observed in both studies with 
heavily pretreated patients.  For Study JFCE, in total 2 partial response (PR) and 16 stable 
disease (S D; 1 PR, 8 SD for each treatment arm) were observed (disease control rate [DCR] 
ArmA 31%, Arm B 29%).  For Study JFCA, SD was seen within all cohorts in a total of 
10patients (DCR 66.7%), including 1 patient with squamous NSCLC and 1 patient wi th 
nonsqua mous NSCLC.
The pivotal, rando mized Phase 3 trial SQUIRE ( I4X-IE-JFCC) compared gemcitabine/cisplat in 
plus necitumumab (GC+N) versus gemcitabine/cisplat in (GC) as first -line therapy in 1093 
patients wi thStage IV squam ous NSCLC (Thatcher et al. 2015).  The study  met its primary  
objective, demonstrating a statistically significant 
improvement in overall survival (OS) in the 
GC+N Arm compared with the GC Arm (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.84; p=0.012).  This was 
supported by  a statistical ly significant improvement in progression -free survival (PFS; 
HR=0.85; p=0.02). Several prespecified subgroup analyses for OS and PFS showed a 
consistent treatment effect in favor of GC+N.  Post- progression anticancer therapy  was similar 
(47% vs. 45%). The safet y data obtained in SQUIRE overall were consistent with the safet y 
profile expected for an anti -EGFR mAb, with skin reactions (any  grade:  79 % vs.12%, including 
Grade ≥3:  8.2% vs. 0.6% ) and hypo magnesemia ( any grade:  31% v s.16%, including Grad e≥3:  
9.3% vs. 1.1% ) being the most frequent ly reported events (pool ed term s) occurring at higher 
rates for pati ents receiving necitumumab .  The Grade ≥3 TEAEs with highest incidence for 
which incidence was higher in the necitumumab arm than in the contro l arm were 
hypo magnesemia (8.7% vs. 1.1%), rash (3.7% vs. 0.2%), pulmo nary embo lism (3.5% vs. 1.8%), 
hypokal emia (3.0% vs. 1.5%), and vomit ing (2.8% vs. 0.9%) .
In another randomized Phase 3 trial, INSPIRE ( I4X-IE-JFCB [JFCB]), 947 patients w ere 
planned to be randomly assigned to necitumumab plus pemetrexed- cisplat in (PC+N) versus 
pemetrexed -cisplat in (PC) as first -line therapy for Stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (Paz-Ares et 
al. 2013) .  Enrollment was halted, fo llowing an independent data monitori ng committee (IDMC) 
recommendat ion, after 633 patients because of safety  concerns related to thromboembolism as 
well as the overall number of deaths from all causes that were unbalanced against the 
experimental group; the trial cont inued for patients that had been enrolled.  Based on the final 
analysis, PC+N did not improve the efficacy outcome over PC alone in advanced nonsquamous
NSCLC (OS HR = 1.01, p=0.96; PFS HR = 0.96, p=0.66) . The addit ion ofnecitumumab 
resul ted in a higher frequency  of Grade ≥3 TEAEs. Grade ≥3 TEAEs occurring more frequent ly 
in the neci tumumab arm includ ed skin or subcutaneous di sorders (14.1 vs.0.3%),
thromboembo lic events (9.5 vs .6.4%), hy pomagnesaemia (7.6 vs .2.2%), asthenia (6.9 vs .1.9%), 
vomiting (6.6 vs .3.2%), dy spnea (5.3 vs .2.6%) ,and diarrhea (4.3 vs .2.2%). The frequency of 
study drug rel ated deaths was 4.9% and 2.9% for PC+N and PC, respectively .
Based on these data, the combinat ion of necitumumab plus pemetrexed -cisplat in is not being 
considered for further dev elopment.  Of note, no safet y signal wit h regard to thromboembo lic 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 24
LY3012211events, including fatal events, has been ident ified for necitumumab in co mpleted clinical trials 
when administered as monotherapy  or in combinatio n with mFOLFOX-6 (5- FU/FA and 
oxaliplat in) chemotherapy .
Therando mized Phase 2 trial ,I4X-MC-JFCL (JFCL ), com pared pacli taxel -carbopl atin plus 
necitumumab versus paclitaxel -carbopl atin in the first -line treatment of patients with Stage IV 
squamous NSCLC.  The overall efficacy and safety resul ts were generally consistent with those 
of SQUIRE. Study I4X-JE-JFCM is a Phase 1b/2 study  in Japanese patients with Stage IV 
squamous NSCLC that compares necitumumab plus gemcitabine -cisplat in versus gemcitabine -
cisplatin alo ne.  The trial is m onitored by  an IDMC and continues as planned.
For m ore details regarding the necitumumab development program, reference is made to the 
Invest igator ’sBrochure (IB).
5.2.1. Rationale for Necitumumab Dose S election
The recommended dose and treatment schedules for necit umumab are 800 m g (weekly), 800 mg 
(once every  2 weeks), or 800 m g (Day s 1 and 8 of a 21-daycycle), based on safet y and 
pharmacokinet ics (PK)data from  2 Phase 1 studi es in heavily pretreated patients with advanced 
solid tumors (JFCA and JFCE). The necit umumab 800 -mg dose administered I .
V.on Day s 1 
and 8 of each 21 -day cycle has also been used in the recent pivotal, randomized Phase 3 trial 
SQUIRE in combinat ion with gem citabine/cisplat in as first -line therapy in 1093 pat ients with 
Stage IV squamous NSCL C (Thatcher et al. 2015).  The starting dose of necitumumab will be at 
Dose Level -1 of the MTD (600 mg on Days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks [ Q3W ]).  Since this is the 
first time these 2mAbs are combined in a clinical setting, the recommended, bio logically  active 
dose of pembro lizumab was selected and it was chosen to use a DLT -driven design to escalate 
necitumumab to MTD.
Although the exposure -response analysis o f SQUIRE data showed an associat ion between drug 
exposure and efficacy , 
the vast m ajority of patients had sufficient exposure of necitumumab, as 
99.6% of patients had exposures superseding half-maximal effect ive concentration ( 82µg/mL) 
for OS, wi th the m edian exposure result ing in clo se to m aximum  efficacy .  Neci tumumab 
disposi tion showed a l ess-than-proporti onal dependence on pati ent body  weight.  Simulat ions 
based on popul ation PK ( PopPK )and ph armacodynamic models show that weight -or body  
surface area -based dosing would not lead to a decreased PK variabilit y or improvement of OS.
There was no cor relation detected between necitumumab PK and hepat ic or renal funct ion 
markers, and there were no differences in disposit ion across age, sex, or race (White vs. Asian).  
No clear rel ationship was observed between drug exposure and safet y events.  In summar y, 
PopPK/Pharmacodynamic analysis supports the administration of 800 mg necitumumab on 
Days 1 and 8 of a 21- day cycle as an appropriate dose in the target populat ion.
5.3. Pembrolizumab
Pembrolizumab [Keytruda (US)], a humanized monoclonal ant ibody  against the programmed 
death receptor -1 (PD -1) protein, has been developed by Merck & Co .for the treatment of 
patients wi th cancer. Pembro lizumab is approved for treatment of patients wi th melano ma in 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 25
LY3012211several countries; in the US and EU it is approv edfor the treatm ent of  patients wi th advanced 
(unresectable or metastatic )melanoma in adult s.  Pembro lizumab has also been approved for 
treatment of patients with NSCLC in several countries; in the US it is indicated for the treatment 
of patients wi th metastati c NSCLC whose tumors express PD -L1 as determined by  an FDA -
approved test and who have disease progression on or after plat inum -containing chemotherapy . 
Patients wi th NSCLC and EGFR or ALK geno mic tumor aberrations should also have disease 
progression on FDA -approved therapy  for these aberrati ons pri or to receiving pembrolizumab.
Pembrolizumab has demonstrated initial clinical efficacy in single arm mo notherapy  trials in 
subjects wi th non-small  cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcino ma, urothelial 
cancer, gastri c cancer, triple negat ive breast cancer and Hodgkin’s Lympho ma as determined by 
response rate.  Ongoing clinical trials are being conducted in these tumor ty pes as well as a 
number of other advanced so lid tumor indications and hematologic malign ancies.  For study  
details please refer to the IB.
5.3.1. Rationale for Pembrolizumab Dose Selection
The dose of pembro lizumab planned to be studied in this trial is 200 mg Q3W. The dose 
recent ly approved in the US and several other countries for treatment of melanoma subjects is 2 
mg/kg Q3W. Informat ion on the rationale for selecting 200 mg Q3W is summarized below.
In Keynote -001,an open -label Phase 1 clinical trial , conducted to evaluate the safet y, 
tolerabilit y, PK and pharm acodynamics , and ant i-tumor acti vity of pembro lizumab when 
administered as monotherapy .The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated 3dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) and dose expansio n cohorts 
evaluated 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W in subjects wi th advanced so lid tumors. All dose 
levels were well tolerated and no DLTs were observed. This first -in-human study  of 
pembro lizumab showed evidence of target engagement and object ive evidence o f tumor size 
reducti on at all dose levels. No MT D has been ident ified. In addit ion, 2randomized cohort 
evaluat ions of m elano ma patients receiving pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 
mg/kg Q3W have been co mpleted, and1randomized cohort evaluat ing10 m g/kg Q3W versus 
10 m g/kg Q2W has also been co mpleted. The clinical efficacy and safet y data dem onstrate a 
lack of clinically important differences in efficacy response or safet y profile across doses.
An integrated body  of evidence suggests that 200 mg Q3W is expected to provide similar 
response to 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W. Previously, a flat 
pembro lizumab exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safet y has been found in pat ients 
with melano ma in the range of doses between 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. Exposures for 200 mg 
Q3W are expected to lie within this range and will be close to those obtained wit h 2 m g/kg Q3W 
dose.   
A population PK model, which characterized the influence of body  weight and other pati ent 
covari ates on exposure, has been developed. The PK profile o f pembro lizumab is consistent 
with that of other humanized monoclonal ant ibodies, which typically have a low clearance and a 
limited vo lume of distribut ion.The di stribut ion of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose are 
predi cted to considerably overlap those obtained wit h the 2 mg/kg dose and importantly will 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 26
LY3012211maintain individual pat ient exposures within the exposure range established in melano ma as 
associ ated wi th maximal clinical response. Pharmacokinet ic properties of pembro lizumab, and 
specifically the we ight-dependency in clearance and volume o f distribut ion are consistent with 
no meaningful advantage to weight -based dosing relat ive to fixed dosing.
In translat ing to other tumor indicat ions, similarly flat exposure -response relationships for 
efficacy  and safety  as observed in subjects with melano ma can be expected, as the ant i-tumor 
effect of pembro lizumab is driven through immune system activat ion rather than through a direct 
interact ion with tumor cells, rendering it independent of the specific tumor type.In addit ion, 
available PK results in patients with melano ma, NSCLC, and other tumor types support a lack of 
meaningful difference in pharmacokinet ic exposures obtained at tested doses among tumor 
types. Thus the 200 mg Q3W fixed -dose regimen is con sidered an appropriate fixed dose for 
other tumor indicat ions as well.
A fixed -dose regimen will simplify the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and 
to reduce potential for dosing errors.  A fixed dosing scheme will also reduce complexit y in the 
logistical chain at treatment facilit ies and reduce wastage.   The exist ing data suggest 200 mg 
Q3W as the appropriate dose for pembrolizumab.  
5.4. Study Rationale
The purpose of this study  is to expl ore the efficacy and safet y of neci tumumab plus 
pembrolizumab in pat ients with Stage IV NSCLC who have progressed after 1 plat inum -based 
chemotherapy regimen .
Necitumumab (LY3012211) i s a recombinant human mAb of IgG1class, which targets EGFR.  
Necitumumab dem onstrates a hi gh affinit y to i ts target and blocks ligand -induced receptor 
phosphorylat ion and downstream signaling.  EGFR is detectable in approximately 85% to 90% 
of patients wi th NSCLC (Fontanini et al .1995; Pi rker et al .2009).   Pharmaco logic inhibit ion of 
EGFR signaling through compet itive inhibition of ligand binding has been shown to play a role 
in the treatment of several cancers, and EGFR mAbs are approved in various tumor indicat ions 
(Erbi tux PI/Sm PC, Vect ibix PI/SmPC).  Necitumumab (PORTRAZZA®) is indicated, in 
combinat ion with gemci tabin e and cisplat in, for thetreatment of adult patients wi th metastatic 
squamous NSCLC (Portrazza USPI/SmPC). The necitumumab SQUIRE trial showed 
statist ically significant improvements in OS and PFS, with an overall favorable benefit -risk 
profile.  In addit ion, a recent m eta-analysis invest igating the addit ion of an EGFR mAb to 
platinum -based first -line therapy demo nstrated a significant ly improved OS and PFS in patients 
with advanced NSCLC (Pujol et al. 2014).
Pembrolizumab (MK -3475, Key truda®) is a humanize d IgG4 mAb di rected against PD -1 T-cell 
co-receptor , thus blocking its interaction wit h ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2.  KEYTRUDA is 
indicated for the treatment of: (a) patients with unresectable or metastatic melano ma
(KEYTRUDA USPI/SmPC) ; (b) in the US, also f or patients with metastatic NSCLC whose 
tumors express PD -L1 as determined by  an FDA -approved test and who have disease 
progression on or after platinum -containing chemo therapy . Patients with EGFR or ALK 
geno mic tumor aberrations should have disease progr ession on FDA -approved therapy  for these 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 27
LY3012211aberrat ions prior to receiving KEYTRUDA (Keytruda USPI). Pembro lizumab is also 
investigated as a single agent or in combinat ion with chemotherapy or immunotherapy  in the 
treatm ent of Stage IVNSCLC.  So far, pooled efficacy  and safet y resul ts from several  ongoing 
single- agent Phase 1 trials wit h expansio n cohorts in NSCLC were reported.  Antitumor activit y 
was similar in squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC.  Treatment -naïve pat ients responded better 
than experienced on O RR, m PFS, and mOS (Garon et al. 2015 ).  The analysis was also 
perform ed in relat ion to the bio marker using IHC assay for PD -L1 expressio n,ident ifying 
patients wi th strongly posi tive, weak ,or negative PD-L1 expressio n.  PFS and OS were longer in 
patients wi th PD-L1 strong- positive versus PD -L1 weak -positive/ negat ive tumo rs(Garon et al. 
2015).
The rati onale for com binin g both agents is based on clinical single- agent data that show activit y 
of EGFR -directed mAbs and pembrolizumab in NSC LC, and preclinical data suggest ing that the 
antitumor activit y of EGFR ant ibodies can be attributed , at least in part, to various immune 
effector m echanisms:
EGFR signaling results in the loss of chemokine expressio n that m ediates tum or evasi on 
in cutaneo us squamous cell carcino ma (Pivarcsi et al. 2007) and was found to posit ively 
regul atePD-L1 expressio n in lung c ancer cells (Akbay et al. 2013).
EGFR ligand (amphiregulin) enhances function o f regul atory  T cells mediated by  the 
EGFR (Zaiss et al . 2013).
EGFR IgG1 antibody triggers activation of natural killer and dendrit ic cells fo llowed by 
development of tumor antigen-specific T- cell immunit y (Srivastava et al. 2013).
Hum an natural  killer cells increas e CD137 expressio n when exposed to col on and H&N 
cance r cells treated with EGFR IgG1 antibody .
The increase in CD137 -expressing NK cells is directly  correl ated to an increase in 
EGFR -specific CD8+ T cells (Kohrt et al. 2014).  
Hence, combinat ion of PD -1 and EGFR blockade may be a promising therapeutic strategy  to 
extend the duration of treatment response and delay  devel opment of resistance.
The individual toxicit y profile sof necitumumab and pembrolizumab suggest that no overlapping 
Grade ≥3toxici ty is expected; skin ras h Grade 1- 2 has been seen with both agents, hence so me 
overl ap is expected.

on the known safet y profile of necitumumab and pembrolizumab.
7.3. Discontinuation
The reason for discontinuat ion and the date of discontinuat ion will be collected for all patients.  
All enrolled patients who discont inue, regardless of whether or n ot they  received study  
treatm ent, will have procedures performed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).
Patients who are di scont inued fro m study  treatm entearly will have fo llow-up procedures 
perform ed as shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
If a patient withdraws informed conse nt, he or she must not be contacted unless he or she has 
explicit ly provided permissio n and consent.  Lilly may cont inue to use previously co llected 
medical research data prior to the withdrawal consistent with the original authorizat ion.
7.3.1. Discontinuation o fInadvertently Enrolled Patients
The cri teria for enrollment m ust be fo llowed explici tly. If the invest igator site ident ifies a patient 
who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertent ly enro lled, the sponsor must be 
notified.   If the sponsor ident ifies a pat ient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was 
inadvertent ly enro lled, the invest igator site will be notified .  A discussio n must occur between 
the sponsor clinical research physician ( CRP )and the invest igator to determine whether the 
patient may  cont inue in the study , with or wi thout study  drug .  Inadvertently enro lled patients 
may be maintained in the study  and on study  treatment when the Lilly CRP agrees with the 
investigator that it is medically appropriate for that patient. The patient may not continue in the 
study  with or wi thout study drug if the Lilly CRP does not agree with the investigator’s 
determinat ion it is m edically appropriate for the patient to continue. The invest igator must 
obtain docum ented approval fro m the Lilly CRP to allow the inadvertently enro lled patient to 
continue in the study  with or wi thout study  drug .
7.3.2. Discontinuation of Study Therapy
Patients will be discont inued fro m the study  treatm entin the fo llowing ci rcumstances: 
Enrollment in any other clin ical tri al involving a study  drug or enrollment in any other 
type of medical research judged not to be scient ifically or medically  com patible wit h this 
study . 
The patient, for any reason, requi res treatm ent wi th another therapeuti c agent that has 
been dem onstrated to be effective for treatment of the study  indicati on;discont inuat ion 
from study  therapy  occurs pri or to introducti on of  the new agent.
Invest igator/Physician Decisio n
oThe invest igator/physician decides that the patient should be withdrawn fro m the 
study due to a n intercurrent illness or change in the patient’s condit ion that 
renders the patient unsuitable for further treatment in the opinio n of the 
investigator .

8.1. Summary of Study Design
Study  I4X-MC-JFCQ is an open- label, mult icenter Phase 1b study  with an expansio n cohort to 
investigate necitumumab in co mbinat ion with pembrolizumab in approximately 78 patients wi th 
Stage IV NSCLC ( AJCC Staging Manual, 7 thedition).
The study  consists of 3 parts:
Part A:  D ose-escalation partwith increasing doses of necitumumab (initially 600mg
and then 800 m g on Day s 1 and 8 Q3W )to determine a recommended dose for
necitumumab that may be safely  administered in combinat ion with a fixed regimen of 
pembro lizumab 200mg on Day 1 Q3W inpatientswith Stage IV NSCLC.
Part B (Expansio n Cohort ):  Dose confirmationofnecitumumab in co
mbinat ion with a 
fixed regimen of pembro lizumab 200 m gon Day  1 Q3W and explorat ionof clinical
antitumor activit yin pat ients with Stage IV NSCLC .
Part C (Japanese pat ients):  DLT confirmat ion using the recommended dose f rom Part 
A for necitumumab in combinat ion with a fixed regimen of pembro lizumab 200 mg on 
Day 1 Q3W in Japanese pat ientswith Stage IV NSCLC .  
In Part B, approximately 54patients will be enrolled with an approximately even split between 
squamous and nonsquamous histology .
Figure JFCQ .8.1illustrates the study  design.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 38
LY3012211* Part C will first enroll 6 patients. If 2 out of 6 patients experience DLT s, the sponsor will examine the safety data 
and consult with an external committee as needed.  The sponsor will decide if the dose is intolerable, or if additional 
patients will be enrolled to the same dose level (or lower dose level) for further investigation.   If additional patients 
are needed, 6 additional Japanese patients will be enrolled (to maximum of 12 Japanese patients in Part C).

Note:  At the time of approval o f the JFCQ (c) protocol  amendment, all patients who are still on 
the study  will be administered necitumumab I.V. infusio n over 60 minutes.
A maximum of 12evaluable patients with Stage IV NSCLC will be enro lled inPart A.   Any 
patient who i s discontinued fro m the study  before complet ing Cycle 1 will be excluded fro m the 
DLT popul ation, unless a DLT was observed.  Patients who do not complete C ycle 1 for reason 
other than DLT will be replaced .
If 1of 3 pati ents in cohort 1 experiences a DLT during Cycle 1, 3 additional pat ients will be 
enrolled in thecohort.   If ≥2of 6patients experience a DLT in Cohort 1, the study  must be 
discontinued.
Cohort 2 will enro ll 6 pat ients.  If ≤1 of the 6 pati ents develops a DLT, Cohort 2 dose will be the 
recommended Phase 2 dose.  If ≥ 2 of the 6 patients e xperie nce a DLT in Cohort 2 , then the dose 
in Cohort 1 will be the MTD.
Dose e scalat ion within a cohort will not be permitted . Patients assigned to a cohort dose level 
will remain at that level throughout the study .  Patients who withdraw from the study  during the 
DLT period for reasons other than a treatment -related toxici ty may be repl aced wi thin the same 
dose l evel.
Necitumumab plus pembro lizumab may be continued at the assigned dose level unt il disease 
progression, the development of unacceptable toxicit y orwithdrawal o f consent by  the patient, or 
sponsor/invest igator decisio n.
Part B :
Part B will enro ll approximately 54 pat ients.  It is a single -arm study  to eval uate efficacy and 
safet y of necitumumab in co mbinat ion with pembrolizumab in pat ients with Stage IV 
squamous or nonsquamous NSCLC (Figure JFCQ .8.1).  Pati ents will be treated with 
pembro lizumab 200 m g on Day  1 Q3W and the dose of necitumumab identified fro m Part A 
of the study  on Days 1 and Day  8 Q3W .
Provi ded there is an acceptable safet y profile in Part A of this study , Part B will be init iated, 
which will include an interim safet y analysis after the first 15 evaluable patients have co mpleted 
2cycles o f study  treatm ent (or otherwi se discont inued study  treatm ent).  Patients with squamous 
and nonsquamous NSCLC from Part A who received the recommended necitumumab dose for 
Part B will be included in the safet y interim analysis.   
The final analysis for all outcom es for Part B will be perform ed approximately 6 months after 
completing enrollment of the study  popul ation.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 40
LY3012211A treatment cy cle will  be defined as 21 day s.  Study  therapy , consist ing of necitumumab plus 
pembro lizumab ,will cont inue until there is a radiographic documentation of PD, toxicit y 
requi ring cessat ion, protocol  nonco mpliance, or withdrawal of consent . Discont inuat ion of 
treatm ent m ay be considered for patient s who have attained a confirmed CR that have been 
treated for at least 24 wee ks from Cycle 1 Day 1 with pembro lizumab and neci tumumab or 
pembro lizumab alone and had at least 2 treatments with pembrolizumab with or wi thout 
necitumumab beyo nd the date when the init ial CR was declared .  
Part C :
Part C will only enroll pat ientsfrom Japan .  It i s a single -arm study  to evaluate safet y and 
tolerabilit y of necitumumab at the recommended dose ident ified from Part A of the study  on 
Days 1 and Day  8 Q3W in combinat ion with pembrolizumab 200 m g on Day  1 Q3W in 
Japanese patients with st age IV NSCLC (Figure JFCQ .8.1).  
Part C will first enroll 6 pat ients.  If 2out of 6 patients experience DLTs , the sponsor will 
examine the safet y data and consult with an external co mmit tee as needed. The sponsor will 
decide if the dose i s intol erable, or if addit ional patients will be enro lled to the same dose 
level (or lower dose level) for further invest igation.  If addit ional pat ients are needed, 6 
additional Japanese pat ients will be enrolled (to maxi
mum o f 12 Japanese patients in P art C).  
Terms used to describe the periods during the trialare defined below:
Baseline:   begins when the ICF is signed and ends at the first study treatment (or at 
discontinuat ion, if no treatm ent is given) .
Study Period:   begins at the first study treatment and ends at study  com pletion.The 
study  period does not i nclude the continued access period .
oStudy Treatment Period :  begins at the first study treatment and en ds when the 
patient and the invest igator agree that the patient will no longer continue study  
treatm ent.  The date of this agreement is to be reported on the case report form 
(CRF)as the Date of Discontinuation fro m study  treatm ent.
Postdiscontinuation Follow -Up:  begins the day  after the pati ent and the 
investigator agree that the patient will no longer cont inue study  treatm ent.
Short -term follow -upbegins the day after the pati ent and the invest igator agree 
that the patient will no longer cont inue study  treatment and lasts approximately 
30days.
Long -term follow -upbegins theday after short -term follow-up is completed and 
continues unt il the pat ient’s death or overall study  com pletion.
Continued Access Period:   begins after study  complet ion and ends at the end of trial .  
During the continued access period,patients on study  treatm ent who con tinue to 
experience clinical benefit and no undue risks may conti nue to receive study  treatm ent 
until one of the criteria for discont inuat ion is met.  The continued access period includes 
continued access follow-up.

LY3012211Patients who are in long -term follow-up when the continued access period begins will be 
disconti nued fro m long-term follow-up.
During the continued access period, a ll AEs, SAEs, and study  drug exposure will be reported on 
the CRF.  Serious adverse events will also be r eported to Lilly Glo bal Pat ient Safet y (see 
Secti on10.2.1 ).  In the event that an SAE occurs, Lilly may request addit ional informat ion (such 
as local laboratory  resul ts, concomi tant m edicat ions, and hospitalizations) in order to evaluate 
the reported SAE. Blood sam ples for PK and immunogenicit yanalysis for necitumumab will be 
collected inthe event of an IRR and during the continued access follow-up.
During the continued access period, the sponsor will co
llect only the data shown in 
Attachm ent 1 .  It is recommended that routine monitoring, using an assessment schedule similar 
to that outlined in Attachment 1 (including radiographic evaluat ion of disease), be continued as 
necessary  to confirm  patient eligibili ty to continue on treatment.  However, the results of all 
these assessments may not be routinely co llected by the sponsor, and all nonmandatory  
assessments ( that is, all assessments not explicit ly described in Attachment 1 ) may be performed 
locally rather than centrally.
8.2. Discussion of Design and Control
In thi s open -label , Phase 1b study with an expansion cohort , the selected fixed -dose of 
pembro lizumab of 200 mg on Day 1 Q3W is an experimental  dose but t he differences in 
exposure for a 200 -mg fixed -dose regimen relat ive to a 2 -mg/kg Q3W body weight -based 
regimen registered currently for melanoma indicat ion are anticipated to remain well wit hin the 
established exposure margins for this compound.   The starting dose of necitumumab in Part A
(patients wi th Stage IV NSCLC) will be at dose l evel -1of the MTD (600 mg on Days 1 and 8 
Q3W ).  Since this is the first time these 2mAbs are combined in a clinical setting ,the 
recommended, bio logically  active dose of pembrolizumab was selected and it was chosen to use 
a DLT -driven design t o escalate necitumumab to MTD.
Patients wi th Stage IV NSCLC who have progressed after 1 platinum -based chemotherapy 
regimen will receive a combinat ion of necitumumab and pembro lizumab .  Prior treatm ent wi th 
EGFR -TKI, VEGF/VEGFR -targeting agents ,and ALK inhibitors is permitted.
In Part B ,approximately 54 patients with Stage IV NSCLC with an approximately  even split 
between squamous and nonsquamous histology  will be enro lled to enable evaluat ion of safet y 
and ef ficacy  parameters by  histol ogy.
Provi ded there is an acceptable safet y profile in Part A of this study , Part B will be init iated, 
whic h will include an interim safet y analysis after the first 15 evaluable patients have co mpleted 
2cycles o f study  treatm ent (or otherwi se discont inued study  treatm ent).  Patients with squamous 
and nonsquamous NSCLC from Part A who received the recommended necitumumab dose for 
Part B will be included in the safet y interim analysis.
In Part C , 6-12 Japanese patients with Stage IV NSCLC with squam ous and nonsquam ous 
histol ogy will be enrolled to enable evaluation of safet y and ef ficacy parameters using a fixed

The outcome will be hypothesis generating only, allowing for future consolidation of this 
regimen depending on the outcome.

LY30122119.Treatment
9.1. Treatments Administered
The fo llowing treatm ents will  be administered in this study (Table JFCQ. 9.1):
In Part A, patients will receive I.V.necitumumab 600 m gor800 mg on D ay 1 and Day 8 Q3W
in combinat ion with pembro lizumab 2 00 m g as an absol ute dose on D ay 1 Q3W .
In Part B and Part C ,the necitumumab dose ident ified fro m Part A will be given on D ay 1 and 
Day 8 Q3W in co mbination wit h pembro lizumab 200 mg as an absolute dose D ay 1 Q3W .
Pembrolizumab will be administered first followed by  necitumumab .

aSites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  However, given 
the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window between -5 mi nutes and +10 minutes is permitted 
(i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes −5 min/+10 min , i.e., between 25 to 40 minutes ).
bAt the time of approval of the JFCQ (c) protocol amendment, all patients who are still on the study will be 
administered necitumumab I.V. infusion over 60 minutes .
Based on the independent necitumumab and pembrolizumab clinical development program s, 
the individual reco mmended dose s are 800 m g on Day 1 and Day 8 Q3W for necitumumab 
and 200 mg on Day  1 for pembro lizumab .For this reason ,further dose escalation beyo nd 
Cohort 2 will not be tested.

LY3012211Hypersensi tivity/infusi on-related reactions (IRRs) may occur during or fo llowing administration 
of neci tumumab (see Sect ion9.4.1.3.1 for a definit ion of Grade 3 and 4 hypersensit ivity/IRRs ).  
As a routine precaut ion, pati ents treated with necit umumab shoul d be observed closely  for any  
potenti al adverse effects by the medical staff from the start of the infusion unt il at least 1 hour 
after the end of the infusio n in an area with resuscitation equipment and other agents (for 
example, epinephrine or predniso lone equivalents ) available.
The invest igator or his/her designee is responsible for the fo llowing:
explaining the correct use of the drugs and planned duration of each individual’s 
treatm ent to the patient,
verifying that instructions are fo llowed properly, 
maintaining accurate records of study  drug dispensing and collect ion, 
and returning all unused medicat ion to Lilly or its designee at the end of the study .
Note : In some cases, sites may destroy  the m aterial  if, during the invest igator site select ion, the 
evaluator has verified and documented that the site has appropriate facilit ies and wri tten 
procedures to dispose clinical trial materials.
Patients will  be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they  have a com plaint 
or probl em with the study  drug so that the situation can be assessed.

9.3. Method of Ass ignment to Treatment
An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be utilized for drug dispensing for Parts A, 
B,
and Cof the study .
For pati ents in Part B ,enrollment will be balanced toinclude approximately  50% squam ous and 
50% nonsquamous pat ients.  Patients will be registered in the IWRS, which consists of assigning 
a unique study  identificat ion number and entering the pat ient’s tumor histology  type (squam ous 
vs. nonsquamous).  Once the patie nt is registered in the IWRS, he or she is considered being 
enrolled in the study .  Enrollment into the IWRS will be disabled once enrollment goals have 
been met for both histology  types.
9.4. Selection and Timing of Doses
The first treatment will be administered within 7 days of enro llment .  Study  treatm entwill be 
administered as described in Sect ion9.1.
A cycle is defined as an interval of 21 days .
Administrati on of  pembro lizumab Day 1 dose , followed by  neci tumumab will trigger the start of 
a new cycle.  I nfusio ns administered within 3days before or after the planned infusio n time point 
due to holidays, weekends, bad weather, or other unfor eseen circumstances will be permitted and 
not coun ted as a protocol  deviat ion.  The necitumumab Day  8 dose can be delayed up to 5 day s.  
Beyond that, the Day  8 dose will have to be omitted in order to maintain the 21 day  cycle.  A 
minimum of 7days ’interv al between any necitumumab dose smust be maintained.
A pat ient may cont inue to receive study  treatm entuntil he or she meets 1 or more of the 
specified reasons for discontinuation (as described in Section 7.3), or complete remissio n is 
diagnosed (as described in Section 8.1).
9.4.1. Special Treatment Considerations
9.4.1.1. Dose -Limiting Toxicity (Part s Aand C )
A DLT is defined as one of the fo llowing AE s,occurring in Cycle 1 if considered to be 
definitely, probably, or possibly related to necitumumab and pembro lizumab . The fo llowing list 
will define DLT:

9.4.1.2.2. Necitumumab
Prior to each administration of necitumumab ,all toxicit ies associ ated wi th neci tumumab must 
have reso lved to Grade ≤2 (except for alopecia and skin toxicit y) or baseline.  Pretreatm ent 
laboratory  data m ay not be ol der than 72 hours (Day 1 of each cycle) or 24 hours (Day  8 of each 
cycle).
If the criteria are not met at the time of a planned treatment, the fo llowing general  rules for the 
management of treatment delays apply :
In the cas e of reversible Grade3-4 necitumumab -related toxici ty(for example , 
fatigue, anorexia, and fever) , administration of necitumumab will be at the 
reduced dose (refer to Section 9.4.1.2.2.1 ) or interrupted, but pembrolizumab will 
continue according to the planned schedule.
If administration of necitumumab is delayed for more than 6 weeks (2 cycles) 
after Day  1 of the m ost recent treatm ent cy cle,the patientshoul d be discontinued 
from necitumumab treatment .
9.4.1.2.2.1. Necitumumab Dose Modifications
The fo llowing are general dose -modificat ion gui delines for toxici ty associ ated wi th 
necitumumab.  Please see Section 9.4.1.3 for specific informat ion on the m anagement of 
necitumumab -related hy persensi tivity/IRRs , skin reacti ons, conj unctivitis, and hypomagnesemia.
For pati ents starting C ycle 1 in Part A and possible Part B of the study  at neci tumumab 600 m g 
on Day s 1 and 8, onedose reduction is permitted.  Patients who cannot tolerate necit umumab 
400mgshoul d discont inue necitumumab; such patients may continue wit h pembro lizumab as a 
single agent.
For pati ents starting 
Cycle 1 at dose level 800 mg on Day s 1 and 8 in Part A and possible Part B
and Part C of the study , 2dose reduction sareallowed following reversible CTCAE Grade ≥3
AEs that requi re del ay of  necitum umab treatm ent for up to 6 weeks following Day 1 of the most 
recent treatment cy cle, unless DLT cri teria are m et (Cycle 1 Parts Aand C ).  In this setting, 
necitumumab may be re -administered at a reduced dose (600 mg) if necessary only if AE i s 
resolved to Grade ≤2.A second dose reduction is permitted f or thi s level  of event (Grade ≥3).  
Necitumumab must be discontinued if further dose reduction is required beyo nd 400mg on Day s

I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 52
LY3012211Necitumumab dose adj ustments are allowed both within a cycle and between cycles.
Necitumumab may  be held up to 6 weeks (2 cy cles) to permit sufficient time for recovery  from 
the toxicit y.  If a dose delay occurs, the invest igator m ay resume necitumumab dosing at the 
same dose level for the remainder of the study  or at reduced dose (assuming resolut ion to at l east 
Grade 1 for nonhematologic and at least Grade 2 for hematologic toxicit y).  If the pati ent 
experiences the same to xicity with the same or greater severit y (CTCAE grade) requiring a dose 
delay within a cycle or at start of the next cycle, the patient must be dose reduced and not 
re-challenged a second time at the pri or dose l evel.
If a patient experi ences CTCAE Grade ≥ 3hematol ogic toxici ty possibly related to necitumumab , 
unless DLT criteria are met, then dosing must be delayed (until the toxicity resolves to either 
baseline or at least Grade 2) and the dose of necitumumab must be reduced by 1 dose l evel (see 
below).
If a patient experiences CTCAE Grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicit y possibly related to 
necitumumab , unless DLT criteria are met, then dosing must be delayed (until the toxicit y 
resolves to either baseline or at least Grade 1) and the dose of necitumumab must be reduced by 
1dose l evel (see bel ow).
For pati ents requi ring dose reduction(s), any  re-escal ation to a prior dose level is permitted only 
after consul tation wi th the Lilly CRP.  After re -escalat ion, subsequent dose adjust ments should 
be based on the dose of neci tumumab that the pati ent is current ly receiving.  Following a dose 
reducti on, the dose of necitumumab may be re -escal ated to the pre -reduction dose, provided that 
at least 2 administrations of the reduced dose were given ,and only afterconsultat ion with the 
Lilly CRP .

In Study JFCB (INSPIRE), which invest igated necitumumab in co mbinat ion with pemetrexed
and cisplat in (PC+N) in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, patients experienced an increased 
rate of serious thromboembo lic events (including fatal events) in the PC+N Arm as co mpared to 
pemetrexe dand cisplat in (PC) alone.  Furthermore, the addition o f necitumumab did not improve 
the efficacy  outcom e over PC al one in advanced nonsquamous NSCLC . Administrati on of  
necitumumab in co mbinat ion with pemetrexed and ci splat in is not recommended.
Disconti nuati on of  necitumumab in pat ients who experience a VTE or ATE should be considered 
after a thorough benefit -risk assessment for the individual patient.
9.4.1.3.6. Pneumonia and Sepsis
During the conduct of Study  JFCL (JFCL; Phase 2 study  to invest igate carboplat in and so luble 
paclitaxel wit h or without necitumumab in pat ients with squamous NSCLC), following the non -
blinded review o f SAE cases that included reports related to pneumonia and sepsis, an imbalance 
in the number of SAEs, including f atal cases, for the necitumumab group compared with the 
paclitaxel -carbopl atin group was found.
The early occurrence of a number of these cases may  have indicated an issue regarding the 
enrollment of the appropriate patients.  The sponsor had therefore pro vided clarification and 
reinforcement of the inclusio n/exclusio n criteria, request ing the invest igator’s particular attention 
with regard to infect ions and condit ions predi sposing to infect ions ongoing at the time of 
enrollment in a protocol amendment.  Du ring the further conduct of this trial, only single 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 59
LY3012211additional reports were received, notably  of cases reporting pneumo nia and sept ic co mplications 
with concurrent neutropenia.
The review of the data from the Phase 3 study  ofnecitumumab in co mbinat ion with gemci tabine
and cisplat in (JFCC ; SQUIRE ) did not show any  evidence of an increased risk of serious lung 
infect ionsor neutropenia associated with necitumumab in this co mbinat ion.
9.4.1.3.7. Cardiorespiratory Disorders
An increased frequency o f cardi orespi ratory  arrest or sudden death was observed with 
necitumumab.  Cardiorespiratory  arrest or sudden death was reported in the pivotal Study  JFCC 
(SQUIRE) in 2.8% (15/538) of patients treated with necitumumab plus g emci tabine and cisplat in 
compared to 0.6% (3/541) of patients treated with chemotherapy alo ne.  Twelve of the 15 
patients di ed wi thin 30 days of the l ast dose of necitumumab and had comorbid condit ions, 
including history  of chronic obstructive pulmo nary di sease (n=7), hypertensio n (n=5) , 
hypo magnesemia (n=4), and coronary  artery  disease (n=3) .  Eleven of the 12 patients had an 
unwit nessed death.
9.4.2. Supportive Care Guidelines for Pembrolizumab
Patients should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deem ed necessary  by the treating 
investigator.  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of AEs with potenti al 
immuno logic etio logy are outlined below. Where appropriate, these guidelines include the use 
of oral or intravenous treatment with cort icosteroi ds as well as addit ional ant i-inflammatory  
agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several 
courses of steroid tapering may be necessary, as symptom s may  worsen when the steroi d dose i s 
decreased. For e ach disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes, such as 
metastati c disease or bacteri al or vi ral infect ion, which might require addit ional supportive care.
The treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the invest igator determine s the events 
to be rel ated to pembrolizumab.
Note: if after the evaluat ion the event is determined not to be related, the invest igator does not 
need to fo llow the treatm ent gui dance (as outlined below ). Refer to Section 9.4.1.2.1.1 for dose 
modificati on.
It may be necessary  to perform  condi tional procedures such as bronchoscopy , endoscopy , or skin 
photography  as part of evaluat ion of the event.
9.4.2.1. Immune -Mediated Pneumon itis
Patients who experience Grade 2 events shall be treatedwith systemic corticosteroids. When 
symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and continued over at least
4 weeks.
Grade 3 -4 events shall immediately  be treatedwith intravenous steroids.   Additional ant i-
inflammatory  measures can be administered , as needed.  P embrolizumab shall be withhel d for 
moderate (Grade 2) pneumonit is, and permanent ly discontinue dpembrolizumab for severe
(Grade 3) or life -threatening (Grade 4) pneumonit is.

[DKA]) or ≥ Grade 3 Hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) 
or metabolic acidosis (DKA) or T1DM or Grade 3 -4 Hyperglycemia
Insulin replacement therapy  is recommended for type I diabetes mellitus and for Grade 3-4 
hyperglycemia associated with metabo lic acidosis or ketonuria.
Patients shall be evaluated with serum glucose and a metabo lic panel, urine ketones, 
glycosylated hemoglo bin, and C -peptide.
9.4.2.3. Immune -Mediated Hypophy sitis
Grade 2 events shall be treatedwith corticosteroids. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or 
less, steroid taper shoul d be started and continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of 
appropriate hormones may be required as the steroid dose is tapered.
Grade 3 -4events shall be treatedwith an init ial dose of I .V.corticosteroids fo llowed by  oral 
corticosteroi ds. When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over at least4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as the 
steroi d dose i s tapered .
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for moderate (Grade 2) hy poph ysitis, withho ld or discont inued 
for severe (Grade 3) hy pophysi tis, and permanently discont inuedfor life -threatening (Grade 4) 
hypophysit is.
9.4.2.4. Immune -Mediated 
Hyperthyroidism or H ypothyroidism
Thyroid disorders can occur at any  time during treatment. Patients shall be monitored for 
changes in thy roid functi on (at the start of treatment, periodically  during treatm ent, and as 
indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of thyro id disorders .
Grade 2 hyperthy roidism  events (and Grade 2 -4hypothy roidism ):
In hyperthy roidism , non -select ive beta-blockers ( for example, propranol ol) are suggested as 
initial therapy. Thyroid hormone replacement therapy, with levothy roxine or liothy ronine, is 
indicated per standard of care. Isolated hypothy roidism may  be managed wit hout treatment
interrupti on and wi thout corti costeroi ds.
Grade 3 -4hyperthy roidism
Treat ment with an init ial dose of I .V.corticosteroid fo llowed by  oral corti costeroi dsis 
recommended . When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks. Replacement of appropriate hormones may be required as 
the steroi d dose is tapered .
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for severe (Grade 3) hy perthy roidism, and permanent ly 
discont inued for life -threatening (Grade 4) hyperthyro idism.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 61
LY30122119.4.2.5. Hepatic Injury
For Grade 2 immune -mediated hepatit is, liver function tests must be monitored more frequent ly 
until returned to ba seline values (consider weekly).  Treat ment with I.V.or oral corticoster oids
shall be considered .
For Grade 3 -4immune -mediated hepat itis, intravenous corti costeroi ds are recommended for 
24to 48 hours.
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, a steroid taper should be started and continued over 
no less than 4 weeks .
If a patient experiences elevated ALT > 3× ULN and/or elevated total bilirubin >2× ULN, clinical 
and laboratory  monitoring m ay be init iated, at the d iscretion of  the invest igator.   
For patients 
with liver metastasi s who begin treatment with Grade 2 AST or ALT, i f AST or ALT increases 
by greater than or equal to 50% relative to baseline and lasts for at least 1 week, then pat ients 
shoul d be discont inued.
Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed laboratory  
test abnorm alities.  To ensure patient safety  and comply  with regulatory  guidance, the 
investigator is to consult with the Lilly CRP regarding collect ion of specific reco mmended 
clinical informat ion and fo llow-up laboratory  tests.  See Site Gui dance Docum ent for 
Drug -Induced Liver Injury  (DILI ).
9.4.2.6. Renal Failure or Immune -Mediated Nephritis
In case of Grade 2 events, treat ment with corti costeroi dsis recommended.
Patients that experience Grade 3 -4events shall be treatedwith systemic corticosteroids.
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and conti nued over 
no less than 4 weeks.
Pembrolizumab must be withheld for moderate (Grade 2) nephrit is, and p ermanent ly 
discontinued forsevere (Grade 3) or life -threatening (Grade 4) nephrit is.
9.5. Blinding
This is an open -label study .
9.6. Concomitant Therapy
Appropriate documentation of all forms of premedicat ions, supportive care, and concomitant 
medicat ions m ust be captured at each visit in the CRF.  Concomitant medicat ions and supportive 
care therapi es must also be documented at the time of discont inuat ion and at the 30-day 
short -term follow
-up visi t.
With the exceptions listed in the sect ions below, no other chemotherapy, experimental 
medicat ions, other anticancer therapy or biological therapy , immunotherapy notspecified in this 
protocol , horm onal cancer therapy , radi ation, surgery  for cancer, or experimental medicat ions 
will be permitted while pa tients are on study  treatment.
Palliat ive radiotherapy, unless required due to PD,is permitted during the study .
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 62
LY3012211Radiation therapy  to a symptom atic solitary lesio n or to the brain may be considered on 
an except ional case -by-case basis after consultation with the sponsor.  The patientmust 
have clear measurable disease outside the radiated field.  Administration of palliat ive 
radiation therapy  will be considered clinical progressio n for the purposes of determining 
PFS.
Live vaccines wit hin 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treat ment and while part icipating in 
the trialare not allowed .  Exam ples o f live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: 
measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, y ellow fever, rabies, BCG , and ty phoid (oral ) vaccine. 
Seasonal influenza vaccines for inject ion are generally killed -virus vaccines and are allowed. 
However, intranasal influenza vaccines ( for example, Flu -Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines 
and are not allowed.
Systemic glucocorti coids for any  purpose other than to modulate symptom s from an AEof 
suspected immunologic et iologyare not permitted .  The use of physio logic doses of 
corticosteroi ds may  be approved after consultation with the sponsor. Inhaled steroids are 
allowed for management of asthma ; similarly, intranasal steroids f or rhini tis and/or sinusit is are 
allowed .
Patients who, in the assessment by  the invest igator, require the use of any of the aforement ioned 
treatm ents for clinical management should be removed fro m the trial .  Pati ents may receive other 
medicat ions that th e investigator deems to be medically necessary.
The exclusion criteria describe other medicat ions that are prohibited in this trial.
There are no prohibited thera pies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase.
9.6.1. Supportive Care
Palliat ive and supportive care for other disease- related symptoms and for toxicit y associ ated wi th 
treatm ent will be offered to all pat ients on this trial.  Supportive care measures may  include but 
are not limit ed to antidiarrheal agents, antiemet ic agents, opiate and nonopiate analgesic agents, 
appeti te stimulants, and granulocy te and ery throid growth factors.  Details of interventions, 
procedures, or blood products (for example, blood cells, platelets, or fresh frozen plasma 
transfusio ns) shoul d be recorded on the eCRF.  Pl ease see Sect ion9.4.1.3 for specific 
inform ation on the management of necitumumab -related hypersensit ivity/IRRs, skin react ions, 
conjunctivitis, electroly te abnorm alities, pneumo nia and sepsis, and seri ous thromboem bolic 
events.  Guidelines regarding the use of other specific supportive care agents are presented 
below .
9.6.2. Colony -Stimulating Factors and Erythropoiesis -Stimulating 
Agents
The use of co lony-stimulat ing factors (CSF s) or eryt hropoi esis-stimulat ing agents (ES As) are
permitted during investigational therapy at the discretion of the invest igator.
Because recommendat ions on the use of CSFs/ESAs are rapidly evo lving, invest igators should 
frequently refer to the local, nat ional, or internat ional standards ( for exam ple, European

Society of Hematol ogy, and/or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid S ervices Web sites) f or the 
latest guidelines .
9.6.3. Therapy for Diarrhea /Colitis
Patients should be carefully mo nitored for si gns and symptom s of enterocolit is (such as diarrhea, 
abdo minal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or wit hout fever) and of bowel perfor ation (such 
as peri toneal signs and ileus).
In the event of diarrhea, the following supportive measures are allowed:  hydrat ion, octreoti de, 
and ant idiarrheal s.
All patient s who experience diarrhea/co litis should be advised to drink liberal quant ities of clear 
fluids.  If  sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be subst ituted 
via I.V.infusio n.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, consider gastrointestinal consultat ion and 
endoscopy  to confi rm or rul e out colit is.
For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis , oral  corti costeroi dsare recommended .
For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis , intravenous steroids fo llowed by  high dose oral  
steroi dsare recommended . 
When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.
If diarrhea is severe (requiring intravenous rehydration) and/or associated with fever or severe 
(Grade 3 or 4) neutropenia, broad- spectrum ant ibiotics must be prescribed.  Patients with 
Grade ≥3 diarrhea or any  diarrhea associ ated wi th Grade ≥3 nausea or vomit ing must be 
hospitalized for intravenous hydration and correctio n of electroly te imbalances.   
Events that 
requi re a pati ent to be hospi talized are considered SAEs (see Section 10.2.1.1 ).
Pembrolizumab shall be withheld formoderate (Grade 2) or severe (Grade 3) colit is, and 
perm anent lydiscont inuedfor life -threatening (Grade 4) colit is.
9.6.4. Antiemetic Therapy
The use of antiemet ic agents is permitted during this study.
9.6.5. Analgesic Agents
The use of analgesic agents is permitted at the discretion of the invest igator.
9.6.6. Bispho sphonates and RANK -L Targeted Agents
Patients wi th bone metastases present on baseline imaging are allo wed treatment
with 
bisphosphonates or receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand ( RANK -L)targeted 
agents (for example, denosumab), per respective approved labels.  Init iation of treatment with 
bone -modifying agents m ust begin at l east 7 days prio r to enrol lment .  Patients receiving 
bisphosphonates or RANK -L targeted agents should not switch treatments (for example, replace 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 64
LY3012211a bisphosphonate with denosumab) while on study  treatm ent.  However, except ional cases 
without evi dence of PD m ay be considere d in consul tation wi th the Lilly CRP.  These 
exceptional cases will not incur a protocol deviat ion.
9.6.7. Therapy for Febrile Neutropenia
Patients experiencing febrile neutropenia, especially  with diarrhea or dyspnea, should be 
managed in a hospital setting acco rding to standard procedures, with the urgent init iation o f 
intravenous ant ibiotic therapy.   Events that require a patient to be hospitalized are considered 
SAEs (see Section 10.2.1.1 ).
9.7. Treatment Compliance
Pembrolizumab and necitumumab will be administered I.V.at the invest igational site, under the 
direction of the invest igator. As a result, a patient’s compliance wit h study  drug administration 
isensured .  Pati ents shoul d attend scheduled clinic visits and must comply  with study  criteria 
under their control .
Patients who are significant ly noncom pliant will  be di scont inued fro m the study .  A pati ent will  
be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she delays therapy  for more than 6 weeks 
following Day 1 of the most recent cycle during the study .
The study  medicat ion will be administered only at the invest igational sites by  the authorized 
study  personnel.  As a result, treatment compliance is e nsured.
Potenti al discontinuati on of  a pati ent due to study  drug noncompliance will be discussed between 
the invest igator and the Lilly CRP before any determinat ion is made to discont inue the patient.

LY301221110.Efficacy , Safety  Evaluations, Sample Collection and 
Testing, and A ppropriateness of Measurements
Written inform ed consent m ust be obtained pri or to any  study -specific pretreatment evaluations.
Study  procedures rel ated to efficacy, safet y, and sample co llection and testing assessments and 
their timing are descr ibed in the sections below and shown in the Study  Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ).
10.1. Efficacy Measures
10.1.1. Efficacy Assessments at Baseline and during Study Treatment
Within 21 days before the first dose of study  drug, baseline tumor measurements will be 
perform ed on each pati ent.  Throughout the study , pati ents will  be evaluated for response 
according to RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al . 2009 ). For the purpose of patient management, 
RECIST 1.1withadaptation (irRECIST) will be used to assess tumor response (see 
Secti on10.1.5.1 ).
A contrast c omputed tom ography  (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI )of the brain 
will be performed at pretreatment only, and thereafter approximately every  6 weeks ± 5days, if a 
patient had brain metastases at study  entry  or if clinically indicated.
Com puted tom ography , including spiral CT, scans and MRI are the preferred methods of 
measurement.
The m ethod of assessment used at baseline must be used consistent ly during the course of each 
patient’s evaluat ion during the study .
Imaging studies required to invest igate known disease shoul d be repeated every  6 weeks 
(±5days) following the first dose of study therapy, regardless of any treatment delays, unt il 
radiographic documentation of PD as defined by  RECIST 1.1 , with adaptati on described below 
in more detail  (irRECIST; see Secti on 10.1.5.1 ). 
CT of the chest and CT or MRI of the abdo men and pelvis is required at each time point;
CT/MRI of the brain must be performed if baseline assessment ident ified any lesio n in this area 
(or if clinically  indicated).
Responses (CR or PR ) must be confirmed at least28 day s from the fi rst evi dence of response .  
Thereafter, a responding patient will be fo llowed approximately every 6weeks (±5days) until 
objective progression is observed .
For pati ents continuing treatment after study  com pletion (continued access period ), efficacy 
assessments (frequency andtype of assessments) will be at the discretion of the invest igator, 
based on t he standard of care.
Response assessments during the ongoing trial (and related treatment decisio ns) will be 
perform ed by  the treati ng invest igator at the site in cooperation with the local radio logist(s).
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 66
LY301221110.1.2. Efficacy Assessments during the Study Period 
Postd iscontinuation Follow -Up
Postdiscontinuati on follow-up during the study  period will be conducted as described in the 
Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
For those patients who discont inue study  treatm ent wi thout obj ectively measured PD, the 
investigat ive sites will cont inue to monitor patients and periodically evaluate tumor response at 
the sam e frequency  and by the same method used at baseline and throug hout the study unt il the 
patient has object ive disease progression, starts a new ant icancer therapy ,or until study  
completion, whichever occurs first .After the patient has object ive disease progression (as 
determined using methodology  described below) or starts a new ant icancer therapy, radiologic 
tests are no longer required and the patient will be fo llowed up approximately every  3 months
[7days] unt il the patient’s death or overall study complet ion, whichever co mes first.
Response (CR or PR) should be confirmed before the init iation of addit ional ant icancer therapy . 
However, init iation of new therapy  shoul d not be delayed so lely to confirm response.
After patients have discont inued study  treatment, they may  receive addi tional anticancer therapy  
at the discretion of the invest igator.  These postdiscontinuat ion therapies mustbe documented on 
the CRF .
10.1.3. Primary Efficacy Measure (Part B only)
10.1.3.1. Tumor Imaging and RECIST Assessment
Local  site study  team  reading (invest igator assessment with site radio logy reading) based on 
RECIST 1.1 will be used to determine patienteligibilit y.  Tum or imaging shoul d be performed 
by CT (preferred).  MRI should only be used when CT is contraindicated or for imaging in the 
brain, but the same imaging technique should be used in a patientthroughout the trial.
Imaging should include the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
10.1.3.1.1. Initial Tumor Imaging
Initial tumor imaging at screening must be performed wit hin 2 1days pri or to the date of the first 
dose of tri al treatm ent.  The si te study  team  must review screening images to confirm the patient
has m easurable disease per RECIST 1.1. Scans performed as part of routine clinical 
management are acceptable for us e as initial tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic qualit y and 
perform ed wi thin 21days pri or to the date of first dose .
10.1.3.1.2. On Study Tumor Imaging
The first on -study  imaging assessment should be performed at 6weeks (± 5days) fro m the date 
of first dose of trial treatm ent.Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 6weeks 
(±5days) or m ore frequent ly only if clinically indicated.  Imaging should not be delayed for 
delays in any of the study  drug dosing. Continue to perform imaging unt il whichever of th e 
following occurs first: 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 67
LY3012211• Initial site-assessed disease progression is confirmed (Section 10.1.5.1 )
• The start of new ant i-cancer treatment
• Withdrawal o f consent
• Death 
• The end o f the study
10.1.3.2. Tumor R esponse Assessment
The primar y efficacy  measure is ORR as defined by  RECI ST 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al. 2009)
provi ded in Attachment 5 .  A responder is defined as any pat ient who exhibits a confirmed CR or 
PR.
Best response is deter mined from the sequence o f responses assessed.
Per RECIST 1.1, partial or complete response should be confirmed by a repeat tumor imaging 
assessment . A second assessment must be performed 28 days after the fi rst evi dence of 
response or at the next schedu led scan ( that is,6 weeks l ater), whi chever is clinically indicated .  
Two obj ective status determinat ions of CR before progression are required for a best response of 
CR.  Two determinat ions of PR or better before progression, but not qualifying for a CR, are 
requi red for a best response of PR.  B est response of SD is defined as disease that does not meet 
the criteria for CR, PR, or PD and has been evaluated at least 1 time, at least 6 weeks after the 
start of study  treatm ent.
Best response will be derived to encom pass all tumor assessments from baseline unt il the earliest 
of objective progression or start of new ant icancer therapy .  Any responses observed after 
objective progression or the start of new ant icancer therapy are excluded fro m the determinat ion
of best response.
The date of first documented object ive disease progressio n must be recorded on the CRF even if 
it occurs after the patient has started a new therapy.
10.1.4. Secondary Efficacy Measures
The secondary  efficacy measures ,including DCR, DOR, PFS, and OS ,will be co llected at the 
times shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachment 1 ).
10.1.5. Exploratory Efficacy Measures
10.1.5.1. Adapted RECIST 1.1 (irRECIST)
RECIS T 1.1 will be adapted to accoun t for the unique tumor response characterist ics seen wit h 
treatm ent of pembro lizumab. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembro lizumab may produce 
antitumor effects by  potenti ating endogenous cancer -specific immune responses. The response 
patterns seen with such an approach may extend bey ond the ty pical t ime course of responses 
seen with cy totoxi c agents, and can manifest a clinical response after an init ial increase in tumor 
burden or even the appearance of new lesio ns.  Stan dard RECIST 1.1assessment may not 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 68
LY3012211provi de an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as pembro lizumab.  
Therefore, RECIST 1.1 will be used wit h the fo llowing adaptations:
If radio logic imaging verifies init ial PD, tum or assessment sh ould be repeated ≥4 weeks 
later in order to confirm PD with the option of continuing treatment per Table JFCQ .10.1
below while await ing radio logic confirmat ion of progression.
If repeat imaging shows < 20% tum or burden com pared to nadi r, stabl e or improved 
previous new lesio n (if ident ified as cause for init ial PD), and stabl e/improved non -target 
disease (if i dentified as cause for init ial PD), treatm ent may  be cont inued/ resumed .
If repeat imaging confirm s PD due to any  of the scenarios list below, patients will be 
discontinued fro m study  therapy  and proposed best al ternative available.
In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or de creased, site study  team  
shoul d consider all  target lesi ons as well as non -target l esions.
Scenarios where PD is confirmed at repeat imaging:
Tumor burden remains ≥20% and at least 5 -mm absol ute increase com pared to nadi r
Non-target di sease result ing in initial PD is worse ( qualitative) 
New l esion resul ting in init ial PD is worse (qualitative)
Addit ional new l esion(s) since last evaluat ion
In patients who have init ial evidence of radio logical  PD,it is at the di scret ion of the treating 
physician whether to continue a patienton study  treatm ent until repeat imaging is obtained.  This 
clinical judgment decisio n should be based on the patient’s overall clin ical condit ion, including 
perform ance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory  data.  Patient s may receive 
pembro lizumab and necitumumab treatm ent while wai ting for confirmation o f PD if they  are 
clinically stable as defined by the fo llowing cri teria:
Absence of signs and symptoms (including worsening of laboratory  values) indicat ing 
disease progressi on
Nodecline in ECOG PS,apart fro m change from PS0 to PS1
Absence of rapid progression of disease
Absence of progressive tumor at crit ical anatomical sites ( for example , cord com pressi on) 
requi ring urgent alternat ive medical intervent ion
When feasible, patients shoul d not be discontinued from study  therapy until progression is 
confirmed.  This allowance to continue treatment despite init ial radio logic progressi on takes into 
account the observat ion that some patients can have a transient tumor flare in the firs t few 
months after the start of immunotherapy , but wi th subsequent di sease response.  Patients that are 
deem ed clinically  worsening/deteriorating are not required to have repeat imaging for 
confirmat ion of progressive disease (see Table JFCQ .
10.1).

10.1.6. Resource Utilization
Invest igators will be asked to document the use of best supportive care measures, conco mitant 
medicat ions, transfusio ns, and treatment -related hospitalization days.  Such assessments are to be 
taken throu ghout the study
 through the 30 -day short -term postdi scont inuat ion follow-up visit.
10.2. Safety Evaluations
Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pat ients who have entered this study  
and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any  event that seem s unusual, even if this event may be 
considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient.
The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study.
The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropria te heal th care opti on, 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study, or that caused the patient to discont inue 
before complet ing the study.  The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event is resolved or 
explained.  Frequency  of follow-up evaluati on is left to the discretion of the invest igator.
The timing of all safet y evaluat ions is shown in the Study  Schedule ( Attachm ent 1 ).

10.2.1. Adverse Events
Lilly has standards for reporting AEs that are to be fo llowed regardl ess of applicable regulatory  
requi rements that m ay be less stringent.  A clinical study  AE is any untoward medical event 
associ ated wi th the use of a drug in humans, whether or not it is consi dered rel ated to that drug .
Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical trials, because the purpose of the clinical trial is to 
establish drug effect.
Any clinically  significant findings from electrocardi ogram s (ECGs) , labs, vi tal sign 
measurements, or other procedures that result in a diagnosis should be reported to Lilly or its 
designee.
Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposures to study  treatm entshoul d 
be reported.  Data on fetal outcome and breast -feeding are collected for re gulatory  reporting and 
drug safet y evaluat ion.
Study  site personnel  will record the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing 
condi tions, including clinically  significant si gns and symptom s of the disease under treatment in 
the study .
After the ICFis signed, site personnel will record the occurrence and nature of any AEs and any 
change in the preexist ing condit ion(s).  All AEs related to protocol procedures are reported to 
Lilly or its desi gnee.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 72
LY3012211In addit ion, all AEs occurring after the patient re ceives the first dose of study  treatm entmust be 
reported to Lilly or its designee via eCRF.
Invest igators will be instructed to report to Lilly or its designee their assessment of the potential 
relatedness of each AE to protocol procedure, or study  treatm entvia eCRF.
The invest igator will decide whether he or she interprets the observed AEs as either reasonably 
possibly  related to di sease, to the study  medicati on, study  procedure, or other concomitant 
treatm ent or pathologies.  The invest igator answ ers Yes/No to make this assessment in relation to 
study  treatm ent and study  procedure.
Patients will  be evaluated for AEs at each visit and will be instructed to call their physician to 
report any  AEs between visit s.
The NCI -CTCAE v 4.0 will serve as the r eference document for choosing appropriate 
termino logy for, and grading the severit y of, all AEs and other symptom s.  For AEs without 
matching termino logy within the NCI -CTCAE v 4.0criteria, the invest igator will be responsible 
for selecting the appropria te system  organ class (SOC) and assessing severit y grade based on the 
intensity of the event.
In addit ion to collect ing the AE verbat im and the CTCAE severit y grade, AE verbat im text will 
also be m apped by Lilly or its designee to corresponding termino logywithin the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA ™) dicti onary .
If a patient’s dosage is reduced or treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study  site 
personnel must clearly  report to Lilly or its desi gnee via eCRF the circumstances and data 
leading to any  such dosage reduction or discont inuation of treatment.
10.2.1.1. Serious Adverse Events
An SAE is any  AEfrom this study  that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es:
death
a life
-threatening experience (that is, immediate risk of dying)
persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y
initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion
congenital ano maly/birth defect
considered significant by  the invest igator for any other reason
Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi talizati on may  be considered seri ous adverse drug events when, based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, they  may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in thi s definit ion.
Serious adverse event collect ion begins after the patient has signed informed consent and has 
received study  treatm ent.  If a patient experiences an SAE after signing informed consent, but 
prior to receiving study  treatm ent, the event will not be reported as serious unless the invest igator 
feels the event may have been caused by a protocol procedure.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 73
LY3012211Data on SAEs that occur before the end of trial will be stored in the collect ion database and the 
Lilly Safety  System .
Study  site personnel  must al ert Lilly or its desi gnee of  any serious adverse event (SAE) within 
24 hours of invest igator awareness of the event via a sponsor -approved method.  If study  site 
personnel contact Lilly or its designee by  telephone regarding an SAE, study  site personnel  must 
also immediately provide official notificat ion on study -specific SAE forms.
This 24 -hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up 
SAE informat ion.
Planned surgeries should not be report ed as SAEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has 
worsened during the course of the study .
Planned hospi talizat ions or procedures for preexisting condit ions that are already recorded in the 
patient’s medical history  at the time of study  enro llment sho uld not be consi dered SAEs.  
Hospitalization or prolongat ion of hospitalizat ion without a preci pitating clinical AE (for 
example, for the administration of study  treatm ent or other protocol -requi red procedure) shoul d 
not be considered SAEs.
Serious adverse events due to disease progressi on, including death, shoul d not be reported unless 
the invest igator deems them to be possibly related to the study  treatm ent.
The invest igator does not need to actively mo nitor pati ents f or AEs once the trial has ended, 
unless provided otherwise in the protocol ; however, i f an invest igator becomes aware of an SAE 
occurring after the patient’s participat ion in the trial has ended, and the investigator believes that 
the SAE is related to a protoco l procedure or study treatment , the invest igator should report the 
SAE to the sponsor, and the SAE will be entered in the Lilly Safety  System .
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  the sponsor in aggregate periodically during the course of the trial may  be 
found in the IB.
10.2.1.2. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions
Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed 
in the Development Core Safet y Informati on in the necitumumab IBand the Reference Safet y 
Inform ation inthe pembro lizumab IB ,and that the investigator identifies as related to the study  
treatm entor study  procedure.  United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Tria l 
Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory  requi rements 
in parti cipat ing countries require the reporting of SUSARs.  Lilly has procedures that will be 
followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global 
regul ations and associated detailed guidances.
10.2.1.3. Events of Clinical Interest -Pembrolizumab
The 2categori es of events of clinical inte rests ( ECIs )for pembro lizumab include:
1.an overdose of pembrolizumab ( ≥1000 m g [5 times the dose]) not associated with clinical 
symptoms or abnormal laboratory  resul ts, and
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 74
LY30122112.An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limi t of 
norm al (ULN) and an el evated total  bilirubin lab val ue that is greater than or equal to 2X 
ULN and, at the same t ime, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X ULN, 
as determined by  way of protocol -specified laboratory  testi ng or unschedu led laboratory  
testing.  Please refer to the Site Guidance Document for Drug -induced Liver Injury.
Secti on 9.4.2 describe ssupportive care measures for each selected pembrolizumab nonseri ous 
and serious adverse events .
10.2.2. Other Safety Measures
10.2.2.1. Electrocardiograms
For each patient, 12 -lead digital ECGs will be co llected according to the Study Schedule 
(Attachm ent 1 ) as single ECGs .  Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes 
before ECG collect ion and remain supine but awake during ECG collection.
ECGs may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically  necessary .  Collecti on of  
more ECGs than expected at a particular time point is allowed when needed to ensure high 
qualit y records.
ECGs will be interpreted by  a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the 
site as soon after the time o f ECG collect ion as possible, and ideally while the patient is still 
present, to determine whether the patient meets entry  criteria and for immediate patient 
management, should any clinically relevant findings be identified.
After enro llment, if a clinically significant increase in the QT/corrected QT interval fro m 
baseline, or other clinically significant quantitative or qualitative change from baseline, is 
present, the invest igator will assess the patient for symptoms (for e xample, palpitat ions, near 
syncope, syncope) and to determine if the pat ient can cont inue in the study .  The invest igator or 
qualified designee is responsible for determining if any change in pat ient management i s needed 
and must document his/her review of the ECG pr inted at the time of evaluation, and any alert 
reports.
10.2.3. Safety Monitoring
The Lilly CRP will mo nitor safet y data throughout the course of the study .
Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures.  The Lilly CRP or 
designee will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally  independent Gl obal Pat ient Safet y 
therapeuti c area physician or clinical scient ist, and review:
trends in safety  data
laboratory  analy tes 
adverse events 
If a patient experiences elevated ALT > 3× ULN and/or elevated total bilirubin >2× ULN, 
clinical and laboratory  monitoring may  be ini tiated, at the discretion of the invest igator
(see Section 9.4.2.5 )
.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 75
LY3012211Details for hepat ic monitoring depend upon the severit y and persistence of observed 
laboratory  test abnorm alities.  To ensure patient safet y and co mply with regulatory  
guidance, the investigator is to consult with the Lilly  CRP regarding collect ion of spec ific 
recommended clinical information and fo llow-up laboratory  tests.  See Site Gui dance 
Docum ent for DILI .
Inform ation on SAEs expected in the study  popul ation independent of drug exposure and that 
will be assessed by  Lilly in aggregate periodically  durin g the course of the trial may be found in 
the respective study  drug IB.In the NSCLC populati ons, the occurrence of
fatigue/weakness/asthenia, pain/chest pain, dyspnea, cough, nausea, anorexia/decreased appet ite,
disease progressi on, m etastasis, hemopt ysis, and pleural  effusio n are reasonably  anticipated due 
tothe underlying malignancy.
10.2.4. Complaint Handling
Lilly collects product complaints on study  drugs used in clinical trials in order to ensure the 
safet y of study  participants, m onitor quali ty, and to fa cilitate process and product improvements.
Com plaint s related to concomitant drugs/drug delivery systems are reported directly to the 
manufacturers of those drugs/devices in accordance with the package insert.
The invest igator or his/her designee is respon sible for handling the fo llowing aspects of the 
product complaint process in accordance wit h the instructions provided for this study :
recording a complete descript ion of the product complaint reported and any associated 
AEs using the study -specific co mplaint forms provided for this purpose
faxing the completed product complaint form wit hin 24 hours to Lilly or its desi gnee
If the invest igator is asked to return the product for invest igation, he/she will return a copy  of the 
product complaint form with the product.
10.3. Sample Collection and Testing
Samples co llected for this study  will be coded wi th the pati ent number.  The samples and any 
data generated from them can be linked back to the patient only by invest igator site personnel.
Attachm ent 1 lists the schedule for sample collect ions in this study.
Attachm ent 2 lists the specific tests that will be performed for this study and whether these will 
be perform ed at a central  or local laboratory .
Attachm ent 6 provides a summary o f the estimated maximum number and volume o f invasive 
samples, for all sampling, during the study .
10.3.1. Samples for Study Qualification and Health Monitoring
Standard laborator y tests, including chemistry , hematol ogy, coagul ation, and pregnancy  testing 
(ifapplicable in wo men of childbearing potential), will be performed and analyzed centrally. 
Urinalysis will be assayed by  invest igator -designated (l ocal) laboratory .Attachment 2 lists the 
laboratory  tests that will be performed for this study .  Central  laboratory  resul ts will  be used to 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 76
LY3012211determine patient eligibilit y atbaseline. Local laboratory  resul ts may  be used for on-study  
dosing decisio ns; if so, testing must also still be performed by the central laboratory. These 
central  laboratory  resul ts will be used for subsequent safet y analyses. In the event of minor 
discrepancies between local and central laboratory  results, the investi gator m ay use the l ocal 
resul ts for treatm ent decisio ns, and the central  laboratory  resul ts will  remain part of the safet y 
database.
Blood and urine samples will be collected at the times specified in the Study  Schedule
(Attachm ent 1 ).
Based on laboratory  safety  values, unscheduled hepatic mo nitoring tests ( see Site Gui dance 
Docum ent for DILI ) maybe perform ed as part of patient fo llow-up, in consultation wit h the Lilly
CRP .
Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory  safety  report.
Samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroyed wit hin 60 days of receipt of 
confirmed test results.  Tests are run and confirmed prompt ly whenever scient ifically 
appropriate.  When scientific circumstances warrant, however, it is acceptable to retain samples 
to batch the tests run, or to retain the samples until the end of the study  to confirm  that the resul ts 
are vali d.  Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary , to com ply with 
applicable laws, regulat ions, or l aboratory  certificati on standards.
10.3.2. Samples for Pharmacogenetics and Translational Research
Collect ion of samples for translational resea rch is also part of this study (see Attachm ent 1 and 
Attachm ent 6 ).
Requi red samples for bi omarker research to be collected from all pat ients in this study  are the 
following:
Tumor tissue:   archived tum or tissue available for bio marker analyses ,or pati ent is 
willing to undergo a tumor biopsy o f an extra -CNS lesio n. Submissio n of FFPE tumor 
tissue sample blo cks is preferred.
Who le blood sam ples
Plasma sam ples
Whole blood , plasma, and t issue samples will be collected to explore bio markers related to 
variable response to necitumumab and/or p embro lizumab ,the EGFR pathway , innate and 
adaptive immunit y, immune funct ioning, and/or the pathogenesis of lung cancer.  Analyses may 
include potential nucleic acid and protein markers to better understand the disease process, and 
to develop predict ive b iomarkers and diagnostics.
10.3.2.1. Whole Blood Sample for Genetic Research
A blood sam ple will be collected for pharmacogenetic analysis as specified in t he Study
Schedule ( Attachment 1 ),where local regulat ions allow .
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 77
LY3012211Samples will  notbe used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either 
now or in the future.  Samples will be used to investigate variable response to study  treatm ent 
and to investigate genetic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in NSCLC.  Assessment of variable 
response may include evaluat ion of AEs or differences in efficacy.  These studies may include 
but are not limited to EGFR pathway, immune cells/funct ion, and the mechanism  of action of 
necitumumab and pembro lizumab to evaluate their associat ion with observed response to study  
treatm ent.
All pharmacogenet ic samples will be coded with the patientnumber.  These samples and any 
data generated can be linked back to the patient only by the invest igator site personnel.  Samples 
will be retained for a ma ximum o f 15 years after the l ast patientvisit for the study, or for a 
shorter period if local regulat ions and/or ERBs impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected 
by the sponsor.  This retention period enables use of new techno logies, response to re gulatory  
questions, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in drug 
development or when the drug is commercially available.
Molecular techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore 
cannot be specifically  named.  However, exist ing approaches include who le geno me or exome 
sequencing, geno me-wide associ ation studies, candidate gene studies, and epigenetic analyses.  
Regardless of the techno logy utilized, genoty ping data generated will b e used only  for the 
specific research scope described in this sect ion.
10.3.2.2. Tumor Tissue Collection
The availabilit y of tum or tissues is important to better characterize the relat ionship of tumor 
biology and response evaluat ion in this study .
If a prior archive d tum or specimen is available, and unless restricted by  local regulati ons, 
submissio n of archived tumor tissue is mandatory .  If an archived specimen is not 
available, submission o f a newly  obtained bi opsy (obtained at baseline, during elect ive 
surgery ,orat the specified time points) i s requi red.
Tumor tissue should be provided in formalin or as an FFPE block ,or unstained slides.  
Due diligence should be used to make sure that tumor specimen (not a normal adjacent or 
a tum or margin sample) is provided.  Pathology  notes/report accom panying archival 
tissue m ay also be requested. The report must be coded with the patient number.
Personal ident ifiers, including the patient’s name and init ials,must be rem oved from  the 
institutional pathol ogy report pri or to submissio n. FFPE b locks will be sect ioned and 
returned to the site. Newly obtained blocks or tissue submitted in formalin and s lides will 
not be returned.
Tumor tissue will  be examined for bio markers related to NSCLC, necitumumab, pembro lizumab ,
and/or the mechanism o f action under investi gation (for example, EGFR pathway  and immune 
cells/funct ion).
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of 15 y ears after the last patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or ER Bs impose shorter time limits, at a facilit y 
selected by  the sponsor.  Thi s retent ion peri od enables use of new techno logies, response to 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 78
LY3012211regul atory  questi ons, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later 
in drug development or when the drug is co mmercially available.
Techno logies are expected to improve during the 15 -year storage period and therefore cannot be 
specifically named.  However, exist ing approaches including mutation profiling, copy  number 
variabilit y, gene express ion, and/or immunohistochemistry  may be perform ed on these ti ssue 
samples to assess potential associat ions wi th these bi omarkers and clinical outcomes.
10.3.2.3. Plasma and Whole Blood Sample sfor Biomarker Research
Plasma and whol e blood samples f or non -pharmacogen etic biomarker research will be co llected 
at the times specified in the Sampling Schedule ( Attachm ent 6 ),where local regulat ions and 
ERBs allow.
Samples will  be used for research on EGFR pathway  and immune cells/funct ion associated with 
NSCLC, m echanism  of action of necitumumab and pembrolizumab, and/or research method or 
in validating diagnostic tools or assay (s) rel ated to NSCLC.
All biomarker sa mples will be coded with the patient number.  These samples and any data 
generated can be linked back to the patientonly by the investigator site personnel.
Samples will  be retained for a m aximum  of 15 y ears after the last patient visit for the study , or 
for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected 
by the sponsor.  This retention period enables use of new techno logies, response to regulatory  
questions, and invest igation of variable response that may not be observed unt il later in drug 
development or when the drug is commercially available.
10.3.3. Samples for Immunogenicity Research
Blood sam ples f or immunogenicit y testing will  be collected to determine ant ibody  producti on 
against necitumumab .  Immunogenicit ywill be assessed by  a validated assay  designed to detect 
anti-drug ant ibodies in the presence of the necitumum ab and pembro lizumab .  Antibodi es may 
be further characterized and/or evaluated for their abili ty to neutralize the activit y of 
necitumumab .
Samples may be stored for a maximum of 15 y ears f ollowing l ast pati ent visi t for the tri al at a 
facilit y selected by  the sponsor to enable further analysis of immune responses to necitumumab.  
The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to regulatory  requests r elated to necitumumab.
10.3.4. Samples for Drug Concentration Measurements 
Pharmacokinetics
Pharmacokinet ic (PK) venous blood samples (also known as bioanaly tical samples ) for 
measurement of necitumumab serum concentrations will be collected as specified in the 
Pharmacokinet ic, Immunogenicit y, and Bl ood-Based Markers Sampling Schedule 
(Attachm ent 6).
Sampling times were selected to coincide with expected maximum concentration and minimum 
concentration of necitumumab and wit h consideratio n to draw minimum vo lume of blood from 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 79
LY3012211patients and ensuring that the patients do not to need to make an extra visit to provide these 
samples.
Instructi ons for the collect ion and handling of bioanalyt ical blood sam ples will be provided by  
the sponsor.  The actual start and end date and time of each infusio nadminist rationmust be 
recorded on the eCRF.  The actual date and time that each bioanalyt ical blood sample was drawn 
must be recorded on the laboratory  accessi on page after the sam ple is drawn.
Serum  concentration sof necitumumab will be determined using validated enzyme- linked 
immunosorbent assays at laboratories approved by the sponsor.
Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure necitumumab concentrati onswill be retained for a 
maximum o f 1 year following l ast pati ent visi t for the study .
10.4. Appropriateness of Measurements

LY301221112.Sample Size and Statistical Methods
12.1. Determination of Sample Size
A total o f approximately  78 patients for Part A ,Part B ,and Part C will be enro lled.  Part A 
requi res up to 12 treated patients (3 -6 for Cohort 1 and 6 for Cohor t2).  Patients with squamous 
and nonsquamous NSCLC from Part A who received the recommended necitumumab dose for 
Part B will also be analyzed together with Part B.  These Part A patients who received the 
recommended necitumumab dos e for Part B will also be included in the interim analys es as 
described in Section 12.2.12 .
Anevaluable patient for Part B will include any  patientenrolled in Part A and treated at the 
recommended Phase 2 doses of necitumumab and pembro lizumab.  In addit ion, pati ents will  be 
entered stri ctly to Part B (with a pproximately 54 evaluable pat ients in Part B).  To be evaluable 
forthe efficacy analysis o fstudy , these pati ents must m eet the following criteria:
(1) The patient has received at least 1 dose each of necitumumab and pembrolizumab .
(2) The patient has a co mplete radiographic assessment at baseline.
In Part C, approximately 6 -12 Japanese patients will be enro lled and treated with necitumumab 
at the recommended dose from Part A in co mbinatio n withpembro lizumab.
The primary analysis of the Part A and Part B will take place approximately 6months after the 
last pati ent evaluable for Part B portion of the study  has been enrolled.  The primary  Part B 
outcom e variable in this study will be ORR .  The Part B statisticalnull hypothesis states that the 
true ORR associated with the regimen of necitumumab and pe mbro lizumab is 2 0%, whereas the 
research hypothesis states that the true ORR associated with the combinat ion regimen is35%.
If the research hypothesis of a 35% ORR is true , there is an 83 % chance of rejecting the null 
hypothesis.  If the null hypothesis of a 20% ORR is true, then there is at mosta 10% chance of
rejecting the null hypothesis. Therefore, the sample si ze of 54 evaluable pat ients in Part B has a 
nominal one-sided alpha level of 0.10, with stati stical power of 83 %.
The analysis of Part C will take place approximately after all the patient s fromPart C ha ve 
completed 8 cycles or discont inued early .  
At the sam e time , som e of the efficacy of P art B m ay
be updated, where appropriate .
12.2. Statistical and Analytical Plans
12.2.1. General Considerations
Theprimary  analysis will be as described in Sect ion12.1.
All efficacy summary  analyses will be performed for all evaluable pat ients (as defined in Sect ion 
12.1). All safety summary  analyses will be performed for all treated patients (those enrolled in 
the study  who receive any  amount of  study  drug [necitumumab and/orpembrolizumab ])
.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 82
LY3012211Minor changes or clarificat ions to any  stati stical analyses described in this protocol may  be
presented in the final statistical analysis plan ( SAP)for this study .
12.2.2. Patient Disposition
A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded.  It will include:
total number of pat ients enrolled; and
total number of pat ients treated (safet y popul ation).
A detailed summary  of reasons for patient discont inuat ion fromtreatm ent will be provided.  
Asummary  of all ident ified important (as defined in the SAP )protocol  violations will be 
provi ded.
12.2.3. Patient Cha racteristics
A detailed description o f patient characteri stics at baseline will be provided, including:
patient dem ographics;
baseline disease characteristics; and
medical history .
12.2.4. Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medicat ions will be summarized for the safet y populati on.
12.2.4.1. Postdiscontinuation Therapy
The numbers and percentages of patients reporting postdiscont inuat ion therapies will be 
provi ded overall, by  type of  therapy  (surgery , radiotherapy , or system ic therapy ), and by  drug 
name.
12.2.5. Treatment Compliance
The number of dose omissio ns, reducti ons, and delays, the number of cycles received, and dose 
intensity will be summar ized for all treated patients.
12.2.6. Primary Outcome and Methodology
The primary  efficacy  endpoint of ORR and its exact 80% CI and95% CI will be est imated .
12.2.7. Analyses of Efficacy
In addit ion to the analyses described in Sect ion12.1, this secti on provi des addi tional details of 
planned efficacy  analyses.  For time -to-event variables, the Kaplan -Meier m ethod will be used to 
estimate parameters (for example, medians, quartiles, 6 months ,and 1-year event rates) . See 
also the SAP for ad
ditional details.
ORR: The deno minator of ORR includes each evaluable patient. The numerator includes those 
patients counted in the deno minator with a best over all tumor response of PR or CR.
DCR:  Using the same deno minator as for ORR, the numerator of the DCR includes those 
patients counted in the denominator with a best tumor response of SD, PR, or CR.
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 83
LY3012211DOR:   The DOR is defined only for responders (patients with a confirmed CR or PR, as defined 
in Section 10.1.1 ).  It i s measured from  the date of first evidence of a confirmed CR or PR to the 
date of object ive progression or the date of death due to any cause, whichever is earlier.  If a 
responder is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data inclusio n cutoff 
date, DOR will be censored at the date of the last complete object ive progression -free disease 
assessment.
PFS:  The PFS time is measured from the date of first dose tothe date of objective progression 
or the date of death due to any  cause, whichever i s earlier.  The censoring is taken in the 
following order:
if a pat ient does not have a complete baseline disease assessment, then the PFS time 
will be censored at the first dose date, regardless of whether or not object ively 
determined disease progression or death has been observed for the patient; otherwise, 
if a pat ient is not known to have died or have objective progression as of the data 
inclusio n cutoff date for the analysis, the PFS time will be censored at the last 
complete obj ective progression -free disease assessment date.
OS:  OSduration is measured fro m the date of first dose to the date of death from any  cause.  
For each patient who is not known to have died a s of the data -inclusio n cutoff date for a 
particular analysis, OS will be censored for that analysis at the last known alive date.   ORR, 
DCR, DOR ,and PFS will be assessed based on RECIST 1.1.
12.2.7.1. Exploratory Outcome and Methodology
The irORR, irDCR, irDOR ,and irPFS accessed based on adapted RECIST 1.1 ( irRECIST ) will 
be used for exploratory  analysis o f ORR, DCR, DOR ,and PFS . See also the SAP for addit ional 
details.
12.2.8. Pharmacokinetic and Immunogenicity Analyses
PK Analyses:
PKanalyses for necitumumab will be conducted on patients who have received at least 1 dose of 
necitumumab and have had samples collected.
Summary  statistics of necitumumab data will be presented graphically as well as in tabulated 
form.  Addit ional expl oratory  analyses using PopPK approach m aybe perform ed if warranted by  
data.Patient or study  factors that may influence the PK of necitumumab , when given in 
combinat ion with pembrolizumab, may be explored. The relationship between necitumumab 
exposure, when given in co mbinat ion withpembrolizumab, and selected safet y outcom es may 
also be explored.
Immunogenicit y Analyses:
Immunogenicit y (anti-necitumumab ant ibody ) incidence will be tabulated, and correlation to 
necitumumab drug level, act ivity, and safet y will be assessed, as appropr iate, respectively .  The 
measures that will be analyzed include baseline presence and level o f anti-drug(s) ant ibodies 
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 84
LY3012211(ADA), treatment -emergent ADA, l evels o f neutralizing ADA, and incidence and levels o f ADA 
related to IRRs.
Interim analysis:
Interim analysis may be conducted to facilit ate exploratory  analyses of PK, pharmacodynamics
(safet y), and immunogenicit y.  Interim data may also be pooled with final and interim data from 
other clinical studies of necitumumab and analyzed using a populat ion PK/ pharmacodynamic
approach.   Since the study  is unblinded, study  objectives will not be compromised by the interim 
analysis.
12.2.9. Translational Research Analyses
Biomarker resul ts will be summarized and correlated with clinical outcom es.
12.2.10. Safety Analyses
Allsafet y summaries and analyses will be based upon the Safet y Popul ation as defined in 
Secti on12.2.2 .
Overall exposure to study drugs , the numbers o f patients com pleting each cycle, and the dose 
intensity will be summarized using descriptive statist ics.  The number of patients with any dose 
adjustm ent will  be presented for enti re treatm ent period .  The number of pat ients with dose 
reducti ons, dose del ays, or dose omissio ns will also be summarized, as will th e reasons for dose 
adjustm ents.
An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for AEs deemed by the invest igator to be related to 
study  treatm ent, and repeated for events regardless of study  drug causalit y.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an event that first occurred or 
worsened between the first dose of study  treatm ent and 30 day s after the last dose of study  
treatm ent and rel ated SAEs reported bey ond 30 days after the las t dose of study  treatm ent.
The number of patients who experienced a TEAE, SAE, AE related to study  treatm ent, died, or 
discontinued fro m the study  treatm ent due to an AE will be summarized.
Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events v 4.0will be used to report AEs by  CTCAE 
terms.
Laboratory  and non -laboratory  CTCAEs will be summarized by CTCAE term and maximum 
CTCAE grade, including the total for maximum Grade 3 and above .  These summaries will be 
provi ded for events deemed by the invest igator to be re lated to study  treatm entand repeated for 
events regardl ess of causalit y.
MedDRA Versi on 17.0 (or higher) will be used when reporting AEs by MedDRA terms.  
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be su mmari zed by SOC and by decreasing frequency  of 
Preferred Term  within SOC.
Reasons for death will be summarized separately for on -therapy  and wi thin 30 days of last dose 
of study  drug .  Seri ous adverse e vents will be summarized by Preferred Term .
I4X-MC-JFCQ( d) Clinical Protocol Page 85
LY3012211Hospitalizations and transfusio ns during the study  treatm ent peri od or during the 30 -day 
short -term follow-up peri od will be summarized.
12.2.11. Subgroup Analyses
Exploratory  subgroup analyses by  histol ogy will be perform ed to l ook f or evi dence of any 
differences in efficacy or safet y that might depend on histology .
12.2.12. Interim Anal yses
An interim safet y analysis will be performed after the first 15 evaluable patients in Part B have 
completed 2 cycles of study  treatm ent (or otherwise di scont inued study  treatm ent).  
Patients wi th squam ous and nonsquam ous NSCLC from Part A who received the recommended 
necitumumab dose for Part B will be included in the interim analys es.
The interim safety  analys es will  be conducted to permit evaluat ion of safet y data by  Lilly.
The results from the interim safet yanalyses will be examined by  an internal assessment 
committee , which will be established prior to enrollment of the first patient in the 
trial.Theinternal assessment committee will consist of a Lilly medical director, a Lilly 
CRP/clinical research scie ntist, a PK scientist, and a statist ician and will make reco mmendat ions 
about the trial. Enrollment will cont inue while the interim safet y analysis is being 
perform ed.Interim safet yanalysis results will not be disseminated outside of the assessment 
committee, unless emerging safet y outcom es warrant such a disclosure.   In case a disclo sure i s 
warranted, t he outcome of the interim safet y analyses will be documented, and a written letter 
will be submitted to the ERB(s) and the invest igators for documentati on purposes .
Interim efficacy analyses may be performed as needed to aid in the planning of future 
trials.There is no plan to stop the study  for posi tive efficacy , the ty pe-1 error for final primary 
analysis will not be affected and hence is not adjusted .

exact infusio n start and stop t imes (actual clock readings) are recorded.  The exact time of 
collect ion of each venous blood sample will be based on the clock used to record infusio n times.  
It is essent ial that the pharmacokinetic blood samples not be withdrawn fro m the sam e I.V. site 
as the drug infusio n.
Predose samples should be taken as close as possible to the start of first infusio n, but can be 
drawn up to 1 hour (60 minutes) prior firstinfusio n,and exact clock reading should be recorded.  
Post-dose (post -end of infusio n) samples for PK for necitumumab should be drawn immediately  
after end of necitumumab infusio n (range =after end of infusion +10 minutes) and exact clock 
reading should be recorded.
In addit ion, if a pat ient experiences an IRR , bloodsamples for both immuno genici ty (anti-

a All sample times are relative to start of first infusion . 
bPre-dose sample for necitumumab PK, and/or IK should be preferably collected within 1 hour  prior to start of first infusion.
cIn the event of an IRR, blood samples will be collected for necitumu mabPK and IK analysis at the following time points within 15 minutes of one another :  (i) as close as possible to the onset of the 
IRR, (ii) at the resolution of the IRR, and (iii) 30 da ys following the IRR .
dPostdose samples should be collected after the end of n ecitumumab infusion , preferably within a 10 minute time window.
eWhile best effort should be done to draw the blood sample for PK/IK within the time windows provided above, it is more import ant to ensure predose sample is actually collected before the start of first 
infusion and postdose infusion samples are collected after infusion has actually completed. It is also equally important to record ACTUAL date and time of blood collection for PK/IK sample on the 
Requisition Form AFTER drawing the sample and to accurately record the ACTUAL infusions start and end dates and times on the eCRF to be able to use the data for analyses.  Sample collection for 
PK/IK must be from the opposite arm to that used for study drug infusion. If drug was administered via a central venous catheter, the sample collection should be from a different site .
fRecord ACTUAL date and time of blood collection for PK/IK sample on the Requisition Form AFTER drawing the sample .  PK/IK sample should be taken within 15 minut es of one another.

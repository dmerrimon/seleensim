6 January 2016                        Page 9 of 60 Primary 
Endpoint:  Pain Reduction  
 Change in VAS Pain Score  at Day 90  
 
Functional Improvement  
 Change in Revised Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Rating  
Scale for Upper Extremity (MSTS ) at Day 90  
 
Primary effectiveness  will be evaluated relative  to literature -based 
historical controls . These were  selected on the basis of comparability to the 
target population  and similarity to the investigational device.  There are 
two primary effectiveness endpoints, reduction in pain at 90 days relative 
to pre -treatment baseline and improvement in function at 90 days relative 
to pre -treatment baseline.  The changes in VAS pain and MSTS from pre -
treatment baseline to day 90 will be involved in the primary effectiveness 
tests to be applied to enrolled patients who have actual or impending 
fractures, with VAS pain s cores of at least 60mm.   Non -inferiority of 
mean changes at Day 90  will be compared relative to reference values 
determined through evaluation of historical controls.  Testing for pain 
reduction will first be performed. Only if the null hypothesis of infe riority 
in mean VAS pain improvement at Day 90 is rejected at p<0.05, will the 
co-primary endpoint MSTS be similarly tested.  
  
Safety Success  is evaluated according to a composite endpoint by meeting 
all of the following criteria:  
 Clinical  
o No Serious Devi ce Related Complications  
o No additional surgical interventions:  
 Revisions, supplements, fixations, or removals  
 Radiographic  
o No device fracture, migrations, mal -alignment or loss of 
reduction or fixation  
The number and percentage of patients achieving the Safety Success 
endpoint will be reported cumulatively for day s 7-14, 30, and 90 and 180 
and 360 and with 95% 2 -sided exact binomial confidence intervals.  
Secondary 
Endpoints  The secondary endpoints, evaluated at the Day 90 Visits, include:  
 The individual components of the safety endpoint  
 Other secondary endpoints include:  
o Duration of index procedure and length of hospital stay  
o Activities of Daily Living score through all follow -up 
intervals  
o Disability status

o Assessment of prescription and over -the-counter analgesic 
medication use  
o Survivability from time of index procedure to death  
The safety endpoints evaluated through Day 90, also include:  
1. Incidence and number of AEs.  
2. Incidence and number  of procedure  and device -related 
complications.  
These secondary endpoints listed above will also be examined during the 
extended follow up portion of the trial at Day 180 and 360.  
Interim Analysis  After 30 patients have been treated and followed for 90 days, an interim analysis 
on change from baseline VAS to 90 days will be carried out.  The purpose of this 
interim analysis is to asses for: (a) potentially stop ping the trial  for futility; and 
(b) po tentially increase the sample size if the imp rovement in the VAS  at 90 days  
is large , but not as large as anticipated in the original sample size calculations.

1.1 Impending Pathological Fractures  from Cancer  
Background   
Metastases from cancer are the most common malignancy involving the skeletal system .1  In the  United 
States alone, of the over 1.4 M (2011) patients diagnosed with cancer annually, over 700,000 w ill be 
diagnosed with  metastases to bone  in addition to an underlying prevalence of 280,000 cases .1, 2  
Compared to the relatively few primary bone cancers  per year , with an incidence of 3,010 (2013)3, the 
economic burden of metastatic disease to bone is enormous: consuming $12.6B (2007) in healthcare 
spend and 17% of the $74B in total direct cost of oncologic care estimated   by the National Institutes of 
Health.4  Prevalence, incidence, and cost estimates for metastatic bone disease (MBD) are projected to 
continue growing as with improved medical treatment of many primary cancers, patients are living 
longer, becoming more likely  to develop distant bone metas tases .5   
The skeleton is the third most common target of distant metastases4, following lung and liver.  The axial 
skeleton is predominantly affected, with MBD of the spine occurring 40 times more frequently than all 
primary bone tumors combined .6 After  the axial skeleton , MBD  affects the femur, humerus, and tibia in 
decreasing incidence.  Studies at post -mortem have revealed MBD following c arcinomas of the breast  in 
73% of patients , prostate (63%), thyroid (42%), kidney (35%), and lung (36%) ; gastrointe stinal tract 
tumors result in MBD in less than 10% of cases .7  Tumors are most often found in the proximal half of 
long bones, following the arterial vascular supply  that runs proximal to distal . 
Unlike primary tumors, the early diagnosis and treatment of metastatic bone tumors will not result in a 
cure of the disease, and l ength of survival following the detection  of MBD is limited , regardless of 
primary cancer type . For example, l arge, retrospective studies of breast cancer patient s have demonstrated 
mean  survival time periods of 22 months (overall), 26 months in patients with bone metastases only, 21 
months in patients with bone and visceral metastases, and 18 months with visceral metastases .8  The two -
year probability of survival for breast cancer patien ts with bone metastases only is estimated to be 0. 74 
(95% CI, 0.67 to 0.79) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.46 – 0.66) for simultaneous bone and visceral metastases .9  
Further, the presence of multiple metastatic  bone  lesions predicts shorter length of survival with solitary 
lesions representing a minority (41%) of detected disease .10  Unfortunately, b reast cancer, when compared 
to the relatively more lethal lung, thyroid, and kidney cancers , has been cited as having as having the best 
median length of survival .10 
The morphology of the tumors in metastatic bone disease may be of blastic, lytic, or mixed type. Cancers 
of purely lytic or mixed blastic -lytic composition are the most concerning, as they result in  local 
destruction of the  cortical  bone, functional compromis e, and cause significant pain .11 Prophylactic 
fixation of impending pathological fractures from MBD  has demonstrated significant clinical benefit, 
including less blood loss, faster procedure time, shorter length of hospitalization and higher likelihood of 
discharge to home9, reduction of pain , improvement in activities of daily living, and better quality of 
life.12  Importantly, efforts have been made to predict fracture risk and the need for prophylactic fixation 
based upon the clinical and radiographic fe atures of MBD.

The prediction fracture risk  in long bones due to MBD  began in the 1960’s with the efforts of Aufranc13, 14 
and Bunting .15  Later efforts by Casadei16, Harrington17, and Hipp18 in the 1980’s and 90’s improved the 
lack of statistical rigor in early efforts and the classification characteristics of impending fractures, 
however no agreement was made between the different efforts .  Ultimately, Mirels19 proposed the rating 
system tha t is most widely used today for the assessment of fracture risk.  
Mirels scoring system is based upon four characteristics: (1) site of lesion; (2) nature of lesion; (3) size of 
lesion; and (4) pain.  The features of each characteristic are assigned scores of 1 to 3, as shown below:  
 
Table 1 : Mirels’ Scoring System  
Site of lesion includes three categories: upper extremity, lower extremity, and the peritrochanteric region 
of the femur.   
The histopathological characteristic of the lesion is characterized by increasing score for blastic, mixed, 
and lytic type.  The rate of fracture in these categories was 0%, 32%, and 48%, respectively .19 
The size of the lesion is characterized as an estimated percentage of the cortical thickness. Increasing 
scores are assigned  to values from 1/3, 1/3 to 2/3, and greater than 2/3. The rate of fracture in these 
categories was 0%, 5%, and 81%, respectively .19 
Functional pain – as defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain – is defined as “an 
unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or 
described in terms of such damage. ”  Of the categories of pain assessed, the progression to fracture with 
functional pain was 100%; mild and moderate pain assessments progressed  to fracture in only 10% of 
cases .19 
Based upon the overall Mirels Score, a prophylactic fixation is indicated with scores of 9 or greater; a 
score of 7 or less may be managed with analgesia and radiotherapy.  The probability of fracture with a 
score of 8 presents a clinical dilemma, in that only 15% of cases were observed to fracture.  Thus, the 
recommendation was made for prophylactic fixation with heavy emphasis on clinical judgment .19

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 17 of 60 The Mirels Scoring System has been independently reviewed and validated multiple times.  Most 
recently, Damron21 determined the sensitivity to be 91% with specificity of 35%, being reproducible, 
valid, and more sensitive than clinical judgment across all experience levels.  
In similar fashion , Harrington ’s17 scoring system incorporated lesion size and the  percentage of local 
cortical bone destruction  in the assessment of fracture risk .  In the diaphysis, the greatest risk was for 
cortical destruction > 50%; in the metaphysis, risk of fracture was greatest at 50 – 75%.  By augmenting 
Mirels’ methodology with a minimum acceptance of >50% cortical destruction, irrespective of diaphysis 
or metaphysis, the false positives encountered in prophylactic treatment with a Mirels score of 8 may be 
decreased.  
Stabilizat ion Practices for Impending and Actual Pathological F ractures   
The goals of surgical treatment for impending and actual pathological fractures secondary to MBD are to 
relieve pain, reduce the need for narcotics, restore skeletal strength, and regain the ability to perform 
activities of daily living.  Long bone surgical stabilization techniques are heavily dependent upon the 
location and extent of bone erosion, but may be broadly divided into methods employing intramedullary 
nails  with locking pins and scre ws; extramedullary plates and screws ; total joint arthroplasty ; or via the 
direct injection of cement (with or without supplemental hardware stabilization).  
Intramedullary Nail Devices  
Intramedullary (IM) nail stabilization of a n impending  fracture is acc omplished by inserting a solid metal 
rod (or “nail”) into the medullary canal of the bone, ensuring that the rod length spans the lesion area .  
The ends of the rod are then fixed in place with locking nails or screws, stabilizing the impending fracture 
proximally and distally .  
IM nails inherently retain certain advantages over plates and screws. Fundamentally , the IM nail is closer 
to the normal mechanical axis of long bone s and acts as a load -sharing device when there is cortical 
contact , thus subjecting the bone to lower bending forces and decreasing the risk of fracture .22 In MBD, 
IM nails are attractive as they allow for protection of the entirety of the bone as new lesions may form at a 
non-contiguous site in the same bone, or the identified lesion may  continue to enlarge .23 IM nails 
generally involve less soft tissue  dissection than plate osteosynthesis, a lower rate of infection, and 
(theoretically) less risk of local nerve injury .24 
Unfortunately, IM nailing is not without shortcomings.  IM nail fail ure – defined as loss of fixation and 
stabilization – has been reported to be as high as 44% at 60 months survival  with a linear increase 
following implantation .25 Tumor progression, non -union (in fractured bone), surgeon error and hardware 
failure have be en identified as the general mechanisms of IM nail failure , with revision rates bring  higher 
in aggressive tumor types, greater -load bearing bones, and more proximal lesions .23, 25 Of these categories, 
surgeon error (improper sizing of the implant, poor lo cation selection for the locking screws) , tumor 
progression (further bone erosion  into screw/nail fixation zones ), and increasing survival  have been 
identified as primary contributors to failure25-27. Sizing error  gaps, forced location selection for locking 
screws in the nail,  and greater distribution of the loading area  all offer opportunities for improvement  with 
newer technology.

6 January 2016                        Page 18 of 60 Plates and Screws  
The use of interlocking plates and screws for the stabilization of impending pathological fractures is 
accomplished by using metal plates that span the lesion site, with such geometry  that screws are able to be 
placed in sufficient cortical bone to guarant ee purchase  and plate adherence .   
Plate and interlocking screw  systems offer several advantages over IM nails, especially when challenging 
bone geometry in a confined area is present.  For example, w ith small lesion size and adequate cortical 
bone present  in the distal femur (a challenging anatomic geography), plate  and screw systems  have been 
shown to provide equivalent axial stiffness and torsional strength to intramedullary nailing  alone .28  
Further, a natomically designed plates offer advantages in conforming to surface anatomy , especially the 
more variable anatomy of the periarticular /trochanteric  regions  of the humerus, femur, and tibia , where 
IM nails are subject to greater loading  with a higher risk of failure .29 
Unfortunately, the success of pla tes and screw systems vary by anatomic  location.  In the diaphysis, they 
have demonstrated higher failure rates than IM nails30; in the peritrochanteric  regions , they have 
demonstrated greater anatomic conformance advantages than IM nails alone, but higher  failure rates than 
partial or total joint prosthesis .31, 32  Thus, a significant product gap exists for a device that is anatomically 
conforming (plates and screws) and also load appropriate (IM nail).  
Cementoplasty  
 “Cementoplasty ” broadly describes the percutaneous injection of poly(methyl -methacrylate) (PMMA) 
bone cement to stabilize the spine and skeletal system33 alone, or as an adjunct to traditional fixation 
hardware.  Cementoplasty is a broad term, including procedures like kyphoplasty, vertebroplasty, 
osteoplasty, and sacroplasty, where the role of cement as a gap filler and structural support  is indicated .34  
The percutaneous injection of poly (methyl -methacrylate ) cement for a therapeutic effect was first 
described in 198735, where it was successfully used to reduce pain by augmenting vertebral height 
secondary to compression fracture from a benign neoplasm.  Since then, the technique has been widely 
published upon in the interventional radiology community, and has gained wi despread adoption for the 
treatment of painful vertebral fractures refractory to conservative medical t reatment .36-38    
Cementoplasty has also been widely described in the treatment of fracture and impending fracture 
secondary to bone pathology – be it os teoporosis, metastatic disease, or neoplasm – where the primary 
indication is relief of pain39-43 and cement is used to increase the strength of fixation44 achieved with 
adjunct hardware.  In this setting, pathologic fractures due to lytic MBD present  a unique dilemma as they 
require two products, of which neither is a complete solution: proximal and distal fixation in the setting of 
compromised bone with an IM rod and locking nails, or the use of cement filler for stabilization of 
attenuated bone  in small lesions . 
There is little debate as to the necessity of cement in the treatment of pathologic fractures and impending 
fractures secondary to MBD.  Numerous publications have described the successful use of percutaneous 
cementoplasty following radiofrequency  ablation (RFA) without44-47 adjunctive hardware for small, 
isolated malignancies, and cement with48-25 adjunctive hardware for more advanced disease states.   In

and qual ity of life has been described .51-54   
Similar to plate -screw systems and IM nails, cementoplasty as a technique is limited in application.  Small 
(<25% cortical erosion), solitary lesions of non -load-bearing bones, such as ribs, iliac crest, sternum and 
clavicle appear to be the most appropriate setting .33-53  In the context of treating impending fractures 
secondary to MBD, space exists for a device with the length and longitudinal load -sharing properties of 
an IM nail with complete conformance to the intramedullary canal; the anatomic flexibility of plate -screw 
systems in variably contoured anatomy and disease types; and the gap filling properties of cementoplasty.  
Impact of Impending and Actual Pathological Fracture s on Reduction of Pain  
Pain reduction following p rophylactic fixation of impending pathological fractures and fixation of 
fractures secondary to metastatic bone disease has been widely  studied by the interventional radiology 
community.  To quote Deschamps and de Barre54:  
“The analgesic benefit of cementoplasty in bone metastases is well -documented in the medical literature 
as producing a reduction in pain in 80 to 97% of cases .50-57  This benefit is obtained irrespective of the 
bone site treated, whether vertebrae, long bones or flat bones.  Alvarez et al.51 have shown that 
cementoplasty of a painful metastatic vertebra produced a significant reduction in pain in 81% of the 
patients tre ated (the mean VAS/10 progressing from 9.1 to 3.2) and the possibility of walking again in 
77% of patients initially bedridden because of it. Cementoplasty is also very effective for metastatic pain 
of the long and flat bones, producing a significant impro vement in the pain of 91% of patients (the mean 
VAS/10 progression from 8.7 to 1.9) .57  This analgesic effect is obtained rapidly, generally between the 
first and third day following the procedure, permitting early postoperative mobilization of patients an d a 
short hospital stay (24 – 48 hours). The physiological mechanisms of this analgesic effect can as yet be 
only hypothesized: the effect of the cement stabilizing microfractures and/or the effect of destruction of 
nociceptive fibers on contact with the c ement, through the exothermic reaction generated during its 
polymerization. According to Urrutia et al.58, the mechanical effect takes precedence over the thermal 
effect since no histological lesions of intraosseous nerve fibers were seen on contact with c ement injected 
into the vertebrae of rabbits. This seems to be confirmed by Anselmetti et al.59 who have found identical 
analgesic efficacy in three groups of patients treated with cements with very different peak 
polymerization temperatures (group A = 87 °C, group B = 60 °C, group C = 45 °C).” 
1.2 Rationale for Development of the IlluminOss Photodynamic Bone 
Stabilization System  
According to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen /Association for the Study of Internal 
Fixation  (AO) Foundation , there are four guiding principles for successful internal fixation  of a fracture : 
the anatomical reduction of the fracture fragments ; stable internal fixation  of the bone; the preservation of  
blood supply ; and the ability to facilitate early, active , pain free motion of the associated muscles and 
joints.  These principles guided the development of the IlluminOss  Photodynamic Bone Stabilization 
System (PBSS) .

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 20 of 60 The Illumin Oss PBSS may be uniquely suited to meet the needs of fracture fixation  and overcome 
shortcomings of current solutions  in pathological fractures by providing longitudinal stability alo ng the 
length of the device , as with an IM nail, but  via a minimally invasive delivery and stabilization technique .  
To place the device, a  small  incision is  made to insert the device  percutaneo usly into  the medullary canal  
with minimal soft tissue dissection .  The non -compliant balloon  is then adjusted to  span the fracture, and 
conforms  to the patient’s  unique medullary canal , providing stable internal fixation  once inflated with the 
monomeric cement . After the cement has been hardened by polymerization with  visible light, additional 
hardware (pins and screws) may be used to stabilize the fracture. The location of supplemental hardware 
– such as pins and  screws – is not pre -determined by the device  configuration, as with traditional IM 
nails . This allows the surgeon to independently choose hardware placement, preserving blood supply to 
the bone, and optimizing the  environment for normal biological healing  to occur. Obstructive bracing is 
not required following implantation , and  only a small surgical dressing is needed to dress the incision  site.  
Thus , the patient is able to move the affected area following  surgery and may potentially begin the return  
to the pre-fracture  level of activity  earlier than with traditional technology . 
2 Intended Use  & Device Description  
2.1 Intended Use  
The IlluminOs s PBSS  is indicated for use in fracture repair . It received CE Mark clearance in 2009 for  
use in the treatment of phalange  of the hand , metacarpal, distal radius, radius, ulna, olecranon, clavicle , 
and fibula fractures. It provides stabilization for  these fractures via a minimally invasive technique in 
which the bone is not subjected to significant weight bearing forc es. As of June 2014, the PB SS has been 
used to treat over 400 bones in patients residing in Chile, United Kingdom , and the European Union . No 
intra-operative, post -operative, or systemic adverse device events  have been reported. The PBSS is not 
cleared for use in the United States (US). More information regarding device  use is provided in Section 3 
of the protocol.  
This study , conducted under an IDE from the U.S. Food and Drug Adminsitration , will evaluate the use of 
the PBSS in the treatment of impendin g and actual pathological fractures of the humerus. The results of 
this study  will be used to support a marketing clearance for the use of the PBSS for pathological fracture  
of the humerus in the United States . 
2.2 Device Description  
The IlluminOss PBSS is man ufactured by IlluminOss Medical, Inc . (East Providence, Rhode Island) ; the 
monomer  cement  is manufactured by Dymax Corporation  (Torrington, CT, USA) . The PBSS is 
comprised of an inflatable, thin walled polyethylene terephthalate (PET; Dacron ™) balloon mounted on 
an insertion catheter. This balloon catheter  system  is designed to deliver the monomer cement  to the 
fracture site via the medullary canal of the bone.  
Once the balloon is in place and has spanned the impending or actual pathological f racture site , the 
delivery sheath is removed, uncovering the balloon; the balloon is then infused with light-curable 
monomer cement via a syringe, causing the balloon to expand. The inflated balloon circumferentially fills 
the medullary canal of the fractu re, applying a transverse reduction force and stabilization to the fracture.

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 21 of 60 The bone is then visualized under fluoroscopy to ensure that the impending fracture  or fracture site has 
been properly spanned and stabilized , with the balloon in the appropriate position, fully -inflated and 
contacting the inner diameter of the bone.  
The light system is then activated, causing the photoinitiator in the monomer to rapidly polymerize and 
harden the cement in situ . The cured balloon thus becomes a bone stabilizing sys tem (or “bone pin”) to 
aid in the support and healing of the bone fracture by primary callous formation and remodeling.  
3 Justification for Clinical Investigation Design  
3.1 Pre-Clinical Investigation Results  
The individual components of the PBSS and the hardene d bone pin were tested under the conditions of 
the company’s ISO 13485:2003 compliant quality system, as well as domestic and international standards 
(MDD 93/42/EC -2007).  
The liquid monomer, the disposable implant catheter set, and the polymeric bone pin have undergone 
extensive biocompatibility testing including genotoxicity,  cytotoxicity, systemic sub -acute and sub -
chronic toxicity, sensitivity and irritation testing, and implan t performance evaluations. The pins  were 
tested by an independent laboratory in pre -clinical models under GLP conditions of standard use and 
failure mode s to assess the safety and performance of the implant materials. The results of the panel of 
testing indicated that the presence of  the uncured monomer and cured polymeric bone pin were well-
tolerated in animal models, ha d no negative effect on cell viability, and were not associated with 
permanent local or systemic complications.  
The light source used to deliver visible light to the liquid monomer, the Blue Wave 75 VT Photodynamic 
Light Box, is similar to a commercially available product used  in the UV adhesive industry. Testing of 
this component  was conducted by an independent, ce rtified testing agency , and evaluated all mechanical, 
electrical, software and user -interface functionalities in compliance with international standard IEC 
60601 -1, 2nd and 3rd Edition. A standard, commercially available 75-Watt  light bulb is used within t he 
unit to transmit light into the lumen of the catheter via a plastic light fiber. The safety and performance of 
the light output (wavelength and intensity spectrum) have passed all testing conducted by a second 
independent, certified testing agency.   
3.2 Prior Clinical  Studies  
The PBSS ha s been cleared for use in the European Union (EU)  for the treatment of phalange s of the 
hand , metacarpal, distal radius, radius, ulna, olecranon, clavicle, and fibula fractures. The ability of the 
device t o perform its intended function  in earlier indications is the rationale for performing this 
investigational study of the PBSS in impending and actual pathological  fractures  of the humerus 
secondary to metastatic malignancy . 
First-in-Man Study  
A First -in-Man feasibility study was conducted in Chile, South America for the use of the device in the 
treatment of phalange and metacarpal fractures.  The study, “IlluminOss Medical Photodynamic Bone

August 2009.  Enrollment  into the study closed in 2009  with no adverse device effects . Subjects met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and were treated for acute fractures of the metacarpal bone. Subjects returned 
to the hospital for Da y 45, Day 90 and Day 180 follow -up visits. At each visit subjects  were assessed for 
ADEs , clinical healing, and fracture alignment. T he subjects completed a Disability of the Arm, Shoulder 
and Hand (DASH) questionnaire a nd radiographs were obtained. The Principa l Investigator  (PI) reported 
that all subjects were clinically  healed by the Day 45  visit, and no local or systemic device -related 
complications were reported.  The study is closed.  
EU Registry Study  
The EU Registry for the IlluminOss Bone Stabilization Sy stem, Protocol # ILLUM -EUREG -2010 -001, 
was initiated in September 2010  and follow -up is ongoing . The aim of the registry is to collect technical 
and clinical outcomes on treated subjects . The subjects may be followed either until they are discharged 
from c linical care, or are followed for up to two years post index surgery. There are no pre-specified 
procedures or additional mandatory visits for subjects enrolled  into the registry. Research personnel 
collect and enter standard of care demographic and fracture -related data, including radiographs, into a 
web-based database for review by IlluminOss personnel . The database prospectively queries for the 
incidence of adverse device effects.  
Enrollment closed in January 2014. A  total of 146 bones have been tr eated in 13 1 enrolled subjects at two 
centers in Germany  and f our centers in The Netherlands . The device has been used to treat acute fractures 
and has been used in revision surgeries across indications. It has been used alone, and with supplemental 
hardwa re, at the discretion of the surgeon.

defined by cortical bridging and > 75% dissolution of the fracture line, was reported for 92% (11/12) of 
the subjects . Four of the 16 subjects  (25%) were treated with an IlluminOss device during a revision 
procedure. Radiographic healing, as defined above, was reported for 75% of the 16 subjects . No reports of 
device migration were reported for any subject  at any  visit.  No unanticipated adverse device effects and 
no clinically significant adverse device effects have been reported.  
4 Risks and Benefits  
4.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
Compared to traditional impending f racture or fracture treatment technologies, subjec ts may benefit from 
participating in this study as use of the IlluminOss PBSS will likely result in:  (1) shorter operative time; 
(2) s horter length of hospital stay; (3) fewer narcotic and physical therapy prescriptions; and (4) fewer 
post-operative compli cations. Additionally, subject s may benefit from regaining use of their limb earlier  
than if they were treated with conventional plates , IM rods , or cement alone . It is also possible that  
subject s may not experience any of these benefits. The results of this study will benefit the medical 
community treating actual and impending pathological  fractures secondary to metastatic bone disease by 
evaluating the safety and performance of the PBSS.  
4.2 Anticipated Adverse Device Effects  (Risks)  
Adverse events (AEs) that may be anticipated in this clinical study are believed to be similar to  and 
consistent with those associated with impending fractures , fractures, anesthesia, and surgical treatment, 
including the use of other commercially available  plating and  intramedu llary fixation technologies.  
Complications may occur at any time during or after device implantation.  
Possible risks that may be related to the IlluminOss device are believed to be similar to other types of 
bone pin devices. As with any IM fixation or plating system , possible risks may include, but are not 
limited to, the following:

 risk of implant fracture when used with screw fixation  
 loosening, bending, cracking  of the compone nts or loss of fixation in bone;  
 loss of anatomic position with non -union or malunion with rotation or 
angulation ; 
 the need for a second operation to treat the fracture  or to remove the device ; 
 risk of uncured/cured monomer outside of the in tended area , resulting in 
effects on the surrounding tissues and muscles, and in possible systemic side 
effects;  
 relative increase d risk of infection following a foreign body implant;  
 x-ray findings of small bone lo ss (osteolysis) may be observed.  
In addition, there is a rare chance that the balloon catheter may become damaged and leak the uncured 
monomer into the space of the fractured bone  prior to the application of the light source to harden the 
monomer . 
Complications associated with surgery and  use of anesthesia are always  possible, but are not common.  
Possible risks of humerus  surgery may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
 infection;  
 permanent  numbness or weakness in the area of treatment ;  
 fractured bones do not heal together prop erly, or may heal with a bent shape;  
 the need for a second procedure, not related to the investigational device  
 abnormal bone loss or growth;  
 swelling or bruising of tissue;  
 thromboembolic event (blood clot or other material that could result in organ 
damage or failure);  
 irregular heart rhythm;  
 bleeding, possibly requiring transfusion;  
 damage to nerves or blood vessels or muscles, or other tissue.  
Possible risks of the use of anesthesia are:  
 nausea and vomiting;  
 headache;  
 backache;  
 sore throat or hoarseness;  
 muscle soreness.  
Other rare side effects or complications of the use of anesthesia include, but are not limited to:

 allergic reaction;  
 prolonged recovery from anesthesia;  
 seizure or stroke;  
 nerve damage (including numbness, pain or paralysis);  
 awareness or recall of the operation;  
 death.  
These events could possibly require  surgery or other treatment to address the event.  
4.3 Residual Risks Associated W ith the Investigational Device  
There are no known residual risks associated with the use of the investigational device.  
4.4 Risks Associated W ith Participation in the Clinical Investi gation  
Risks associated with participation in the investigation include additional radiographic assessments that 
may not be  standard of care in the follow -up of traditional impending fracture treatment surgery.  
Enroll ed subjects will have standard of care  radiographs tak en at the Day 7-14, 30, and Day 90 visits.  
Depending on the research site , the Day 180 and 360 radiographic assessments  may not be considered 
standard of care . The risk of exposure to  extra  radiation at these time points is expected to be less than 
that received during a routine  airplane flight.  
4.5 Risk Mitigation  
Risks will be minimized by ensuring that only board -certified orthopedic surgeons trained in the use of 
the IlluminOss PBSS participate as investigators in the study. Strict patient inclusion and exclusion 
criteria will be followed, enrolling only patients who meet criteria and provide written informed consent.  
During each follow up visit, subject s will be assessed for AEs, with particular attention to events that may 
be related to the surgical procedure and the investigational device. Medical monitoring will be conducted 
to review the frequency, severity, and relatedness of AEs. In addition, the study will be monitored to 
ensure compliance with the protocol and the continued acceptability of the investigator and institution.  
4.6 Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The potential benefits to enrolled subjects and the medical community outweigh the potential risks 
identified in this protocol. Robust preclinical testing has demonstrated the safety of the device 
components  and all materials that come in contact with enrolled subjects . The early experience of the 
PBSS in CE Marked indications suggest the device is well tolerated and performs its pr imary function of

frequent safety assessments  and to identify any potential new  risks.   
5 Study  Objectives  
The primary objective of the study is to collect safety and performance data of the PBSS when used for 
the treatment of painful impending and actual fractures of the humerus secondary to metastatic 
malignancy.  
6 Study Design  
This is a  prospective, multi -center, open label study  to evaluate the PBSS in the treatment of impending 
and actual pathological fractures of the humerus  for the purposes of FDA marketing clearance .  
A total of up to  80 subjects will b e recruited from up to 20 sites in the United States . 
6.1 Study Endpoints  
The following study endpoints will be evaluated in all subjects who consent to the study and are treated 
with the IlluminOss PBSS . All endpoints are subject -based unless otherwise specified.  
 
6.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
Pain Reduction  
 Change in VAS Pain Score  at Day 90  
 
Functional Improvement  
 Change in Revised Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Rating Scale for Upper Extremity (MSTS)  at 
Day 90  
 
Primary effectiveness  will be evaluated relative  to literature -based historical controls . These were  selected 
on the basis of comparability to the target population  and similarity to the investigational device.  There 
are two primary effectiveness endpoints, reduction in pain at 90 days relative to pre -treatment baseline 
and improvement in function at 90 days relative to pre -treatment baseline.  The changes in VAS pain and 
MSTS from pre -treatment baseline to day 90 will be involved in the primary effectiveness tests to be 
applied to enrolled patients who have actual or impending fractures, with VAS pain s cores of at least 
60mm.   Non -inferiority of mean changes over time will be compared relative to reference values 
determined through evaluation of historical controls.  Testing for VAS pain reduction will first be 
performed. Only if the null hypothesis of inferiority in mean VAS pain improvement is rejected at 
p<0.05, will the co -primary endpoint MSTS be similarly tested.  
 
Safety Success  is evaluated  according to a composite enpoint  by meeting all of the following criteria:  
 Clinical  
o No Serious Device Relat ed Complications  
o No additional surgical interventions:

 Radiographic  
o No device fracture, migrations, mal -alignment or loss of reduction or fixation  
The number and percentage of patients achieving the Safety S uccess endpoint will be reported 
cumulatively for day 7 -14, 30, and 90 and 180 and 360 and with 95% 2 -sided exact binomial confidence 
intervals . 
6.1.2 Secondary Endpoints  
The secondary endpoints, evaluated at the Day  90 Visit , include:  
 The individual components of the safety endpoint  
 Other secondary endpoints include:  
o Duration of index procedure and length of hospital stay  
o Activities of Daily Living score through all follow -up intervals  
o Disability status  
o Evaluation of duration of physical therapy prescription  
o Assessment of prescription and over -the-counter analgesic medication use  
o Survivability from time of index procedure to death  
 The safety endpoints evaluated through Day 90  also include:  
1. Incidence  and number of AEs.  
2. Incidence  and number of procedure - and devic e-related complications.  
The secondary endpoints  and safety endpoint s listed above will also be examined during the extended 
follow up portion of the trial at Day 180 and 360.  
 
6.2 Primary Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness hypotheses for the primary VAS pain improvement endpoint and the co -
primary MSTS functional improvement endpoints are as follows:  
 
Ho: mean improvement in VAS at 90 days ≤ 80% of Ref. (inferior)  
Ha: mean improvement in VAS at 90 days   > 80% of Ref.(not inferior)  
 
Ho: mean i mprovement in MSTS at 90 days ≤ 80% of Ref. (inferior)  
Ha: mean improvement in MSTS at 90 days  > 80% of Ref (not inferior)  
Testing for pain reduction will first be performed. Only if the null hypothesis of inferiority in mean VAS 
pain improvement is rejec ted at p<0.05, will the co -primary endpoint MSTS  functional improvement  be 
similarly tested. P -values will be determined by comparing the maximum likelihood estimates of average 
mean at 90 days to target value determined through evaluation of historical controls  based on the mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) described below .

6 January 2016                        Page 28 of 60 6.3 Historical Controls  
VAS pain improvement:  Target reference mean improvements were derived from literature -based 
historical control data available on a per patient basis from 4 selected articles (Gregory et al. 2011, Kim et 
al. 2011, Deschamps et al. 2012, and Pretell et al. 2010). The minimum improvement in Pretell and Kim 
were both 40.  The Pretell study repor ted mean improvement of (SD) = 74.8 (13.3) in 21 patients and the 
Kim study provided mean (SD) improvement of 56.7 (11.1) in 15 patients. Gregory included patients with 
actual fractures and impending fractures.  Four patients had baseline pain scores of ze ro and 1 had a score 
of 20; all remaining patients had baseline VAS ≥ 40.  Mean (SD) improvement for patients with baseline 
VAS pain ≥ 40 mm was 67.5 (16.7).   Kim and Gregory used 10 point numerical rating scales and these 
were multiplied by 10 to put mea surements on the same scale as Pretell.  The following table summarizes 
the improvements in VAS pain score these 44 patients by study.  
 
Means and Std Deviations  
Level  Number  Mean Impr  Std Dev  Std Err 
Mean  
Deschamps  8 67.50  16.69  5.90 
Kim 15 56.67  11.13  2.87 
Pretell  21 74.76  13.27  2.90 
Mean improvements significantly differed among studies based on one -way ANOVA F(2,41)=8.15, 
p=0.001 due to difference s in timing of assessments and other study conduct differences.  However, it is 
clear that there were ve ry large mean improvements in all three studies . Moreover, the SD’s are similar 
across studies  providing confidence in the estimated between patient variance .  The  weighted  mean 
improvement is 67.3 and the pooled estimate of the SD is 13.3. To determine re ference target for the 
primary test of non -inferiority, th e weighted mean improvement  was multiplied by 80% to get 53.8.  
Therefore,  the primary effectiveness hypothesis concerning VAS pain improvements is:  
 
Ho: mean improvement in VAS at 90 days ≤ 53.8  
Ha: mean improvement in VAS at 90 days  > 53.8  
 
That is, this study seeks to demonstrate that the mean change improvement in VAS pain scores from 
baseline to D ay 90  is greater than 53.8.  Clearly, a mean improvement >53.8 is clinically meaningful  and 
important to patients .  If this is demonstrated, it will be concluded that the investigational device 
performance is not clinically significantly inferior to the historical control as defined above.  
 
MSTS Improvement:  The Kim article and the Gregory a rticle contain data for improvements in MSTS.   
However, the intervention in the Kim article was more similar to the investigational device (i.e., 
intramedullary nail).  It was also  not possible to determine timing of post -operative MSTS assessments in 
Gregory.  Therefore, reference target for MSTS improvement was constructed using the Kim study as the 
historical control.

to facilitate interpretation.  The standard deviation of mean improvements is somewhat larger for MSTS 
compared to VAS pain, implying that a larger sample size is need ed compared to VAS pain.  80% of 29.6 
is 23.7.    
 
Therefore,  the primary effectiveness hypothesis concerning MSTS functional improvements is:  
 
Ho: mean improvement in MSTS at 90 days ≤ 23.7  
Ha: mean improvement in MSTS at 90 days  > 23.7  
 
That is, it must be demonstrated that the mean improvement f rom baseline to Day 90 is greater than 23.7.  
This implies that the mean improvement must be shown to correspond to nearly 25% of the range of the 
MSTS scale to meet th e effectiveness study success criterion  for the co-primary endpoint .

7.1 General Methods  
This section summarizes key aspects of the analysis plan including the methods to be used to test the primary 
effectiveness hypothesis and justification for the sample size to be used in these tests. Additional details regarding 
methods for the final data analysis will be provided in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) which will be 
written and approved prior to study la unch with any amendments approved prior to database lock. The SAP will 
detail all analyses and data displays. The SAP will be executed according to SOPs in a controlled environment.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS for Windows, Version 9.2 or higher. Descriptive statistics 
for continuous variables will consist of the number, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum 
values. For categorical variables, the count and percent of each category will be displayed.  
7.2 Sample Size Ratio nale 
VAS pain improvement: The primary endpoint is change in VAS from baseline to Day 90.  All patients will be 
included in the primary analysis of this endpoint through the use of a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
model assuming an unstructured covari ance matrix. To be conservative, statistical power is evaluated on the basis 
of a single -sample t -test with a 1 -sided alpha=0.05 based on the change at Day 90.    As discussed in Section 6.2 
above, the null and alternative hypotheses of interest are:  
Ho: mean improvement in VAS at Day 90   53.8 
Ha: mean improvement in VAS at Day 90  > 53.8  
Based on the above historical control data in Section 6.2, an estimate of the standard deviation of the primary 
endpoint is 13.3 .  Under the assumption this is the tr ue standard deviation, under the assumption the true mean 
improvement from baseline VAS at Day 90  is 58, then 68 evaluable patients yields over 80% power to reject the 
null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.  In order to account for 15% premature withdrawal rate, a total of 80 
patients will be enrolled.  Note that the assumption of 5 8 for the true mean improvement from baseline VAS at 90 
days may be conservative given the historical control data in Section 6.2 (where the overall mean change was 
estimated to be approximately 67, over a shorter periods than 90 days).   
MSTS improvement:  The second primary endpoint, to be tested if the above null hypothesis for improvement 
in VAS is rejected, is change in MSTS from baseline at Day 90;  this will be ana lyzed a similar MMRM manner 
as the primary endpoint above.   As discussed in Section 6.2 above, the null and alternative hypotheses of interest 
for this endpoint are:  
Ho: mean improvement in MSTS at Day 90  ≤ 23.7  
Ha: mean improvement in MSTS at Day 90  > 23.7 
The hypothesis regarding mean improvement in MSTS will be tested conditionally on rejection of the null 
hypothesis concerning VAS pain improvements (1 -sided p<0.05). Based on a single -sample t -test (1 -sided 
α=0.05), assuming that the true standard devia tion at each visit is equal to 20.8, assuming a sample size of 68 
(accounting for potential LTF), then at least 80 % power will be achieved to reject the null hypothesis that the

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 33 of 60 mean improvement in MSTS <23.7 if the true mean change is at least 30.3 at Day  90. This value is similar to the 
mean improvement for the Kim historical control (mean = 29.6). Thus, as long as the true mean improvement 
across post -baseline visits is similar to than the mean improvement reported in Kim, there will be good statistical 
power to reject the conditional hypothesis concerning the co -primary endpoint of improvement in upper arm 
function as reflected in change in MSTS  at Day 90.  
7.3 Analysis Population  
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) analysis population is defined as all subjects who pr ovide informed consent, undergo 
surgery, and have an implantation  or attempted implantation  of the IlluminOss Photodynamic Bone 
Stabilization System into the intramedullary canal; this includes subjects for whom implantation of the 
IlluminOss device is attempted but fails; such patients will be followed and included in the ITT population. The 
ITT population is equivalent to the Full Analysis Set (FAS). The ITT population will serve as the primary 
analysis population. Effectiveness will be evaluated in the ITT po pulation as primary.  
The per -protocol (PP) analysis population is defined as all ITT subjects who achieved the 90 -day visit.  This 
will be the  secondary analysis population.  
7.4 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Summary tables will be provided for demographic and baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
work status,  occupation, history of pain, smoking history, hand dominance, and fracture characteristics if evident. 
Continuous variables will be summarized using means, standard deviations, medians, minimum, and maximum 
values.  
7.5 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary  effectiveness hypotheses to be tested in this study are:  
Ho: mean improvement in VAS at Day 90   ≤ 80% of Ref. = 53.8  
Ha: mean improvement in VAS at Day 90  > 80% of Ref. = 53.8  
Ho: mean improvement in MSTS at Day 90  ≤ 80% of Ref. =23.7  
Ha: mean improvement  in MSTS at Day 90  > 80% of Ref = 23.7  
Testing for VAS pain reduction will first be performed. Only if the null hypothesis of mean VAS pain 
improvement is rejected at one -sided 0.05 level of significance, will the co -primary endpoint concerning MSTS 
functi onal improvements be similarly tested.  
Summary statistics for VAS and MSTS scores at baseline and changes from baseline to each follow -up 
visit will be presented (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values).  
Each null hypothesis will be tested as follows:  A mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) model will be 
executed for the dependent variable of “change from baseline at each visit”, with the categorical main effect of 
visit (Day 7 -14, Day 30, Day 90) as the i ndependent variable.  From this model, the estimate of the overall mean 
change from baseline at Day 90  and its standard error, will be established, and from this a one -sample t -test will 
be generated to test the null hypothesis of interest at a one -sided 0 .05 level of significance. The MMRM model

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 34 of 60 will be estimated using a direct likelihood approach as implemented in the SAS procedure PROC MIXED. The 
model will include the baseline value of the score as an additional covariate. The model is designed not only  to 
account for correlations among responses over time, but to use these correlations to implicitly impute missing 
values from the non -missing values. Inferences based on this approach are unbiased under the assumption of 
MAR (missing at random) which is a  more generally true assumption than MCAR (missing completely at 
random)65. The MMRM will employ an ‘unstructured’ covariance matrix that allows the correlations to vary 
between each pair of time points and allows the variances to differ over time.  If the  model does not converge 
with the unstructured covariance matrix, other structures may be used, starting with compound symmetry.  Full 
details will be provided in the formal statistical analysis plan.  
These analyses will be carried out for the ITT (primar y) and PP (secondary) analysis sets.  
7.6 Handling of Missing Data  
All patients in the ITT analysis set will be included in the primary effectiveness test as long as there are non -
missing baseline values. The MMRM provides implicit imputation of missing post-baseline values through the 
covariance matrix reflecting the associations among responses within patient over time.  
7.7 Multiplicity  
The primary effectiveness hypothesis concerns improvements in VAS pain at Day 90.  Only if the null 
hypothesis is rejected relative to historical control with p<0.05 will testing for improvement in MSTS 
function occur. Pre -specification of the order of testing within this hierarchical framework eliminate 
type 1 error inflation due to multiplicity. Therefore, no multiplicity ad justment will be made across the 
co-primary endpoints.  
7.8 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
7.8.1 Procedure - and Device -related Complication Rate

Range of motion will be assessed using ordinal variables reflecting the forward flexion, lateral elevation, external 
rotation, and internal rotation of the arm. Summary statistics for range of motion will be presented at each follow -
up visit. In additio n, the number and percentage of subjects for each level of these ordinal variables will be 
displayed.  
7.8.7  Return to Work  
The numbers and percentages of subjects who returned to work, and in what capacity (e.g., full -time, part -time, 
with limitations) will be presented at each follow -up visit.  
7.8.8  Extended Follow Up Visits  
The analysis described above will also be provided for the extended follow up visits once completed.  
7.8.9  Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Incidences of treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) 
will be presented. Incidences of TEAEs will also be presented by maximum severity, seriousness, and 
relatedness (device or procedure rel ated) at Day 90 and during the extended follow up visits. This includes 
the reporting of device revisions, reoperations, removals, supplemental fixations, or other procedures.  
7.9 Optional  Analyses  
7.9.1  Fracture Location/Type of Primary Cancer  
Analysis of primary and/or secondary endpoints as described above may also be performed on subgroups. These 
subgroups would be defined by fracture location (proximal, diaphyseal and distal fractures) and by type of primary 
cancer.  
7.9.2  Health Economic Data  
Descriptive statistics  for the duration of physical therapy prescription will be presented. The number and 
percentage of subjects who used supportive orthopedic devices post -surgery and who used prescription and over -
the-counter analgesic medication will be presented. No formal  statistical testing will be undertaken and no p -
values will be presented.

After 30 patients have been treated and followed for 90 days, an interim MMRM analysis on change from 
baseline VAS at Day 90  will be carried out.  The purpose of th is interim analysis is not to stop the trial for 
overwhelming efficacy, but rather to (a) potentially stop for futility; and (b) potentially increase the sample size if 
the mean VAS improvement from baseline at Day 90  is large but not as large as anticipated in the original sample 
size calculations.  The interim analysis will be generated and reviewed by an independent statistician not 
otherwise involved in the study, who will report to the Sponsor of whether or not a sample size increase is needed, 
but with no other details regarding the interim results.  
At this interim stage, the conditional power for rejecting the above null VAS hypothesis will be calculated, 
conditioned on the interim observed results.  If the cond itional power is ≥ 80%, the study will continue as is.  If the 
conditional power is between 50% and 80%, then the sample size increase required to achieve 80% conditional 
power will be calculated using the Chen -DeMets -Lan (CDL) approach3.   If conditional power is between 10% 
and 50%, no sample size increase will be carried out, and if the conditional power is <10%, the study may be 
stopped for futility.  
Under the CDL approach, an “alpha -penalty” does not need to be made for any sample size increase as lon g as the 
maximum sample size increase required to maintain 80% power is below the bound 100* R% of the original 
sample size, where R is calculated as follows:  
 
√1+𝑅(√1+𝑅−1)/√1+𝑅−𝑡=0.84/1.645 
where t is the proportion of information at the interim analysis ( t=0.5), 0.84 is the standard normal (z) critical 
value corresponding to 80% power, and 1.645 is the z critical value corresponding to a one -sided alpha of 0.05.  
Specifically, as long as the sample size increase required to maintain 80% conditional power is  <R*100% of the 
original sample size, then the sample size increase does not require an alpha -penalty.  
8 Schedule of Subject  Activities  
8.1 Visit 1: Screening and Baseline  
8.1.1 Screening  
A Pre -screening Log will show 1) all patients (anonymized) who presented with a n impending 
pathological fracture  or actual fracture  but who were not offered the study and the reason(s) and 2) all 
patients to whom the study was described but who declined participation.  
Qualified patients  who agree to participate in the study will be re quired to sign an  informed consent form 
(ICF). After signing the ICF, study subjects will undergo study -specific screening procedures.   
All patients  who consent to the study will be listed on the Screening/Enrollment Log.  This log will 
document the date of  screening, the results of screening , and the primary reason for exclu sion if the 
subject did not satisfy the initial eligibility criteria  or was disqualified during surgery .

9 Adverse Event s, Adverse Device Effects and Device Deficiencies  
9.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) : any untoward medical occurrence , unintended disease  or injury or untoward clinical 
signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in patient s, users or other persons,  whether it is con sidered 
device related or not.  Only adverse events which are new or have worsened will be evaluated in the safety 
assessmen t. 
IlluminOss Medical, Inc. – U.S. Pathological Humerus Fractures  Confidential  
Study ID#: 14 -03-PATHOLHUM -02  
 
Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 40 of 60 The severity of the AE should be assessed based on the following definitions:  
 Mild: an AE that is noticeable to the patient  and may require additional therapy;  
 Moderate: an AE that interferes with the patient ’s activities and requires intervention or 
additional therapies;  
 Severe: an AE that is intolerable, or necessitates additional therapy, or places the patient  at 
immediate risk of harm.  
Serious Adverse Event : An AE is considered serious (SAE) if it  
 results in death,  
 led to serious deterioration in health that either:  
o resulted in  life-threatening  illness or injury , or 
o require d in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,  or  
o result ed in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or  
o Resulted in  medical or  surgical intervention to prevent life threatening illness , or  
o led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
Note that planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition or a procedure required by the protocol, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a n SAE. 
Device Deficiency : A device d eficien cy is defined as inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its 
identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety , or performance.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) : an AE is considered to be a UADE if there is an 
occurrence of an adverse effect on health or safety, if that effect or problem was not previously identified 
in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or ap plication, or if any other 
unanticipated problem associated with the device occurs that relates to the rights, safety or welfare of 
patients.  
Device -related AE : an AE is considered to be device -related when, in the judgment of the PI, the clinical 
event ha s a reasonable time sequence associated with use of the investigational device and is unlikely to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other procedures or medications.  It is reasonable to believe that the 
device directly caused or contributed to the AE.  
Procedure -related AE : an AE is considered to be procedure -related when, in the judgment of the  PI, it is 
reasonable to believe that the event is associated with the device implant or removal procedures and is not 
specific to the investigational device use d.  Other products, surgical techniques, or medications required 
specifically for the procedure are likely to have contributed to the occurrence of the event.  
For purposes of this study, the following events are not considered to be AEs because they are no rmally 
expected to occur in conjunction with the device -implant and/or removal procedures, or are associated 
with customary, standard care of patients undergoing surgical procedures for treatment of arm fractures:  
 Early post -operative pain (within 72 hours  post-index procedure) at the access site and/or 
related to position on procedure table ; 
 Post-anesthesia/conscious sedation emesis, nausea, or headache (within 24 hours post -index

 Electrolyte imbalance without clinical sequelae following index procedur e, even if requiring 
correction;  
 Systolic or diastolic blood pressure changes that do not meet the definition of hypotension or 
hypertension;  
 Low grade temperature increase (≤ 38.3 °C /  101 F) wit hin 24 hours of index procedure;  
 Hematocrit decrease from baseline, but not associated with hemodynamic changes and 
remaining above 30% ; 
 Blood loss without transfusion, associated with a decrease in hemoglobin or hematocrit of <  2 
g/dl or <  6%, respectively from baseline level with a resulting hemat ocrit that is ≥  30% (or 
hemoglobin  ≥ 10 g/dl);  
 Minor, loc alized tenderness, swelling, in duration, oozing, etc. at the surgical  site. 
This listing of events is intended to provide guidance to the investigational sites for purposes of AE 
reporting. The  PI at the investigational site should utilize his/her own clinical judgment in evaluating 
subject  AEs, and may determine that the above events should be reported as AEs . 
The PI should follow all unresolved SAEs until the events are resolved  or the investigator assesses them 
as chronic or stable , the subject  is lost to follow -up, the subject  has withdrawn consent, or the AE is 
otherwise explained.  
9.2 Relation to the Device  and Procedure  
The potential relationship of the event to the investigational device or procedure is to be determined by 
the PI and will be based on the following definitions:  
Not related  
An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate that there is no causal c onnection between the 
event and the device or procedure. The AE is due to , and readily explained by , the subject ’s underlying 
disease state or is due to concomitant medication or therapy  not related to the use of the device or the 
procedure.  In addition, the AE may not follow a reasonable temporal sequence following the treatment 
procedure.  
 
Possibly related  
There is a reasonable possibility that the AE may have been primarily caused by the device or procedure.  
The AE has a reasonable temporal relationshi p to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a 
known or expected response pattern to the investigational device or procedure, but alternative etiology is 
equally or more likely , compared to the potential relationship to the use of the device or the procedure.

Version 5.0 
6 January 2016                        Page 42 of 60 Probably related  
There is a reasonable probability that the AE may have been primarily caused by the device or procedure.  
The AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the device or the procedure and follows a 
known or expected response pattern to the investigational device or procedure.  
 
Definitely related  
The AE has a strong causal relationship to the device or proc edure.   The AE follows a strong temporal 
relationship to the use of device or the procedure, follows a known response pattern to the investigational 
device or procedure, and cannot be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject ’s clinical 
state or other therapies.  
9.3 Reporting to Sponsor  
All AEs classified as SAEs, or UADEs  shall be reported by the PI (or designee) to the study CRO via 
telephone  1-215-616-3096   or email ( icon-mads@iconplc.com ) within 24  hours of learning of the AE . 
The PI (or designee) shall send a written report, including a narrative description of the SAE/UADE , to 
the Sponsor or CRO , within 3 working days of the initial report.  
Subject  death during the study must be reported by  the PI (or designee) with written document ation by 
facsimile to the Sponsor or CRO within 24  hours of the PI’s knowledge of the death.  Notification of 
death must include a brief statement of the relevant details of the death and is required to be signed by the 
investigator.  A copy of the death r ecords, death certificates, and an autopsy report (if performed)  should 
be sent to the Sponsor or the Spon sor’s authorized representative ( CRO ) within 10  days post -autopsy.  
In the event of death, efforts should be made to perform an autopsy in order to ass ess the state of the 
target arm.  If autopsy is not performed, written documentation from the PI will be required regarding the 
reasons why.  
9.4 Reporting to Institutional Review Board and FDA  
All SAEs (including deaths) , and/or UADEs  shall be reported to the IRB and FDA  in accordance with 
regulatory  requirements.  
For the purpose of this guidance and based on the definitions above, the following events are considered 
reportable events:  
- any serious adverse events  
- new findings/updates (e.g. outcome) in relation to already reported events  
- any Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
 Events will be reported to the FDA as required by regulation.

All AEs, regardless of their relationship to the investigational device, must be recorded on the AE  case 
report f orm (CRF) by the  PI (or designee)  for all events that occur after the consent form is signed .  
Adverse events will be collected based upon medical diagnosis and not symptoms.  The report should 
include: severity, duration, treatment used, treatment outcome , and the PI’s written medical judgment of 
the relationship of the AE to the study device, proc edure, , etc. ( i.e., unrelated, related , or relationship 
unknown).  In the case of serious or unanticipated AEs, medical record documentation (e.g. , procedure 
notes, discharge summary, relevant progress notes, imaging , or lab oratory  studies) must be sent t o the 
Sponsor or designee to describe the treatment, duration, resolution , and outcome of the AE. 
The following criteria must also be adhered to by the  PI: 
 Use separate AE f orm(s) to  document each series of events;  
 The AE f orm(s) must be signed by the PI or sub-investigator;  
 It is the responsibility of the PI to inform the  IRB of SAEs as required by the  
IRB procedures.

PI. 
10.8 Data Monitoring and Quality  Control  
A contracted CRO is  assigned to manage the data for the investigational study on behalf of the Sponsor, 
IlluminOss Medical.  
10.8.1  Training  
The training of the PI will be the responsibility of the Sponsor, IlluminOss Medical , with the assistance of 
the CRO. To ensure uniform data collection and protocol compliance, the appointed monitor will perform 
study initiation visits to review the clinical protocol, techniques for the identification of eligible patients, 
instructions on in -hospital data collection, methods for soliciting data from alternative sources, and 
schedules for follow -up with study site personnel, and the regulatory requirements of participating in a 
clinical trial.  
Didactic Session : The didactic session will be comprised of a presentation re viewing the concepts of the 
protocol and a review of any information from clinical use of  the PBSS device.  The team will be shown a 
presentation on the surgical technique  and the removal technique , should the product need  to be removed 
sometime after implantation or due to a failure of the balloon during infusion and/or curing.  This session 
will allow all those involved in the study to pose questions regarding the investigational plan and 
investigational device use.  
Hands -On Demonstration: In addition to the didactic segment, a practice session using modeling will 
allow  the clinician to gain a better understanding of the system operation.

required.  
10.8.4  Data Review  
At routine monitoring visits, HIPAA -compliant research methods will be used to ensure that all patients 
presenting with impending pathological  fractures secondary to metastatic bone disease were considered 
for participation in the study.  
All CRFs will be reviewed for completeness and clarity.  Missing or unclear data will be investigated by 
the monitor and will be clarified and entered by study personnel a s necessary throughout the study.  
IlluminOss Medical  or the contracted CRO may request additional documentation from the PI, such as 
physician procedure notes or physician written summaries, when AEs are observed and reported.  
Development of the primary database for the study will be managed by IlluminOss Medical or the 
contracted CRO .  IlluminOss Medical or the contracted CRO  will also be responsible for quality control 
of the database and confirming the overall integrity of th e data.  
10.8.5  Record Maintenance  
PI files containing all records and reports of the investigation should be retained for a minimum of 2 years  
after the completion/ termination of the investigational study.  They may only be discarded upon written 
notification by the Sponsor.  To avoid error, the PI should contact IlluminOss Medical before the 
destruction of any records and reports pertaining to the study to ensure they no longer need to be retained.  
In addition, in accordance with the Clinical Study Agreement, the  Sponsor should be contacted if the PI 
plans to leave the investigational site so that appropriate arrangements for file custodianship can be made.

IlluminOss Medical or the contracted CRO is  responsible for t he monitoring o f the s tudy.  The study will 
be monitored according to applicable provisions of CRO ’s clinical monitoring procedures and in 
compliance with  regional regulations . 
10.9 Clinical Investigational Protocol  Amendments  
No amendments to the protocol may be made without prior authorization of IlluminOss Medical Inc. and 
the approval of the IRB and FDA . 
10.10  Deviations from Clinical Protocol and Medical Emergencies  
The PI will not deviate from the clinical protocol without the p rior written approval of IlluminOss 
Medical except in medical emergencies or in unforeseen, isolated instances where minor changes are 
made that will not increase the subject’s risk or affect the validity of the study.  In medical emergencies, 
prior writte n approval for protocol deviations will not be required, but the CRO , as the authorized 
representative of the Sponsor, should be notified within 24 hours of occurrence.  
Deviations to the protocol will be documented on CRFs. Investigators will also adhere t o procedures for 
reporting deviations to  their IRB in accordance with their specific IRB reporting  policies and procedures.  
Major deviations to the protocol may result in study termination of an investigator or investigational site.  
10.11  Investigational Site Suspension or Premature Termination  
If conditions arise during the study that indicate that the study or an investigational site should be 
terminated, the Sponsor, Investigator, Monitor, IRB,  and/or regulatory agencies will discuss the situation 
and take a ppropriate action after consultation.  The Sponsor reserves the right to  terminate an 
investigational site from the study . Examples of noncompliance include, but are not limited to : 
 Repeated failure to complete CRFs;  
 Failure to obtain informed consent;  
 Failure to report SAEs within 24 hours of knowledge;  
 Loss of or unaccountable investigational device inventory;  
 Repeated protocol violations;  
 Failure to enrol l an adequate number of subjects . 
Noncompliance is defined as the I nvestigator not complying with an enforceable and/or agreed upon 
requirement. In the case of a noncompliance, corrective and preventative actions may be taken. 
Noncompliance also involves the I nvestigator not complying with or initiating an effective corrective 
action plan to ensure com pliance. Depending on the nature of the noncompliance, the Sponsor may decide 
to take further action, disqualify the Investigator, terminate enrollment or terminate the site entirely.  
If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended for any reason, the IRB and, if necessary , the 
regulatory authorities, will be informed promptly and provided with a  detailed written explanation for the

replacement (e.g. due to mechanical failure of the implant, infection, etc.).  
 Reoperation: a re-operation is any surgical pro cedure at the involved implant (or “index surg ery”) 
site that does not remove, modify or add any aspect of the implant (e.g. drainage of a hematoma at the 
surgical site).  
 Supplemental Fixation: a supplemental fixation is a procedure in which additional, non -IlluminOss 
device(s) are implanted at the index surgical site (e. g. plates and screws). (No te: external devices such 
as splints or casts, which may be used in the routine care of patients with fractures, are not considered 
supplemental fixation).  
Other Interventions:  Therapeutic interventions the patient experiences dur ing the study period, which do 
not meet the definition of Revision, Removal, Reoperation, or Supplemental Fixation, and are considered

H.  Other Adverse Event Definitions  
Acute Renal Failure:  acute post -operative renal insufficiency resulting in one or more of the following: 
(a) increase of > 1.0 mg/dl in serum creatinine from most recent prior measured level, and current 
measur ed absolute value is > 2.0 mg/dl; (b) a new requirement for dialysis.  
Anemia : Decrease from baseline in red blood cells, hemoglobin, or total blood volume that is associated 
with hemodynamic changes or requires transfusion, or a drop in hematocrit to below  30%. Any bleeding 
event requiring ≥2 units PRBCs will be considered an SAE.  
Death:  all cause mortality, occurring from time of index procedure through 360 days post -index 
procedure.  
Hypertension : Acute or severe elevation of systolic blood pressure requi ring treatment.  
Hypotension:  Abnormally low blood pressure requiring circulatory support seen in shock but not 
necessarily indicative of it.  It may be caused by dilation of the blood vessels, or loss of Systemic 
Vascular Resistance.  
General Discomfort : Ph ysical or psychosocial signs or symptoms commonly associated with 
hospitalization that are investigated and determined to require minor (i.e. aspirin, non -narcotic 
medication) or no treatment.  
Nausea : The unsettling feeling in the stomach that accompanies  the urge to vomit.  
Pain : An unpleasant sensation occurring in varying degrees of severity as a consequence of injury, 
disease, or emotional disorder.  
Vasovagal Reaction : Reflex stimulation of the vagus nerve resulting in slowing of the heartbeat, 
decreased blood pressure, etc. and requires treatment consisting of any of the following: (a) > 1 liter of IV 
fluids; (b) postural changes; (c) pacing intervention; or (d) administration of atropine.  
Wound Dehiscence:  The separation of the surgical wound  after more than 24 hours of closure, which can 
be due to non -union, trauma, infection, or other cause .

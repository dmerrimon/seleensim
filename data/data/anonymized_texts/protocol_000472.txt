Term  Definition  
Comprehensive 
neurops ychological  
assessment  Defined by AACN guidance (Board of Directors, 2007):   
“Neuropsychological evaluations vary in content depending on their purpose, 
but they typically assess multiple neurocognitive and emotional functions. 
Primary cognitive domains include : intellectual functions; academic skills (e.g., 
reading, writing, math); receptive and expressive language skills (e.g., verbal 
comprehension, fluency, confrontation naming); simple and complex attention; 
learning and memory (e.g., encoding, recall, recogn ition); visuospatial abilities; 
executive functions, problem -solving an d reasoning abilities; and sensorimotor 
skills. Ideally, assessments should also include measures designed to assess 
personality, social -emotional functioning, and adaptive behavior.”  
Cognitive Domain  For this study, collected cognitive domains include Language ,  
Executive Function , Attention , Verbal Memory , Visual Memory , Verbal 
Fluency , and Motor Function  
Preferred 
neuropsychological 
tests  For this study, tests include Boston Naming , Trails making Test A and Test B ,

2 BACKGROUND  & PURPOSE   
A portion of patient concern regarding epilepsy surgery is potential for cognitive decline or functional 
deficit following surgery.  To address this concern, comprehensive neuropsychological testing is 
performed as part of the surgical epilepsy evaluation  and at  follow -up. While neuropsychological and 
functional change after open resection is well described, change following Laser Interstitial Thermal 
Therapy  (LITT) is less well known. The goal of this study is to assess and describe differences in post -
surgical neuropsychological test  scores in a population of patients with epilepsy who are undergoing 
LITT.  This study will also assess a subset of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy for changes to 
visual fields. This study is being conducted as a sub -study within the LAANTERN r egistry; therefore, all 
enrolled patients in PENSAR must be consented to both protocols.  
 
3 INTERVENTION/TREATMENT  
• All subjects will undergo comprehensive neuropsychological assessment post -LITT per standard 
of care practice .  
• Visual field testing will be conducted in a subset of enrolled patients.  
 
4 STUDY  DESIGN  OVERVIEW  
This is a multicenter sub -study that will include comprehensive neuropsychological assessment data 
collection done at baseline (within 1 year prior to the index LITT procedure ) and at follow -up (at least 6 
months from the index LITT procedure) . Visual field testing will be conducted in a subset of enrolled 
patients.  Up to 250 subjects may be enrolled at up to 15 study sites.  
 
 
4.1 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
Primary outcome measure: Site -determined cognitive changes per domain  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Neuropsychological test data will be collected for all study participants to describe 
cognitive domain specific changes  as a cohort. Change will be assessed from r aw test 
score s and demographically  corrected  standardized scores  (where available).  
 
Secondary outcome measure 1 : Change in raw test scores  from standard battery of 
preferred neuropsychological tests  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Describe the observed change or stability of neuropsychological test scores in patients 
who underwent  laser ablation surgery . Change will be assessed from r aw test score s and 
demographically  corrected  standardized scores  (where available).  
 
Secondary outcome measure 2 : Incidence of visual field deficits in patients with MTLE.  
[Time Frame: 6+ months]  
Visual field testing using Humphry automated fields ( HVF 24 -2 SITA standard) will be 
conducted for a subset of patients to identify visual field deficits resulting after the LITT 
procedure.

 4.2 STUDY POPULATION  
Subjects  who meet inclusion  criteria and no exclusio n criteria and sign the Informed Consent Form  (ICF)  
(CL10149 ) will be  considered enrolled in this study . Subjects will continue to be identified by their u nique 
identification number (ID)  assigned  in LAANTERN and will be presented with additional  electronic  Case 
Report Forms ( eCRFs)  applicable for the PENSAR study.  
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient or legally authorized representative provides written authorization and/or consent.  
2. Patient is enrolled in the LAANTERN trial and had an epilepsy diagnosis without  the 
presence of a malignant brain tumor.  
3. Patient is 16 years of age or older.  
4. Patient has completed a baseline comprehensive neuropsychological assessment with a 
neuropsychologist.  
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
1. Patient does not complete the index LITT procedure as specified in the LAANTERN 
registry.  
 
5 INFORMED CONSENT (ICF)  
The Sponsor will provide a template ICF to each site for Institutional Review Board ( IRB) submission prior 
to the site initiation. This template may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual study site. 
The Sponsor must pre -approve all changes to the ICF prior to initial submission to the IRB. A copy of the 
IRB-approved ICF must b e sent to the Sponsor and the original copy must be retained at the study site. If 
the ICF is amended by the reviewing IRB, the Sponsor must pre -approve all changes to the ICF prior to 
submission. In addition, a copy of the approved documents must be provi ded by the Investigator to the 
Sponsor prior to enrollment of subjects in the study.  
The Investigator or assigned designee must administer this approved ICF to each prospective  study 
subject and obtain the subject’s signature or a legally authorized representative signature along with the 
date of consent and prior to  performing any PENSAR study related activity. The  ICF must be obtained in 
accordance with 21 CFR Part 50. Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study 
at any time and for any reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is  
otherwise entitled and informed that withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical 
care.  A copy of ICF must be given to each subject enrolled in the study. The institutional standard subject 
consent form does not replace the study ICF . 
 
6 VISIT SCHEDULE AND DATA COLLECTION  
Neuropsychological testing is typically conducted as standard of care at baseline and at follow -up. The 
testing should be conducted by qualified neuropsychologist. The neuropsychologist should use the same 
tests at follow -up so that the status of change  from baseline  may be assessed.   
Collection of preferred test results will allow for pooling of multicenter data for the Primary Outcome and 
Secondary Outcome 1. A listing of preferred and commonly used tests assessing multiple 
neuropsychological functions are provided in Table 1.  
Additional neuropsychological tests consisting of each site’s standard -of-care battery (along with raw 
scores and demographically corrected standardized scores) will also be accepted in cases where 
preferred test results are not available.  
Visual fields  testing will be conducted as the study intervention/treatment at follow -up using Humphry 
automated fields ( HVF 24 -2 SITA standard) for visual field test ing to assess peripheral vision after at least  
6 months from the index LITT procedure  in cases where:  
• The patient is diagnosed with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE)/mesial temporal sclerosis 
(MTS).  
• The patient has an amygdala/hippocampal LITT ablation.

7 STUDY COMPLETION OR WITHDRAW AL 
Subjects will complete the PENSAR study  once follow -up comprehensive neuropsychological testing is 
completed and/or their participation in the LAANTERN registry ends.  
 
8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
No separate adverse events will be collected or reported for this study. Adverse events will continue to be 
collected and  reported under the LAANTERN protocol  criteria and definitions. Visual field test results  and 
neuropsychological outcomes are not reportable adverse events unless  they meet LAANTERN protocol 
criteria and definitions .  
 
9 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Anticipated  protocol deviation s include improper  consenting of subject  (i.e., consent not obtained  and 
improper consenting ) and not completing follow -up neuropsychological testing . All deviations will be 
reported to Monteris Medical.  It is the site’s responsibility to report deviations in compliance with their 
Institutional Review Board  if required . 
 
10 DATA ANALYSIS  
Study objectives  will not be statistically powered given the anticipated heterogeneity in available 
neuropsychological test results.  
Scores will be collected to assess domain specific changes for the Primary outcome measure using pre -
defined clinically meaningful cut scores ( based on previously described methods1,2):  
• Changes of 1.5 standard deviations will be considered improved (+) or worsened ( -). 
• Changes of 2.5 standard deviations will be considered substantial post -operative improvements 
(+) or worsening ( -).  
• Any score change less than 1.5 standard deviation will be considered unchanged and the result 
of anticipated variability.  
 
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the results for Secondary Outcome measures:  
• Continuous variables: The total count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be 
provided.  
• Categorical variables: Total count and percentage will be provided.  
 
Ad hoc, exploratory analyses may be conducted if sufficient sample size allows for correlation or 
multivariate assessment of patient subsets (e.g., those with improvement or worsening).  
 
11 DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT   
The study  will be performed in accordance with all requirements set forth in the U.S. regulations, 21 Code 
of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 50 (Protection of Human Patients ), 56 (Institutional Review Board), 
and applicable requirements from the reviewing IRB for the study  at each site .  
 
The study  data will be hosted in  the same electric data capture ( EDC ) system  as the LAANTERN registry  
where it will continue to follow compliance  with the U.S. regulations, 21 CFR part 11, Electronic Records; 
Electronic Signatures.   
 
All required data for this study will be collected on standardized Case Report Forms (CRFs).  
Qualified study staff at each investigational site will perform primary data collection drawn from source 
document ( e.g., hospital chart) review. All CRFs will be subject to review for omitted data, gross data 
inconsistencies, illegible data , and deviations. Any deficiencies or deviations will be reviewed,  and any 
necessary action determined ( e.g., data query, communication to the study center).  
De-identified source documents will be collected  for neuropsychological test ing results at baseline and 
follow -up. De -identified source for the  Single Field Analysis (HVF24 -2 printouts) from both eyes will be 
collected  as well as  summary data of normal/abnormal findings.

Monteris Medical  Strictly Confidential  Page 9 of 10 
 Data review (including crosschecks) will be performed,  and any discovered errors will be reported to the 
study site using the data correction and query process (as necessary). The study site will review the 
query, respond , and make any necessary corrections or comments. The data cleaning cycle will be 
repeated until all data are considered clean.

conduct of the clinical investigation, including obtaining and documenting proper study  informed consent, 
collecting all required data, su bmitting accurate and complete CRFs, etc.  
At each site, appropriate procedures must be followed to maintain subject confidentiality according to 
appropriate local regulations ( e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the U.S.).  Each 
site may have its own internal procedures or requirements for use and release of subject medical  
information in research studies.  Each Investigator is responsible for obtaining appropriate approvals, 
consents, or releases of medical information as dictated by their relevant patient  privacy laws.  
The study  is not transferable to other sites attended by the Investigator unless prior approval is obtained 
from the appropriate IRB and the Sponsor.   
 
12.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD  (IRB) APPROVAL  
Investigators must submit the study  protocol and ICF to their reviewing IRB and obtain IRB written 
approval before being allowed to conduct and participate in the study . Each Investigator must submit to 
the Sponsor a copy of the IRB approval letter, specific to this protocol and addressed to Investigator, 
certifying study  approval prior to enrolling subjects into  the study . This approval letter should identify the 
study  name, study protocol number (including revision number), the date of the approval as well as the

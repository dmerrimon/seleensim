score (SDS) in the normal range of 0.0 to +2.0  at 26 weeks of weekly  
Tran sCon hGH treatment  
 To evaluate the change in height standard deviation scores ( ∆HSDS)  
in children with GHD  at 26 weeks  of weekly TransCon hGH 
treatment  
 To determine the incidence of antibodies against TransCon hGH 
(anti-hGH and anti -PEG ) in children with GHD  over 26 weeks of 
weekly  TransCon hGH treatment  
 To assess the expected maximum observed concentration (Cmax) of 
Trans Con hGH in children with GHD ≥ 6 months to < 3 years old  
 To assess the preference for weekly TransCon hGH or commercially 
available daily hGH treatment  
 To assess the treatment satisfaction of weekly TransCon hGH over 
time

TransCon hGH Dose:  
TransCon  hGH will be  dosed at 0.24 mg hGH/kg /week.  This dose was 
selected due to variable compliance with daily dosing regimens and to be 
consistent with  the pivotal phase 3 heiGHt Trial that has been ongoing 
since November 2016.  The initial volume  of TransCon hGH 
administered will be calculated using the  weight measurement obtained 
at Visit 1 and the TransCon hGH bracketed weight chart.  
Dose Adjustment Parameters:  
The following parameters may be used by the investigator to adjust the 
TransCon hGH dose without Medical Monitor  pre-approval.  
At Visit  2, the TransCon hGH dose may be adjusted  by the investigator  
based on the TransCon hGH bracketed weight  table . 
Additionally, t he goal for IGF -1 should be between 0 and +  2.0 SDS 
(unless a different target is identified in consultation  with the Medical 
Monitor ).  Thus, if the IGF -1 SDS measured at Visit 2 (or the Cmax Visit, 
as applicable)  is < 0 SDS, and following confirmation  of IGF -1 level  as 
< 0 SDS  by a second measurement collected 5 days post -dose (±1 day) , 
the dose may be increased by approximately 20% to the next higher  
weight bracket by the investigator.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Stopping/Dose Reductions:  
The investigator (with Medical Monitor  pre-approval) or Medical 
Monitor  (and, if needed, with the Independent Safety Committee [ISC]  
review ) may stop or reduc e the dose of stu dy drug at any time during the 
trial in the presence of the following  symptoms and laboratory 
abnormalities:  
 Severe hGH-related AEs at any tim e during the trial  
 Pregnancy  
Subjects who are sexually active must use an effective form of 
contraception  
 IGF-1 > +2.0 SDS: Following confirmation of IGF -1 level  as 
> +2.0 SDS by a second measurement collected 5 days post -dose 
(±1 day) , TransCon hGH dose may be decreased by 
approximately 20% to the next lower weight bracket, unless a 
different target is identified in consultation with the Medical 
Monitor  
Any re -establishment of the original dose (0.24 mg 
hGH/kg /week) due to a subsequent sub -optimal IGF -1 
response should  receive prior  approval by  the Medical 
Monitor . 
 Substantially reduced IGF -1 and growth response or ev idence of 
a hyper sensitivity to TransCon hGH  
 Evidence of clinically significant pre -diabetes or diabetes (HbA1c  
> 6.2%  measured at Visit 2 and an absolute increase of 0.5% 
from Screening HbA1c ): Following confirmation of HbA1c level, 
TransCon hGH dose may be decreased by approximately 20% to 
the next lower weight bracket. If appropriate follow -up 
monitoring shows progressively worsening glucose intolerance, 
additional TransCon hGH dose adjustments  may be appropriate.  
 Clinical evidence of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) based 
on history and physical exam, including visual changes, 
headaches, nausea, vomiting, and/or papilledema on fund oscopy : 
TransCon hGH treatment should be discontinued while BIH is  
clinical ly manage d 
Reinstituti on of TransCon hGH treatment, preferably at a 
lower dose, should receive prior approval by the Medical 
Monitor . 
 De novo  diagnosis of  a slipped capital femoral epiphysis should

transiently bound to a carrier, methoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), via a 
proprietary low -molecular -weight TransCon linker.  The inert  mPEG acts 
as a carrier, extending hGH circulation time in the body through a 
shielding effect that minimizes GH receptor binding and renal excretion, 
thereby largely inactivating hGH until its release.  Over a one -week 
period, TransCon hGH releases fully -active unmodified hGH via 
auto-hydrolysis of the TransCon linker in a controlled manner based on 
physiologic power of hydrogen (pH) and temperature.  As such, the 
TransCon technology is designed to maintain the same mode of action as

STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
Baseline and demographic data will be summarized to characterize the 
study population.  Special subgroups of interest, such as prior exposure 
to growth hormone and age categories will be determined, and 
corresponding subgroup analysis for safety and efficacy will be 
performed as appropriate.  Prior and concomitant medication , as well as 
exposure to study drug,  will be summarized.  
Data from clinical assessments will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.  Numerical variables will be summarized by mean, median, 
standard deviation, minimum, and maximum, while categorical variables 
will be summarized  by counts  and proportions.  
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  A sample size of 150 subjects provides at least 95% probability to 
observe  AEs with a 2% or more incidence rate .  It also enables the 
combined safety database of the clinical program ( a sample size of 
approximately  300 exposed to TransCon hGH for at least 6 months ) to 
have at least 95% probability to observe AEs with a  1% or more  
incidence rate.  
As recruiting  subjects < 3 years old will prove challenging, an exact 
sample size for this coho rt has not been pre -determined.

 Background and Rationale  
hGH is a product of endocrine secretion of the pituitary gland, which targets tissues to promote 
g
rowth in children and control metabolism in children and adults.  It is secreted by somatotroph 
cells located in the lateral wings of the anterior pituitary gland.  The secretion of hGH is pulsatile 
in nature; the majority of  secretory pulses (up to 70% of daily secretion) occur with the first 
e
pisode of slow-wave sleep.  During childhood hGH levels are relatively stable until puberty, 
when the h GH pulse amplitude is elevated with no change in the frequency of pulses; afterwards 
hGH pulse levels gradually decline through adulthood.  hGH production and secretion are 
re
gulated by multiple factors; growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and ghrelin are the 
most significant stimulators, while somatostatin is the strongest inhibitor. 
The hGH gene cluster is located on human chromosome 17q22-24, encoding a 191 amino-acid 
prote
in of 22 kDa and a less abundant 20 kDa hGH molecule (as well as related proteins).  hGH 
sti
mulates the hepatic production and release of IGF-1 which in turn acts on target tissues and is 
li
kely responsible for most, but not all, activities of h GH.  IGF-1 is also produced by growth 
c
artilage in response to hGH, where it acts locally as a paracrine ‐autocrine growth factor.  hGH 
a
lso has direct effects in the growth plate (eg, stimulation of chondrogenesis, in concert with 
I
GF-1 action) and in adipocytes (eg, lipolysis, in opposition to IGF-1 mediated lipogenesis).  
I
GF-1 is found in association with specific IGF-binding proteins whose main functions are to 
extend IGF-1 half-life in circulation, transport IGF-1 to target cells, and modulate its biological 
actions. 
The most important and obvious function of hGH is growth promotion of children.  Through its 
I
GF-1 mediated effects (as well as less obvious direct effects ), it stimulates cartilage and bone 
growth by enhancing the activity of chondroblasts and osteoblasts and promoting collagen 
synthesis.  In addition, hGH has important metabolic functions: it exerts potent anti-insulin 
effects resulting in decreased glucose utilization (and resultant increased plasma glucose levels) 
and increased lipolysis (in contrast to the opposing actions of IGF-1 to lower plasma glucose and 
incr
ease lipogenesis); these functions underlie its continued secretion into adulthood.  New 
research continues to reveal other potential roles of hGH, including regulation of cardiac and 
im
mune function, mental agility and aging. 
GHD is the result of impaired production or secretion of h GH, which can appear at any time 
point in life and is due to various known and unknown factors.  The etiology of childhood GHD 
is most commonly of hypothalamic origin with impaired GHRH secretion, the most common 
diagnosis being isolated idiopathic GHD.  GHD is a well-recognized clinical entity in adults as 
we
ll.  It causes abnormalities in body composition, lipid metabolism, and physical and 
psychosocial function, all of which improve with hGH replacement therapy.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Fifty years have passed since the human pituitary hGH extract was purified and the first GHD 
patient was succe
ssfully treated.  Contamination with infectious agents (Creutzfeld-Jakob prions) 
led to discontinuation of its use in 1985 ( Kemp 2014).  A recombinant human growth hormone 
(
somatropin) was then produced by introducing the human DNA sequence into Escherichia coli  
(E coli ) and later produced in other cell lines; it first became commercially available in 1985.  
The
 product is identical to natural hGH with 191 amino acids.  Since then, several hundred 
thousand chil
dren have received hGH for growth impairment.  In addition, hGH has been 
successfully used to treat growth impairment associated with a number of conditions such as 
Turner syndrome, Prader- Willi syndrome, chronic renal insufficiency, short stature homeobox 
(SHOX) deficiency, Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature, and children born small for 
gestational age
 (SGA).  The safety and efficacy profile of daily hGH preparations in pediatric 
and adult populations is well established and deemed satisfactory. 
At the present time, however, there are no commercially available sustained-release or long-
acting h
GH preparations.  Currently hGH is available only as daily injection formulations, thus 
c
ausing 
a significant burden and interruption of normal daily life to children and their parents, as 
we
ll as compliance issues.  Decreased compliance with daily hGH therapy is known to result in 
sub-optimal height outcomes ( Cutfield 2011).  If a weekly long-acting hGH product were to have 
sim
ilar efficacy, safety, and tolerability while maintaining hGH exposure in the optimal 
therapeutic 
range as existing daily therapies, preference and satisfaction for the weekly regimen 
would likely exist, with improved compliance to follow. 
To address this unmet need, the Sponsor developed TransCon hGH, part of the company’s 
proprietary pipeline of drugs that utilize TransConjugation (ie, transiently attaching proteins or 
small molecules to a car
rier) to create an inactive prodrug.  The prodrug is stable during storage, 
but, after subcutaneous injection, the prodrug enters the bloodstream where the active ingredient 
(
hGH) underg
oes sustained release under physiological temperature and pH in a controlled and 
predictable manner.  This ensures an extended in vivo half-life and more constant drug 
concentration levels than observed when using traditional conjugation methods (eg, permanent 
PEGylation).  TransC
onjugation technology is designed to provide several key benefits to 
pharmaceutic
al product development: 
1) Efficacy/safety profiles similar to daily hGH therapy 
2) Extended in vivo half-
life of hGH while maintaining exposure in the optimal therapeutic 
range 
TransCon hGH is a weekly administered hGH prodrug that liberates unmodified hGH as the 
active pha
rmaceutical ingredient through controlled auto-hydrolysis resulting in sustained release 
of hGH.  TransCon hGH
 consists of hGH that is transiently conjugated to mPEG via a 
(TransCon) linker (Fi
gure 1) .

hGH = human growth hormone; mPEG = methoxypolyethylene glycol, c = 250 
The linker that forms the bridge between the protein and mPEG moieties is stable at pH 5.0.  
However, after introduction into a physiological pH and temperature (ie, after injection of 
TransCon hGH), 
autohydrolysis of the linker occurs in a controlled manner that follows 
first-order kine
tics, whereby unmodified, fully-active hGH is released.  As the released hGH is 
completely unmodified, it has the same mode of action and tissue distribution as endogenous 
hGH.  This is important for optimal efficacy, as a portion of hGH activity is mediated by local 
hGH effects in target tissue, including the growth plate and adipocytes.  The release of hGH also 
liberates N1, -N1, - N3-trimethyl-1,3-propane-diamine, a small molecular weight compound 
associated with the linker.  The
 remainder of the inactive mPEG-linker component of TransCon 
hGH is cleared from the body through known natural mechanisms for other high molecular 
weight molecules.
 
The exposure-toxicity relationship of PEG in animals and humans has been well investigated and 
metabolism/excretion of PEG is well understood, indicating that the PEG associated with a 
biological molec
ule represents an acceptable benefit-risk ratio to humans ( Webster 2007).

Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page 30 of 99 
Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  The Sponsor initiated the TransCon hGH development program with TransCon PEG80 hGH 
(ACP-001), in which the carrier was 80 kDa mPEG, and for which 4 clinical trials were 
c
onducted: 2 phase 1 trials in healthy adults, 1 phase 2 trial in adult GHD, a nd 1 6-month 
phase 2 trial in pediatric GHD .  Ac ceptable  safety, pharmacokinetics (PK ), and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) were shown in these trials.  Importantly, safety, tolerability, and 
e
fficacy comparable to Genotropin were shown in the phase 2 pediatric GHD trial, as well as 
c
omparable exposure (C max and area under the curve ( AUC ) ) when compared to the same weekly 
dose of daily hGH. 
Upon completion of the TransCon hGH (ACP-001) p hase 2 clinical program, the Sponsor 
modified the TransCon hGH product by replacing the 80 kDa mPEG with a 40 kDa mPEG, with 
the unde
rstanding that this difference in mPEG would not significantly affect the autohydrolytic 
release of hGH, the prolonged half-life, or the inactive nature of the parent TransCon hGH 
product.  The linker component and hGH remained the same between TransCon hGH (ACP-001) 
and TransCon hGH (ACP-011); the only change was the reduction in mPEG carrier size.  This 
c
hange resulted in TransCon hGH (ACP-011), a drug product that is functionally equivalent in 
both PK and PD to its predecessor, but with lower viscosity and higher product concentration 
that e
nables smaller injection volumes and the use of a small-gauge needle.  Additionally, the 
PEG exposure was reduced by ≥ 50%. 
 Relevant Findings from Nonclinical Studies  
Nonclinical PK and PD models have supported the suitability of TransCon hGH (ACP-011) for 
once-weekly treatment of patients. 
Ove
rall, the toxicity studies with TransCon PEG40 hGH did not identify any unexpected 
findings or significant concerns, following either weekly repeat dosing in cynomolgus monkey 
for up to  26 weeks, for up to 5 weeks in the rat, or following in utero exposure in rat, or during 
c
ritical phases of pre- and post-natal development in rat.  TransCon hGH (ACP-011) and derived 
hydrolysis products were not genotoxic when assessed in a standard battery of genotoxicity tests, 
and no adverse effects were observed in stand-alone safety pharmacology studies in the rat. 
Following weekly repeat dosing for up to 26 weeks at dose levels 20-fold above the expected 
therapeutic dose, a minimal increased body weight gain was observed in the juvenile 
cynomolgus monkey.  Non-adverse test article-related microscopic findings, interpreted as 
exaggerated pharmacology, were limited to the mammary glands in both male and female 
animals.  The findings included small amounts of exudate, ductal dilation, vacuolation, 
mononucle
ar cell infiltrate, and minimal lobular hyperplasia in females only, and only at the 
4.8 mg hGH/kg dose level.  Hyperplasia is a recognized finding at high growth hormone doses in 
monke
ys, presumably reflecting cross-reactivity with the prolactin receptor. 
Additionally, the nonclinical safety pharmacology program for TransCon hGH (ACP-011) did 
not i
dentify adverse effects on the function of the central nervous, pulmonary, or cardiovascular 
systems.  No effects on the cardiovascular system were observed in the adult or juvenile

hGH
/kg/week (highest dose tested).  In all studies, multiple time points were selected to ensure 
adequate coverage of the T max of the parent prodrug and the autohydrolysis products.  
F
urthermore, an in vitro hERG assay was performed as part of the TransCon hGH (ACP-001) 
nonclinical safety program and was deemed relevant by FDA and BfArM to support 
development of TransCon hGH (ACP-011).  In this study (Study 790652), the application of 
partly hydrolyzed TransCon hGH (ACP-001) containing released hGH (nominal concentration of 
72 μ
g/mL), remainder mPEG80-linker (nominal concentration of 289 μg/mL), and TMPD 
(nominal concentration of 235 ng/mL) did not produce a statistically significant effect on the 
hERG ion channel tail current. 
Comprehensive QSAR assessments evaluating the potential carcinogenicity, genotoxicity and 
cardiotoxicity of TMPD have been performed.  Based on these evaluations, mainly employing 
FDA data sets of modules built by the ICSAS group of the CDER branch of the FDA in 2010, it 
was concluded that structural elements of TMPD do not show evidence of carcinogenicity, 
genotoxicity or cardiotoxicity (MultiCASE 2011). 
DEREK did not identify any alerts linked to mutagenicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, hERG 
channel inhibition, or any of the DEREK rapid prototype clinical related endpoints such as 
bradycardia, hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity.  Leadscope investigations were marginally 
positive in the E coli mutagenicity model but negative in the mouse lymphoma model.  TMPD 
was not predicted to be carcinogenic in rodent models (CTS 2011). 
Additionally, TransCon hGH has been studied in two Phase 1 trials in adults 
(ACP 001 PK/PD-001, and ACP 001 CT-003), a Phase 2 trial in adults with GHD 
(ACP
 001 CT -002), and a 26-week Phase 2 trial in treatment-naïve children with GHD 
(A
CP 001 CT-004).  Electrocardiograms in each of these trials did not demonstrate any 
drug
-relate cardiotoxicity. 
The nonclinical data are provided in further detail in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
 Clinical Experience  
A first p hase 1 clinical trial of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) in healthy male volunteers has been 
conducted as a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation trial versus placebo and daily hGH 
(Omnitrope) investigating the safety, tolerability, PK and PD response in 44 healthy male 
subjects.  No negative effects of the test drug were detected when compared to placebo and the 
active comparator (Omnitrope).  The test product was well tolerated at up to 0.24 mg hGH/kg 
when injected once subcutaneously to 28 healthy male subjects.

(ACP-001) a
t 2 different dose-levels, 0.30 mg hGH/kg and 0.36 mg hGH/kg, respectively, in 
24 male and female healthy subjects.  ACP-001 was well tolerated with no safety concerns.  
Detailed information is given in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. 
A phase 2 clinical trial in adult subjects with GHD was a randomized, open-label, 
active-c
ontrolled trial of 3 dose levels of TransCon hGH (ACP-001) (0.02, 0.04 and 0.08 mg 
hGH/kg/week) compared to daily hGH (Omnitrope 0.04 mg hGH/kg/week divided into 7 equal 
daily doses) over 4 weeks.  A total of 37 subjects were randomized.  The PK results showed that 
dose-linearity was observed for AUC and C max of hGH in 29 subjects.  TransCon hGH 
(A
CP-001) slowly released hGH in a sustained, controlled manner and thereby increased the 
overall exposure of hGH, making it suitable for once-a-week dosing.  The PD  results showed 
that ACP
-001 elevat ed IGF-1 over the period of 1 week, with an AUC similar to that provided by 
daily hGH.
 
A phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric subjects with GHD has been conducted as a multicenter, 
ra
ndomized, ope
n-label, active-controlled, parallel-group trial of 3 doses of TransCon hGH 
(ACP-001; 0.14, 0.21 and 0.30 mg hGH
/kg/week) compared to daily hGH (Genotropin 0.21 mg 
hGH/kg/week divided into 7 equal daily doses) over 26 weeks.  55 subjects were randomized, of 
whom 53 receiv
ed study drug (12 subjects in the 0.14 mg hGH/kg/week, 14 subjects in the 
0.21 mg hGH/kg/week and 14 subjects in the 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week TransCon hGH cohorts and 
13 subjects in the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week Genotropin cohort).  Mean annualized HV among the 
3 dose levels administered weekly ranged from 11.9 cm for the 0.14 mg/kg/week dose to 
12.9 cm for the 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose to 13.9 cm for the 0.30 mg hGH/kg/week dose, 
which were all comparable to 11.6 cm for the active comparator, daily injections of Genotropin 
at a 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week dose ( Figure 2) .

No reports of drug-related serious or unexpected AEs were observed.  AE s were generally mild 
and observed at the same level and nature compared between the 3 TransCon hGH cohorts and 
the Genotropin cohort.  Injection site reactions were generally mild and transient and were 
observed at a rate that was similar to the daily hGH control arm.  There were no observations of 
injection site nodule formation or lipoatrophy.  Low immunogenicity (a single subject with a low 
ti
ter) was consistent with published data for daily hGH .  This subject, treated with the lowest 
dose of TransCon hGH (0.14 mg hGH/kg/week), demonstrated an annualized HV of 19.0 
c
m/year compared to the cohort mean of 11.9 cm/year.  No neutralizing antibodies were 
de
tected.  Maximum and average hGH blood concentration were comparable between equivalent 
we
ekly doses of TransCon hGH and daily hGH. 
A dose
-proportional increase in IGF-1 levels into the normal range was observed following 
dosing of the 3 TransCon hGH dose levels.  Consistent with expectations, transient point values 
of IGF-1 st
andard deviation score > +2.0 have been observed in a small number of subjects and 
primarily in the high-dose treatment arm (0.30 mg/kg/week). 
The clinical safety profile of ACP-001 was overall comparable to daily hGH.  Headache and 
fatigue were the most frequent drug-related AEs during the phase 2 adult growth hormone 
de
ficiency (AGHD) trial and were reported in all treatment groups.  No AEs were judged to be 
de
finitely drug-related.  The single probably related AE was a subject with iron deficiency

e
rythema (p hase 2 AGHD) and pain (p hase 2 pediatric GHD), occurred across all treatment 
groups. 
TransCon hGH (ACP-011) was found to be bioequivalent to TransCon hGH (ACP-001) in a 
phase 1 single center, randomized, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, a nd 
PD of ACP-011 at doses of 0.24, 0.30, and 0.42 mg hGH/kg administered subcutaneously to 
he
althy subjects.  There was a crossover portion in the trial to compare the PK and PD 
pa
rameters of ACP-011 and ACP-001 at the 0.24 mg hGH/kg dose level. 
The ratios of the means for C max and AUC for both released hGH and IGF-1 fell within the 
bioequiva
lence limits of 80% – 125%.  Following a single subcutaneous administration of 
Tr
ansCon hGH (ACP-011), free hGH showed a dose dependent increase in mean serum C max and 
AU
C within the dose range 0.24 to 0.42 mg  hGH/kg.  Serum concentrations increased rapidly 
with a me
dian T max of 16.0 to 36.0 hours.  Elimination appeared in a mono-phasic manner and 
the me
an terminal half-life ranged from 21.8 to 25.4 hours independent of dose. 
Following the switch from ACP-001 to ACP-011 described above, a global phase 3 trial, called 
the 
TransCon hGH heiGHt Trial in children with GHD, was initiated in September 2016 and is 
ong
oing.  The heiGHt trial is a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 registration 
stud
y that is designed to enroll approximately 150 children with GHD who have not previously 
been treated.  The inclusion criteria require subjects to be pre-pubertal children with bone age 
that is at least six months less than chronological age, impaired height that is either greater than 
or equal to two standard deviations (SD) below the population mean or at least 1.5 SD below 
mid-parental height (MPH), GHD diagnosis confirmed by two different GH stimulation tests, 
a
nd IGF-1 that is greater than or equal to one SD below the population mean.  Patients will 
re
ceive either once-weekly TransCon hGH (0.24 mg hGH/kg/week) or daily injections of 
Ge
notropin at 34 µg/kg/day (0.24 mg hGH/kg/week) with a 2:1 randomization in a 
non-inferiority design.  The primary endpoint of the trial is height velocity after 52 weeks of 
tre
atment.  Other key endpoints include an annualized HV a t earlier time points, change in height 
standard deviation scores over 52 weeks, normalization of IGF-1 SDS, change in serum IGF-1  
and IGFBP-3 levels, and change in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 SDS.  Patients completing the trial on 
stud
y drug may then enroll in the planned phase 3, open-label extension trial, CT-301EXT. 
 Trial Rationale  
In comparison to the heiGHt trial, the primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of 
unde
rgoing the switch from a commercially available daily hGH product to weekly TransCon 
hGH (ACP-011) in children with GHD (6 months-17 years old, inclusive).  Adolescents up to 
17 years old who have not completed puberty and infants down to 6 months of age are included 
to obt
ain additional safety and tolerability data of TransCon hGH in a broader age range than 
be
ing evaluated in the heiGHt trial, which is evaluating TransCon hGH in subjects with GHD

dosi
ng with TransCon h
GH or commercially available daily hGH will also be evaluated. 
 Summary of P otential Risks and Benefits 
TransCon hGH (ACP-011) is a new hGH prodrug product with a proposed once-weekly dosing 
regimen designed to overcome the inconvenience and suboptimal compliance of daily hGH 
injections and is anticipated to have a comparable safe ty and efficacy profile to currently 
a
pproved daily hGH products, while maintaining exposure (C max and AUC) in the optimal 
ther
apeutic range and biodistribution established by daily hGH products.  Obviating the need for 
daily inje
ctions should increase compliance and therefore long-term efficacy, which would be of 
great bene
fit to pediatric patients with GHD ( European Union 2008).

(≥ 0.20 mg hGH/kg/week) for ≥ 13 weeks but ≤ 130 weeks and be  without evidence of closed 
e
piphyses. 
The trial will be conducted at up to approximately 50 sites specialized in the management of 
pediatric G
HD. 
The trial consists of: 
1) Screening Period – up to approximately 4 weeks 
2) Tr
eatment Period – up to 27 weeks of dosing 
The total duration of participation for each subject in the trial will therefore be up to 
approximately 31 weeks (Figure 3 ). 
Ea

 Premature Subject Withdrawal  
Early withdrawal occurs when an enrolled subject ceases participation in the trial, regardless of 
the circumstances, prior to the expected completion of the trial.  Additionally, the investigator 
may discontinue the tre
atment of a subject at any time if considered to be in the subject's best 
interest.  Unless infor
med consent is withdrawn, any subject who discontinues treatment should 
be encoura
ged to remain in the trial and attend all subsequent clinic visits.  See  Section 7.3.1  for 
a list of stopping
 rules governing early termination of subjects from the trial. 
In the cas
e of premature discontinuation of a subject’s participation in the trial ( eg, withdrawal of 
informed consent), the investigator should schedule an Early Termination Visit to collect data, 
particularly AE
 follow-up data (if applicable), and to collect blood for laboratory evaluations.  
This visit should contain a
ll assessments from Visit 3 (Week 26), and should be documented in 
the eCRF
 together with the reason(s) for trial discontinuation.  In the case of treatment 
discontinuation for ca
uses other than withdrawal of informed consent, subjects should be urged 
to remain in the trial and a
ttend all subsequent trial visits.  An Early Termination Visit is not 
required for subjec
ts who remain in the trial after discontinuing study drug.  However, if the 
subject is not willing to attend all subsequent trial visits, this should be considered a withdrawal 
from the trial and an Early Termination Visit should be scheduled. 
Every effort should be made to observe subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug 
for the entire observation period, even if they discontinued trial treatment.  The investigator 
shoul
d make every attempt to contact the subject/parent/legal guardian via phone to arrange the 
appropriate follow-up assessment(s) for such subjects. 
 Subject Repl acement Criteria  
Subjects who terminate early are not expected to be replaced.

 Labeling  
All study drug will be labeled according to GMP and local requirements.  Subjects/parents/legal 
guardians will be provided with dosing and storage instructions.  Study drug labels will comply 
with regulatory requirements of each country and will be printed in the local language. 
 Treatment  Administered  
TransCon hGH will be provided as a lyophilized powder in single-use glass vials to be 
reconstituted with 1 mL sWFI.  Two concentrations will be available, the less concentrated for 
lighter weig
ht subjects, the more concentrated for higher weight subjects: 
 12.1 mg hGH/vial (11.0 mg hGH/mL when reconstituted) 
 24.2 mg  hGH/vial (22.0 mg hGH/mL when reconstituted) 
Table 1  shows the weight ranges and corresponding drug concentration and volume to be 
administered to all subjects, regardless of weight, with an average dose of 0.24 ± 0.02 mg 
hGH/kg/week.  If the concentration suggested in the preferred dosing column is unavailable, 
alternati
ve dosing should be followed.  It is imperative that investigators do not  calculate a 
weight-based dose but rather follow the chart and administer the exact volume (based on weight) 
of the given concentration as indicated. 
TransCon hGH will be injected SC into the left and right buttock, left and right thigh, and left 
and right abdomen b
y the subject/parent/legal guardian/caregiver except at Visit 1 where the trial 
staff may administ
er the first dose.  To minimize local side effects, it is recommended to rotate 
the 6 injection sites in a subsequent manner (eg, right thigh, right abdomen, right buttock, left 
thi
gh, left abdomen, le
ft buttock).

The reason for administering the exact volume as per Table 1 (rather than calculating the exact 
dose) is as follows.  At the conclusion of this 26-week trial, if eligible, subjects may choose to 
enter the extension trial, CT-301EXT, during which TransCon hGH will initially be administered 
by syringe and needle.  When the auto-injector, a unique device developed specifically for the 
administration of TransCon hGH, becomes available, subjects will be switched from the 
administration of TransCon hGH by syringe and needle to the auto-injector. 
With the auto-injector, TransCon hGH will be provided in single-use dual chamber cartridges 
(DCCs).  Multiple DCC presentations will be available containing 20% incremental increases in 
dose to support increasing weight ranges.  Thus, each DCC will contain a specific quantity of 
TransCon hGH to support a specific weight range consistent with Table 1.  The intention within 
thi
s trial is to mimic dose increments that will eventually be administered via the auto-injector in 
the CT-301EXT (extension) Trial. 
Additionally, dosing based on volumes for weight ranges with 20% bracketing assures that all 
subjects will rec
eive an average of 0.24 mg/kg/week over the course of the trial. 
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for complete details on the composition and 
characterist
ics of TransCon hGH.

 Dispensing and Storage  
TransCon hGH must be kept in a locked area at the clinic with access limited to designated trial 
staff and stored a
ccording to its labeling.  The sWFI supplied for reconstitution of TransCon 
hGH should also be stored according to its labeling.  All products will be temperature monitored,

. 
TransCon hGH and sWFI will be dispensed by trial staff and sent home with the subjects/ 
parents/

Further details a
re provided in the trial manual and Instructions For Use. 
 Selection of Trial Doses  
TransCon hGH is an inactive prodrug.  The phase 2 pediatric GHD trial with TransCon hGH 
demonstrated tha
t a dose of 0.21 mg hGH/kg/week provided similar hGH exposure, efficacy 
(annualized HV),  and safety/tolerability compared to the equivalent weekly dose of Genotropin, 
with PD demonstrating normalization of IGF-1 SDS.  This trial also demonstrated comparable 
tolerability
 and safety and numerically greater annual HV with a 0.30 mg/kg/week dose of 
TransCon hGH.  Treatment guidelines support initiation of hGH at a dose of 0.24 mg 
hGH/kg/week 
(Grimberg 2016 ) .  The TransCon hGH 0.24 mg hGH/kg/week dose is currently 
be
ing studied in t
he phase 3 heiGHt Trial.  To align the starting dose across the TransCon hGH 
program, the same dos
e has been chosen for the current trial.  Given non-compliance rates on 
daily hGH dose
s versus the expected increased compliance in this trial, even subjects entering on 
0.30 mg hGH/kg/week will likely do well on the lower TransCon hGH dose.  Importantly, 
I
GF-1 levels, along with other safety parameters discussed in  Section 9.6, will be measured at 
Visi
t 2 (and the C max Visit, as applicable) and, if needed, changes in dosing allowed. 
 Dose Adjustment s 
9.6.1 Dose  Adjustment Parameters 
The following parameters may be used by the investigator to adjust the TransCon hGH dose 
without Medical Monitor pre-approval. 
At Visit 2, the TransCon hGH dose will be adjusted by the investigator based on weight (See 
S
ection 9.3
). 
Additi
onally, the goal for IGF-1 should be between 0 and + 2.0 SDS (unless a different target is 
identified in consultation with t
he Medical Monitor).  Thus, if the IGF-1 SDS measured at 
Visit 2 (or the C max Visit, as applicable) is < 0 SDS, and following confirmation of IGF-1 level as 
< 0 SDS by a second measurement collected 5 days post-dose (±1 day) at an unscheduled visit, 
the dose may be increased by approximately 20% to the next higher weight bracket by the 
investigator (Se
e Section 9.3 ).

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  9.6.2 S topping/Dose Reductions 
The investigator (with Medical Monitor pre-approval) or Medical Monitor (and, if needed, with 
the 
IS
C review) may stop or reduce the dose of study drug for an individual subject at any time 
during
 the trial in the presence of the following symptoms and laboratory abnormalities: 
 S
evere hGH -related AEs at any time during the trial (eg, peripheral edema, severe headache, 
intracranial hypertension or other adverse drug reaction and/or abnormal laboratory values)  
 Pregnancy  
Subjects who are sexually active must use an effective form of contraception  
 I GF-1 > +2.0 SDS measured at Visit 2 (or the C max Visit, as applicable) should be confirmed 
b
y a second measurement collected 5 days post-dose (±1 day) at an unscheduled visit.  If the 
I
GF-1 SDS is still elevated above +2.0, the TransCon hGH dose may be decreased by 
a
pproximately 20% to the next lower weight bracket, unless a different target is identified in 
c
onsultation with the Medical Monitor.  
Any re-establishment of the original dose (0.24 mg hGH/kg/week) due to a subsequent 
sub-optimal IGF-1 response should receive prior approval by the Medical Monitor.  
 S ubstantially reduced IGF-1 and growth response or evidence of a hypersensitivity to 
TransCon hGH  
 Evidence of clinically significant pre-diabetes or diabetes (HbA1c > 6.2% measured at 
Visit 2 and an absolute increase of 0.5 % from Screening HbA1c) should be confirmed by a 
second measurement at an unscheduled visit.  If the repeat values are the same or higher, the 
Tr
ansCon hGH dose may be decreased by approximately 20% to the next lower weight 
bracket.*  If appropriate follow-up monitoring shows progressively worsening glucose 
int
olerance, additional TransCon hGH dose adjustments may be appropriate. 
* If a subject had evidence of borderline glucose intolerance or diabetes prior to starting 
study drug ( eg, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 98 mg/dL and HbA1c 5.9%), treatment of 
h
yperglycemia should occur prior to study drug treatment adjustment. 
 C linical evidence of benign intracranial hypertension (BIH) based on history and physical 
exam, including visual changes, headaches, nausea, vomiting, and/or papilledema on 
fundo scopy should result in discontinuation of TransCon hGH treatment and clinical 
management

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Reinstitution of TransCon hGH treatment, preferably at a lower dose, should receive 
prior approval by the Medical Monitor. 
 De  novo diagnosis of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis should result in a dose reduction or

tion 
 Identification of anti-hGH antibodies that are determined to be neutralizing 
If treatment is discontinued, all subsequent visits and assessments should continue as planned.

 Drug Accountability  
Trial s ite staff will be supplied with the study drug and ancillary supplies to distribute as required 
to sub
jects/parents/legal guardians.  Dedicated site staff will be responsible for study drug and 
associated procedures, as well as ancillary supplies, exercising accepted medical and 
pharmaceuti
cal practices.  Study drug and ancillary supplies must be kept in an appropriate, 
secure area at the trial site and stored according to conditions specified on the product labels.  
The trial will use an Internet-based interactive web response system (IWRS) to capture drug 
inventory and a
ccountability data, including receipt of drug inventory and supplies by the site, 
dist
ribution to subjects, return to the site from subjects, and return to the Sponsor (or destruction 
with the Sponsor’s approva
l).  Each study drug delivery to the site must be confirmed, including 
da
te, quantity
, and batch/pack number.  Each drug dispensed by the site to a subject must include 
date and amount of dru
g dispensed.  Each drug return ed to the site by a subject must include date 
a
nd amount of unused drug returned. 
The computer sy
stem complies with all applicable regulatory requirements for record keeping 
and record retention in clinical trials (21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP ) as do paper systems.  
The IWRS will be the only drug accountability documentation by trial sites. Clinical 
investigators will not be expected to maintain paper source documentation of drug inventory, 
dispensing, and acc
ountability. 
The system is designed so that changes to any record do not obscure the original information.  
The audit record will clearly indicate that a change was made and clearly provide a means to 
locate and read the prior information.  All changes to the data have an electronic audit trail in 
accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  Electronic signatures will be used in accordance with 21 CFR 
Part 11. 
Upon completion or termination of the trial, the investigator will, until further notice, keep 
remaining study drug
 and ancillary supplies, along with a copy of the inventory records from the 
IWRS.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  IMPORTANT: Under no circumstances will the investigator allow study drugs to be used other 
than as direc
ted by this protocol. 
 Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance will be assessed based on drug accountability and review of the subject 
diary.  Subjects/parents/legal guardians will be instructed to return all empty study drug vials at 
Visi
t 2 and Visit 3.  The
 completed subject diary, which captures the date, time, person 
administering study drug, and dose of study drug, should be returned at each site visit.  All study 
drug
, used and unused, shall be returned at the end of the subject’s participation in the trial or at 
the visit following study drug stoppage. 
 Prior and Concomitant Therapies  
9.9.1 P rior Therapy 
Prior therapy is considered any therapy given within 4 weeks prior to the Screening Visit and 
will
 be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. 
9.9.1.1 Previous hGH Therapies 
At Visi
t 1, subjects ≥ 3 years old must be on current daily hGH (≥ 0.20 mg hGH/kg/week) for 
≥
 13 weeks and ≤ 130 weeks, while subjects ≥ 6 months to < 3 years old may be either 
trea
tment-naïve or be on current daily hGH (≥ 0.20 mg hGH/kg/week) for ≤ 130 weeks.   The 
current hGH  name, dose, injection device type, and start date will be recorded on the appropriate 
e
CRF page.  Subjects should remain on a stable dose between Screening and Visit 1. 
S
ubjects are to be instructed to take their regular dose of hGH the evening before Visit 1 
but NOT on the day of Visit 1.  
9.9.2 P ermitted and Prohibited Therapies 
Concomitant therapy is considered any medication other than the investigational product that is 
administered from the first dose of study drug administration up until the end of the trial.  Any 
c
hange in documented, permitted concomitant medication must be recorded in the eCRF, noting 
the type of medication, the dose, start date, stop date (if applicable), and indication.  If the 
administration of a prohibited concomitant medication becomes necessary, participation in the 
trial may be discontinued prematurely for that subject, based on a decision made jointly by  the 
investigator and Medical Monitor. 
9.9.2.1
 Permitted Therapies 
1. Replacement therapy for other non- GH pit uitary deficiencies.  As hGH may enhance the 
tra
nsformation of hydrocortisone to cortisone, the investigator may increase the dose of 
h
ydrocortisone replacement therapy if needed (eg, for anticipated stress).

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  10.2.3 Unscheduled Visits 
Unscheduled visits are those visits that occur between regularly scheduled visits and are 
performed to assess a
 previously noted AE, abnormal laboratory value(s), and/or clinical 
findings.  In such cases, the subject/parent/legal guardian will be contacted to arrange an 
unscheduled visit.  Only focused assessments (guided by the reason for the visit) will occur at 
these visits. 
10.2.4
 Early Termination Visits 
Early Termination Visits are performed for any early termination/withdrawal of a subject from 
this clinical trial.  Early Termination Visits are NOT to be performed for subjects who have 
terminated study d
rug but have continued to attend trial visits.  The structure and assessments of 
the Early Termina
tion Visit should be as similar as possible to the final visit (Visit 3).  
10.2.5 Follow-u
p and Extension Phase 
All subjects who successfully complete this trial on study drug and who have not completed 
puberty will be invited to participate in an extension trial, CT -301EXT.  If the subject meets the 
e
ligibility criteria for the extension trial, Visit 1 for the extension trial should be performed at the 
same time as Visit 3 for
 this trial, and data collected at Visit 3 will become the baseline data for 
the extension trial.  Th e purpose of the extension trial is to assess long-term safety and efficacy 
of TransCon hGH. 
F
or subjects who do not enter the extension trial and for whom Visit 3 is the final visit, there will 
be no follow-up visit except as required to follow SAEs that are determined to be related to the 
stud
y drug
 (See  Section 12.1.3 ). 
11. ASS ESSMENTS 
 Vital Sign Measurements  
Subject should rest for at least 5 minutes before assessment.  For younger subjects with whom 
this may not be possible
, attempts should be made to measure vital signs when subject is calm. 
The following vital signs should be measured: 
 Heart Rate 
 Blood Pressure  
 Respiratory Rate 
 Body Temperature

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  
 Weight Measurement  
Weight should be measured at each visit by the same auxologist at approximately the same time 
of da
y on the same calibrated weight scale (to minimize bias and reduce variability).  Subjects 
shoul
d be wearing light clothing and no shoes.  For subjects who cannot stand independently, a 
calibrated pediatric/infant weight scale should be used.  
 Height Measurement  
Height should be measured at each visit by the same auxologist at approximately the same time 
of day using the same wall-mounted stadiometer (to minimize bias and reduce variability), the 
a
ccuracy of which has been verified prior to each visit using a 100 cm metallic calibration rod.   
C
hildren < 2 years old should be measured in  a re cumbent position using a length board placed 
on a
 flat, stable surface such as a table.  Note: despite previous height measurements being 
pe
rformed on a length board, once a subject is 2 years old, the subsequent measurements should 
be performed on a stadiometer. 
For subjects ≥ 2 years old, obtain height measurements on a stadiometer following the general 
g
uidance below: 
 The subject should not stretch prior to height determination 
 The subject should be standing without shoes and socks.  Thin foot covers over bare feet may 
be worn 
 The subject should be wearing only light clothing so that the subject's pose can be observed 
 The  subject's gaze should be forward and horizontal position (Frankfort plane) 
 The subject’s heels should be placed together.  If the subject has genu valgum (knock-knee), 
the kne
es must be in contact with each other and the heels as close to each other as possible 
 The  subject’s heels, buttocks, shoulders, and occiput of the cranium should all be in contact 
with t
he stadiometer 
 Upw ard pressure should be applied to the subject’s mandibular rami (jaw) 
 The subject’s shoulders should be relaxed and pressure applied to the abdomen to reduce 
lordosis (spine curvature) 
 The counterweight head is lowered until it is in contact with the highest part of the subject's 
head 
 The height measurement is read at the horizontal level with the counter 
 The subject should step away from the stadiometer and repeat the previous steps 2 more 
times .  Repeated determinations must be within 0.5 cm of each other otherwise three new 
measurements must be performed and recorded.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  For subjects < 2 years old, obtain height measurement on a length board following the general 
guidance be
low ( WHO 2008 ) : 
 The  subject should be undressed (diaper/underwear is acceptable) 
 The parent/legal guardian/caregiver or another individual should place the subject supine on 
the length board with 
the subject’s head ag ainst the fixed headboard, compressing the hair 
 The  subject’s head should be positioned so that an imaginary vertical line from the ear canal 
to the lower border of
 the eye socket is perpendicular to the board.  The subject’s eyes should 
be looking straight up 
 The  auxologist should stand on the side of the length board, clearly able to see the measuring 
tape.  I
f possible, t
he subject’s parent/legal guardian/caregiver or another individual should 
stand behind the headboard and hold the subject’s hea d in position 
 The  subject should lie straight along the board, with shoulders touching the board and 
without arching
 the
 spine 
 The  subject should not change position during measurement 
 Gentle pressure should be applied to the subject’s knees to straighten the legs as far as 
possible 
 While the subject’s knees are being held with one hand, the footboard should be pulled with 
the other hand until flat against the subject’s feet, toes pointing upwards 
 Measurement of the subject’s length is read and r ecorded in centimeters to the last completed 
0.1 cm 
 Limited Physical Examination  
A limited physical examination should be performed to include injection site examination to 
assess for local toler
ability .  At Screening and Visit 1, injection site examinations to the daily 
hGH treatment areas should be explicitly documented so as to differentiate from any new 
reactions t
hat occur during the trial. 
 Fundoscopy  
A standard fundoscopy should be performed to rule out blurred disc margins.  Additional 
fundoscopies may be
 performed throughout the trial as needed at the investigator’s discretion. 
 Pregnancy Test  
Testing for hCG should be performed for female subjects of child-bearing potential .

 Patient -Reporte d Outcome Measures  
All Patient-Reported Outcomes used in this trial have been assessed for understanding by GHD 
patients and their parents/legal guardians/caregivers as intended by the Sponsor in a prior 
Cognitive Debriefing study per the Guidance for Industry – Patient-Reported Outcome 
Measu
res: Use in Medical Product Development to Support Labeling Claims  
(Guidance for Industry 2009 ). 
11.7.1 Pre
ference Questionnaire 
The
 Preference Questionnaire should only be completed for subjects who were treated with daily 
hGH
 prior to enrollment in the trial.  The parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the PQ-P, 
while the subject, i
f ≥ 9 years old at Visit 1, will complete the PQ- C. 
At W
ee
k 6, immediately prior to the 6 th dose of study drug, the PQ-P and PQ-C (as applicable) 
will
 be comple
ted within the Subject Diary.  At approximately Week 13, the PQ-P and PQ-C (as 
applicable) 
will be completed at Visit 2. 
11.7.2 Child Sheehan Disability Scale 
At Visit 1, the Child Sheehan Disability Scale (CSDS) should only be completed for subjects 
who w
ere treated with daily hGH prior to enrollment.  At all other time points, the CSDS should 
be completed fo
r all subjects. 
The CSDS is an adaptation of the Sheehan Disability Scale to assess impairment related to 
childhood anxiety
 on children and their parents ( Whiteside 2009).   This measure is being adapted 
in t
his trial to assess impairment related to treatment burden on children and their parents/legal 
guardians/caregivers.  The parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the CSDS-P, while the 
subject, if 
≥ 9 years old at Visit 1, will complete the CSDS- C. 
At W
eek 6, immedia
tely prior to the 6 th dose of study drug, the CSDS-P and the CSDS-C (as 
applicable) will be completed within the Subject Diary.  At approximately Week 13 and Week 
26, the CSDS-P
 and the CSDS-C (as applicable) will be completed at Visits 2 and 3. 
11.7.3 Convenience
 & Overall Satisfaction Domains of the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire f
or Medication 
At Visit 1, the Convenience and Overall Satisfaction (C&OS) of the Treatment Satisfaction 
Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) should only be completed for subjects who were treated 
with daily hGH prior to e
nrollment.  At all other time points, the C&OS should be completed for 
all subjects.

Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page 60 of 99 
Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  The original 14 -item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) 
Version 1.4 is a reliable and valid instrument to assess patients' satisfaction with medication, 
providing scores in four domains – Side Effects, Effectiveness, Convenience and Overall 
Satisfaction.  In naturalistic studies, administering the TSQM with the Side Effects domain could 
provoke the physician to assess the presence or absence of adverse events in a way that is 
clinically atypical, carrying the potential to interfere with routine medical care.  As a result, an 
abbreviated 9 -item TSQM (TSQM -9), derived from the TSQM Version 1.4 but without the Side 
Effects domain was created  (Bharmal 2009) .  This  measure is being adapted fur ther for this trial  
with the removal of the  Effectiveness domain since effectiveness of hGH is not subjective and 
will
 be assessed with objective measures in this and other trials evaluating TransCon hGH.  
Thus, only Convenience  & Overall Satisfaction domains (C&OS ) of the TSQM will be used.  
Only the parent/legal guardian/caregiver will complete the C&OS  of the TSQM -9, thus  it has 
been identified for this trial as the C&OS  – Parent  (C&OS -P). 
At Week 6, immediately prior to the 6th dose of study drug, the C&OS will be completed within 
the Subject Diary. At a
pproximately Week 13, the C&OS will be completed at Visit 2. 
 Subject Diary  
The subject diary will be provided to the subject/parent/legal guardian/caregiver at Visit 1 and 
should be completed weekly on the day of study drug administration.  The data captured within 
the subject diary
 includes: 
 Da te and time of administration 
 Dose  of study drug 
 Person preparing and giving injection 
 Location of injection on subject’s body 
 Assessment of subject pain using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (see 
Appendix 2)  
 Assessment of local tolerability  
 Changes to medications or subject’s health 
The
 subject diary should be reviewed by trial staff at every trial visit as part of concomitant 
medication review, adverse event reporting and study drug compliance.  
 Bone X -Ray 
To confirm open epiphyses (bone age ≤14.0 years for females or ≤16.0 years for males), a bone 
age x-ray must be performed for subjects at Tanner stage 4 only.  An x-ray performed within the 
past 52 we
eks with a bone age delay of ≥ 6 months is acceptable.  If not available, a bone age 
x
-ray must be
 performed at Screening and read locally.

 Local Tolerability Assessment  
Local tolerability is defined as an injection site reaction deemed abnormal from those ordinarily 
obse
rved in SC injections (including pain, intensity, or duration). 
11.11.1 Local Tolerability Documentation 
At Visit 1, assessment of local tolerability will be performed by trial staff using the Local 
Tole
rability
 Scale (see  Appendix 1) at the time of the first study drug injection and 15 minutes, 
1 hour and 2 hour post-dose.  At the same time, and as part of subject diary training, the 
subjects/pare
nts/legal guardians/caregivers will document their assessment of local tolerability in 
the subject diary, within which injection site pain will be rated by the Wong-Baker FACES Pain 
Rating Scale (see Appendix 2).  
Between visi
ts, local tolerability will be evaluated and documented by the subject/parent/legal 
guardian/caregiver in the subject diary. 
At Visit 2 and Visit 3, assessment of local tolerability will be performed by injection site 
examinati
on by trial staff (documented as part of the limited physical exam), in conjunction with 
subject diary review. 
11.11.2 Reporting Local Tolerability as an Adverse Event 
For the purpose of this trial, injection site reactions should not be documented as AEs unless the 
reaction: 
 I mpacts the subject’s ability to perform daily activities, or 
 Requires  medical therapy (not including prophylactic therapy) 
12. AD VERSE EVENTS, SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, AND REPORTING 
 Adverse Events  
12.1.1 Definition 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with the treatm
ent.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
abnormal labora
tory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to that product.  An AE can arise with 
any use (eg, in combination with another drug), route of administration, formulation, or dose, 
including an overdose.

 Injection site reactions/rashes (as well as rare, generalized hypersensitivity reactions) 
 S kin atrophy and lipoatrophy 
Note: Rotating the injection site (see  Section 9.3) is expected to decrease the risk of skin 
a
trophy or lipoatrophy. 
 He adaches 
 Glucose intolerance, including impaired glucose tolerance/impaired fasting glucose as well 
as overt diabetes mellitus 
 Intracranial hypertension with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or 
vomiting 
 F luid retention manifested by edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes 
(including carpal tunnel syndrome/paresthesias) 
 Hypothyroidism (central [secondary] hypothyroidism may first become clinically evident or 
worsen in patients with GHD durin
g hGH treatment) 
 S lipped capital femoral epiphysis (occurs more frequently in patients with endocrine 
disorders or in patients undergoing rapid growth) 
Note: Any subject with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain should be 
c
arefully evaluated for a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. 
 Progression of pre -existing scoliosis due to rapid growth (hGH has not been shown to 
increase
 the occurrence of scoliosis) 
Note: Any subjects with a history of scoliosis should be monitored for progression of 
scoliosis.

de
velops persistent severe abdominal pain. 
Clinically significant treatment-emergent physical examination or laboratory abnormalities and 
worsening pretreatment conditions should be recorded as AEs. 
The
 Medical Monitor will review all AEs, including SAEs, on an ongoing basis.  The key safety 
data w
ill also be reviewed periodically by an ISC in accordance with its governing charter.   
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording of all AEs, including SAEs,

Mild  – The subject is aware of the sign or symptom but tolerates it easily.  The event is of 
little concern to the subject and/or of little or no clinical significance.  The event is not 
e
xpected to have any effect on the subject’s health or well-being.  The event may or may no t 
require medical intervention. 
Moderate  – The event causes the subject enough discomfort for it to cause interference with 
or c
hange some of the subject’s usual activities.  The event is of some concern to the subject 
and poses some risk to the subject’s health or well-being.  The event may require medical 
int
ervention. 
Severe  – The subject is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in many or all usual 
a
ctivities.  The event is of definite concern to the subject and/or poses substantial risk to the 
subject’s health or well-being.  The event is likely to require medical intervention and/or 
close follow-up. 
Life-threatening  – The subject is at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. 
12.1.2.2
 Causality Rating 
The principal investigator will assess the causal relationship between the study drug and the 
e
vent using the following guideline:

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Definite  – This causality category applies to those AEs which the investigator feels are 
c
learly related to the study medication.  An AE may be categorized as definitely related to 
the stud
y drug when the event meets the first 4 (or more) of the following criteria: 
 The  event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration 
 The event cannot be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject’s 
c
linical status, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered 
 The  event disappears or decreases in severity upon cessation of the study drug  [There are 
im
portant exceptions when an AE may not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug yet 
drug
-relatedness clearly exists (eg, tardive dyskinesia)] 
 The  event follows a known response pattern to the study drug 
 The  event reappears upon re-challenge (if applicable)  
P
robable – This causality category applies to those AEs which the investigator feels a high 
de
gree of certainty are related to the study drug.  An AE may be categorized as probably 
re
lated to the study drug when the event meets the first 3 (or more) of the following criteria: 
 The  event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration 
 The  event cannot be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject’s 
c
linical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered 
 The  event disappears or decreases in severity upon cessation of the study drug  [There are

 The  event follows a known response pattern to the study drug 
 The  event reappears upon re-challenge (if applicable)  
P
ossible – This causality category applies to those AEs in which the investigator feels there 
is a r
easonable, although not probable, connection with the study drug.  An AE may be 
categorized as possibly related to the study drug when the event meets the first 2 (or more) of 
the f
ollowing criteria: 
 The  event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from study drug administration 
 The event is possibly explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other therapies administered to the subject 
 The  event follows a known response pattern to the study drug  
Unl

above. 
12.1.2.3 Outcome Assessment 
S
ubjects will be followed until AEs have either resolved, subjects have returned to their baseline 
status, or 
subjects are deemed stable or commensurate with ongoing disease processes.  One of 
6 AE outcomes listed below must be recorded: 
Re
solved  – The subject has fully recovered from the event and has returned to baseline status 
without
 residual observable effects. 
Resolved with sequelae  – The subject has recovered from the event with some residual 
obse
rvable effects. 
Ongoing  – The subject has not recovered from the event and observable effects remain, 
re
gardless of whether the event is changing or stable and persistent. 
De
ath Due to This Event – The subject died because of the event. 
De
ath Due to Other Event – The subject had not recovered from the event at the time of 
death
. 
Lost to Follow- up – The subject had not recovered from the event at the time of last contact.  
12.1.3 Reporting Procedures for All Adverse Events 
At e
ach visit, a ll AEs will be documented in response to a general question about the subject’s 
we
ll-being and whether any possible changes in well-being have occurred since the previous 
visi
t.  Additionall
y, at each visit, site staff will review subject diary data with the subject and 
parent/legal guardian/caregiver, to determine if diary entries reflect any AEs.  There will be no 
dire
ct questioning to solicit possible AEs.

Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page 68 of 99 
Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  AEs, including SAEs, will be documented through the end of the trial (ie, Visit 3 ).  All AEs 
ong
oing at Visit 3 or Early Termination Visit must be followed until the event is resolved or 
deemed sta
ble by the investigator.  All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  AEs 
either obse
rved by the investigator or reported by the subject must be recorded regardless of 
causality
. 
The following attributes must be documented for each AE: 
 S ubject ID 
 Description 
 Onset date (if AE was present on Day 1, include whether onset was prior to or after first 
dose of study d
rug
) 
 R esolution date, if applicab le 
 Severity 
 Causality ( relationship to study drug) 
 Outcome 
 Action taken  
 Determination of “serious” (or not) 
Any medical conditions, signs, symptoms, or illnesses active during the Screening Period (ie, up 
to approximately 4 weeks prior to first study drug administration) will be captured as medical 
history unless the c
hange is trial procedure-related, in which case it will be reported as a non-
treatment-
emergent AE.  Any  changes to the conditions documented as medical history during 
the tr
ial and that meet the above AE definition should be recorded as AEs so that a complete 
safety profile of the study drug is obtained.  See  Section 12.2.2 for additional reporting 
procedure
s for serious AEs. 
Any chan
ge from baseline health status that meets the above AE definition and occurs from the 
time of the first admi
nistration of study drug until end of Visit 3 or the Early Termination Visit 
will be recorde
d as an AE. 
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs if they: 
 I nduce a diagnosis, clinical sign(s ), or symptom(s), or 
 Are considered clinically significant by the investigator, or 
 Require therapy. 
TransCon hGH CT- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page 69 of 99 
Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Whenever possible, an AE should be recorded as a specific diagnosis or syndrome rather than as 
a sign, symptom, or abnormal laboratory value.  If there is not a diagnosis, the event term should 
be the clinical sign or symptom.  Only if a diagnosis, clinical sign, or symptom is not present 
shoul
d an AE be recorded as the abnormal value itself. 
C
are should also be taken to record the most medically appropriate term (eg, hypertension for 
e
levated blood pressure that persists and requires chronic treatment and follow-up, or increased 
blood pressure for elevated blood pressure that occurs for a limited time and does not persist or 
require ongoing treatment). 
AEs will be documented at the maximum intensity experienced.  If a previously recorded AE or 
c
ondition recorded as part of medical history increases in severity or frequency, it will be 
recorded as a new AE. 
All AEs will be considered ongoing until they have completely resolved or, in the case of a 
c
ondition recorded as part of medical history, returned to baseline status prior to study drug 
a
dministration.  At the end of Visit 3 or the Early Termination Visit, all AEs should have a 
s
tatement regarding resolution. 
Any SAE that is determined to be related to the study drug will be followed until resolution or 
stabili
zation. 
Any undesirable medical occurrence resulting from an accidental overdose is an AE and should 
be recorded and reported on the appropriate eCRF page.  Regardless of classification as an AE or 
not, all  overdoses should be documented and the subject(s) monitored.  Since accidental 
overdoses with the study drug could have serious clinical consequences and/or represent a 
compliance issue, they should be reported to the Medical Monitor immediately and evaluated by 
the Sponsor. 
 Serious Adverse Events and Suspected Unexp ected Serious Adverse Reactions  
12.2.1 Definitions 
12.2.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Definition 
In addition to severity and causality ratings, each AE is to be classified by the investigator as 
“serious” or “not serious.” 
A
n SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that : 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening  
TransCon hGH CT- 302 
Clinical Study Protocol  TransCon hGH (ACP- 011) 
Ascendis Pharma Endocrinology Division A/S  Page 70 of 99 
Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  Note:   The term “life-threatening” here refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
de
ath at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more seve re. 
 R equires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure, for a routinely scheduled treatment,  or 
scheduled in advance of trial participation are not considered SAEs  
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Note:  This applies if a subject exposed to an investigational product gives birth to a child 
with a c
ongenital anomaly or birth defect 
Additionally, medical events that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above should be considered serious. 
Eve
nts not  considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations for: 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the study drug or indication under study not associated 
with 
any d
eterioration in condition 
 Tr eatment that was elective or planned prior to enrollment for a pre-existing condition 
unrelated to the study drug or indication under study that has not worsen ed 
 Admis sion to a hospital for general care not associated with any deterioration in condition 
 Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions 
of serious given above and not resulting in hospital admission 
12.2.1.2 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction Definition 
A SUS
AR is any AE for which there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the AE, and which is assessed as both unexpected and serious.  A suspected adverse 
re
action is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or Reference 
S
afety Information as associated with TransCon hGH, or if it is not listed at the specificity or 
se
verity that has been observed.  The final determination of expectedness will be assessed by the 
S
ponso r. 
12.2.1.3 Non-Serious Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation 
If situation permits, non-serious events (including laboratory abnormalities and pregnancies) that 
ma
y require permanent discontinuation of study drug should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor prior to making any final decision.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  12.2.2 Reporting 
All initial and follow-up information regarding SAEs or SUSARs must be reported by the 
investigator to the Sponsor or its representatives within 24 hours of discovery , including 
those related to protocol-mandated procedures and regardless of suspected causality.  Reporting 
must not be delayed by waiting for additional information.  The minimum information required 
for reporting an SAE are the AE term (diagnosis) and the investigator’s initial causality 
assessment.  Additional information can be reported to the Sponsor or its representatives as a 
follow-up re
port.   
The Sponsor (or its representatives) is  responsible for reporting within the time frame required 
b
y applicable regulations all SUSARs to :   
 I nvestigators 
 C entral IRBs/HRECs/IECs 
 National ethics committees (if applicable) 
 Appropriate regulatory authorities .   
It is the investigators’ responsibility to comply with the requirements of the ir local 
I
RB/HREC/IEC for reporting SUSARs, other SAEs, and any new and/or relevant safety 
infor
mation provided by the Sponsor or its representatives.  At minimum, SUSARs must be 
broug

 Sample Size Determination  
A sample size of 150 provides at least 95% probability to observe AEs with a 2%  or more 
incidence rate for a 26-week follow up.  It also enables the combined safety database of the 
clinical program (a sample size of approximately 300) to  have at least 95% probability to 
obse
rve AEs with an incidence rate of 1% or more.  
As recruiting subjects < 3 years old will prove challenging, an exact sample size for this cohort 
has not been pre-determined. 
 Analysis Populations  
The analysis population includes all patients who receive at least one dose of study drug. 
 Statistical Analyses  
Details of applicable statistical methods will be provided in a statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
B
aseline and demographic data will be summarized to characterize the study population. 
Subgroups of interest, such as prior exposure to h GH and age categories, will be determined and 
c
orresponding subgroup analyses for safety and efficacy will be performed as appropriate.  Prior 
and conc
omitant medication, as well as exposure of study drug, will be summarized. 
Data from clinical assessments will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Numerical 
va
riables will be summarized by mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum 
while c
ategorical variables will be summarized by counts and proportions. 
15. T RIAL CONDUCT 
 Site Initiation  
Prior to participation, investigational sites and investigators will be evaluated for appropriate 
qualifications and ability to execute the trial.  Each investigational site must undergo appropriate 
tra
ining on the trial protocol and ancillary trial procedures and documents through participation 
in 
a Site Initiation Visit (SIV) or Investigator Meeting (IM).  Protocol and GCP training must 
take
 place before any subjects are enrolled at a site.  SIVs and IMs will include,  but may not be 
limited to, study drug preparation and administration procedures, data collection requirements, 
a
nd subject eligibility requirements. 
 Screen Failures  
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria at any point prior to administration of first study 
drug dose are defined as Screening Failures.  The reason(s ) for  each Screening Failure will be 
recorded in the eCRF.

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  The decision to rescreen will be made on a case by case basis together with the Medical Monitor, 
including
 which screening procedures may not need repeating. 
 Maintenance of Screening & Enrollment Logs  
Procedures for maintenance of Screening and Enrollment Logs are discussed in the trial manual. 
 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
15.4.1 Collection of Data 
Data will be collected in the eCRF.  The eCRF is an integral part of the trial and subsequent 
reports.  It must be used to capture all trial-specific data collected and must be kept current to 
reflect subject status during the course of the trial.  Only a Subject Identification Number will be 
use
d to identify the subject.  The investigator must keep a separate Subject Identification Code 
List with subject names and medical record numbers (or other personal identifiers). 
The trial will use an Internet-based remote data entry system to collect clinical trial data at the 
investigational sites.  The system complies with 21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP.  The system 
will
 be used to enter, modify, maintain, archive, retrieve, and transmit data.  The system is 
c
onfigured based on the requirements from the Sponsor.  Source documents are to be retained to 
e
nable a reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source documents include the hospital files 
and trial worksheets provided by the Sponsor.  Data will be recorded in the trial worksheets as 
a
ppropriate to complete and/or clarify the source data. 
The design of the computerized system complies with all the applicable regulatory requirements 
for record keeping and record retention in clinical trials (21 CFR Part 11 and ICH E6 GCP) to 
the same degree of confidence as is provided with paper systems.  Clinical investigators must 
re
tain either the original or a certified copy of all source documents sent to the Sponsor or its 
representatives, including query resolution correspondence.  The system is designed so that 
chang
es to any record do not obscure the original information.  The audit record clearly indicates 
that a change was made and clearly provides a means to locate and read the prior information.  
All changes to the data have an electronic audit trail, in accordance with 21 CFR 11.10(e).  
Electronic signatures will be used in conformance with 21 CFR Part 11. 
15.4.2 Coding Dictionaries 
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. 
Coexistent diseases and AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). 
A complete description of data to be collected is provided in the trial manu al.

15.5.1 Monitoring Procedures 
The
 Sponsor and/or its representative may make periodic visits to the investigational site to 
assess compliance with trial procedures and regulatory requirements; to ensure that the safety, 
welfare, and privacy of subjects are being protected; and to verify the accuracy and integrity of 
the trial data.  In addition, independent Quality Assurance site audits may be conducted as 
ve
rification of the quality and compliance of trial conduct. 
The Sponsor and/or its representative will periodically review the trial data to ensure that data 
are being appropriately collected and reported.  Queries and corrections will be made as needed. 
15.5.2 Data Management 
S
ponsor or designee will be responsible for activities associated with the data management of 
this trial.  The standard procedures for handling and processing records will be followed per GCP 
a
nd Contract Research Organization ( CRO )’s standard operating procedures (SOPs).  A 
c
omprehensive data management plan (DMP) will be developed including a data management 
overview, description of database contents, annotated e CRF s, user acceptance testing procedures, 
que
ry contacts, and consistency checks. 
Trial site personnel will be responsible for providing resolutions to all data queries.  The 
investi
gator will be required to document electronic data review to ensure the accuracy of the 
corrected a
nd/or clarified data.  Procedures for soliciting and documenting resolution to data 
queries are described in the trial manual. 
 Auditing  Proced ures 
In addition to the routine monitoring procedures, a GCP Quality Assurance audit may be 
ini
tiated by the Sponsor.  The investigator has to ensure that subjects/parents/legal guardians are 
aware of and consent to personal information being reviewed during the data verification process 
a
s a part of monitoring/auditing/inspection by the Sponsor, properly authorized agents of the 
S
ponsor, or competent authorities.  In addition, participation and personal information is treated 
a
s strictly confidential to the extent that applicable law permits and to which it is not publicly 
availa
ble.  The purpose of audits and inspections is to evaluate compliance with the principles of 
GCP, international and local regulatory requirements, and the trial protocol.  The audit or 
inspec
tion may include, for example, a review of all source documents, drug records, original 
clinic medical notes, and some or all of the facilities used in the trial. 
The audits may be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s selected agent in accordance with 
Sponsor’s SOP or SOPs of the selected and properly authorized agent.  A competent authority 
may also wish to conduct an inspection during the trial or after its completion.  If an inspection is 
re
quested by a competent authority, the investigator must inform the Sponsor immediately that

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  this request has been made.  The investigator and his/her institution will permit all monitoring, 
audits, and regulatory inspections, providing direct access to source data. 
 Laboratory Quality Standards  
Laboratory tests or evaluations described in this protocol will be conducted in accordance with 
quality laboratory standards as described in the SOPs of the central laboratories.  Some blood 
samples may be used for laboratory test validation.  
The
 laboratories will provide a list of reference ranges for applicable analyses before trial start.  
These will be held in the investigator site file and the trial master file.  The methods employed 
for each assay should be available on request.  Any change in the laboratory procedures, 
re
ference values, etc., during the trial must promptly be communicated to the Sponsor.  The 
labor
atories may also be audited by the Sponsor or by competent authorities. 
 Trial Termination or Completion  
The investigator should notify the IRB/HREC/IEC in writing of the completion or early 
ter
mination of the trial.  Upon trial completion or termination, applicable regulatory reporting 
re
quirements will be foll
owed.  The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the trial at any time 
for
 any reason. 
 Changes to the Protocol  
Changes in any portion of this protocol must be documented in the form of an amendment from 
the Sponsor and must be approved by the investigational site’s IRB/HREC/IEC and regulatory 
authorities, as required, before the amendment is implemented.  However, in the event of 
apparent imm
ediate hazard to a subject, a deviation from the protocol is allowed to eliminate the 
hazard.  In this case, the deviation and the reason for it must be submitted for approval as 
required by regional regulations to the applicable IRB/HREC/IEC and regulatory authorities, 
a
long with a proposed protocol amendment if appropriate. 
Protocol amendments may only be made with prior written approval of the Sponsor and/or its 
representative and documented approval or favorable opinion from applicable regulatory 
authorities or regional IRB/HREC/IEC, as required.  The investigator must send a copy of the 
documente
d approval to the Sponsor and/or its representative. 
 Other Changes in Trial Conduct  
Changes in trial conduct are not permitted.  Any unforeseen changes in trial conduct will be 
re
corded in the clinical study report.

progress of the trial and assess accumulating safety data.  After each meeting, it will advise the 
S
ponsor on the continuing safety of current trial subjects and on the continuing validity and 
scientific merit of the trial.  All decisions about the conduct of the trial will rest solely with the 
Sponsor.  The ISC will consist of at least 1 pediatric endocrinologist and 1 physician of another 
re
levant medical discipline, all with experience in clinical studies, who will operate based on the 
ISC Charter agreed to by all ISC members.  The Charter will define data content and review 
frequency. 
The Sponsor may attend the ISC meetings. 
The
 ISC is empowered to recommend the following courses of action with respect to continuing 
the trial: 
1) The trial should continue without modification 
2) The trial should continue but with modification to the protocol or with additional data 
pre
sentation needs 
3) Trial enrollment and treatment administration should be temporarily suspended pending 
further data evaluation 
4) The
 trial should be terminated because of safety concern

Confidential Information  CSP 29 August 2017  1 Subjects <3 years old at Visit 1 will perform the C max Visit.  Subjects ≥3 years old at Visit 1 will NOT perform the C max Visit.  
2 An Early Termination Visit should be performed for all subjects exiting the trial and should include al l procedures listed for Visit 3. Stopping study drug does NOT require 
termination from the trial and therefore does NOT require an Early Termination Visit.  
3 Vital sign measurements include heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body temperature , which should be performed after the subject has rested for at least 5 
minutes.  
4 Height should be measured at each visit at approximately the same time of day, preferably by the same auxologist.  
5 Locally read b one age x -ray only required at Screening if subject is at Tanner stage 4 and an x-ray performed within the past 52 weeks with  a bone age delay of  ≥ 6 months is 
not available.  
6 Fundoscopy may also be performed at any time, if clinically indicated.  
7 Blood samples collected at Screening will be tested for the following: IGF -1 and IGFBP -3, antibodies against hGH and PEG, hormone/glycemic status (TSH, FT4, FT3, 
morning cortisol, and HbA1c), chemistry, hematology, and lipid panel.   The analyses of antibodies against hGH and PEG may only be conducted  after enrollment and are not 
required for eligibility verification.  Data will be used to support evaluation of post-dose antibody detection. Female subjects of child -bearing potential will also have blood 
samples tested for hCG.  
8 Blood samples collected  at the C max Visit will be tested for the following: hGH, IGF -1 and IGFBP -3, and hormone/glycemic status (TSH, FT4, FT3, morning cortisol, and 
HbA1c).

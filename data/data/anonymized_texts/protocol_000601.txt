 PROTOCOL  SYNOPSIS  
TITLE  Testing the Effectiveness of a Fall Prevention System  
  SPONSOR  Tammy Moore , RN PhD   
  FUNDING 
ORGANIZATION  Palarum, LLC  
NUMBER OF SITES  1 Site on 3 floors of the Ohio State  University Wexner Center  Brain 
and Spine Hospital ; ( 8 South, 9 South, 10 South, 8 East, 9 East & 10 
East  
  RATIONALE  Each year, between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people in the United States 
fall in a healthcare environment  (Agency for Healthcare Research and 
Quality, 2015) .  Falls can have a widespread and significant impact on 
health, can be deadly, and often result in high costs.  Falls with serious 
injury are consistently among the Top 10 sentinel events reported to 
The Join t Commission’s Sentinel Event database  (The Joint 
Commission, 2015) .  The average 200-bed hospital might log 300 
patient falls a year (based on 5 patient falls per 1000 patient days), 
which results in $10,200 per fall in medical costs annually – or more 
than $3 million.  (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality)  
The best way to reduc e the number of falls is to prevent them. A 
whole marketplace of bed and chair alerts and other devices has been 
developed to address the need, yet the numbers increase . On a busy 
patient floor, nurses lose valuable seconds just figuring out which 
patient’ s bed alert is sounding. We expect research to show that the 
Palarum PUP™ System reduces the incidence of falls .  
 
 
  STUDY DESIGN   Single arm trial  
  PRIMARY 
OBJECTIVE  To determine if the fall rate (as measured by falls per 1000 patient 
days) for patients designated “fall risk” decreases with the use of the 
intervention ( Patient is UP fall prevention technology  [PUP™ ]) 
when compared to historical NDNQI data for the prior 12 months 
(“Benchmark Data”) from nursing units where the intervention is 
being undertaken.

 SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVES  1. To reduce the incidence of false alerts, <5%.  Our goal is a high 
reliability notification system.   
2. To provide positive alert reliability of 95%.  Our goal is to reduce 
alert fatigue with nurses.  To determine number of alerts sent out; 
what is the frequency of these patient safety events (i.e.), fall risk 
patient up, out of bed, unassisted  
3. To gather compliance data and response times from alert to 
caregiver response.   
 
  NUMBER OF 
SUBJECTS  2500 patients  
  SUBJECT 
SELECTION  
CRITERIA  Inclusion Criteria : All risk fall patients , eighteen years of age or  older,  
who are admitted  to the OSU Brain and Spine Hospital  on Floors 8  
South , 9 South , 10 South, 8 East, 9 East or 10 East .     Patients will 
undergo a pre -assessment as per OSUWMC procedure to determine if 
they are of fall risk.   
 
Exclusion Criteria :  Patients whose medical condition  as assessed by 
the PI  prohibits their participation in the program, which would 
include among others  the following:  patients who lack the capacity to 
consent  that do not have an Legally Authorized Representative 
(LAR) , patients with an anatomy or wound issue on their feet or 
around their calves that would bar them from wearing socks on either 
foot, and /or patients for whom the sock would impede medical 
treatment.  
 
  TEST PRODUCT, 
DOSE, AND METHOD 
OF USE  Test Product:   Palarum LLC’s, PUP™  (Patient is Up) System  
Dose:   N/A  
Method of Use : 
The Study site, the OSU Wexner Center Brain and Spine Hospital , is 
located on three contiguous floors with each floor being made up of 
two units or Pods designated East and South. Following 
commencement of the study, and throughout its durat ion, Pods 
assigned to the Study  will only utilize the Palarum Fall Prevention 
System and a monitored PUP™ sock as the standard of care 
intervention for fall prevention in accordance with its operating 
instructions and procedures.   The Implementation Team f or the Study 
will consist of the PI, the Nurse Managers and Staff, allied health 
professionals as may be assigned to the Pods during the course of the 
Study.  
The Palarum Fall Prevention System  is made up  of seven tangible 
elements connected by Wi -Fi and/or  BTLE:  an inpatient room

 Android tablet (IRT), a nurse station Android monitor (HUC), a local 
server (PLS), a cloud server (PCS), a Bluetooth Low Energy 
beacon(s), an Android smart notification device , and an e -textile sock 
connected sensor transmitter ( PUP™ sock).   
 
The PUP™  sock monitors and transmits pressure, force, acceleration 
and motion data to IRT and PLS, and HUC and PCS.  This data is 
evaluated and validated by an Android application on the IRT to 
determine whether or not a fall risk patient is standing unaccompanied 
by a caregiver. If a monitored patient is standing unattended, the PLS 
locates and alerts the Smart  Notification Device s of the five (5) 
closest healthcare providers and the HUC using the beacon 
technology.   
 
Alerts are terminated by the Smart  Notification Device  and PLS based 
on caregiver proximity to the patient. All data, alerts, suspensions, 
terminations and notifications are recorded by the PCS.  On a daily 
basis, PCS reports  are produced which contain data  for each patient 
enrolled, number of alerts, excessive alerts, and caregiver response 
time, as well as summaries by Pod and entire facility.  
 
All Brain and Spine Hospital  patients will be evaluated as to fall risk 
using the current fall risk assessment procedures  employed by  OSU 
Medical Center and administered in the usual and customary fashion  
upon evaluation on the floor and Pod.  
Any patient fall is to be reported and evaluated following current 
processes and procedures  developed by the OSU Brain and Spine 
Institute as main tained with IHIS.  
 
If a fall risk patient is admitted to  the unit and is not otherwise 
disqualified by the Study Exclusion Criteria, the patient  and/or LAR  
in form of a Patient Consent document, will be given information 
about and the opportunity for the patient to participate in the Study. If 
the patient or legal surrogate declines participation, the patient will 
receive standard of care  provided prior to the Study.  
Upon receiving a consent to participate, the  patient will be fitted with 
a monitored PUP™  sock sized to the patient’s foot from the Study 
inventory, and thereafter enrolled by a caregiver in the Palarum Fall 
Prevention System using an Android application on the IRT.   The 
Palarum  Fall Prevention System and PUP™  sock thereafter monitor 
the patient’s activity 24x7 throughout the patient’s entire length of 
stay.  During the patient’s stay, the PUP™  sock will be evaluated 
daily for proper fit, patient comfort, and patient safety.  Upo n 
discharge or transfer, the patient is un -enrolled from the system again

 utilizing the IRT.  All patient relevant fall  data, including system 
performance, is collected and stored in the PCS for future study and 
evaluation.   Any patient fall is to be repor ted and evaluated following 
current OSU Medical Center processes and procedures independent of 
the Palarum Fall Prevention System.  
Technical support for the Palarum Fall Prevention system is available

  STATISTICS  
Primary Analysis Plan  The primary endpoint for this study is the number of patient falls.  
This will be expressed as a  falls incidence  rate, i.e., number of falls  
per patient days where patient days are counted from the initiation of 
the PUP™ System until discharge or removal from the fall risk 
protocol.  Using a one -sided one -sample test for Poisson means, we 
will test whether the observed fall rate is less than t he historical rate of 
0.004.  This test will be conducted at the alpha=0.1 level.  Results will 
be presented as the fall rate and the corresponding one -sided 90% 
confidence interval which will provide an upper bound for the fall 
rate.

 Rationale for Number  
of Subjects  The primary endpoint of the trial is the patient fall rate per patient 
days.  Comparing to a historical rate of 0.004 using a one -sided test of 
Poisson means, we have at least 70% power to detect a 25% reduction 
in the fall rate at alpha level  0.1 with 2360.  Assuming a dropout rate 
of 5%, we will enroll 2500 patients into the study.

 1 BACKGROUND  
The PUP™ System is designed to monitor patient activity in a hospital, clinic, nursing 
home, or other  facility where a patient may be receiving care.  
The System includes pressure sensors incorporated into the toe  and heel of  a sock using 
both pressure sensitive fibers and also a Bluetooth transmitter affixed to the exterior of the 
sock in the ankle region.  After the caregiver assists the patient in putting on the PUP™ 
socks, the caregiver will enter the appropriate patient data into the dedica ted in -room 
PUP™ tablet to associate the patient with the specific sensor.  When the patient gets out 
of bed and steps on the floor, pressure is detected by the sock sensors which trigger an 
alert signal to the PUP™ tablet.  This alert is displayed locally  in the patient’s room on the 
PUP™ tablet and can be dismissed by a caregiver present in the room with the patient, as 
appropriate.  The in -room PUP™ tablet also relays the alert signal to a local Palarum 
server which sends the alert signal to both a monit oring device located at the nursing 
station as well as to notification devices being worn by select caregivers.  The sock also 
includes a sensor for motion detection for power -saving purposes.  If the patient is idle for 
a specified amount of time, the dev ice enters a power -saving mode. Once motion is 
detect ed, the system ‘wakes’ in order to be able to detect whether pressure is applied to 
the sock indicating that the patient is standing or attempt ing to get out of bed.  
The system can support monitoring of sensors for multiple patients, allowing display of 
sensor status for multiple patients on the tablet app.  
 
1.1 Overview of Research  
Each year between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people in the United States fall in a healthcare 
environment  (Agency for Healthcare Res earch and Quality, 2015) .  Falls can have a 
widespread and significant impact on health, can be deadly, and often result in high costs.  
Falls with serious injury are consistently among the Top 10 sentinel events reported to 
The Join t Commission’s Sentinel  Event database  (The Joint Commission, 2015) .  The 
average 200 -bed hospital might log 300 patient falls a year (based on 5 patient falls per 
1000 patient days), which results in $10,200 per fall in medical costs annually – or more 
than $3 million.  
Falls ar e one metric that Medicare now uses to measure hospitals on patient safety.  Not 
meeting the fall metric will trigger a reduction in the hospital’s cost reimbursements.  
While one in three hospitalized Americans, aged 65 and over falls every year, elderly 
patients are not the only ones vulnerable to falling in health care facilities.  Any patient of 
any age or physical ability can be at risk for a fall due to medical condition, medications, 
surgical  procedures or diagnostic testing.    Falls increase the len gth of inpatient stays by 
6.3 days and hospital charges by $14,000.  (The Joint Commission, 2015).  
Most facilities have tried to address falls with traditional motion detection systems, room 
sitters, and enhanced training, but falls continue to be a quality  of care and cost issue.  
Traditional motion detectors can result in a false alert, which can lead to nurses or other

 hospital workers tuning out alerts or turning them off.   One hospital executive said they 
spent $4.2 million on patient sitters last year  
 
2 STUDY RATIONALE  
Palarum LLC (“Palarum”) has designed and developed a wireless and “smart” fall 
prevention system and desires to have the effectiveness of the system evaluated by The 
Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (“OSU”) through a disciplined and 
structured product evaluation process.  
Each year between 700,000 and 1,000,000 people in the United States fall in a healthcare 
environment  (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2015) .  Falls can have a 
widespread and significant imp act on health, can be deadly, and often result in high costs.  
Falls with serious injury are consistently among the Top 10 sentinel events reported to 
The Join t Commission’s Sentinel Event database  (The Joint Commission, 2015) .  The 
average 200 -bed hospita l might log 300 patient falls a year (based on 5 patient falls per 
1000 patient days), which results in $10,200 per fall in medical costs annually – or more 
than $3 million.  (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality).  
Falls are one metric that Medicare now uses to measure hospitals on patient safety.  Not 
meeting the fall metric will trigger a reduction in the hospital’s cost reimbursements.  
While one in three hospitalized Americans aged 65 and over falls every year, elderly 
patients are not the only one s vulnerable to falling in health care facilities.  Any patient of 
any age or physical ability can be at risk for a fall due to medical condition, medications, 
surgical procedures or diagnostic testing.    Falls increase the length of inpatient stays by 
6.3 days and hospital charges by $14,000.  (The Joint Commission, 2015) .  
 Falls represent both a patient safety priority and an economic priority for healthcare 
organizations.  A fall may result in fractures, lacerations, or internal bleeding, leading to 
increased health care utilization.  As of 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid 
Services (CMS) does not reimburse hospitals for the extra care associated with an 
inpatient fall and the trauma associated with it.  (The Joint Commission, 2015) .  
 
The best wa y to reduce the number of falls is to prevent them. A whole marketplace of 
bed and chair alerts and other devices has been developed to address the need, yet the 
numbers creep up. On a busy patient floor, nurses lose valuable seconds just figuring out 
whic h patient’s bed alert is sounding. We expect research to show that the Palarum PUP™ 
System takes back that critical time.   
 
2.1 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
 
Risks of Product  
 Over -reliance on automation of technology decreasing hourly rounding presence  
 System fails to notify staff of stand alert  
 Possible skin impression from prolonged use of sock  
 
Tammy Moore, PI, Sponsor  Confidential  
 
Version #:  4 – 2018H0303  Version Date: 07/29/2019  Page 15 of 34 
 Mitigation of Each Risk  
 Education  
 Patient Assessments  
 Replacement of Socks  
 Socks come with multiple locations with sock sensor placement  
 
Benefits  
 Improved patient sa fety by reducing the number o f patient falls.  A 25 % reduction in  
patient falls will result in 90  less falls per year in a 200-bed hospital.  
 Improved patient outcomes  
 Staff is notified immediately when a patient safety event occurs (fall risk patient is up  
and unattended)  
 Reduced alert fatigue.  Improved accuracy of the stand detection with innovative 
pressure sensitive smart textiles.  New notification system which alerts only the closest  
five caregivers, with an escalation protocol, when a fall risk patient is up and 
automatically terminates the alert when a caregiver enters the room.   
 Data & Analytics.  The PUP™ Fall Prevention System delivers critical new data to 
enhance patient care and imp rove hospital operations.  
 Cost Savings. The Palarum LLC, alert system could save one 200 bed hospital 
approximately $744,600 dollars each year.  Average 200 bed hospital is expected to 
have 5 patient falls per 1000 patient days.  Therefore, an average 200 bed hospital will 
have 365 falls per year (20% reduction in patient falls (73)/year x $10,200/ fall).   
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES

 4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Study Overview  
 Problem - Falls occur at a rate of 5.5 per 1000 patient days in US hospitals. In 
addition to the human morbidity and mortality costs, falls cost hospitals in excess of 
$8 billion in unreimbursed charges. No intervention to date has been shown to 
significantly reduc e that rate.  
 Purpose - To determine the effectiveness, if any, of the PUP™ Fall Prevention 
System.  The hypothesis is that the System will reduce the fall rate by at least 2 5% of 
prior years’ average fall rate.  
 Population to be studied  -  All fall risk patients , eighteen years old or older,  admitted 
to OSU Brain and Spine Hospital on Floors 8, 9, and 10  until the sample size is 
reached.   
 Research Design – Single arm trial  
 Extent of Researcher Interference - Minimal, only studying events as they normally 
occur.   The PUP™ System will have been previously evaluated and approved for use 
as the standard of care at the OSU Medical Center Brain and Spine Hospital in 
accordance with the terms of an agreement between Palarum and OSU Medical Center 
dated March 28, 2018.  
 Time horizon  - Current.  
 Study setting  - Non-contrived. OSU Medical Center Brain and Spine Hospital.  
 Measurement and measures  
o Patient fall rate (measured as number of falls/1000 patient days) data collection 
and reporting forms, criteria and protocols  for the three calendar years 
preceding initiation of the research.  
o Patient fall rate data collection and reporting forms, criteria , and protocols for 
the research period calendar year.  
o Data collection standards and protocol for/of ; 
 Positive stand detection alert  
 Negative stand detection alert  
 Participant inclusion, exclusion or exemption  
 Sampling methods of 1 -3 above  
 Report form(s), structure and content  
 Participant or data exclusion standards, if any.  
 Data Collection Method  - Unobtrusive automated  physical measurement u sing the 
PUP™ sock, sensors, wireless technology , and R EDCap.

Devices. 
 
 How to respond to Alert s 
o There are two ways to respond to an alert in the Palarum Fall Prevention 
System  
 Nurse proceeds into the room (wearing Palarum Smart Notification 
Device ) and the system automatically turn s off do to his/her proximity.  
 Nurse proceed s into the room and manually turn s off the system on the 
IRT by touch ing the red alert Icon on the screen and proceeding to put 
in their initials.

 5 CRITERIA FOR EVALUAT ION  
5.1 Primary Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the f all rate  per patient days  within the study population .  A fall is 
defined a s “an unplanned descent to the floor with or without injury to the patient. Include 
falls when a patient lands on a surface where you wouldn't expect to find a patient. All 
unassisted and a ssisted falls are to be included whether they result from physiological 
reasons (fainting) or environmental reasons (slippery floor). Also report patients that roll 
off a low bed onto a mat as a fall .” 
 
5.2 Secondary Effectiveness Endpoints  
 The rate of false alerts per patient days delivered by the PUP™ System.  We 
define as false alert as an alert generated by other than a physical stand by the 
PUP™ System.  
 The number of patient safety events.  Fall related  patient safety events include 
patient standing, walki ng, and otherwise moving without a caregiver present.  
 We will assess the average  time to respond to an alert delivered by the PUP™ 
System. This will be the time from the initiation of an alert until it is silenced 
automatically by RSSI proximity of a  careg iver or manually by the caregiver.  
5.3 Safety Evaluations  
Falls are inherent in healthcare settings  and can not be entirely eliminated.  As such 
they are not an adverse event arising from or related to the use of the Palarum PUP™  
System.  
6 SUBJECT SELECTION  
6.1 Study  Population  
 All fall risk patients , eighteen years old or older,  admitted to the OSU Medical Center 
Brain and Spine Institute on Floors 8, 9 and 10 . “Fall risk” will be defined by

 11 DISCONTINUATION AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJE CTS  
11.1 Early Discontinuation of Study   
A subject may be discontinued from study treatment at any time if the subject, the LAR, 
the investigator, or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.  
The following is a list of possible reasons for study treatment discontinuation .  
 Subject or LAR withdrawal of consent  
 Subject is not compliant with study proc edures  including but not limited to 
intermittent wearing of the sock, refusal after enrollment to wear the socks, or 
repeatedly engaging in activity which defeats the integrity of the electronic 
circuitry of the sock.  
 Adverse event that in the opinion of t he investigator would be in the best interest 
of the subject to discontinue study treatment  
 Protocol violation requiring discontinuation of study treatment  
 Sponsor request for early termination of study  
 All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
 Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for 
subject withdrawals.  The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will 
be specified in the  subject’s source documents. Refer to Section 10 for early 
termination procedures.  
11.2 Withdrawal of Subjects from the Study  
 A subject may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the subject, the investigator, 
or the Sponsor feels that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue.    
 All subjects are free to withdraw from participation at any time, for any reason, 
specified or unspecified, and without prejudice.  
 Reasonable attempts will be made by the investigator to provide a reason for subject 
withdrawals.    
o The reason for the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be specified in the 
subject’s source documents.    
o As noted above, subjects who discontinue study treatment early should have an 
early discontinuation visit. Refer to Section 10 for early termination 
procedures.    
 
12 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
 A protocol violation occurs when the subject or investigator fails to adh ere to 
significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, subject safety and  
Tammy Moore, PI, Sponsor  Confidential  
 
Version #:  4 – 2018H0303  Version Date: 07/29/2019  Page 26 of 34 
 primary endpoint criteria.  Protocol violations for this study include, but are not 
limited to, the following:  
o Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
o Failure to comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines will also 
result in a protocol violation. The Sponsor will determine if a protocol 
violation will result in withdrawal of a subject.  
o When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the investigator and 
a Protocol Violation Form detailing the violation will be generated. This form 
will be signed by a Sponsor representative and the Investigator. A copy of the 
form will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s files.  
13 STATISTICAL METHODS AN D CONSIDERATIONS  
Prior to the analysis of the final study data, a detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will 
be written describing all analyses that will be performed.  The SAP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan desc ribed below.   
13.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using appropriate 
descriptive statistics including the mean and standard deviation for continuous values and 
counts and proportions for disc rete variables.  
13.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for this study is the number of patient falls.  This will be expressed 
as a rate per patient days where patient days are counted from the initiations of the PUP™  
System until discharge or re moval from the fall risk protocol.  Using a one -sided one -
sample test for Poisson means, we will test whether the observed fall rate is less than the 
historical rate of 0.004.  This test will be conducted at the alpha=0.1 level.  Results will be 
presented as the fall rate and the corresponding one -sided 90% confidence interval which 
will provide an upper bound for the fall rate.  
13.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Secondary outcomes include estimating the incidence of false alerts, the rate of alerts sent 
out per patient days, characteristics of the patient safety events, and time to response. The 
analyses of the secondary endpoints will be descriptive and exploratory with the goal of 
further characterizing the properties of the PUP™ System.  Rates and means will be 
calculated as appropriate.  Confidence intervals will be computed to accompany each 
estimate.  No formal statistical testing will be conducted.  
We will also examine how fall rates may be associated with patient characteristics.  We 
may also explore  data related to the activity level of fall risk patients that are collected by 
the PUP™ System.  These descriptive analyses could help to further characterize the fall 
risk patient population.  
Tammy Moore, PI, Sponsor  Confidential  
 
Version #:  4 – 2018H0303  Version Date: 07/29/2019  Page 27 of 34 
 13.4 Sample Size  
The primary endpoint of the trial is the patient fall rate per patient days.  Comparing to a 
historical rate of 0.004 using a one -sided test of Poisson means, we have at least 70% 
power to detect a 25% reduction in the fall rate at alpha level 0.1 with 2360.  Assuming a 
dropout rate of 5%, we will enroll  2500 patients into the study.  
14 DATA COLLECTION, RET ENTION AND MONITORIN G 
14.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents 
designed to record all observations and other pertinent data for each sub ject treated with the 
study drug.   
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corresponding to a 
subject’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) OR paper 
CRF when the information corresponding to that visit is available.  Subjects will not be 
identified by name in the study database or on any study documents to be collected by the 
Sponsor (or designee) but will be identified by a site number, subject number , and initials.  
If a correction is required for  an eCRF, the  time and date stamps track the person entering 
or updating eCRF data and create an electronic audit trail.   
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on subjects enrolled in this 
study.  All data collected during the cour se of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator.  A copy of the CRF will remain at the 
Investigator’s site at the completion of the study.  
14.2 Data Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated  database.  The Data Management group will be 
responsible for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation.  Database 
lock will occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed.  
All procedures for the handling and analysis of dat a will be conducted using good 
computing practices meeting FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for 
clinical trials.  
14.3 Data Quality Control and Reporting  
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemented and applied to the database on a regular basis. 
Queries are entered, tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly.  The study 
database will be updated in accordance with the resolved queries.  All changes to the 
study database will be documented.  
14.4 Archival of Data  
The database is safeguarded against unauthorized access by established security 
procedures; appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be 
Tammy Moore, PI, Sponsor  Confidential  
 
Version #:  4 – 2018H0303  Version Date: 07/29/2019  Page 28 of 34 
 maintained.   Databases  are backed up  by the database administrator in conjunction with 
any updates or changes to the database.    
At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim reports and final reports), 
data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
14.5 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., 
FDA) inspectors upon request.  A fil e for each subject must be maintained that includes 
the signed Informed Consent /HIPAA Authorization Form and copies of all source 
documentation related to that subject.  The Investigator must ensure the reliability and 
availability of source documents from  which the information on the CRF was derived.  
All study documents (patient files, signed informed consent forms, copies of CRFs, Study 
File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secure for a period of two years following marketing of 
the investigational product or  for two years after centers have been notified that the IND 
has been discontinued.  There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is 
required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contacted prior to 
removing study record s for any reason.  
14.6 Monitoring  
Monitoring visits will be conducted by representatives of the Sponsor according to the 
U.S. CFR Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6).    By signing 
this protocol, the Investigator grants permission to the Sponsor (or designee), and 
appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on -site monitoring and/or auditing of all 
appropriate study documentation.  
14.7 Subject Confidentiality  
In order to maintain subject confidentiality, only a site number, subject number , and 
subject initials will identify all study subjects on CRFs and other documentation submitted 
to the Sponsor.  Additional subject confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in the 
Clinical Study Agreement.  
15 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHI CAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of 
Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and 
Obligations of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 312).

amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be 
implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working days.  
15.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Et hics Committees  
The protocol and consent form will be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC of each 
participating center prior to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of 
causality will be reported to the IRB/IEC in accordance with the s tandard operating 
procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC 
informed as to the progress of the study.  The Investigator will obtain assurance of 
IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB/IEC ma y need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent information) 
will be submitted to the IRB/IEC.  The IRB/IECs written unconditional approval of the 
study protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated.  The IRB/IECs unconditional approval statement will be 
transmitted by the  Investigator to the Sponsor or designee prior to the shipment of study 
supplies to the site.  This approval must refer to the study by exact protocol title and 
number and should identify the documents reviewed and the date of review.  
Protocol and/or infor med consent modifications or changes may not be initiated without 
prior written IRB/IEC approval except when necessary to eliminate immediate hazards to 
the patients or when the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the 
study.  Su ch modifications will be submitted to the IRB/IEC and written verification that 
the modification was submitted and subsequently approved should be obtained.   
The IRB/IEC must be informed of revisions to other documents originally submitted for 
review; ser ious and/or unexpected adverse experiences occurring during the study in 
accordance with the standard operating procedures and policies of the IRB; new 
information that may affect adversely the safety of the patients of the conduct of the study; 
an annual update and/or request for re -approval; and when the study has been completed.

to IMRT), concurrent with  daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 -2.2 Gy) to a total of 60-72 Gy 
over approximately 7 weeks, p lus cisplatin administered 80 -100 mg/m2 once every three  
weeks for 3 doses or 30 -40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6 -7 doses (investigator’s choice)  
• Arm B: 90 mg GC4419 per day (60 min IV infusion to complete within 60 minutes prior 
to IMRT), concurrent with  daily f ractions of IMRT (2.0 -2.2 Gy) to a total of 60-72 Gy

Statistical methods:  
With 65 patients per arm  having received GC4419/placebo and completed their IMRT course  
(assumes 72 patients en rolled to each treatment arm with a  10% dropout rate ), the study will have 
roughly 80-85% power to detect a reduction in duration  in the experimental arm under  the following 
assumed  incidence of severe OM  and percentiles  of the distribution of duration of severe OM:  
• GC4419 arms: incidence = 40%; duration (25th, 50th, 75th percentile): 0, 0, 21 days  
• Control arm: incidence = 65%; duration (25th, 50th, 75th percentile): 0, 28, 50 days  
For each active dose, duration of severe OM will be compared to the placebo  duration using the van 
Elteren test stratified by the factors used in randomization, namely baseline HPV status and planned 
chemotherapy sc hedule.  
To control the overall 2 -sided Type I error rate of 0.05, testing of hypotheses for the primary and 
secondar y endpoints will follow a fixed sequence, continuing until a preceding hypothesis fails to be 
rejected at the 0.05 level .    
Additional details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  In the event of discrepancies of 
details between the protoco l and the Statistical Analysis Plan, the latter will control the analyses 
performed.

 21  4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1. Background  
4.1.1.  Oral Mucositis in Pa tients Treated with Chemoradiation for HNC  
Oral mucositis (OM) is a common, problematic, and painful complication of cancer therapy, 
particularly in regimens that include radiation  to the head and neck .1   Oral m ucositis  is readily 
graded using the commonly -used five-point World Health Organization (WHO) scale, in which:  
• Grade 0  = No mucositis  
• Grade 1  = Pain and erythema  
• Grade 2  = Ulceration but no compromise in diet (able to eat solid food ) 
• Grade 3  = Ulceration w ith ability to eat only liquids  
• Grade 4  = Ulceration with inability to eat/requirement for tube or parenteral feeding   
A majority of patients receiving combined chemoradiotherapy for head and neck cancer (HNC) 
can be expected to develop severe ( WHO Grade 3-4) OM,2 and nearly all HNC patients 
receiving RT with concurrent cisplatin are expected to develop ulcerative OM ( WHO Grade 2 or 
higher).3  
Standard chemoradiotherapy  for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck 
(SCCHN), whether in the post -operative or definitive setting, currently consists of intensity -
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus systemic therapy .  Common systemic treatment is with 
single-agent cisplatin, administered either q3 week s or once weekly schedule.4, 5, 6, 7  The 
monoclonal antibody cetuximab has also been shown to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy for 
locally advanced head and neck cancer,8  and the combination of IMRT plus either single -agent 
cisplatin or  single -agent cetuximab is currently being tested head -to-head for patients with 
human papilloma virus (HPV) -related oropharyngeal cancer in the ongoing RTOG 1016 trial.  
Unpublished observations for a group of approximately 300 patients treated with intens ity-
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plus single -agent cisplatin for cancers of the oral cavity or 
oropharynx, without additional treatment to prevent OM, suggest that approximately 70% of 
patients may be expected to develop severe OM, at a median cumula tive IMRT dose delivered of 
approximately 40 Gy (S. Sonis, Dana -Farber Cancer Institute) , as summarized i n Table  2.  In 
addition, two published Phase 3 studies of palifermin in patients receiving RT plus single -agen t 
cisplatin for SCCHN reported an overall incidence of severe (WHO Grade 3 -4) OM among 
placebo patients of 67% in one study and 69% in the other.9,10

Adding cetuximab to standard chemoradiation regimens for HNC incr eases the risk of significant 
OM,7 while cetuximab without additional chemotherapy has been reported in one study to 
increase the risk of OM  in patients receiving radiation  modestly, if at all .8  
Among patients being tre ated for HNC, OM follows a predictable and well -documented course.11 
By the end of the first week of treatment (typically cumulative radiation doses of 10 Gy), 
erythema of the oral mucosa is usually seen and patients complain of discomfort that is 
characterized as burning.  This relatively mild pain escalates between the second and third week 
of treatment (radiation doses of 20 Gy to 30 Gy), when frank ulceration  of the mucosa develops.  
Lesions at this stage often necessitate a modification in food intake and a marked increase in the 
need for analgesics.  Individual ulcers frequently coalesce as radiation progresses resulting in 
confluent injury affecting many as pects of the oral mucosa.  Pain intensifies and may be 
inadequately controlled even with aggressive narcotic therapy.12 
Oral mucositis  is a treatment -induced morbidity that has substantial impact on day -to-day 
functioning.  In addition to the common need for, and inadequate pain control with , narcotics, the 
profound clinical impact of OM also includes weight loss, difficulty eating and swallowing, 
dehydration, need for nutritional support, and reduced performance status,12 as well as secondary 
infections at sites of ulcerative OM,13 and diminished quality of life (QOL) outcomes.14  Patients 
with HNC may also suffer the additional complications of short - and long -term xerostomia, taste 
change, and trismus related to post -radiation fibrosis.   
Besides its symptomatic toll, OM is associated with a number of serious medical complications 
and negative health economic outcomes. Among patients treated for HNC, even mild mucositis 
results in more frequent hospitalization and breaks in treatment, introducing the risk of 
compromised anti -tumor efficacy.15, 16  In granulocytopenic patients, mucositis is strongly 
associated with an increased risk of bacteremia and sepsis.17  Adverse health economic outcomes 
include incre ased analgesic and antibiotic use, increased number of febrile days, need for 
parenteral nutrition, prolonged length of hospital stay, and increased resource use and associated 
cost.18

 23  4.1.2.  Oral Mucositis is an Unmet  Medical Need  
Oral mucositis  prevention and management  remains a substantial unmet need. For years, there 
has been no substantial change in its management.19  Current guidelines20 from the Multinational 
Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology 
(MASCC/ISOO) limit recommended or suggested interventions to prev ent OM to:  
• Palifermin in the setting of high -dose chemotherapy and t otal body irradiation, 
followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), for a 
hematological malignancy;  
• Oral cryotherapy in the setting of 5 -fluorouracil therapy or chemotherapy/HSCT;  
• Low-level laser therapy in the setting of chemothe rapy/HSCT or chemoradiotherapy 
for HNC;  
• Benzydamine mouthwash in the setting of HNC treated with moderate -dose RT, 
without concomitant chemotherapy;  
• Oral zinc supplements in the setting of radiation or chemoradiation;  
• Oral care protocols across all cancer treatment modalities.  
Narcotics and doxepin mouthwash are recommended or suggested by MASCC/ISOO for the 
treatment of OM -related pain.  A number of other agents currently used to treat OM, while 
designed to palliate associated pain or manage infection, do not alter the underlying biologic 
processes that give rise to OM.  MASCC/ISOO currently recommends or suggests against the 
use of some agents that have historically been used (e.g., antimicrobial mouthwashes, sucralfate, 
chlorhexidine mouthwash), citing ev idence for lack of effectiveness against OM in one or more 
treatment settings.  
At present, palifermin is the only FDA -approved drug intervention for OM but its use (patients 
receiving HSCT for hematologic malignancies) is limited to a very small cohort (4% ) of the at -
risk population; viz., OM associated with conditioning regimens prior to stem cell transplant for 
the treatment of hematologic malignancies.21   
A number of medical devices are in the market, but gene rally lack sufficient data to allow 
recommendation.  The mucoadhesive MuGard™ is indicated as a palliative  treatment  for the 
management of OM22  but require s administration  four to six  times per day for optimal e ffect and 
does not alter the mechanism of OM.  The oral gel Gelclair® has a similar use and effect for OM 
or oral irritation due to other causes  but does not affect the mechanism of OM .  Caphosol® 
(supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse) is indicated for x erostomia or as an adjunct to standard 
oral care for OM23 but failed to reduce the incidence of ulcerative or severe OM in a recently -
published Phase 2 study.24   The l ipid-based oral barrier rinse Episil® and the bacteriostatic rinse 
GelX® (zinc gluconate -taurine complex) may be used for pain related to OM but do not affect the 
mechanism causing OM.  
4.2. GC4419  
GC4419 is a novel, highly stable manganese -containing macrocycli c ligand complex with a 
molecular weight of 483, whose activity mimics that of naturally occurring superoxide dismutase 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 24  (SOD) enzymes.  It is therefore a prototype of a new class of drugs termed selective SOD 
mimetics.   
GC4419 selectively removes superoxi de anions without reacting with other reactive oxygen 
species, including nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, and peroxynitrite.  In addition, unlike native 
SOD, GC4419 is not deactivated by nitration.  Nonclinical data have identified GC4419 as a 
promising ne w radioprotective, anti -cancer and anti -inflammatory agent.  Thus, GC4419 was 
active as a radio -protectant in animal models of cancer radiation therapy and added to the 
activity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models of cancer. Importantly, GC4419 did  not 
interfere with the anti -tumor effects of either radiation therapy or chemotherapy in animal 
models of cancer.  
GC4419 is being developed for the initial indication of “ Reduction of the Severity and Incidence  
of Radiation and Chemotherapy Induced Oral M ucositis” under IND 111,539 with the Division 
of Oncology Products I, United States Food and Drug Administration.  
4.2.1.  Biological Rationale for GC4419 in Radiation/Chemotherapy Induced OM  
Under normal circumstances superoxide (O2 -) is a by -product of mitochondr ial cellular 
respiration and is also produced by activated phagocytes.   Since superoxide is extremely 
reactive with biological molecules , it is quite toxic to cells.  In all studied species, this potentially 
toxic su peroxide burden is normally contained b y a complement of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) 
enzymes.25  In vertebrates , SOD enzymes are present in the cytoplasm (SOD1 Cu/Zn based), 
mitochondria (SOD2, Mn based) and extracellular spaces (SOD3, Cu/Zn based).  S uperoxide 
dismutases are a class of oxidoreductase enzymes that dismutate superoxide into molecular 
oxygen and hydrogen peroxide.  
The control of the free radical flux derived from oxygen is jeopardized in many circumstances in 
which superoxide production is excessive or if the breakdown of superoxide is compromised. 
This over -production of superoxide can overwhelm the body’s ability to eliminate it via catalytic 
dismutation and lead to a variety of superoxide initiated or mediated disease states, including  
OM. 
Ionizing radiation damages cells by transferring sufficient energy to intracellular atoms or 
biomolecules to modify their normal properties and functions. Since approximately 70% of an 
average cell consists of water, radiolytic hydrolysis is by far th e primary triggering event 
following the exposure of cells and tissues to ionizing irradiation, e.g., as in radiation therapy 
(RT) for the treatment of cancer.26    
Radiolytic hydrolysis leads to the formation of  a number of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 
including predominantly the superoxide anion (O2 -). Therapeutic radiation damages cancer cells 
by abruptly but transiently increasing tissue ROS, including superoxide. Normal cells in the 
radiation field counter these damaging effects by detoxifying ROS via their intact redox 
protective enzyme systems (SOD, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) , converting hydrogen 
peroxide into water and molecular oxygen,  and by the activation of DNA repair mechanisms. In 
cancer cell s, it has been suggested that exogenous SOD and SOD mimetics, by reducing 
intracellular superoxide (a proliferation trigger) and increasing hydrogen peroxide (an apoptosis 
trigger) shifts the critical cellular redox balance reducing the proliferative drive  and increasing 
the apoptotic drive.27

 25  Recent research has demonstrated that the pathogenesis of mucositis involves more than just 
direct clonogenic cell death induced non -specifically on rapidly dividing basal epithelial cells.  
Rather, basal epithelial cell death is mediated by a wide rang e of mechanistic pathways; at least 
14 canonical pathways have been identified as being involved in HNC treatment toxicities.28  
The generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by chemoradiation, for example, leads to a 
number of signaling pathways in the submucosa that then target the epithelium and result in loss 
of epithelial renewal and the development of ulceration.29  ROS, and in particular O2• -, are 
believed to play a central role in the initiation of tissue injury and up -regulation of inflammatory 
cytokines, with subsequent signal amplification and mucosal inflammation and ulceration.30  
Furthermore, differences in polymorphisms that encode for glutathione S -transferase, an enzyme 
that provides protection from ROS, have been associated with increased risk for radiation - and 
chemotherapy -induc ed injury to both the oral mucosa and skin.31  
Taken as a whole, this suggests that an agent that efficiently and rapidly removes O2• - offers a 
treatment paradigm for preventing or controlling OM.  Numerous publi shed studies indicate that 
OM, esophagitis, pneumonitis, fibrosis, or other normal -tissue radiation damage may be reduced 
by treatment with liposomally encapsulated exogenous MnSOD or a MnSOD transgene, 
exogenous Cu/Zn SOD, or a dismutase mimetic enantiome rically related to GC4419.32, 33, 34, 35, 36 
4.3. Pre-Clinical GC4419 Data  
4.3.1.  Pre-Clinical Data with GC4419 in Hamster Models for Radiation -Induced OM  
Pre-clinically, GC4419 has been shown to reduce the duration of severe OM in the hamster 
cheek pouch model.  When administered 30 min before and 12 h ours after irradiation (40 Gy) of 
the everted buccal cheek pouch of Syrian golden hamsters, GC4419, like its enantiomer GC4403, 
accelerated the resolution of OM and reduced the percentage of animal days with severe OM (a 
mucositis score ≥3), in a dose -dependent fashion, compared with a vehicle control group.37   
Effective plasma c oncentrations of GC4419 in this well -established animal model of OM were 
similar to those previously found achievable in normal human volunteers.38  
In a separate study in the same model  assessing fractionated ra diation , hamsters received a total 
of 60 Gy in eight  fractions of 7.5 Gy each over 10 days, on Days 0 -3 and 6 -9.  GC4419, 10 or 30 
mg/kg i.p, was administered 30 minutes before irradiation by two schedules: on Days 0 -3 and 6 -
9; or on Days 0, 2, 6, and 8 (1 0 animals per group).  GC4419 significantly reduced severe OM, 
but only when administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg before each irradiation.39  
4.3.2.  GC4419 is not Tumor Protective in Non -Clinical Cancer Models.  
Importantly, GC4419 does not interfere with the antitu mor efficacy of radiation therapy or 
cancer chemotherapeutic agents in any in vitro or in vivo models evaluated to date.  This 
supports the findings for this differential effect on cancer and normal cells is due to differences 
in H2O2 sensitivity between t hese cells , as noted above .  SOD enzymes in normal cells rapidly 
convert O2• - to H2O2 which is then rapidly detoxified to water by catalase, glutathione 
peroxidase and related enzymes.  Cancer cells may be deficient in these enzymes, but also tend 
to be es pecially sensitive to elevated H2O2.  The addition of an SOD mimetic (such as GC4419) 
more rapidly drives O2• - to H2O2, creating a burden that is markedly more toxic to tumor cells 
than normal cells.  In vitro, GC4419 protects a variety of normal cell type s from the effects of

 26  radiation while sensitizing lung and head -and-neck cancer cell lines, consistent with the literature 
on SOD enzyme effects.  GC4419 did not antagonize the growth -inhibitory effects of cisplatin 
on the cisplatin -sensitive CT26 tumor ce ll line.  In fact, at concentrations >1 µM cisplatin, 
GC4419 enhanced the cisplatin effect.  As expected, GC4419, when added alone, inhibited the 
O2•- dependent proliferation of CT26 cells.  In addition, Galera has evaluated GC4419 as a 
single agent agains t multiple tumor cell lines in vitro and, in every case, tumor cell growth and 
proliferation was either inhibited or not affected (data on f ile, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.).    
In vivo, GC4419 does not diminish, but may enhance, the anti -tumor effects of ra diation or 
chemotherapy.  Notable are results in the human lung tumor xenograft, H1299, and the human 
HNC tumor xenograft, FaDu/HTB -43.  In the H1299 model, GC4419 appeared modestly to 
increase the antitumor effect of cisplatin plus radiation  given in frac tions of approximately 2 Gy .  
In the FaDu model, GC4419 neither enhanced nor antagonized the anti -tumor effect of radiation.  
In the FaDu model, in parallel cohorts of tumor -bearing animals, plasma concentrations of 
GC4419 assayed 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 minu tes following irradiation demonstrated plasma 
exposures of GC4419 that exceeded the levels shown to be efficacious in the previously 
described OM model in hamsters (data on file, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.).  
Further, results from ongoing Galera -sponsored st udies (M. Story, University of 
Texas/Southwestern , personal communication ) suggest that GC4419 may more greatly 
radiosensitize tumors when radiation is given by a hypofractionated schedule.  In another 
experiment in the H1299 model, a single dose of 20 mg/ kg GC4419 caused a tumor growth delay 
of 22 days vs . vehicle control , comparable to results with  single agent cisplatin (21 day tumor 
growth delay) .  A single radiation fraction (day 0) of 18 Gy produced a 32 -day tumor growth 
delay compared to vehicle.  Th e combination of GC4419 and 18 Gy of radiation produced a 
tumor growth delay of 90 days compared to vehicle and 57 days compared to radiation alone.  
These results were similar to those obtained by the combination of cisplatin and radiation and 
were not st atistically different from results when GC4419 was added to the combination of 
radiation and cisplatin.     
Galera has conducted tumor growth delay studies in several other in vivo tumor models, 
including colon, HNC, lung and melanoma.  In every case, tumor  growth was either slowed or 
not affected, and in no case has GC4419 interfered with the anti -tumor effects of chemotherapy 
(cisplatin, gemcitabine, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, irinotecan, and doxorubicin) or 
radiotherapy (data on file, Galera Therapeuti cs, Inc.).  
Results of experiments with GC4419 in cancer tumor models are further described in the 
GC4419 Investigator’s Brochure.   Additional non -clinical studies are planned to further elucidate 
mechanisms of any anti -tumor interaction between radiation a nd GC4419.  
4.4. Phase I Study of GC4419 , GT -001  
4.4.1.  Clinical Data with GC4419 in Radiation/Chemotherapy Induced OM  
GC4419 has been studied in a Phase 1b/2a trial, GT -001 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), in combination with 
IMRT and single agent cisplatin, in the treatment of patien ts with squamous cell carcinoma of 
the oral cavity (OC) or oropharynx (OP) for whom the planned IMRT/cisplatin regimen is 
medically indicated.  In the IMRT regimen, patients received approximately 2 Gy of IMRT once 
daily, Monday -Friday, up to a total of ap proximately 70 Gy administered over 7 weeks.   
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 27  Cisplatin was administered either every 3 weeks for 3 doses (80 -100 mg/m2), or weekly for 6 -7 
doses (30 -40 mg/m2).  GC4419 was administered by 60 -minute IV infusion each day (M -F) prior 
to that day’s IMRT frac tion, with IMRT administered within 60 minutes of the end of GC4419 
infusion.  
The primary objective of the GT-001 clinical study was to characterize the safety profile of 
GC4419 when administered with the IMRT/platinum regimen, with key secondary objective s of 
reduction in the incidence, severity, and/or duration of OM experienced by patients.  The trial 
followed  a serial cohort (3+3) dose escalation design.  
Under an early version of protocol GT -001 patients received GC4419 prior to each of the first 14 
or 20 doses of IMRT.  Serial cohorts of patients were assigned to daily doses of 15, 30, 50, 75, or 
112 mg (absolute dose).   After FDA review of a Type A meeting request (IND serial 0016, 
submitted April 2, 2014 with FDA Meeting Preliminary Comments April 2 8, 2014) the protocol 
was amended to provide for serial patient cohorts to receive GC4419 prior to the first 25, 30, or 
all 35 dose fractions of IMRT, at daily doses previously shown not to exceed the maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD).   Under this amendment, s erial cohorts of patients were assigned to 
receive 112 mg/d for 25 or 30 doses, 90 mg/day for 30 or 35 doses, and 30 mg/d for 35 doses.  
Studying longer durations of dosing was based on the hypothesis that administration of GC4419 
throughout the duration o f IMRT would be needed for optimal efficacy against OM.  
A total of 46 patients were enrolled.  Of these, 45 were evaluable for safety and 43 were 
evaluable for OM ( Table  3):

4.4.2.  Oral Mucositis Clinical Data from GT -001 
As of July 8 , 2015, treatment was complete for all patients and unaudited OM data were 
available for the  43 patients evaluable for OM. The OM evaluations indicate th at, compared with 
historical expectations:  
• The overall incidence of severe (WHO Grade 3 or 4) OM appears reduced;  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 28  • Severity of OM (specifically, Grade 4 OM) appears to be lowered when GC4419 
treatment is extended for 6 -7 weeks;  
• Onset of severe OM appears de layed;  
• Duration of severe OM appears reduced, particularly with the longer treatment schedules.  
In general, efficacy to reduce the incidence and severity of OM appeared greatest with more 
prolonged GC4419 dosing schedules.  However, there was not a clear r elationship between 
absolute daily dose and OM results; excellent efficacy was apparent even for patients who 
received 30 mg/d.  
The overall incidence of Grade 3 -4 OM (all cohorts, pooled) is summarized, in comparison with 
the matched historical data, in Table  4, below:

Sources:  Sonis, personal communication; Monitored, unaudited Gal era GT -001 clinical data  
It is noteworthy that only 2 of 43 patients had experienced Grade 3 OM (no Grade 4) by the end 
of the third week of IMRT, and only 5 of 43 had experienced Grade 3 OM (no Grade 4) by the 
end of the fourth week of IMRT.  This compare s favorably with the published experience of Le 
et.al.9 and Henke et.al.10 in which approximately 20% of patients receiving placebo and 
approximately 15% of patients receiving palifermin had developed Grade 3 or 4 OM by the end 
of 3 weeks, and approximatel y 40% of patients receiving placebo and approximately 30% of 
patients receiving palifermin had developed Grade 3 or 4 OM by the end of 4 weeks.9,10 
However, a single metric such as overall incidence does not fully characterize the OM efficacy 
data for GC44 19.  Figure  1, Figure  2 and Figure  3 demonstrate each individual patient’s OM 
experience over time (one row per patient).  In the agg regate, these results appear to confirm 
that, as treatment duration is increased, the incidence of severe OM is lower than expected, while 
severe OM, when it occurs, is delayed in onset, lower in severity (with Grade 4 OM rare in 
patients receiving 6 -7 wee ks of GC4419), and shorter in duration.   
Table  5 tabulates OM results by several measures, vs the historical matched data and the 
published placebo data of Le and Henke.  These measures include incidence of severe OM 
through the “landmark” point of 60 Gy delivered to tumor (approximately 6 weeks), a fixed 
reference point in the treatment course.

4.4.3.  Clinical Safety Data  with GC4419   
The most common adverse events observed in the GT -001 study were nausea, fatigue, dysgeusia, 
oropharyn geal pain, decreased white blood cell count, constipation, dry mouth, anemia, 
vomiting, diarrhea, decreased lymphocyte count, and decreased appetite. These and other 
adverse events observed are characteristic of the cisplatin/IMRT regimen in this patient 
population.  
The following mild to moderate adverse events were reported as possibly related to GC4419 for 
>10% of patients in the GT -001 study: nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, diarrhea, fatigue, dyspepsia, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, dizziness, dysgeusia , weight loss, decreased appetite, headache, 
paresthesia, and hic cups.  
The following more severe adverse events were reported as possibly related to GC4419 in the 
GT-001 study: anemia, nausea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, low white blood cell count, low 
neutrophil count, weight loss, decreased appetite, arthritis, and reduced range of motion.  As of 
21-Dec-2016 the following additional  severe adverse events have been reported as possibly 
related to GC4419 in the GT -201 study: hypotension, diarrhea, unexplained  fever, and 
bradycardia/syncope.  
Potentially mechanism -related facial tingling or paresthesia, possibly due to nitric oxide 
potentiation, was reported for several patients in the GT -001 study and appears related to 
GC4419 dose, occurring in 11/19 (58%) pat ients receiving 112 mg per dose, 5/9 (55%) patients 
receiving 90 mg/dose, but only 2/18 (11%) at lower doses.  This facial tingling/paresthesia was 
mild to moderate, and when it occurred it did so during GC4419 infusion with resolution shortly 
after the en d of the infusion.  It was neither treatment -limiting nor troublesome to patients, and 
does not pose a meaningful safety risk.

    Per their reported assessments, investigators considered two patients to have potentially dose-
limiting toxicities (DLTs), both a t a daily dose of 112 mg:  
• One patient receiving 112 mg for 14 doses had an episode described as gastroenteritis 
(principally nausea and vomiting) requiring hospitalization.  This event occurred 
during the first three weeks of IMRT, and was reported as poss ibly related to GC4419 
because of the temporal association with days of GC4419 treatment, although the 
patient’s symptoms were not infusion -related.  Furthermore, the treating investigator 
reported that the event “probably” was attributable to cisplatin.  
• One patient enrolled to the 112 mg x 30 dose cohort experienced two episodes of 
nausea and vomiting requiring hospitalization, first after the fourth week of protocol 
therapy, then again after rechallenge with GC4419 and IMRT through the fifth week 
of treat ment.  The treating investigators reported that the patient’s vomiting was 
possibly related to GC4419 but principally due to the presence of thick secretions 
complicating swallowing.  The patient also experienced Grade 3 hyponatremia that 
was initially rep orted as possibly related to GC4419, but that appears from the clinical 
events to be attributable to GI loss and poor intake of solutes.  While this patient’s 
events were reported as possibly related to GC4419, they may not constitute true 
dose-limiting to xicities of GC4419. Including these two cases, through August 6, 
2015 a total of 49 event terms have been reported as serious adverse events (SAEs) 
for 23 patients.  In some cases, a single medical event was reported as several event 
terms with identical o r overlapping onset dates.  Only in the two cases described 
above were the events reported as possibly related to GC4419.  Other SAEs were 
judged not related to GC4419, but attributable to the combination of platinum and 
IMRT or to comorbidities and concom itant medications.   SAEs event terms reported 
for more than one patient include fever (5 patients), vomiting (5 patients), febrile 
neutropenia (4 patients) , nausea (3 patients), and dehydration (2 patients).   
Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling has been perform ed on Week 1 Day 2 and on Week 3 Day 3.  
Preliminary results shown in Table  6 below reflect available data for 32 patients  from the GT -
001 study , with analysis of additional patients (e.g., treated at 90 mg/day) in progress. Results are 
consistent with modeled predictions (data not shown), and demonstrate increases in GC4419 
Cmax and AUC that are approximately dose -proportional.  There has been minimal accumulation 
of GC4419 in plasma with repeated dosing.  Exposure to active metabolites (which are 
substantially less active than the parent drug) is low compared with exposure to the parent drug 
GC4419 (data not shown).

4.5. Randomized Phase II Study of GC4419, GT -201 
In the present three -arm, randomized (1:1:1), placebo -controlled phase 2 tria l, two doses of 
GC4419 (a  “low” dose of 30 mg and a “high” dose of 90 mg) will be evaluated against placebo 
in patients with locally advanced, non -metastatic squamous  cell HNC of the oral cavity or 
oropharynx.  All patients will receive a backbone regimen of cisplatin, either administered q3 
week s, 80-100 mg/m2 or weekly 30 -40 mg/m2 (investigator’s choice), plus IMRT administered 
in 2.0 -2.2 Gy daily  fractions, to a total dose of 6 0-72 Gy.   
The goals of the Phase 2 trial are to identify sufficient efficacy of GC4419, in the form of 
reduced duration, incidence, and severity  of OM ; to suggest clinical benefit and indicate that 
confirmation of such benefit is likely in a subsequent pivotal trial ; and to inform the design of 
that trial.  Accordingly, the design of the Phase 2 trial, including the sam ple and target effect 
sizes, is  intended to provide data sufficiently robust for GT -201 to guide the design of a future 
pivotal, registration -directed Phase 3 trial of GC4419 in the present indication.  
GT-201 is a  placebo -controlled, double -blind trial.  Galera believes that the estimated incidences 
of severe OM as communicated by Sonis ( Table  2) are likely to be accurate, because the data 
supporting them are pooled from a set of patients matched for tumor site, IMRT, and single -
agent cisplatin treatment, and because they appear to agree closely with published data, including 
the placebo experience in the two similarly -designed trials conducted with palifermin.  However, 
because  of the risk of bias, the possibility of reductions of severe OM arising solely from 
ongoing refinements in the delivery of radiation therapy, and the early stage of GC4419’s 
development justifying equipoise, the placebo -controlled design has been chosen.  Similarly, th is 
trial is double -blinded to reduce the risk of bias in the primary and secondary endpoints.

    5. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
5.1. Primary Objective  
The primary objective of  this study will be t o evaluate and compare the duration of severe OM, 
as ass essed from the first determination of ≥ Grade 3 OM to the first instance of non -severe OM 
(≤ Grade 2), without a subsequent instance of ≥ Grade 3.      
5.1.1.  Rationale for Primary Endpoint  
The WHO scale is  commonly used to assess OM in clinical care and research settings.   It was 
developed as a standard toxicity reporting index . It has evolved into the most accepted outcome 
for efficacy testing of drugs as it has been shown to meet key characteristics for clinical studies:  
• Accurate reflection of the severity and course of the objective and subjective changes 
of mucositis.  
• Easy to teach with a  minim al inter-observer variability.  
• Does not require measurement of lesions.  
• Sensitive enough to discriminate treatment efficacy.  
• Clinically meaningful and easily interpreted  endpoints for clinicians, patients and 
regulatory agencies.  
• The WHO scale has been used as the primary efficacy endpoint for many studies and 
is accepted internationally.    
There is precedent for severe OM on the WHO scale being used as the basis for drug  approval.  
Palifermin (Kepivance®) is indicated to decrease the incidence and duration of severe oral 
mucositis in patients with hematologic mali gnancies receiving myelotoxic therapy requiring 
hematopoietic stem cell support, when the preparative regimen is predicted to result in WHO 
Grade > 3 mucositis in the majority of patients.  Approval of palifermin was based on a reduction 
in the number of days during which patients experienced severe oral mucositis (Grade 3/4 on the 
WHO (World Health Organization) scale); other analyses included the incidence, duration, and 
severity of oral mucositis and the use of opioid analgesia.43   Additional studies of agents to 
reduce OM —notably the two published studies of palifermin in the HN C population9, 10 also 
have used  the WHO scale.   
The duration  of severe OM is planned  as the single primary endpoint of this Phase 2 trial.  
Secondary and exploratory endpoints (see sections 5.2  and 5.3, below) are expected to provide 
important and clinically relevant data supporting the primary endpoint, as well as data to guide 
the selection of a primary endpoint for a future pivotal trial.  
Because of the nature of the WHO grading scale (See Sectio n 20), improvement of meaningful 
magnitude in the primary endpoint implies clinical benefit.  While ulcerative (Grade 2) OM is 
very common, its functional consequences may be open to question.  However, by defini tion, 
WHO Grade 3 OM entails a change in diet, and WHO Grade 4 OM includes  inability to eat, 
requiring parenteral or tube feedings.

 36  
    It may be noted here that many reports of OM in clinical trials use the NCI -CTCAE, in which the 
grading of OM is different  from the WHO scale  (Table  7).  Whereas the WHO criteria have been 
stable for years, NCI criteria have changed markedly with every new version.  The NCI criteria 
have found their greatest application in describing m ucositis as an AE associated with anti -
cancer regimens, not as an instrument to assess intervention efficacy.  
Table  7: Comparison of WHO Scale vs. NCI -CTCAE v4 for Oral Mucositis  
OM Grade  WHO Scale  NCI-CTCAE v4  
0 No mucositis  No mucositis  
1 Pain and erythema  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; 
intervention not indicated  
2 Ulceration but no compromise in diet 
(able to eat solid food)  Moderate pain; not interfering with oral 
intake; modified diet indicated  
3 Ulceration w ith ability to eat only liquids  Severe pain; interfering with oral  
Intake  
4 Ulceration with inability to 
eat/requirement for tube or parenteral 
feeding  Life-threatening consequences;  
urgent intervention indicated  
As noted, the WHO scale will be used in G T-201.  Separate grading of OM according to the 
CTCAE will not be performed.

    6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
6.1. Overall Study Design  
GT-201 is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multi -center study conducted in the 
US and Canada to evaluate GC4419 administered IV to reduce the duration, incidence, and 
severity of radiation induced oral mucositis in patients receiving chemoradiation for SCCHN, 
limited to the  oral cavity or oropharynx .   
6.2. Treatment Plan and Duration of Therapy  
Patients will be randomized equally to one of three  treatment arms:  
Arm A:  30 mg GC4419 per day (60 min IV infusion, to complete within 60 minutes prior 
to IMRT), concurrent with daily f ractions of IMRT (2.0 -2.2 Gy) to a total of 60-
72 Gy over approximately seven  weeks, p lus cisplatin administered 80 -100 
mg/m2 once every three  weeks for 3 doses or 30 -40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 
doses (investigator’s choice)  
Arm B:  90 mg GC4419 per day (6 0 min IV infusion, to complete within 60 minutes prior 
to IMRT), concurrent with  daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 -2.2 Gy) to a total of  60-
72 Gy over approximately seven  weeks, p lus cisplatin administered 80 -100 
mg/m2 once every three  weeks for 3 doses or 30 -40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 
doses (investigator’s choice)  
Arm C : Placebo daily (60 min IV infusion, to complete within 60 minutes prior to  IMRT), 
concurrent with  daily fractions of IMRT (2.0 -2.2 Gy) to a total of 6 0-72 Gy over 
approximately seven  weeks, p lus cisplatin administered 80 -100 mg/m2 once every 
three  weeks for 3 doses or 30 -40 mg/m2 once weekly for 6-7 doses (investigator’s 
choice)  
Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa, floor of 
mouth, tongue, soft palate) that are each planned to receive a total of ≥ 50 Gy.  Note, u navoidable 
doses of at least 50 Gy, to include entrance, exit, and scatter doses, still constitutes planned 
radiation.  
GC4419 /placebo  will be given intravenously in a one hour infusi on. IMRT must be initiated as 
soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419 /placebo  infusion but no later than 60 minutes 
following the end of the GC4419 /placebo  infusion.  
GC4419 /placebo  will be g iven beginning on the first day of radiation and con tinuing daily, 
concurrent with each dose of IMRT, to a cumulative r adiation dose of approximately 6 0-72 Gy. 
If IMRT is not administered on any given day due to a treatment break or unforeseen 
circumstance s, GC4419 /placebo  should n ot be administered on that day.  Breaks in IMRT will be 
determined by the patient’s treating physician in accordance with standard of care. Patients 
should resume GC4419 /placebo  administration when IMRT resumes .  On days when planned 
doses of both GC4419 /placebo  and IMRT are not administered (e.g., due to a hol iday site 
closure , etc. ), GC4419 /placebo  dosing may be extended along with IMRT to make up the missed 
dose(s)  up to a maximum of 35 doses of GC4419 /placebo .  If a fraction of IMRT is not 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 40  
    administere d for any reason after GC4419 /placebo  has been administered, that day’s 
GC4419 /placebo  will count as one of the 35 doses.  
Anti-emetic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factor use should be administered per ASCO 
guidelines.  If institutional guidelines p ermit, cisplatin may be administered prior to or after the 
first day of IMRT , as long as it follows a weekly or tri -weekly schedule .  On days in which 
chemotherapy and GC4419 /placebo  are administered, the administration sequence should be 
GC4419 /placebo , IMRT, prehydration, and cisplatin if possible. Patients treated with induction 
chemotherapy prior to concomitant chemoradiation are not eligible for this study.  
6.2.1.  Rationale for GC4419 Dose and Schedule Selection  
Data from the GT-001 trial indicate that the ac ute toxicity of GC4419 and the overall adverse 
event profile in combination with IMRT/cisplatin are as expected.  GC4419 does not appear to 
increas e the toxicity of IMRT/cisplatin.  The acute toxicity of GC4419 was acceptable at all 
doses tested , and consi stent with prior expectations as described in the Investigator’s Brochure.  
A true “maximum tolerated dose” of GC4419 by the common definition used in oncology Phase 
1 trials (>1/6 patients with DLT) was not exceeded in the GT -001 trial .  Although dose -limiting 
toxicities were suggested in two patients receiving 112 mg/dose, the relationship of the events to 
GC4419 is questionable in each case.  However, the overall incidence of Grade 3 nausea at 112 
mg was nominally greater than at lower doses.   Even if no t strictly dose -limiting, nausea is 
highly undesirable for the indication currently under study.  In addition, circumoral paresthesia , 
although mild, was dose -related.   Therefore, to provide an additional margin of safety and reduce 
the possibility of adve rse events that could increase the possibility of breaking study blinding, an 
upper dose of 90 mg of GC4419 will be used in the present trial.  Safety was acceptable at this 
dose when administered for 30-35 doses over six-seven  weeks .  Accordingly, the ava ilable safety 
data support the doses selected for the present trial for administration daily on weekdays for a 
full course of IMRT.  
Also of note is that Phase 1 data have not indicated a clear dose -response relationship with 
regard to either safety or pote ntial efficacy in preventing OM , although there did appear to be a 
positive relationship between the total duration of GC4419 treatment and the incidence, onset, 
and duration of severe OM .   
The small cohort sizes and overall Phase 1 sample size preclude c onclusions about a dose -
response relationship. As a next step in exploring such relationships, Galera will study 30 mg as 
a “low” dose in one of the two active treatment arms in GT -201.   
6.2.2.  Rationale for Cisplatin/IMRT Treatment P lan 
Meta -analyses have indic ated superior survival for HNC  patients treated with concurrent 
chemoradiotherapy compared with standard fractionation (M -F) radiation therapy alone.  While 
not all available regimens have been tested directly against one another, the benefit appears 
super ior for single -agent cisplatin over other chemotherapy regimens,40 and concurrent IMRT 
plus platinum monotherapy was chosen as one arm of the ongoing RTOG 1016 trial in human 
papilloma virus -associated oropharyng eal cancer.  The other arm of that trial uses IMRT plus 
cetuximab, as a potentially less -toxic, equally efficacious regimen to IMRT/cisplatin, based on 
the results from the trial of Bonner et. al. ,8 and other stu dies.  The incidence of severe OM may 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 41  
    be lower when IMRT is combined with cetuximab than with cisplatin; in the Bonner study, 
[NCI -CTCAE] Grade 3 -5 OM was reported in 56% of patients r eceiving IMRT plus cetuximab.  
Survival data for RTOG 1016 are anticipat ed in 20 20.41 For purposes of the GT -201 study, the 
still-standard cisplatin/IMRT regimen has been chosen as it poses a significant medical need by 
virtue of the high in cidence of associated severe OM.  In the ev ent that GT -201 yields positive 
results with regard to OM, the combination of GC4419, IMRT, and cetuximab may be studied in 
a separate, future trial.  It should be noted that RTOG 0522 determined that adding cetuximab to 
IMRT plus cisplatin did not increas e antitumor efficacy, but did increase toxicity.7  
Standard fractionation ( five fractions/week, delivered M -F) IMRT has been chosen for the GT -
201 trial.  Although accelerated fractionation ( six fractions/week, c ombined with two rather than 
three  doses of cisplatin q3 weeks), has been studied, prospective lead investigators for GT -201 
have advised that standard fractionation remains the widely -used standard, and in the interest of 
using a chemoradiation regimen th at is as uniform and commonly -used as possible, the standard 
fractionation approach is being retained.  It is noted that accelerated fractionation appears 
substantially to increase the incidence of severe OM.42   
Galera believes that the q3 week s cisplatin regimen has not been directly compared with the 
once -weekly cisplatin regimen in combination with IMRT for HNC  cancer in a clinical trial.  
These two regimens appear to be used interchangeably based on investiga tor preference and 
clinical assessment of the risk of cisplatin toxicity to the patient.   The data supporting the 
information in Table  2 includes patients treated with both cisplatin schedules, but these data do 
not indicate a difference in the incidence of severe OM based on the cisplatin schedule used 
(Sonis, personal communication).  However, and on advice of the Division of Oncology of the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, enrolled patients will be stratified b ased on the cisplatin 
regimen to be used.  
6.2.3.  Rationale for Tumor Follow -up and A nalysis  
Although the mechanism of action and existing nonclinical data (in vitro and in vivo) with 
GC4419 uniformly indicate otherwise, there is  a theoretical potential for GC4419  to protect the 
tumor from the therapeutic effects of concurrent chemoradiation.  Patient candidates for GT -201 
will be informed of this potential risk and the existing data as part of the consent process and 
document.  There has been no suggestion of tumo r protection so far in GT -001 [data not shown].   
Fakhry et.al. have recently published an analysis comparing time to and patterns of progression 
for HPV -positive and HPV -negative patients treated in RTOG 0129 or RTOG 0522 .46   The rate 
of progression was similar in the two groups and is summarized i n Table  8.  
After a median follow up of four years, the maj ority of progression events was  found to have 
occurred in the first  year after protocol therapy, and the vast majority of all progressions 
observed occurred by the end of three years.

Progression within first year post treatment  65% 63% 
Progression within first two years post

Progression within first three years post 
treatment  86% 93% 
This information suggests that tumor control data at two years after protocol treatment may 
provide a strong initial indication that results are consistent with expectations.  As such, patients 
in this Phase 2 trial will be followed for tumor progression and overall survival for two years 
after completing treatment.

    7. SELECTION AND WITHDRAW AL OF SUBJECTS  
Approximately 2 16 total patients from investigational sites  in US and Canada will be enrolled to 
achieve 195 evaluable patients, with 65 evaluable patients p er treatment arm.  Patients 
appropriate for this trial will be identified by the Principal Investigator (or designee) who will 
make a preliminary determination of the patient’s eligibility for the trial in accordance with the 
provisions of the study protoc ol.  Once a patient is enrolled to the study, the Sponsor or designee 
will assign a unique patient identification number that does not contain any Personal Health 
Information that will be used to reference the patient and corresponding data that is collect ed.

Note: Patients who are participating in non -interventional clinical trials (e.g., QOL, 
imaging, observational, follow -up studies, etc.) are eligible, regardless of the timing of 
participation.  
7. Require ment for significantly modified diet (liquids and/or nothing by mouth ) due to 
compromised oral /pharyngeal  function at baseline  
8. Complete reliance on parenteral or gastrointestinal tube -delivered nutrition at baseline  
Note: Patients who have gastrostomy tub es prophylactically placed are eligible.  Patients 
receiving supplemental nutrition through a gastrostomy tube at baseline may be  eligible 
depending on diet.  
9. Malignant tumors other than HNC within the last five years, unless treated definitively  
and with lo w risk of recurrence in the judgment of the treating investigator   
10. Active infectious disease excluding oral candidiasis  
11. Presence of oral mucositis ( WHO Score ≥ Grade 1) at study entry  
12. Known history of HIV or active hepatitis B/C (patients who have been vac cinated for 
hepatitis B and do not have a history of infection are eligible)  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 45  
    13. Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding  
14. Known allergies or intolerance to cisplatin and similar platinum -containing compounds  
15. Requirement for concurrent treatment with n itrates or other drugs that may, in the 
judgment of the treating investigator, create a risk for a precipitous decrease in blood 
pressure  
16. Medical history that includes any condition, or requires the use of concomitant 
medications which, in the investigator ’s judgment, are associated with or create a risk of 
increased carotid sinus sensitivity, symptomatic bradycardia, or syncopal episodes.   
7.3. Rationale for Patient Population  
Eligibility will be limited to patients with squamous cell tumors of the oral cavity  or oropharynx 
in an attempt to keep the evaluation of OM as uniform as possible and to facilitate comparison 
with the Phase 1 data and the assumptions derived from the matched data base described in  
Table  2.  Altho ugh some trials, such as the trials of palifermin for OM in patients with H NC 
cancer, have included other anatomic sites (e.g., laryngeal, hypopharyngeal), exclusion of these 
from the current trial may simplify the evaluation of OM (e.g., by reducing the n eed for 
endoscopy) for the immediate goal of obtaining a clearer assessment of the efficacy of GC4419 
in the proposed indication.  Patients with locally advanced squamous cell cancer of the oral 
cavity or oropharynx remain appropriate candidates for concur rent chemoradiation as standard of 
care, with single -agent cisplatin perhaps the most widely accepted and widely used standard 
regimen.  
Eligibility will include patients scheduled to receive the prescribed IMRT/cisplatin regimen 
either as definitive therap y or post -operatively.  Both groups may be candidates for 
IMRT/cisplatin as standard care and the incidence of severe OM is expected to be similar for 
both groups.  In addition, b oth have been included in the Phase 1 trial, GT -001. 
Patients with unknown pr imary tumor whose IMRT/cisplatin treatment plans conform to study 
requirements will be eligible , as most of these patients are considered likely to have 
oropharyngeal or oral cavity primary tumors.  
7.4. Screen Failures  
A patient is considered to be a screen fai lure if the patient signs the informed consent form but 
withdraws consent or is deemed ineligible before being randomly assigned to a treatment arm.  
The reason why the patient was precluded from the clinical trial  will be collected .  All patients 
who sign the informed consent form for this study , including screening failures , will be listed on 
the Screening , Enrollment , and Discontinuation  Log which is further detailed in  the Regulatory 
Binder . 
7.5. Randomization Failures  
A patient is considered to be a randomi zation failure if the patient signs the informed consent 
form and is randomized to a treatment arm but withdraws consent or is deemed ineligible prior to 
receiving their first dose of IMRT and GC4419/placebo. Basic demographic and disease history 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 46  
    informati on will be collected for randomization failures, as well of the reason the patient was 
precluded from the clinical trial.  All randomization failures will be listed on the Screening, 
Enrollment, and Discontinuation Log which is further detailed in the Regul atory Binder.  
7.6. Subject Withdrawal Criteria  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, a patient ha s the right to withdraw from the study 
at any time for any reason. The investigator may also, at his/her discretion, discontinue a patient 
from participat ing in this study at any time.  Additionally, study treatment may be discontinued 
for any of the following reasons : 
• Adverse Event  
• Medical requirement to administer a contra -indicated  medication  
• Patient non -compliance  
• Discontinuation of the study at the req uest of Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
The primary reason for ceasing treatment with the randomized therapy ( GC4419  or placebo) will 
be cl early documented in  the patient’ s medical record and recorded on the appropriate CRF page.  
Once a patient discontinues, the patient will not be allowed to be retreated.  
If a patient discontinues randomized therapy  as a result of an adverse event (AE) or serious 
adverse even t (SAE), every attempt should be made to keep the patient in the study and continue 
to perform the required study -related follow -up and procedures.  If this is not possible or 
acceptable to the patient or investigator, the patient may be withdrawn from the  study.   
7.7. Study and Site Closure  
Both the sponsor and the investigator reserve the right to terminate the study at any time.  Should 
this be necessary, both parties will arrange discontinuation procedures.  In terminating the study, 
Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  and the investigator will assure that adequate consideration is given to 
the protection of the patients’ interests.  
Upon completion of the study, the monitor will conduct the following activities in conjuncti on 
with the investigator or site staff, as appropriate:  
• Return of all study data to Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  (as applicable)  
• Resolution of all data queries  
• Accountability, reconciliation, and arrangements for all unused study drug  
• Review of site study records for completeness  
• Shipment of laboratory samples (as applicable)  
In addition, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely  
discontinue this study either at a single site or at all sites at any time for reasons including, but 
not limited to, safety or ethical issues or severe non -compliance.  If Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
determines  such action is needed, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  will discuss this with the investigator 
(including the reasons for taking such action) at that time.  When feasible, Galera Therapeutics, 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 47  
    Inc. will provide advance notification to the investigator of the impending action prior to it 
taking effect.  
Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  will promptly inform all other investigators and/o r institutions 
conducting the study if the study is suspended or terminated for safety reasons and will also 
inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or termination of the study and the reason(s) 
for the action.  If required by applicable regula tions, the investigator must inform the 
IRB/IEC /REB  promptly and provide the reason for the suspension or termination.  If the study is 
prematurely discontinued, all study data must be returned to Galera Therape utics, Inc.  
Financial compensation to investigators and/or institutions will be in accordance with the 
agreement established between the investigator and Galera Therapeutics, Inc.

    8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
8.1. Concom itant Medications  
All concomitant therapies (e.g., prescription and over -the-counter medications) taken by patients 
from the date of randomization through  30 days following the last GC4419 /placebo , IMRT or 
cisplatin (i.e. whichever occurs last)  dose will b e collected in the CRF.  Additionally, any 
concomitant therapies if used to treat any serious or related adverse event will be recorded in the 
CRF.   
Note that narcotic medications will be captured separately in a pain medication diary and entered 
into a s pecific segment of the CRF, apart from other concomitant medications.  Narcotic  use will 
only be recorded from the Baseline Visit through the Last Day of IMRT Visit.  
Anti-emetic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factors should be used per ASCO guidelines . 
If a patient withdraws consent for the study or is removed from the study completely (i.e. , the 
patient is no longer participating in any study procedures or follow -up) no further data should be 
collected  after the date of the  patient’s study discontinua tion.  
8.1.1.  Prohibited Medications  
Investigators may prescribe any concomitant medication or supportive therapy deemed necessary 
to provide adequate supportive care including antiemetics, systemic antibiotics, hydration to 
prevent renal damage, topical fluoride  etc., with the following exceptions:  
• Low-level laser treatment for OM  
• Amifostine (Ethyol®)   
• Benzydamine (Difflam®)  
• Cetuximab (Erbitux®) 
• Glutamine applied topically  
• GM-CSF applied topically  
• ‘Magic mouthwashes’ or ‘Miracle mouthwashes’ are permitted, pro vided they do not 
contain:  
o Chlorhexidine  
o Hydrogen peroxide  
o Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) 
o Tetracycline  
o Any other listed disallowed medications  
o Notes:  
o Topical lidocaine preparations are permitted

Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 49  
    o Diphenhydramine (Benadryl®) administered as tablets for by injection is 
permitted; only diphenhydramine liquid formulation is prohibited  
• MuGard™ , Gelc lair®, Episil®, or other barrier devices  
• Caphosol® 
• Nitrates, phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE 5) inhibitors (e.g., sildanefil, tadalafil, or 
similar agents) or other dr ugs that in the judgment of the treating investigator could 
create a risk of a precipitous decrease in blood pressure are prohibited until at least 24 
hours after the last dose of GC4419  
• Pyridostigmine or other drugs that in the judgment of the treating in vestigator could 
create a risk of increased carotid sinus sensitivity, symptomatic br adycardia, or 
syncopal episodes   
• Palifermin (Kepivance®) or other keratinocyte or fibroblast growth factor  
• Povidone -iodine rinses  
• Steroid rinses  
• Sucralfate in suspension  form (use of sucralfate tablets is not proscribed)  
• Other biologic response modifiers – except systemic hematopoietic growth factors for 
the management of anemia or myelosuppression   
• Concurrent approved or investigational anti -cancer therapy (e.g., chemo therapy, 
immunotherapy, targeted therapy, hormone and biologic therapy) other than the 
Protocol regimen  
• Other investigational agents  
All medication restrictions end after post-IMRT OM follow -up is completed  unless otherwise 
noted . 
Patients who receive proh ibited medications prior to completion of post -IMRT OM follow -up 
will not automatically be removed from the study; however, administration of a prohibited 
medication is a significant deviation from the protocol and must be reported to the Medical 
Monitor a s soon as possible and the presiding IRB /IEC /REB  (per institutional guidelines).  The 
decision for study continuation or discontinuation will be made at that time on a case -by-case 
basis and in consideration of the clinical requirement and circumstances.       
A standard oral care regimen is recommended, consisting of aggressive oral hygiene, frequent 
saline rinsing, and the use of daily topical fluoride.  Mouthwashes or rinses containing sodium 
bicarbonate, clotrimazole (Mycelex), nystatin, fluconazole (Di flucan), viscous xylocaine, and/or 
viscous lidocaine are permitted. If a patient uses “Magic Mouthwashes” or “Miracle 
Mouthwashes,” all ingredients must be recorded in the patient’s medical record in order to 
confirm the mouthwashes did not contain the pro hibited ingredients listed above.  
Anti-emetic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factor use are permitted per ASCO 
guidelines.  Following ASCO (and MASCC) guidelines for the prevention and management of 
chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is strongly encouraged.

    8.2. Treatment Compliance  
Compliance with GC4419 /placebo dosing , including administration details (e.g., volume, start, 
stop times, etc.)  should be documented in the source documents  and recorded on the Case Report 
Form (CRF).  
8.3. Randomization and Blinding  
8.3.1.  Treatment Assignment  
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three  study arms through an interactive voice 
randomization system (IVRS) or web -based randomization system.  The system will assign a 
patient a unique randomization number that will remain consistent for the duration of the study.  
See the Pharmacy Binder  for additional information regarding patient randomization and the 
IVRS system.   
8.3.2.  Stratification  
Central randomiz ation will be stratified according to the following criteria:  
• HPV  status at baseline: positive vs. negative  
• Initial chemotherapy schedule: q3 weeks or weekly cisplatin  
8.3.3.  Blinding  
Treatment should remain blinded until the end of the Post -active Phase of the s tudy.  Only in the 
case of an emergency, when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the patient, may the investigator unblind a patient’s treatment 
assignment prior to the end of the Post -active Pha se.  The investigator will, whenever possible, 
discuss options with the Medical Monitor, on -call physician, or appropriate Galera Therapeutics, 
Inc./CRO study personnel before unblinding.  If the blind is broke n for any reason and the 
investigator is unable to contact Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  prior to unblinding, the investigator 
must notify Galera Therapeutics, Inc. /CRO  as soon as possible following the unblinding incident 
without revealing the subject’s study treatment assignment, unless the information is important 
to the safety of patients remaining in the study.  In addition, the investigator will record the date 
and reason for revealing the blinded treatment assignment for that subject in the appropriate 
section of the CRFs.  
If a serious adverse event (SAE; as defined in Section  12.1.2 ) is reported to Galera Therapeutics, 
Inc./CRO, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  staff may unblind the treatment assignment for the 
individual patient.  If an expedited regulatory report to one or more regulato ry agencies is 
required, the report will identify the patient’s treatment assignment.  When applicable, a copy of 
the regulatory report may be sent to investigators in accordance with relevant regulations, Galer a 
Therapeutics, Inc.  policy, or both.

    9. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
9.1. Description of Study Drug  
GC4419  
GC4419 (manganese,dichloro[(4aS,13aS,17aS,21aS) -
1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,12,13,13a,14,15,16,17,17a,18,19,20,21a -eicosahydro -11,7-nitilo -7H-
dibenzo[b,h][1,2,7, 10]tetraazacylcoheptadecine -κN5,κN13,κN18,κN21,κN22] -) is a water 
soluble, highly stable, low molecular weight manganese -containing macrocyclic ligand complex 
whose activity mimics that of naturally occurring SOD enzymes.  
GC4419 is formulated as a clear so lution at two concentrations to support the active arms:  
• Arm A: 30 mg GC4419: 3 mg/mL in 26 mM sodium bicarbonate -buffered 0.9 wt. % 
saline for parenteral administration .   
• Arm B: 90 mg GC4419: 9 mg/mL in 26 mM sodium bicarbonate -buffered 0.9 wt. % 
saline for parenteral administration .   
There are no other excipients.  GC4419 is packaged as an 11 mL ± 0.1mL aliquot in a 10 mL 
amber glass vial with an S-127 4432/50 gray stopper and a 20 mm red flip-off seal.  
Placebo  
• Arm C: 26 mM sodium bicarbonate -buffered 0 .9 wt. % saline for parenteral 
administration . 
There are no other excipients.  Placebo is packaged as a clear solution of 11 mL ± 0.1mL aliquot 
in a 10 mL amber glass vial, with an S-127 4432/50 gray stopper and a 20 mm red flip-off seal.  
9.2. Study Drug Packag ing and Labeling  
GC4419 (either concentration) and placebo will be presented in kits of 35 single -use vials, which 
represent 35 daily doses to be administered IV concurrent with IMRT.  To maintain the blind, 
each concentration of GC4419 , as well as placebo , will be packaged into amber vials and will 
appear generally identical; that is, there  will be no  distinguishing features in or on  the packaging  
that could permit the identification of GC4419 concentration or placebo.   
9.3. GC4419  
GC4419 is packaged as a n 11 mL ± 0.1mL aliquot in a 10 mL amber  glass vial with a S-127 
4432/50 gray stopper and a 20 mm red flip-off seal. Each bottle will be labeled with the 
appropriate language, including the required regulatory text.  
9.4. Placebo  
Placebo is packaged as an 11 mL ± 0.1 mL aliquot in a 10 mL amber glass vial with an S-127 
4432/50 gray stopper and a 20 mm red flip -off seal. Each bottle will be labeled with the 
appropriate language, including the required regulatory text.

 52  
    9.5. Study Drug Storage  
GC4419  and Placebo  
GC4419 solutio ns must be stored at 2°C to 8°C at all times until use. GC4419 solutions must not 
be frozen at any time. Temperature excursions above freezing and up to 25 °C or down to 0.1 °C 
for four hours are accepted; however, Galera Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee m ust be notified 
immediately of the temperature excursion to ensure proper oversight.  
Once prepared, the IV bags containing GC4419/saline mixtures must also be stored at 2°C to 
8°C until use, and must be administered to patients within 24 hours of preparat ion.  GC4419 
dosing solutions must not be frozen at any time.  If freezing of the material is evident, that supply 
must be quarantined per institutional guidelines and Galera Therapeutics, Inc. or its designee 
must be notified immediately.  
9.6. Study Drug Prepa ration  
GC4419  and Placebo  
GC4419 will be provided to the study site in single use, sterile, pyrogen -free vials ready for dose 
preparation. Proper mixing with normal saline is required. Standard aseptic techniques will be 
used to maintain sterility.  
Assign ment of treatment arm will be randomized 1:1:1 with respect to treatment arms A, B and 
C.  GC4419 (either concentration) and placebo will be presented in kits of 35 single -use vials, 
which represent 35 daily doses to be administered IV concurrent with IMRT .   
To prepare daily IV solutions, investigational pharmacists will extract of 10 mL from a single 
vial and add to 250 mL normal saline. Note that there is no extraction of saline (i.e., the infusion 
solution volume will be 250 mL saline + 10mL volume of G C4419/placebo).  No additional 
modifications or adjustments are to be made to the infusion solution.   
Further information and preparation details will be provided in a separate pharmacy manual.   
Note: Investigational staff who prepare infusion solutions cannot be oral evaluators.  
9.7. Administration  
GC4419  and Placebo  
GC4419  or Placebo /saline mixture will be administered intravenously at an infusion rate that 
totals 60 min (± 6 min to account for saline  overfill) for the total dose assigned. Infusions of 
GC4419 /placebo must be administered using an infusion pump (i.e., not by drip rate).  Infusion 
pump models are not specified and may be per institutional preference/standard.  
To facilitate administration  of GC4419 according to the study schedule, a n indwelling venous 
access device may be used, at the discretion o f the treating investigator .  If an indwelling venous 
access device is placed to facilitate administration of GC4419, this fact will be recorded with the 
study data, as will information about the date of placement, type of device, and subsequent 
complications or adverse events related to the use of the device.  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 53  
    IMRT must be initiated as soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419 /placebo  infusion , 
but no later than 60 minutes following the end of the infusion.  
GC4419 /placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily, 
concurrent with each dose of IMRT, to a cumulative r adiation dose of approximately 6 0-72 Gy. 
Table  9 outlines the chemoradiation and GC4419 /placebo  administration schedules.  Please note  
chemothera py is not required to be administered on the study d ays listed in Table  9 as long as it 
follows a weekly or tri -weekly schedule.  
If IMRT is not administered on any given day due to a treatment break or unforeseen 
circumstances, GC4419 /placebo  should not be administered on that day.  Breaks in IMRT will be 
determined by the patient’s treating physician in accordance with standard of care. Patients 
should resume  GC4419 /placebo  administration when IMRT resumes.  On days when planned 
doses of both GC4419 /placebo  and IMRT are not administered (e.g., du e to a holiday site 
closure), GC4419 /placebo  dosing may be extended along with IMRT to make up the missed 
dose(s) to a maximum of 35 doses of GC4419 /placebo .  If a fraction of IMRT is not administer ed 
for any reason after GC4419 /placebo  has been administered, that day’s GC4419 /placebo  will 
count as one of the 35 doses.

1 Intravenous GC4419/placebo is administered by a 60 -minute intravenous infusion ( ±6 min) once a day for the first 
35 days of IMRT (Monday through Friday).  IMRT must be initiated as soon as possible upon completion of 
GC4419/placebo infusion, but no later than 60 minutes post GC4419/placebo infusion.  On Day 1 /Baseline , 
chemotherapy prehy dration and infusion should be administered after GC4419/placebo infusion and IMRT , if 
possible . If IMRT is not received on any given day due to a treatment break or unforeseen circumstances, 
GC4419/placebo should not be administered on that day. Patients should resume GC4419/placebo administration 
when IMRT resumes. If a patient is scheduled to receive IMRT on a weekend day (e.g., to make -up for a holiday 
site closure), the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor for a discussion prior to IMRT admi nistration . 
2 Cisplatin monotherapy should be administered in a standard q3 week s regimen (80 -100 mg/m2) or weekly regimen 
(30-40 mg/m2). Anti -emetic prophylaxis and hematopoietic growth factor use should be administered per ASCO 
guidelines.  If institutio nal guidelines permit, cisplatin may be administered prior to  or after  the first day of IMRT.  
On days in which chemotherapy and GC4419/placebo are administered, the administration sequence should be 
GC4419/placebo, IMRT, prehydration, and then cisplatin , if possible.  Patients treated with induction 
chemotherapy prior to concomitant chemoradiation are not eligible for this study.  
3 Eligible patients will be scheduled to receive a continuous course IMRT delivered in single daily fractions of 2.0 
to 2.2 Gy, f ive days per week (Monday through Friday), with a cumulative radiation dose between 60 Gy and 72 
Gy. Planned radiation treatment fields must include at least two oral sites (buccal mucosa, floor of mouth, tongue, 
soft palate) that are each planned to recei ve > 50 Gy.  
4 The 7th dose of cisplatin will only be administered if the patient is on the 7 -dose weekly cisplatin schedule 
(weekly cisplatin schedule may be 6 or 7 doses, depending on investigator choice) . 
9.8. Study Drug Accountability  
GC4419 and Placebo  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability of all used and unused 
GC4419 /placebo.  This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of 
GC4419 /placebo (quantity and condition), patient dispensing records, and quantity of 
GC4419 /placebo  returned or destroyed.  Dispensing records will document quantities received 
from Gale ra Therapeutics, Inc.  and quantities dispensed to patients, including container number 
or lot number, date dispensed, patient identifier number, patient initials, and the initials of the 
person dispensing the medication.  Any GC4419 /placebo that is prepared but not used must also 
be recorded in the dispensing records.  
All GC4419 /placebo supplies and associated documentation will be reviewed a nd verified by the 
study monitor.  All GC4419 /placebo and used containers are to be retained by the site until 
notified by the study monitor, who will instruct the site in the disposal and/or destru ction of all 
used GC4419 /placebo supplies.  Copies of all forms, documenting drug receipt at the study site , 
drug transportation to satellite sites,  and drug return  to Galera Therapeutics, Inc. , together with 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 55  
    drug accountability records, will be retained according to the regulations governing record 
retention.  
The investigator will not allow GC4419 /placebo  to be given to any patient not included in the 
study or any unauthorized person.  
9.9. Study Drug Handling and Disposal  
GC4419  and Placebo  
After completion of the study, all unused study drug will be inventoried and if possible, 
destroyed locally at the site.  GC4419 /placebo should not be returned directly to Galera 
Therapeutics, Inc.  unless specifically requested by Galera Therapeutics, Inc.   The study monitor 
will instruct the site in the disposal and/or destruction of all used and unused GC4419 /placebo  
supplies.  Destruction of any GC4419 /placebo s hould be documented appropriately.

    10. TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Dose Delays and Dose Modifications for Toxicity  
The following toxicities require a 25% dose reduction in GC4419 /placebo:  
• Grade 3 flushing  
• Grade  2 or greater hypotension within two hours after the start of GC4419/PBO 
infusion  
• Grade 3 or 4 infusion reaction with GC4419  
• Grade 4 vomiting despite optimal antiemetic therapy per current ASCO and MASCC 
guidelines   
Two dose reduction s for toxicity will be  permitted per patien t. After the first event, the patient 
will be re -challenged at 75% of the original dose (7.5 mL  GC4419/placebo in 250 mL normal 
saline ). After the second event, the patient will be re -challenged at 50% of the original dose (5.0 
mL GC44 19/placebo in 250 mL normal saline ). Patients who are unable  to tolerate 
GC4419/placebo infusions following two dose reduction s must be discontinued from the study 
treatment b ut may continue with cisplatin/IMRT at the discretion of the treating investigato r. 
For other toxicities (including those attributable to cisplatin and IMRT), management will be per 
institutional and ASCO guidelines and investigator judgment.  
Galera strongly recommends that treatment modifications  for cisplatin related toxicities shoul d 
be managed by reducing the dose and/or altering the schedule of cisplatin administration.  Such 
modifications may be made per the judgment of the treating investigator.  However, substitution 
of other systemic agents (e.g., carboplatin  with or without  paclitaxel, cetuximab , etc. ) is not 
consistent with the protocol and should not be done without prior consultation with the Galera 
Medical Monitor  to determine the patient’s eligibility for continuing  protocol treatment.  
10.2. Supportive Care Guidelines  
Necessary supportive measures for optimal medical care will be given throughout the study.  
Supportive care medications may be administered at the investigator's discretion and recorded in 
the CRF (including administration of prophylactic antiemetic medication if de emed appropriate 
by the investigator).  However, medications are subject to the exclusions listed in Section 8.1.1 . 
10.2.1.  Supportive care for chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV)  
Medication to prevent or man age chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) should 
follow recent guidelines from ASCO and MASCC (Appendix 7, Section 25).  It should be noted 
that single -agent IV cisplatin is considered a “high risk” tre atment for the purposes of these 
guidelines.  Therefore, the use not only of a 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, but 
also an NK 1 antagonist (aprepitant or fosaprepitant) is recommended.  
Supportive care for CINV should be optimized, per ASCO and MASCC guidelines, before 
GC4419 dose is reduced for nausea and vomiting.

    11. ASSESSMENT S 
The study procedures to be conducted for each patient enrolled in the study are described in the 
text that follows and presented in Section 19. 
Any deviation from protocol procedures should be explained in the source documents.  The 
sponsor (or designee) and the site’s institutional review board (IRB – as required by the IRB’s 
policies and procedures) should be notified as soon as possible of any substantial deviations 
potentially affecting patient safety, study drug administration or the assessment of safety, 
efficacy and tolerability parameters.  
11.1. Safety  Assessments  
Safety will be assessed on the basis of treatment -emergent AEs, physical examination findings, 
clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements, and vital sign measurements.  
11.1.1.  Clinical Assessments  
The following clinical assessments are defined when referenced in the schedule of events for this 
study:  
• 12-Lead ECG: ventricular rate, P -R interval, QRS interval, QT interval, and QTc  
• Vital signs: measured following two minutes of rest in the sitting position – 
temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate and respiration rate  
• Weight and Height : measured in kilograms (kg) and centimeters (cm), respectively  
• Performance Status: ECOG (see Section 22 for conversion criteria for Karnofsky to 
ECOG)  
11.1.2.  Laboratory Assessments  
All protocol required clinical labora tory assessments should be performed at the central 
laboratory.     
The investigator must assess all abnormal clinical laboratory results for clinical significance in a 
timely fashion. A notation of clinically significant (CS) or non -clinically significant  (NCS) with 
initials and date will be documented on the respective laboratory report next to any abnormal 
value.  Information on laboratory AE reporting can be found in Section 12.  
The following laboratory asses sments are defined when referenced in the schedule of events for 
this study:  
• Hematology Profile:  hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell 
count with differential, and platelet count.  Differential to include total neutrophils, 
lympho cytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils . 
• Serum Chemistry Profile:  glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, 
albumin, total protein, direct bilirubin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT 
(SGPT), AST (SGOT), chloride, phosphate, bica rbonate . 
• Serum Pregnancy Test:  required for all females of childbearing potential.  Lack of 
childbearing potential must be noted in the source documents, if applicable.

    11.2. Oral Mucositis Assessments  
OM assessments will be completed at the Screening Visit (wi thin 28 days of IMRT start), 
Baseline Visit, and twice weekly (no less than 48 hours apart) within each five-day IMRT 
treatment period. The extent of patients’ OM will be assessed by a trained evaluator and scored 
using the WHO OM toxicity grading scale.  All patients must have an oral assessment on the last 
day of IMRT treatment.  If a patient withdraws for any reason prior to the end of IMRT, a 
complete oral assessment should be done on that day.  
If a patient has a WHO score ≥ 2 at the completion of IMRT , the patient will be evaluated at 
weekly (± 2 day s) intervals until the WHO score returns to ≤ 1 or until the Week 8 Post-IMRT 
Follow -up Visit, whichever comes first.   Post-IMRT Follow -up Visit should occur at intervals of 
7 ± 2 calendar  days from the las t day of IMRT (i.e., 7, 14, 21 days, etc.) and not 7 days from the 
previous Post -IMRT OM Visit.  
Study site personnel will be provided with specific training and instructions regarding OM 
assessment performance, grading, and documentation.  Designated train ed study staff (oral 
evaluators) will conduct all assessments using a standardized and consistent method.  To reduce 
inter-observer variability, the fewest possible number of evaluators should be involved in the 
assessments of each patient.  The oral evalu ators will use a Sponsor -provided headlamp for all 
oral assessments conducted for this study.   
The WHO scale will be the measure for assessing OM.  The assessment of the impact of OM on 
a patient’s ability to eat is critical for accurate scoring of the WH O scale.  Therefore, 
standardization of the assessment is very important.  In order to reduce variability in assessing 
food intake, the definitions for solids, liquids, and nothing by mouth are provided here:  
• Solid foods are defined as foods that need to b e chewed.  Examples include meat, 
grains and vegetables.  
• Liquids are defined as foods that take the shape of their container.  Examples include 
fruit juices, soups, pureed foods, mashed potatoes, cooked cereals (oatmeal), baby 
food, Jell O®, pudding, and i ce cream.  
• Nothing by mouth is defined as no eating or drinking, except enough liquid to allow 
for taking medications.  
The WHO scoring scale is appended  in Section 20.  
11.3. Radiation Therapy Quality Assurance  
Quality assurance for IMRT will be conducted by a prospective review of the overall treatment 
plan, at the time of patient screening, by a radiation oncologist who is not an investigator on the 
trial.  In addition to IMRT treatment , dosimetry and dose v olume histo grams will be collected 
after simulation.  Confirmation of appropriate planned doses to oral cavity and oropharynx sub -
sites for eligibility will be confirmed.  Galera plans to collect the following information from all 
investigators:  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 59  
    • Institutional policy /radiation oncologists plan  regarding the margins used to 
determine Gross Tumor Volumes, (G TV), Clinical Target Volumes  (CTV)  and 
Planning Target Volumes  (PTV)  
• What elective volumes are to  be treated  
• What  nodal levels are to be treated  
This information will  be available for summary and retrospective analysis at the end of the study.  
11.4. Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)  
11.4.1.  Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ)  
Patients will be required to personally complete the OMDQ. The OMDQ will be contained in the 
patient dia ry and will be completed daily, including weekend days, during the IMRT treatment 
period.  If a patient is required to continue weekly visits after the last day of IMRT based on 
his/her WHO score, the OMDQ will be completed at the time of those visits. As any 
manipulation of the patient’s mouth may influence PRO responses, the OMDQ must be 
completed prior to the oral assessment.  
The mouth and throat soreness (MTS) question of the OMDQ contains five response categories 
from 0 (no soreness) to 4 (extreme sore ness). In a study conducted by Stiff et al. (2006), the 
OMDQ MTS question two score was found to be highly correlated with the WHO Scale and 
patients reported the onset, peak and resolution of oral pain one to three  days earlier than 
physicians using the c linical assessment.  
The OMDQ has been used in the Phase 1 trial, GT -001, with excellent patient compliance.  The 
OMDQ was used in past trials in OM, notably the registration trial of palifermin .44  In that trial , 
there was high patient compliance (>80%), and good test -retest and internal consistency 
reliability.  Changes in MTS -related scores —particularly for question two (“During the last 24 
hours, how much mouth and throat soreness did you have?”) paralleled ch anges in the WHO OM 
score and were higher in patients with severe (Grade 3 -4) OM than for patients with Grade 1 -2 
OM.  Changes in MTS -related scores on the OMDQ preceded changes in the WHO scoring by 
one to two  days, perhaps reflecting the timing of visits  to assess and record the WHO score.  
It may be further noted that a weekly counterpart to the OMDQ —the OMWQ —has been 
reported to be more responsive to early changes in symptoms than less symptom -focused 
instruments such as the FACT -HN and the FHNSI .45 
The OMDQ can be found in Appendix 3, Section 21.  Results from the OMDQ are an 
exploratory endpoint of this study.  
11.5. Health and Economic Outcomes  
Several health and economic outcomes, including the incidence and duration of opioid use, 
insertion of and need for use of gastrostomy tube feedings, use and complications of indwelling 
venous access catheters , and unplanned office visits, emergency room visits, or hospitalizations, 
will be assessed  throughout the study.    
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 60  
    11.5.1.  Pain Medication Diary  
Questions regarding analgesic use will be contained in the patient pain medication diary, which 
will be completed daily, including weekend days, during the IMRT treatment period  (Baseline 
Visit  through Last Day of IMRT Visit) . In addition, general concomitant medications will be 
recorded by study personnel on weekdays during IMRT treatment. To measure opiate analgesic 
use for oral pain, patients will be required to record in the pain medication diary each time any 
opiate analgesics are administered (either by self or investigational staff).        
Unaided written completion of the pain medication diary by the patient should always be 
encouraged and should be considered the standard method of data  collection for the study.  
However, diary responses should be recorded using one or more of the methods described below 
if the patient is unable to fully complete the diary him/herself : 
1. From the patient in the form of a verbal response recorded in the dia ry with the assistance 
of: 
a. A spouse, family member, or other personal caretaker  
b. Study coordinator, study nurse, or investigator  
2. From the patient’s medical record if:  
a. The patient is hospitalized, or otherwise incapacitated  
b. The patient supplies incomplete in formation  
Adequate documentation (i.e. emergency room or inpatient hospitalization reports, 
documentation of a prescription on file, etc. ) must be on file in the patient’s medical record and 
available for review by the site monitor.  
11.6. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Me asurements  
Sparse PK sampling will be sought from all patients for GC4419 and its two metabolites, 
GC4520 and GC4570.   
Plasma samples for GC4419  PK measurements will be collected in two cycles : Study Days 1 and 
2, and Study Days 22 and 23 .  On Study Days 1 and 22, four samples will be drawn as follows:  
1. The first sample will be drawn prior to GC4419  administration . 
2. The second sample wi ll be drawn within 10 minutes after  the end of GC4419 infusion.  
3. The third sample wi ll be drawn within 10 minutes after  the e nd of IMRT.  
4. The fourth and final sample will be drawn between 60 and 180 min utes after the end of 
GC4419 infusion.   If cisplatin is being administered on the same day as PK sampling, it is 
preferred that the PK sample be drawn prior to cisplatin administr ation, but not required.   
On Study Days 2 and 23 only one PK sample will be drawn.  This sample should be drawn 
approximately 24 hours after the previous day’s GC4419 infusion but prior to the GC4419 
infusion on Days 2 and 23.  
Table  10 below summarizes  the PK sample collection  time points . Note that this schedule may 
be adjusted to accommodate mid/late -week study starts and holidays. Adjustments in the PK 
schedule must be approved by Galera, and will not be considere d a protocol deviation by the

 61  
    Sponsor if pre -approved. Time of actual blood draws for PK assessment must be recorded in the 
source notes.  Plasma PK samples will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis and 
interp retation.  Further details on PK sample  collection, processing, and shipping are provided in 
a separate manual.  Volumes  and start/stop times for administration  of IV fluids will be collected 
on PK sampling days.

2If cisplatin is being administered  on this day , it is preferred that  the PK sample be drawn prior to cisplatin 
administration , but not required .  
11.7. Biological Surrogate Markers of Mucositis  
Preliminary data obtained during the ongoing Phas e 1 study provide preliminary evidence of 
GC4419’s   biological activity.  Consequently, biological surrogate markers of mucositis will be 
assessed in all patients enrolled in the study. Correlation between levels of circulating cytokines 
and proteins and clinical endpoints will be assessed by analysis of blood samples collected for all 
patients during the active phase of the study. Refer to Appendix 1, Section 19 for the schedule of 
biomarker assessments for each  treatment schedule.  For patients who consent separately, RNA 
samples for the assessment of gene expression patterns prior to receiving the first dose of 
GC4419 and upon completion of GC4419 doses  will be collected during screening  and on the 
last day of IMRT. Additional details regarding the processing and handling of biomarker samples 
will be provided in a separate manual.  
Whenever possible, blood draws for cytokine analysis should be conducted at OM Visit 2 for  
each protocol -specified week. H owever, if blood draws must be taken on another day within a 
given week, it will not be considered a protocol deviation . 
11.8. Tumor Status Assessment  
11.8.1.  Clinical Tumor Assessment  
The patient’s tumor status will be assessed clinically at the following time  points:  
• Last day of  IMRT  
• Every 3 months , ± 30 days , throughout the 1st year post -IMRT (Month s 3, 6, 9, and 12 ) 
• Every 4 months , ± 30 days , throughout the 2nd year post -IMRT (Month s 16, 20, and  24) 
The following t umor status information will be collected at each of the  above t ime points:  
• Survival  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 62  
    • Disease progression  
• Development of second primary tumors  
• Additional malignancies  
If disease progression is suspected at any of the above visits, a laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror 
and/or fiberoptic and/or direct  procedure), should be cond ucted. If disease progression is not 
suspected, a neck and oral exam is sufficient.  
11.8.2.  Tumor Imaging  
11.8.2.1.  Pre-Treatment Tumor Imaging  
Radiographic tumor imaging must occur within 60 days prior to the first day of IMRT 
(Baseline). One of the following imaging combi nations is recommended:  
• CT scan of the neck with contrast plus chest CT with or without contrast  
• MRI scan of the neck with contrast plus chest CT with or without contrast  
• CT scan of the neck with contrast plus PET/CT of the neck and chest with or without 
contrast  
• MRI scan of the neck with contrast plus PET/CT of the neck and chest with or 
without contrast  
If the patient has no evidence of disease at Baseline, it should be clearly indicated . 
11.8.2.2.  Post-Treatment Tumor Imaging  
Radiographic imaging must be pe rformed  at Months 12 and 24  Post-IMRT  for all patients . 
Patients treated definitively (as opposed to post -operatively) will also undergo imaging at Month 
3 Post -IMRT to assess tumor response/clearance to the degree possible.  
Radiographic imaging is highly recomme nded at any Post -IMRT follow -up visit at which disease 
progression is suspected by the trea ting physician. If radiographic imaging is performed,  both 
local/ regional recurrence and di stant metastases should be evaluated . 
When possible, t he same imaging tech nique (i.e., CAT, PET, or MRI) that was used for pre -
treatment tumor imaging at the time of staging  should be used for post -treatment tumor imaging .  
11.9. Xerostomia and Trismus Assessments  
To assess trismus, the maximum opening of the mouth that a patient can achieve will be assessed 
by measuring the distance in millimeters between the incisal edges of the mandibular and 
maxillary incisors at midline using a Sponsor -provided ruler.  
To assess xerostomia, patients will mark their response on a 100  mm visual anal og scale (VAS 
See Section 24) anchored on the left with negative responses (very dry; extremely 
uncomfortable; very difficult) and on the right with positive responses (not dry; comfortable; 
easy).  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 63  
    The assessmen ts for trismus and xerostomia will be performed and recorded at Baseline and at 
Months 3, 6, 9, 12 , 16, 20, and 24  Post-IMRT.  
11.10.  Schedule of Time and Events  
A schedule of study assessments table is located in Appendix 1, Section 19.  Minor changes to 
the assessment schedule may be made to accommodate holidays, administrative closures, etc., 
which if necessary, are not considered as significant deviations by the Sponsor.  Sites sh ould 
contact the Sponsor (or it s repre sentative)  prospectively to address rescheduling protocol 
assessments and data handling.  
11.11.  Screening Phase  
The following screening observations and procedures will be completed within 28 days of IMRT 
and GC4419 start:

    safety tests (chemistry and hematology profiles) do not need to be 
conducted on the last day of IMRT or at the early termination visit.  If 
safety labs have not been drawn during the current study week at the  
time of the early termination visit or on the last day of IMRT, then 
safety labs should be drawn on that day.  Safety labs only need to be 
drawn once per study week  after Week 1.

11.12.11.  Post-IMRT Weeks 1 through 8  
If a patient has a WHO score ≥ 2 at the completion of IMRT, the patient will be evaluated at 
weekly (± 2 days) intervals until the WHO score returns to ≤ 1 or until the Week 8 Post -IMRT 
Follow -up Visit, whichever comes first.  Post -IMRT Follow -up Visit should occur at intervals of 
7 ± 2 calendar days from the last day of IMRT (i.e., 7, 14, 21 days, etc.) and not 7 days from the 
previous Post -IMRT Visit.   At each visit, the following should be compl eted: 
• Administer the OMDQ  
• Conduct OM assessment (OMDQ must be completed prior to the OM assessment) 
and record the severity using the WHO score  
• Record adverse events and concomitant medications through 30 days following the 
last dose of IMRT, cisplatin, o r GC4419/placebo (i.e., whichever occurs last)  
11.13.  Post-Active Phase  
All patients will be followed for two years P ost-IMRT. Patients will be seen every 3 months 
throughout the first year Post -IMRT  (Months 3, 6, 9, and 12)  and every 4 months throughout the 
second year Post -IMRT  (Months 16, 20, and 24) , ± 30 days  for each visit. At each of these visits 
the patient should be seen by a Radiation Oncologist, Medical Oncologist, ENT, or  Head & Neck 
Surgeon and the following assessments should be conducted:  
• Clinical tumor assessment (See Section 11.8.1 ) 
• Xerostomia and Tri smus assessments (See Section 11.9)    
Radiographic imaging must be performed at Months 12  and 24 Post -IMRT  for all patients . 
Patients treated definitively (as opposed to post -operatively) will also undergo imaging at Month 
3 Post -IMRT to assess tumor response/clearance to the degree possible.  
As indicated in Section 11.8.2.2 , radiographic imaging is highly recommended if disease 
progression is suspected by the trea ting physician at any of the above time points . If radiographic 
imaging is performed,  both local/ regional recurrence and di stant metastases should be evaluated . 
Biopsy of any lesion(s) suspicious for tumor recurrence is also recommended . 
When possible, t he same imaging technique (i.e., CAT, PET, or MRI) that was used for pre -
treatment tumor imaging at the time of staging  should be used for post -treatment tumor ima ging.

    12. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE as provided in this protocol.  Throughout the study, AEs will be 
recorded in t he source documents and on the appropriate pages of the CRF regardless of whether 
the AEs are considered related to GC4419 /placebo .  To avoid confusion, the AE should be 
recorded in  standard medical terminology.  
12.1. Definitions  
The following definitions of ter ms are guided by the International Conference on Harmonization 
and the US Code of Federal Regulations and are included here verbatim.   
12.1.1.  Adverse Event (AE)  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with t he use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) 
product.  
Examples of an AE include:  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition/indication under 
study.   
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity (grade) of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product administration even 
though they may have been present pri or to the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae associated with a suspected interaction of the 
investigational product with a concomitant medication.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae associated with a suspected overdose of either 
investigational product or a concurrent medication.  
12.1.2.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death,  
• Is life -threatening  – NOTE: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of ‘serious’ 
refers to any adverse drug experience [adverse event] that places the patient or 
subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as 
it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, migh t have caused death.  [emphasis added]  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 73  
    • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  – NOTE :  In 
general, hospitalization signifies that the patient or subject has been detained 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for 
observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s 
office or outpatient  setting.  Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs.  
If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfi lls any other serious criteria, the 
event is serious.  When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was 
necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  Hospitalization for elective 
treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen fro m baseline is not 
considered an AE.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  – NOTE: The term disability 
means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions . 
OR 
• Is a congenital abnormality/birth defect.  
12.2. Adverse Event Reporting Requirements  
12.2.1.  Serious Adverse Events  
All events meeting the criteria for Serious Adverse Events (see Section 12.1.2 ) must be reported 
by investigational sites within 24 -hours  of becoming aware of the event .  In order to determine 
the sponsor’s timeline for notifying regulatory a uthorities and investigators  per Federal 
Regulations, an  event term , serious criteria,  and causality is required at the time of the i nitial 
report.  Specific SAE reporting instructions are provided in a separate manual.  
The i nvestigator is responsible for notifying the IRB/IEC /REB  in writing of serious events as 
soon as is practical in accordance with the policy of the IRB/IEC /REB . 
12.2.2.  All Adverse Events (AEs) Regardless of Seriousness  
Any adverse medical condition or laboratory a bnormality with an onset date before the date of 
randomization is considered to be pre -existing in nature , and part of a patient’s  medical history.  
Adverse medical conditions that begin on or after date of rand omization will be considered an  
adverse event , including SAEs, and followed for 30 days after the last dose of IMRT, cisplatin, 
or GC4419/placebo  (i.e., whichever occurs last) , hereafter referred to as the “30 Day Follow -up 
Period” .  Similarly, new events will be reported as AEs/SAEs if the start dat e is within 30 Day 
Follow -up Period .  Increas es in toxicity grade  of pre-existing condition s that occur on or after the 
date of randomization are  also considered an adverse event.  
All adverse events must be recorded in the patient’s source documents and on  the CRF 
regardless of frequency, severity (grade) or assessed relationship to randomized therapy.  
12.2.3.  Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal Assessments as AEs 
and SAEs  
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal asses sments that are 
associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more severe than 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 74  
    expected for the patient’s condition, or that are present or detected at the  time of randomization  
and do not worsen, will not be reported as A Es or SAEs.   
Laboratory abnormalities should only be recorded in the A dverse Event section of the CRF  if at 
least one of the following criteria is met:  
• Meets the criteria of an SAE  
• Resulted in a dose reduction and/or delay  in the administration of GC4419/ placebo, 
IMRT, and/or cisplatin  
• Treatment is initiated for the abnormality  
• Investigational product was discontinued  
• Grade 3 or Grade 4 per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Event Version 4.0 3 (NCI CTCAE v4.0 3) 
All other abno rmal laboratory findings will be captured via laboratory CRF pages and noted in 
shift tables.  
Abnormal assessments (e.g., ECGs) that are judged by the investigator as clinically significant  
will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definitions as de fined in Section 12.1.   
12.2.4.  Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
SAEs  
Oral mucositis  and xerostomia will not be reported as AE s as they are captured as study 
endpoint s in the CRF .  Progressive disease found by scan or on clinical evaluation should be 
captured on the applicable lesion CRF pages and not as an AE.  
12.2.5.  Grading of Adverse Events  
The severity of adverse events will be designated as mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, or 
fatal per NCI CTCAE version 4.03. If not specifically addressed in NCI CTCAE version 4.03, 
use Table  11 below : 
Table  11: Adverse Event Severity  
Grade  Criteria1 
Mild – Grad e 1 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated  
Moderate – Grade 2  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental ADL2 
Severe – Grade 3  Severe or medica lly significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization 
indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL3 
Life Threatening – Grade  4 Life-threatening consequences;  urgent intervention indicated  
Death – Grade 5  Death related to adverse event  
1 A Semi -colon indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade.  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 75  
    2 Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
3 Self-care ADL refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking 
medications, and not bedridden.  
12.3. Relationship to Study Drug  
All AEs will be categorized by the investigator with respect to their relationship to 
GC4419 /placebo . The relationship between GC4419 /placebo  and the AE may be considered 
related, possibly related, or unrelated. The criteria for each category are listed below:  
• Related: It is likely that GC4419 /placebo  caused or contributed to the cause of the 
adverse event or laboratory abnormality, whe n the temporal sequence from the time 
of GC4419 /placebo  administration, the known consequences of the patient’s 
clinical/state condition or study procedures, the effects of discontinuing or 
reintroducing GC4419 /placebo  on the adverse event, and other medic ally relevant 
factors are considered.   
• Possibly Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event or 
laboratory abnormality was caused by GC4419 /placebo , when the temporal sequence 
from the time of GC4419 /placebo  administration, the known consequences of the 
patient’s clinical state/condition or study procedures, and other medically relevant 
factors are considered.   
• Unrelated: The investigator has a high level of certainty that the patient’s clinical 
state/condition, study procedures, or o ther medically relevant factors other than 
treatment with GC4419 /placebo  caused the adverse event or laboratory abnormality.  
This relationship category should only be used when a clear precipitating cause exists 
and it is not reasonably possible that the event is caused by treatment with 
GC4419 /placebo . 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“possibly related” the event will be considered to be related to the investigational product for the 
purposes of ex pedited regulatory reporting.  
12.4. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each patient 
and provide further information on the patient’s condition . The investigator will ensure that 
follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care  
professionals.  
Non-serious AEs that have not resolved by the end of the 30 Day Follow -up Period  will be 
considered ongoing, and marked as such in the CRF .  All SAE s will be followed until they 
resolve  or a new baseline is established , at which point the a ppropriate CRF page(s) or SAE 
Report F orm(s) will be updated.   
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 76  
    Routine collection of AEs will stop at the end of the 30 Day Follow -up Period ; however, 
collection of clinical data will continue on AEs of interest or as clinical circumstances warrant 
that e xceed the 30 Day Follow -up Period , per below and described in other sections of the 
Protocol:  
• Oral Mucositis: up to 8 weeks post last IMRT dose (Section 11.12.11 ) 
• Xerostomia and Trismus: through 12 months post la st IMRT  dose (Section 11.9) 
• Medical  events, which in the opinion of the investigator, serious and are believed to 
be a result of study participation to warrant notifying the sponsor (Sections 12.5 and 
12.6).  In these circumstances, the in vestigator should contact the Galera Medical 
Monitor (or designee) directly to discuss the case, and how it should be reported.  
As reasonably  requested by Galera Therapeutics, Inc. , the investigator will perform or arrange 
for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations to elucidate as fully as 
possible the nature and/or causality of  the AE or SAE.  If a patient dies during participation in 
the study or during a recognized follow -up period, Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  will be provided 
with a copy of any post -mortem findings, including histop athology.  
12.5. Post-Study Reporting Requirements  
Although such information may not be routinely sought or collected by Galera Therapeutics, 
Inc., serious adverse events that occur after the patient has completed a c linical study may be 
reported.  Such cases will be evaluated for expedited reporting.  
12.6. Pregnancy  
The risks of treatment with GC4419  during pregnancy have not been evaluated.  Male subjec ts 
and female  subjects of childbearing  potential  who engage in sexual intercourse should  use a 
barrier method of contraception throughout the study and for 30 days  following the last dose of 
GC4419/placebo . 
12.6.1.  Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
As permitted by IRB/EC/REB policies, a ny pregnancy that occurs from the first dose of 
GC4419/placebo  up to 30 days after last dose should  be reported using the appropriate form  
within 2 weeks of learning of the patient’s pregnancy . The patient will be followed througho ut 
the course of the pregnancy. Generally, follow -up will be no longer than six to eight  weeks 
followin g the estimated delivery date. Any premature termination of the pregnancy should  be 
reported.  If a pregnancy is identified outside the 30 days after last  dose, the investigator may 
report using clinical judgment.  
12.6.2.  Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs in a Female Partner of a Male Patient  
The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a male 
study patient who becom es pregnant while participating in this study.  The investigator will 
record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
within 2 weeks of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  The partner will also be followed to 
determine the outcome of the pregnancy.  Information on the status of the mother and child will 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.

 77  
    be forwarded to Galera Therapeutics, Inc.   Generally, follow -up w ill be no longer than six to 
eight  weeks following the estimated delivery date.  Any premature termination of the pregnancy 
will be reported.  If a pregnancy is identified outside the 30 days after last dose, the investigator 
may report using clinical judgm ent. 
12.7. Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs must be recorded on the appropriate CRF regardless of the severity or relationship to 
GC4419 /placebo . All AEs that meet the seriousness criteria should also be recorded on the SAE 
Report Form. All SAEs must be reported  to the sponsor or delegated organization within the 
timeline stated in Section 12.2. 
The recording of AEs will be based on data obtained from the following sources:  
• Medical and surgical history  
• Physical examinat ions including vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory test results  
• Patient verbal reports to the investigational staff and documented in the medical chart  
• Patient diary  
All clinical events, including both observed (such as any reaction at sites of application) a nd 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded. The need to capture this 
information is not dependent upon whether the clinical event is associated with GC4419 /placebo  
use. AEs resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurr ent medications or symptomatic 
progression of disease states are also to be recorded.  
The information to be recorded for AEs will include:  
• The specific type of event i n standard medical terminology – diagnosis if known, is 
preferred over symptoms  
• Duration of the clinical event (start and stop dates)  
• Severity (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) of the clinical event  
• Seriousness (SAE) criteria, if applicable  
• Relationship of the AE to GC4419 /placebo  as defined in Section 12.3  
• Management of GC4419 /placebo  administration and other action taken to alleviate 
the clinical events  
• Clinical outcome of the AE  
If an adverse event changes in grade within the date of randomization through the 30 Day 
Reporting Period, the event should be re corded as a new AE.  
12.8. Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events  
Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  will have final determination of reportability  and is responsible for 
notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of certai n events.  The investigator will report all 
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 78  
    SAEs that occur at his/her site to the IRB per the site’s IRB regulations. AEs will be reported to 
regulatory authorities in compliance with 21 CFR 312.32, local and regional law and established 
guidance by the S ponsor or its designee. The format of the reports will be dictated by the local 
and regional requirements.  
Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug -related events (7/15 Day 
Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical trial.  Each site is responsible for notifying its 
IRB/IEC/REB  of these additional SAEs in accordance with local or central IRB/IEC /REB  
procedures.  Copies of each report will be kept in the investigator’s files and adequate 
documentation will be provided to Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  including documentation that the 
IRB/IEC /REB  was notified of each safety report.

    13. STATISTICS  
13.1. General Considerations  
A separate Statistical Analysis Plan will provide technical details of the statistical analyses to be 
performed, in addition to the specifications in this protocol.  In the event of discrepancies 
between the protocol and the Statistical Analysis Plan, the latter will control the analyses 
performed.  
All statistical analyses will be conducted with the SAS® software package version 9.2 or higher.  
13.1.1.  Randomization and Stratification  
Eligible patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to the three treatment arms.  Randomization  will be 
stratified by:  
1. Tumor human -papilloma virus (HPV) status .  It is now accepted that tumor HPV status is 
a strong independent prognostic factor for survival of patients with or opharyngeal 
cancer,45 and that HPV -positive disease is fundamentally different from HPV -negati ve 
disease.  HPV -positive oropharyngeal cancer tends to present with early T stage and 
advanced N stage.  Whether the risk of severe OM is different for patients with HPV -
positive disease compared with those with HPV -negative disease has not been 
establish ed; review of the data supporting the information in Table  2 suggests that the 
risks are similar for the two groups (Sonis, personal communication).  However, 
stratification by tumor HPV status is common in trials t hat are not limited to HPV -
positive disease but include patients with oropharyngeal cancer.   
2. Assigned cisplatin schedule ( q3 week s or weekly). Historical data supporting also do not 
suggest differences in risk of OM based on the cisplatin schedule ( q3 week s or weekly) .  
However, based on correspondence with the Food and Drug Administration, patients will 
be stratified by cisplatin schedule in this study.  
It may be noted that the historical data supporting Table  2 also do not suggest a difference in OM 
risk associated with , T stage (although this factor may be co -distributed with HPV status) (Sonis, 
personal communication).  Similarly, whether smoking status affects the risk of OM is not 
certain.  In GT -201, informati on about smoking (current/past/never, pack -years) will be collected 
and its association with OM assessed in the final data analysis.  However, stratification based on 
T stage, smoking status, or factors other than tumor HPV status  and cisplatin schedule  is not 
planned.  
13.2. Sample Size  
Approximately 216 patients will be enrolled to ensure that  65 patients per arm receive study drug 
and complete their IMRT course , with an assumed proportion of early discontinuations of 10%.    
The primary objective of the study will test the following hypothesis : separately for each active 
arm:  
• H0: the distribution of duration of severe OM in the active arm = the distribution of 
duration of severe OM in the placebo arm  
Clinical Study Protocol GT -201  Galera Therapeutics, Inc.  
Confidential              Amendment 6 
 
 80  
    • H1: the distribution of duration of severe OM in the active  arm ≠ the distribution of 
duration of severe OM in the placebo arm  
Sample size has been calculated using  an overall two -sided alpha of 0.05 .  
With 6 5 patients per arm  having received GC4419/placebo and completed their IMRT course  
(assumes  72 patients enro lled to each treatment arm with a  10% dropout rate), the study will 
have roughly 80 -85% power  to detect a reduction in duration in the experimental arm under the 
following assumed incidence of severe OM  and percentiles of the distribution of duration of 
severe OM:  
• GC4419 arms: incidence = 40%; duration (25th, 50th, 75 th percentile): 0, 0, 21 days  
• Control arm: incidence = 65%; duration (25th, 50th, 75th percentile): 0, 28, 50 days  
13.3. Analysis Populations  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population includes all subjec ts who are randomized and will be used in 
the primary analysis for all efficacy endpoints. Subjects will be analyzed according to their 
randomized treatment assignments.  
Analyses on other efficacy populations (e,g.,  a modified intent -to-treat (mITT) popula tion, or an 
“evaluable” or “per protocol” population) may be conducted.  Such analyses  will be specified in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan for this study.  
The safety population will include all patients who receive at least one dose of GC4419. Only 
patients  with clear documentation that no GC4419 was received may be excluded from analysis. 
Patients will be analyzed according to the dose received.  
13.4. Definition of Endpoints  
13.4.1.  Primary Endpoint  
Duration of severe OM is defined as the number of days from  the first o ccurrence of WHO 
Grade 3 or 4 OM through the first occurrence of non -severe (≤ Grade 2)  without a subsequent 
instance of  ≥ Grade 3  OM. Subjects with complete study follow -up for severe OM who do not 
develop severe OM will be considered to have durations of 0  days. 
13.4.2.  Secondary Endpoints

13.5. Safety Analysis  
Adverse events will be grouped b y system organ class, high level term, and preferred term 
according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) dictionary. Incidence 
by subject will be tabulated for all treatment emergent, serious, severe, and treatment related 
adverse e vents. Detailed listings will be provided for all serious adverse events, deaths, and 
withdrawals due to adverse events.  
Laboratory measurements, vital signs, and ECG parameters will be summarized by treatment 
group at each of the protocol specified time p oints.  
Further details will be provided in the trial’s Statistical Analysis Plan. 
13.6. Primary Efficacy Analysis  
Duration will be compared between each active arm and placebo by a van Elteren test, stratified 
by the factors used in randomization, namely baseli ne HPV status and planned chemotherapy 
schedule.  
Differences in duration will be described by presenting each group’s incidence of severe OM and 
the percentiles of the duration of severe OM, both with and without inclusion of subjects without 
severe OM.  
13.6.1.  Multiplicity  
To control the overall Type 1 error at 0.05, the testing of each GC4419 dose group to placebo 
will be done sequentially for the primary and secondary endpoints as shown in the following 
table. Testing will proceed conditional on the statistical  significance of the prior test(s) at the 
0.05 level.

Under this procedure, duration of severe OM in the 90 mg GC4419 treatment arm will be 
compared  with placebo first.  If p ≤0.05  for this comparison, duration of severe OM in the 30 mg 
GC4419 treatment arm will be compared.  Additional tests of severe OM incidence or other 
parameters will be performed, sequentially, as long as p ≤0.05 . If for any test p>0.05, no further 
hypo theses will be formally tested.   
13.6.2.  Handling of Missing Data  
Investigators should make reasonable attempts to continue to collect WHO OM scores for 
inclusion in the study database for subjects who discontinue from study drug but continu e to 
receive further IMRT fractions.  
The trial’s Statistical Analysis Plan will discuss the imputation strategy for subjects who lack 
WHO OM scores, who discontinue from the trial without complete follow -up of WHO OM 
scores, and whose resolution date of s evere OM is unknown .  
13.6.3.  Covariate Adjustment  
Because  the trial’s randomization is stratified by baseline HPV status and planned chemotherapy 
schedule, the primary analysis will be stratified by these factors. The Statistical Analysis Plan 
will contain guidel ines for combining strata should the size of any of the four strata be 
unacceptably small.

    13.7. Secondary Efficacy Analyses  
13.7.1.  Cumulative Incidence Endpoints  
Incidence endpoints will be analyzed by Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel tests stratified by the factors 
used in ra ndomization.  
13.7.2.  Onset of Severe OM: Number of IMRT Fractions Delivered at Onset of Severe 
OM, Time (days), and Cumulative  IMRT Delivered at Onset of Severe OM  
Onset of severe OM will be compared using a stratified  logrank test, where time is substituted by 
the cumulative IMRT fractions received. Subjects without severe OM will be censored at their 
last IMRT fraction. Kaplan -Meier estimates will be presented in a figure.  
Similar supportive analyses of the endpoint will be performed using days on study and using  
cumulative RT dosage as the unit of time.  
13.8. Exploratory  Efficacy Analyses  
13.8.1.  Instances of severe OM lasting ≥  7 days  
Instances of severe OM lasting seven  or more days will be compared by a van Elteran test . The 
proportion of subjects with episodes of severe OM  lasting seven or more days will be compared 
by a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test.  
Further exploratory efficacy analyses are described in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
13.9. Analysis of Tumor  Endpoints  
13.9.1.  Local or Regional Progression  
Local (primary site) or regional  (neck) progression is defined as clinical or radiographic evidence 
of progressive disease at the primary site or neck.  The location of progressive disease should be 
separately distinguished (local vs . neck) if possible.  Progression of local or regional disease 
should be confirmed by biopsy when possible but may be clinically assessed and documented in 
the clinical record at the judgment of the treating clinicians.  Tumor reappearing with the initial 
and immediate adjoining anatomical region of the primar y will be considered local recurrence.   
13.9.2.  Distant Metastasis  
Clear evidence of distant metastases (lung, bone, brain, etc .): biopsy is recommended where 
possible.  Multiple lung nodules/masses are considered distant metastases from the index cancer 
unless p roven otherwise.  
The frequencies of locoregional and distant failure will be tabulated and standard Kaplan -Meier 
plots will be made for time -to-event endpoints (OS, PFS, locoregional failure over time, distant 
metastases over time).  Other exploratory ana lyses of the time -to-event endpoints may also be 
performed; e.g., ratio or difference of t -year event rates, ratio or difference of percentiles of 
survival functions, and ratio or difference of restricted mean survival times or restricted time 
lost.47

    13.9.3.  Second Primary Neoplasm  
A solitary, speculated lung mass/nodule is considered a second primary neoplasm unless proven 
otherwise.  
Frequency of second primary neoplasms will be tabulated.  
13.10.  Data Monitoring Committee (DMC ) 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will perform periodic unblinded safety 
reviews while patients in the trial receive study drug. The DMC will make recommendations 
regarding the conduct of the study, i.e., to continue enrollment, to hold enro llment until further 
review, to amend the protocol, or to stop the study early.

    1 If a patient ends study participation early  and withdraws consent , all last d ay of IMRT procedures should be completed.  
2 The Post -IMRT Weeks 1 through 8 Follow -up Visits will be scheduled based on the last day of IMRT. Patients will be seen weekly (every 7  ± 2 calendar days) 
until WHO < 2.  
3 See protocol Sections 7.1 and 7.2. 
4 The HNC history shoul d include tumor HPV status, staging (AJCC) information , prior treatments,  and confirmation of histopathological diagnosis of SCC. 
Medical conditions and illnesses that have occurred since the patient signed the ICF up until the date of randomization  should be recorded as medical history . 
Medical history also includes tobacco  and alcohol use history . 
5 At the Screening and Last Day of IMRT Visit s, a complete physical examination will be conducted.  
6 Vital signs (temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, and respiration rate), body weight, and ECOG will be o btained and recorded at the 
Screening and Baseline Visit s, once during Weeks 4 and 7, and at the Last Day of IMRT Visit. All vital signs should be measured following 2 minutes of res t 
in the sitting position.  
7 For patients receiving tri -weekly cisplatin,  body surface area (BSA) will be recorded to confirm cisplatin  dosing at the Baseline Visit and  once during Week s 4 
and 7 . For patient s receiving weekly cisplatin, body surface area (BSA) will be  recorded to confirm cisplatin dosing at the Baseline  Visit an d once per week 
until chemotherapy is completed . 
8 For a woman of childbearing potential, serum pregnancy test must be performed at the Screening Visit.  
9 Radiographic imaging must be performed within 60 days prior to the first day of IMRT and at Months 1 2 and 24 Post-IMRT  for all patients . Patients treated 
definitively (as opposed to post -operatively) will also undergo imaging at Month 3 Post -IMRT to assess tumor response/clearance to the degree possible. 
Radiographic imaging is highly reco mmended at any Post-IMRT follow -up visit at which disease progression is suspected by the treating physician. If 
radiographic i maging is performed, both local/ regional recurrence and distant metastases should be evaluated.   
10 At the Last Day of IMRT Visit, a clinical t umor assessment will be conducted. A  neck and oral exam is sufficient at the Last Day of IMRT Visit if disease 
progression is not suspected. If disease progression is suspected, a laryngopharyngoscopy should be conducted. At Months 3, 6 , 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24, a 
laryngopharyngoscopy (mirror and/or fibe roptic and/or direct procedure)  is required  if disease progression is suspected to evaluate local/ regional or distant 
progression.  
11 All concomitant therapies (e.g., prescription and over -the-counter medicati ons) taken by patients  on or after the date of randomization through  30 days 
following the last GC4419/placebo,  IMRT  or cisplatin (i.e. whichever occurs last)  dose will be collected in the CRF , except for narcotics (narcotics will only be 
captured from the  Baseline Visit through the Last Day of IMRT Visit) .  Additionally, any concomitant therapies used to treat any serious or related adverse 
event will be recorded in the CRF.   
12 AEs and SAEs with onset dates on or after the date of randomization through 30  days following the last GC4419/placebo, IMRT or cisplatin (i.e. whichever 
occurs last) dose will be recorded on the CRF.  All patients with SAEs will be followed until the events resolve, stabilize, become chronic, th e patient 
completes the study, or the patient is lost to follow -up. 
13 Ventricular rate and P -R, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals will be assessed and recorded. An ECG will be conducted at the Screening and Baseline  Visits , during  
Week 4, and at the Last Day of IMRT Visit.  
14 All OM assessments mus t be performed by trained evaluators. The extent of the patient’s OM will be scored using the WHO OM toxicity scale. OM 
assessments will be completed at the Screening Visit, at the Baseline Visit, and twice weekly (no less than 48 hours apart) w ithin each 5-day IMRT period. For 
Week 1, the first OM assessment will occur at the Baseline Visit; one additional OM assessment must occur at least 48 hours later during the week. The extent 
of the patient’s OM will be scored using the WHO OM toxicity scale. If a pa tient has ulcerative OM (WHO ≥ 2) at the Last Day of IMRT Visit, visits for OM 
will be repeated weekly ( every 7 days ± 2 days) until the WHO score is 0 or 1 or the patient is 8 weeks p ost-IMRT, whichever occurs first.  
15 Using a Sponsor -provided ruler, the  distance in millimeters between the incisal edges of the mandibular and maxillary incisors at midline will be measured to 
determine the maximum opening of the mouth that the patient can achieve at the Baseline Visit and Months 3, 6, 9, 12 , 16, 20, and 24  Post-IMRT Visits.   
16To assess xerostomia, patients will complete a VAS instrument at the Baseline Visit and 3, 6, 9, 12 , 16, 20, and 24  Month Post-IMRT Visits.

    17 Beginning at the Baseline Visit (IMRT Day 1) and through the Last Day of IMRT  Visit , patie nts will complete a daily diary (including weekends) containing 
the OMDQ and questions regarding narcotic  use. If a patient returns for weekly visits following the last day of IMRT because WHO ≥ 2, the OMDQ only will 
be completed at the time of the weekly clinic visit.   
18 Clinical laboratory measurements will be conducted at the Screening Visit, twice during Week 1 (once at the Baseline Visit an d again on Day 3, 4 or 5 ), and 
once weekly from Week 2 through the last d ay of IMRT. Clinical laboratory measure ments at these visits will include the hematology profile (hemoglobin, 
hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet count.  Differential to include tota l neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, 
eosinophils, and baso phils) and chemistry profile (glucose, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, albumin, total protein, total bilirubin , direct bilirubin, 
alkaline phosphatase, ALT (SGPT), AST (SGOT), chloride, phosphate, bicarbonate).  
19  If safety labs have already been drawn during the study week in which the last day of IMRT or early termination visit falls, then lab safety tests (chemi stry and 
hematology profiles) do not need to be conducted on the last day of IMRT or at the early termination visit.  If safety lab s have not been drawn during the 
current study week at the time of the early termination visit or on the last day of IMRT, then safety labs should be drawn on  that day.   Safety labs only need to 
be drawn once per study week  after Week 1. 
20Blood  samples will be collected for GC4419 pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements at Baseline, Day 2, Day 22 and Day 23. See Table  10 for additional 
information.  
21For cytokine analysis, blood  samples will be collected  at the Screening  Visit (within 28 days of IMRT start but at least 72 hours prior to Baseline), at the 
Baseline Visit, Week 2 OM Visit 2, Week 4 OM Visit 2, Week 6 OM Visit 2, and at the Last Day of IMRT Visit. Whenever possible , blood draws for cytokine 
analysis should be  conducted at OM Visit 2 for each protocol -specified week; however, if blood draws must be taken on another day within a given week, it 
will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
22If the patient consents separately, blood samples will  be collected  at the Screening Visit (within 28 days of IMRT start but at least 72 hours prior to Baseline ) 
and at the Last Day of IMRT Visit for the assessment of gene expression patterns prior to receiving the first dose of GC4419 and upon completion of GC4419 
doses .   
23GC4419  will be administered up to 35 times: weekly, Monday through Friday, beginning at Baseline (IMRT Day 1) and through Study Day 47 (end of IMRT). 
IMRT must begin no longer than 60 min following the end of the GC4419 infusion.  If IMRT is not received on  any given day due to a treatment break or 
unforeseen circumstances, GC4419 should not be administered on that day.  Patients should resume GC4419 administration when I MRT resumes.

    Guideline for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting:   To prev ent acute nausea and 
vomiting following chemotherapy of high emetic risk, a three -drug regimen including single 
doses of a 5 -HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone  12 mg , and aprepitant  125 mg  (or 
fosaprepitant  150 mg ) given before chemotherapy is recommen ded.  (Dosing of 5 -HT-3 receptor 
antagonist and dexamethasone as per ASCO guidelines , except no recommendation made for 
ramositron .) 
Guideline for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting:  In patients receiving cisplatin 
treated with a combination of aprepitant (or fosaprepitant*), a 5 -HT3 receptor antagonist and 
dexamethasone to prevent acute nausea and vomiting, the combination of dexamethasone and 
aprepitant  (80 mg orally per day for the 2 days following chemotherapy) * is suggested to prevent 
delaye d emesis, on the basis of its superiority to dexamethasone alone.  
• *However, if fosaprepitant is used in Day 1, only dexamethasone is required at days 2 
- 4 post -chemotherapy  
Additional note:  NEPA (a fixed -dose combination of netupitant and palonosetron) has been 
approved by the FDA in October 2014 and may be considered.

    26. APPENDIX 8: SUMMARY OF CHANGES IN  AMENDMENT 6 
The GT -201 Protocol  Amendment 5, dated 8 May 2017,  is repla ced by this Protocol Amendment 
6, dated  19 October  2017 . This Protoc ol Amendment 6 applies to all sites.  
Listed below are a summary of substantive chang es incorporated into Amendment 6.  
Administrative changes, such as cross -linking and typographical/grammatical corrections have 
also been made, which ma y not  be summarized.   A red -line version which identifies all non -
formatting changes (i.e., “was -is” document) is incorporated by reference to this document as, 
“GT-201: Redline Changes from Protocol Amendment 5 to Protocol Amendment 6” (Note: The 
page numbers in the final ve rsion may not match exactly the page numbers in the redline version 
due to the listing of previous and new text).  
1. Change:  Change method of handling multiple comparisons from the prior Hochberg 
method to a fixed sequence analysis approach. As part of the ch ange in multiple testing, 
add as secondary endpoints incidence of Grade 4 OM and onset of severe OM, expressed 
as number of IMRT fractions at onset.  
Rationale:  In consultation with scientific, statistical, and regulatory advisors, the 
Sponsor has determine d that a fixed sequential approach provides a more appropriate way 
to assess the effects of the two active doses of GC4419.   Note: this change is made prior 
to database lock or study unblinding, and is not informed by examination of the study 
data.   
2. Chang e: Specify that, in the event of discrepancies between the protocol and the

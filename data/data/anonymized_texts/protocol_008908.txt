STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 
Patients with T2D will be included in this study if at Screening they 
have an HbA1c between 7% and 11%, inclusive, and moderate renal 
impairment (defined as a Screening Modification of Diet in Renal 
Disease (MDRD) eGFR of ≥ 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2). Any 
background antidiabetic therapy (oral or injected including insulin) is permitted with the exception of other sodium-glucose cotransporter 
type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. During the double-blind Treatment Period, 
the type and the dose of background therapy should not be changed unless for safety concerns. 
All patients will have a Screening Period comprised of an up to 
2-week Screening phase and a 2-week , single-blind placebo Run-in 
phase prior to randomization. In order to qualify for randomization, patients must demonstrate compliance during the single-blind 
placebo Run-in phase based upon tablet count ( ≥80%) and as 
assessed at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1:1 to 1 of 3 treatment arms at 
Visit 3 (Week 0, Day 1): 
• Placebo 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg. 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%) 
• Screening SBP (<130 mmHg and ≥130 mmHg) 
• Chronic kidney disease stage (either CKD stage 3A [screening eGFR of 45 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m
2] or CKD 
stage 3B [screening eGFR of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m2]). 
To ensure sufficient patients in each CKD stratum, enrollment will be capped for the 1st CKD that reaches 390 patients (either CKD stage 
3A or CKD stage 3B). Enrollment for the study will be completed

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 5 when reaching the target number as planned. 
Following randomization, patients will have a 26-week double-blind 
Treatment Period, followed by a 26-week double-blind Extension 
Period, and a 4-week post-treatment Follow-up Visit to collect safety 
and some efficacy information. 
Patients will be monitored throughout the double-blind Treatment 
Period and Extension Period for signs of deterioration in renal 
function (eg, decrease in eGFR) as well as all other routine clinical and laboratory findings. If at any visit after Randomization up to 
Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% increase from Baseline level, where Baseline level is defined as the mean of 
creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomization) or if at 
any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% above the mean of 
creatinine values from the previous 2 visits, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for creatinine increase and in particular the following causes: 
• Medications that increase creatinine 
• Decrease in cardiac output 
• Obstructive uropathy 
• Urinary tract infection 
• Volume depletion. 
If addressing these causes does not reduce the creatinine level below the above stated threshold, the investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) will be stopped for 2 weeks. If at creatinine recheck 
the patient has returned to the below threshold, then IMP will be 
restarted at a reduced dose (ie, dose reduced via interactive 
response technology to 200 mg for those randomized to 400 mg, maintained to 200 mg for those randomized to 200 mg, and to 
placebo for those randomized to placebo). If the creatinine does not 
return to below the threshold, the IMP will be permanently 
discontinued but the patient will be asked to continue attending all 
study visits. 
The HbA1c and FPG results will be masked to study sites and 
patients after randomization and until study end. To prevent partial 
unblinding, UGE and UGCR results will also be masked to study 
sites and patients. Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick will not include 
the measurement of urine glucose. 
Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, phosphorus, 
magnesium, and creatinine will be measured separately at all on-site visits by the central laboratory. 
Early termination 
If a patient discontinues treatment with IMP early during the 
Treatment Period, the patient will have a Premature End of 
Treatment (EOT) visit and a Follow-up Visit 4 weeks after the last 
dose of IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to have all patients 
return to the site at the time corresponding to their scheduled visits, 
particularly the Week 26 and Week 52 visits. 
If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by 
telephone to enquire about their safety information, particularly at the 
time of the initially scheduled end of study.

The thresholds values are defined as follows, depending on study 
period: 
• From Baseline Visit (V3, Day 1) to Visit 6 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 6): FPG >270 mg/dL 
(15.0 mmol/L). 
• From Visit 6 (Week 8) to Visi t 7 (Week 12) (including value 
at Visit 7): FPG >240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L). 
• From Visit 7 (Week 12) up to the EOT Period Visit 11 
(Week 52) (including value at Visit 11): FPG >200 mg/dL 
(11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥8.5%  (the 8.5% criterion does 
not apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was 
≥1.0%). 
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic 
parameters remain under predefined thresholds values (see 
hereinafter). 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the specific glycemic 
limit on one day, the patient checks it again during the 
2 following days. If all the values in 3 consecutive days 
exceed the specific limit, the patient should contact the 
Investigator and a central laboratory FPG measurement 
(and HbA1c at Week 12 and onwards) is performed as 
soon as possible, preferably within 7 days to confirm the 
hyperglycemia. 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert a central 
laboratory re-test must be completed and confirmed 
as exceeding the criterion  for rescue before rescue 
therapy is initiated. The re-test confirmation should be 
performed as soon as possible, but within 7 days of receipt 
by unscheduled visit . 
In case of a confirmatory FPG and/or HbA1c above the threshold values, the Investigator should ensure that no reasonable 
explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular 
that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours). 
• Investigational product is given at the planned dose. 
• Absence of intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize 
glycemic control (eg, infectious disease). 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate. 
• Compliance to diet and lifestyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the insufficient glycemic 
control, the Investigator should consider not initiating rescue medication and should undertake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting condition (ie, after at least 8 hours fast). 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in adverse event [AE]/concomitant medication parts of the electr onic case report form [e-CRF] 
and the medical record).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 • Stress on the absolute need to be compliant with 
treatment. 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a 
Registered Dietician or other qualified nutrition 
professional and to reinforce on the absolute need to be 
compliant to diet and lifestyle recommendations, and 
schedule an FPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit. 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be found, or if 
appropriate action fails to decrease FPG/HbA1c under the threshold 
values, rescue medication may be introduced. 
• Open label rescue medication(s) to treat hyperglycemia must be in accordance with local standard of care and 
prescribing practice for patients with CKD and will be at the 
discretion of the investigator. Except for sodium-glucose 
cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and medications 
with specific contraindications in renal impairment, any 
approved medication(s) including oral antidiabetic drugs or 
insulin can be considered with appropriate dose 
modification as indicated. 
• The patient continues the IMP (blinded) and stays in the 
study in order to collect efficacy and safety information. 
The planned visits and assessments should occur until the 
last scheduled visit. 
• Rescue therapy is consi dered a noninvestigational 
medicinal product. Rescue therapy is to be reported in the 
e-CRF. This information should include specific drug 
name, dose, route of administration, and frequency. 
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of the rescue therapy will 
be reimbursed by the Sponsor where permitted by local regulations.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination: 
The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the 
primary endpoint. Assuming a common standard deviation of 1.2% 
and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 130 patients in each CKD 
stratum (3A or 3B) in each treatment group will provide the following power: 
• To detect a treatment difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c 
change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 
400 mg versus placebo: 
- 98% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus 
placebo in patients in CKD 3A stratum 
- 98% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3B stratum 
- 99% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus 
placebo in overall patient population 
• To detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to Week 26 between sotagliflozin 
200 mg versus placebo: 
- 91% power comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus 
placebo in patients in CKD 3A stratum 
- 91% power comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3B stratum 
- 99% power comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo in overall patient population 
• At least 80% overall power to have all 6 above statistical inferences statistically significant based on above 
treatment effect assumptions. 
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population, defined as all randomiz ed patients irrespective of 
compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. 
Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint: Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to 
Week 26 in HbA1c) will be perform ed using the ITT population, using 
HbA1c measurements obtained during the study, including those 
obtained after IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint of c hange in HbA1c from Baseline to 
Week 26 will be analyzed with missing values imputed by control-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at 
random frame work. 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data, 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin groups, missing data will be imputed as if the patients were on placebo group 
throughout the study, where all patients’ measurements 
including the on-treatment measurements will be 
considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model.

(ie, CKD 3A and 3B patients combined), the model will include 
treatment (sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), 
randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%), 
randomization stratum of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, 
≥130 mmHg), randomization stratum of CKD stage (3A, 3B), and 
country as fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, versus 
placebo in each CKD stratum, the model will include treatment 
(sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), 
randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%), 
randomization stratum of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), randomization stratum of CKD stage (3A, 3B), 
treatment by randomization stratum of CKD stage, and country as 
fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c value as a covariate. Results from 
each complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted 
mean change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment 
group, as well as the between-group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group versus placebo) and its associated 95% 
confidence interval (CI) using contrast statements. 
Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baseline value, observed 
values, and observed changes from Baseline) at scheduled visits will 
be provided for each treatment group and by CKD stages (3A, 3B). 
The summary will include the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), minimum, median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine 
trends over time using mean values (±SE) and mean changes from 
Baseline (±SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using observed case 
[OC]). 
Baseline definition:  
The Baseline value is defined generally as the last available value 
before the first dose of double-blind IMP or the last available value 
prior to randomization for patients who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. 
For serum creatinine (or eGFR), t he Baseline value is defined as the 
mean of creatinine levels (or eGFR) at the Screening and 
Randomization Visits prior to the first dose of double-blind IMP or 
prior to randomization for patients who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. 
Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints: The secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a similar approach 
to the primary efficacy endpoint, with missing values imputed by the 
control-based multiple imputation method under the missing not at random frame work. For each of the continuous secondary 
endpoints, each of the complete datasets will be analyzed by the 
ANCOVA model with treatment groups (sotagliflozin 400 mg, 
sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), randomization stratum of 
Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%), randomization stratum of 
Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), randomization stratum 
of CKD stage (3A, 3B), and country as fixed effects, and Baseline

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 13 secondary endpoint value as a covariate. Results from each 
complete dataset will be combined to provide the adjusted mean 
change from Baseline to Week 26 (Week 12 for SBP endpoints) for each treatment group, as well as the between-group difference 
(comparing each sotagliflozin group versus placebo) and its 
associated 95% CI using contrast statements. 
The UACR will be log-transformed before the analysis. Change from 
Baseline to Week 26 of UACR in log scale will be analyzed. Results 
in the log scale will be back-transformed to provide the ratio and then 
the percent change of UACR at Week 26 versus Baseline based on 
the geometric means as well as the corresponding 95% CIs. 
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of HbA1c <6.5%, <7% 
at Week 26 will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
method stratified by randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c 
(≤8.5% and >8.5%), randomization stratum of Screening SBP 
(<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg), randomization stratum of CKD stage 
(3A, 3B). For the HbA1c <7% or <6.5% analysis, patients with missing HbA1c data at Week 26 will be considered non-responders 
in the ITT population. 
Summary statistics for the secondary endpoints at scheduled visits 
will be provided for each treatment group and by CKD stages (3A, 
3B) as appropriate. 
Analysis of other efficacy endpoints:  
The analysis of other endpoints will be descriptive with no formal 
testing. Summary statistics at scheduled visits using OC will be 
provided by each treatment group and by CKD stages (3A, 3B) as 
appropriate. Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate 
trends over time. 
Analyses of safety data:  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical significance 
tests will be performed on safety data. These analyses will be based 
on the safety population, which is defined as all randomized patients 
who receive at least 1 dose of do uble-blind treatment, regardless of 
the amount of treatment administered. Patients will be analyzed for 
safety analyses according to the treatment actually received. 
DURATION OF STUDY PERIOD (per 
patient) Up to 60 weeks, including a 4-week Screening Period (comprised of a 2-week Screening phase and a 2-w eek single-blind placebo Run-in 
phase), a 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, a 26-week double-blind Extension Period, and a 4-week post-treatment 
Follow-up Visit.

a If a patient discont inues treatment with IMP early during the Treatment Pe riod, the patient will have a Premature EOT Visit (si milar to Visit 11, see Section  10.1.3.2 ), and a Follow-up Visit, 4 weeks after the last 
dose of IMP (similar to Visit 12, see Section  10.1.4.1). However, every effort will be made to have all patients retu rn to the site for all scheduled visits, in particular the Week 26 and Week 52 Visits. If a patient 
discontinues (or completes) treatment and study at the same time, a single visit for both EOT and follow-up will be performed. 
b Four weeks after the last dose of IMP. 
c Height to be measured only at Screening. 
d Vital sign measurements (sitting BP, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate): 3 separate seated BP and heart rate measur ements should be taken with at least 1 minute between readings, following a 
5-minute rest period and prior to phlebotomy. 
e The abbreviated physical exam s hould focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas important for assessment of  AEs if necessary. 
f Self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) is to be performed fasting, at least 3 times per week from start of Run-in until end of Tre atment Period including on day of each on-site study visit except Visit 4. Patients will 
also be requested to self-assess blood glucose levels whenever they experience symptoms of hypoglycemia. The SMBG will be prese nted as equivalent self-monitoring plasma glucose (SMPG). 
g The 12-lead ECG recordings should be obtained prior to IMP admin istration. The ECG will be evaluat ed as “normal” or “abnormal” .

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 18 h All laboratory assessments occur prior to dose of double-blind IMP. All visi t dates will be scheduled bas ed on the date of rand omization with a ±3 days visit window allowed during the Treatment Period. 
Chemistry panel: Hematology panel in Section  9.2.1.3 . 
i Clinical chemistry laboratory tests are outlined in Table 2 . Other chemistry tests w ill include amylase and lipase. 
j An additional blood sample will be dr awn at Week 26 (Visit 9) and Week 52 (Visit 11), 3 hours after administering the dose of I MP for creatinine (for eGFR) and for assessing plasma concentration of sotagliflozin 
and sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide. 
k Serum pregnancy testing only at Screening; urine pregnancy testing subsequently. Serum pregnancy test results must be reviewed prior to beginning the Run-in phase for all women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed based on serum pregnancy test. The Investigator may perform addition al tests at their discretion or as required by local regulations. For women of 
nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or estradiol levels should be tested if  the definition of postmenopausal or premenopa usal cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical 
document of hysterectomy or cessation of menses <12 months without an alternative medical cause. 
l Plasma concentration samples for sotagliflozin and sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide collected on Weeks 4, 18, 26, and 52 may be dr awn with the other laboratory assessments but MUST be collected before 
administration of IMP. The time of the last intake of study drug prior to visits where PK samples are taken should be recorded by the patient in the patient diary. Patients should be reminded of this at visits 
preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the Premature EOT Visit, neither at all subsequent visits. 
m The markers of intestinal transit and absorption include vitamins B6, B12, K, E, and A, serum folate, and ferritin. 
n Markers of bone and calcium metabolism include: serum calcium , se rum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, serum  phosphorus , serum magnesium, serum parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 
markers of bone resorption (serum NTX, serum β-CTX-1), bone formation (serum P1NP and osteocalcin) and serum alkaline phosphatase. 
o Urinalysis includes urine dipstick and microscopy. Dipstick includes assessment of specific gravity, pH, protein, blood, ketone s, bilirubin, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocyt e esterase. Microscopy includes, but is not 
limited to, detection of formed cellular elements, casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and crystals in centrifuged urine sedimen t. In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspicious of urinary tract infection (UTI), 
urine culture should be performed . Positive urine culture determination will be bas ed upon the criteria of the reporting labora tory. Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point the Principal 
Investigator suspects the presence of a UTI. 
p BMD will be assessed locally (with central reading) in all patients at Baseline (Week 0, Day 1 ±7 days) and at Visit 11 (Week 52, Day 364 ± 7 days). 
q Patients will collect overnight urine on Weeks 0,  2, 4, 12, 26, and 52.  In the night prior to the visi ts, the urine before sleep will be discarded and the urine during sleep and the first morning uri ne (after getting up) 
will be collected.  The visits should be rescheduled to allow for urine collection in case a patient missed it.  Urinary albumin, total protein, cr eatinine, calcium (adjusted for creatinine), phosphorus (adjusted for serum 
phosphorus and creatinine), magnesium (adjusted for serum magnesium and urinary creatinine), and glucose will be assessed. 
t The 50% increase will be fr
om Baseline value (t o Week 8) or from the arithmetic mean of  creatinine values from last two visits (after Week 8) only at visits having a measurement of creatinine. 
u All serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse ev ents (AEs), AEs of special interest (AESI),  and events of special interest (EOSI) will be collected starting from signing info rmed consent and continue until the end of 
the study. All AEs that occur during treatment should be followed until study completion (or until patients leave the study) or  until the event has resolved, the condition has stabilized or the patient is lost to follow-
up. All patients will have a Follow-up visit 4 weeks after the last dose of IMP to collect safety and some efficacy information .

4.1 BACKGROUND: SOTAGLIFLOZIN AND DISEASE 
Sotagliflozin is a dual inhibitor of the sodium-g lucose cotransporters type 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and 
SGLT2) being developed for use in Type 2 diabetes  (T2D), a metabolic disorder characterized by 
hyperglycemia that results from a combination of increased insulin resistance and beta-cell 
dysfunction ( 1). The micro vascular complications of diabetes are well known and can result in 
impaired renal function, retinopath y and neuropathy and the macr ovascular complications result 
in coronary disease, amputations and stroke. Other comorbidities that are frequently associated with diabetes are hypertension, obesity, and cardi ovascular (CV) disease. According to the most 
recent International Diabetes Fe deration Diabetes Atlas, the es timates in 2015 were that 1 in 11 
adults have diabetes, which means 415 milli on people and estimated to be 642 million by 2040 
(2). 
According to the World Health Organization, th ere are about 60 million people with diabetes in 
the European Region, or about 10.3% of men a nd 9.6% of women aged 25 years and over ( 3). 
While these numbers include both people with T2 D and Type 1 diabetes (T1D), over 90% of 
adults with diabetes have T2D. Diabetes is among the leading causes of death by disease and is a leading cause of heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney disease, and amputation ( 2, 3). Despite 
the fact that the population of people with diabetes  is growing, none of the current therapies is 
curative and the results of treatment are variable. 
Despite the numerous treatment options available, monotherapy fails in many patients as beta-cell 
function continues to deteriorate leading to pr ogressively increasing hyperglycemia. Glycemic 
control with the currently available agents often leads to side effects, most notably weight gain 
and an increased frequency of hypoglycemia. Thes e concerns emphasize the need to develop new 
agents that effectively and safely lower glucose in diabetic patients ( 4). 
The SGLT1 is expressed predominantly in the gast rointestinal (GI) tract; SGLT1 is responsible 
for the majority of glucose absorption by the small intestine ( 5). Inhibition of SGLT1 in the GI 
tract delays glucose absorption and lowers  peak postprandial glucose levels ( 6). Additionally, 
there is accumulating evidence that SGLT1 inhibition stimulates secretion of glucagon-like 
peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), gut horm ones involved in pancrea tic beta-cell function 
and appetite control, respectively. Reduced glucose absorption in the proximal intestine leads to more glucose being delivered distally, which allo ws L cells in both the ileum and the colon to 
sense glucose and its byproducts, and as a resu lt, they secrete GLP-1 and PYY. Although a 
complete lack of functional SGLT1 may be associ ated with symptoms of glucose and galactose 
malabsorption, ( 7) pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT1 by sotagliflozin has not produced these 
effects in preclinical models or patients with T2 D. Selective inhibitors of the SGLT1 transporter 
are in early stages of development. 
Extensive clinical studies conduc ted for selective sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) 
inhibitors have established this class as effective agents for the treatment of T2D ( 4,8) and have 
led to approvals by the US Food and Drug Ad ministration (FDA) and the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA). Studies with sotagliflozin, a, dual inhibitor of SGLT2 and SGLT1, have shown

EFC14837 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 29 that this agent produces significant glucosuria in preclinical animal models, healthy human 
volunteers, and patients with T2D. Single- and multiple-dose administration of sotagliflozin to healthy human patients has resulted in dose-dependent increases in glucosuria. Multiple-dose (28-day) administration in diabetic patients produced improvements in several metabolic 
parameters, including urinary glucose excre tion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), GLP-1, and PYY (9). These data suggest that sotagliflozin should be 
of therapeutic benefit to patients with T2D. 
Diabetic nephropathy with advancing duration of diabetes and the treatment of T2D in the face of 
advancing renal insufficiency represents a particular challenge to the clinician. Many agents used 
to treat T2D, including sulfonylurea, metformin and incretin-based insulin secretagogues, can no 
longer be used or must be dosed with caution in the clinical setting of renal insufficiency. 
The glucose lowering efficacy of selective SGLT2 inhibitors will diminish when renal function 
(glomerular filtration rate) dimin ishes because SGLT2 is located exclusively in the renal tubule 
and selective SGLT2 inhibitors act solely by bl ocking reabsorption of glucose that has been 
filtered at the glomerulus ( 6). For this reason the use of dapaglif lozin is restricted to patients with 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m
2 and that of empagliflozin and 
canagliflozin is limited to patients with eGFR ≥45 mL/min/1.73 m2 (10,11,12). Sotagliflozin, in 
contrast, lowers glucose by blocking absorption of  glucose in the small intestine (SGLT1) as well 
as by blocking reabsorption at the kidney (SGL T2) and thus would be expected to maintain 
glucose lowering efficacy as renal function diminishes. In fact this was shown to be the case in an early Phase 1 trial (LX4211.1-107 DM). Patients with T2D and either chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) stage 3A (eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m
2) or CKD stage 3B (eGFR 30 to 
44 mL/min/1.73 m2) were randomized to sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or placebo for 7 days 
while being closely monitore d, partly as inpatients. 
Sotagliflozin significantly reduced postprandial gl ucose (PPG) levels rela tive to placebo in the 
total population and in  patients with an eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73m2, with a placebo-adjusted 
decrease in incremental area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) pre-dose –4 hrs  of 
73.5 mg*h/dL (p=0.009) and 137.2 mg*h/dL (p=0.001) for the total population and the eGFR <45 mL/ min/1.73 m
2 subgroup, respectively. As expected sotagliflozin caused less increase in 
UGE in the CKD stage 3B subsets than in the to tal population subset (pla cebo-subtracted increase 
in UGE was 38.7, 53.5, and 20.4 g/24h for the total population, CKD stage 3A subset, and CKD stage 3B subset, respectively [p = 0.007 for all 3] ). This suggests that something other than 
inhibition of SGLT2 mediated renal glucose absorption is being inhibited by sotagliflozin, eg, SGLT1 effect in the GI. In addition, the patients with CKD 4 have decreased insulin clearance and 
better glucose control. These results also sugg est that dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibition with 
sotagliflozin could prove useful for the treatme nt of patients with T2D and renal impairment ( 13). 
Sotagliflozin has shown effect in patients with renal impairmen t and SGLT1 inhibition does not 
depend on kidney. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of sotagliflozin in glucose 
lowering in patients with renal impairment.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 30 4.2 CLINICAL TRIALS OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN IN HUMANS 
Approximately 840 subjects (698 assigned to so tagliflozin and 229 assigned to placebo) have 
participated in completed clinical studies of sotagliflozin. No significant safety concerns have 
been identified in the sotagliflozin drug program, and sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date. Serious adverse events (SAEs) and discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) 
have been infrequent and have been balanced between treatment and co mparator groups. Reports 
of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) across all sotagliflozin studies for which data are available were generally balanced between  treatment and comparator groups . The most frequently reported 
TEAEs (≥2.0%) were headache, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, dizziness, and upper respiratory 
tract infection, all of which were reported at a frequency greater than placebo. However, the 
majority were described as mild to moderate, and most resolved spontaneously and without discontinuation of the study drug. 
In completed and ongoing clinical trials, no additi onal safety issues beside those already described 
in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) ha ve been observed. In general, no significant 
imbalances of SAEs/AEs between sotagliflozin and comparators were observed in completed 
studies. Cumulatively, across the completed studies  8 SAEs were reported in 6 patients (4 T2D 
and 2 T1D), all of which were assessed as unrelated to study drug; those reported in 4 T2D 
patients who received sotagliflozin included pulm onary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, bile 
duct stone, cholangitis and lower limb fracture, while a myocardial infarction (MI) was 
experienced by a patient receiving placebo. Tw o SAEs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were 
reported in 2 T1D patients in the ongoing (blinded) Phase 2 T1D study LX4211.1-203-TIDM; 
both SAEs were assessed as due to failu re of insulin delivery via insulin pump. 
A drug interaction study with digoxin, a sensitive P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, indicated that sotagliflozin acts as a weak P-gp inhibitor. Base d on drug-drug interaction studies, the effect of 
sotagliflozin in competing with compounds meta bolized with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 are 
minimal. Sotagliflozin wa s profiled as perpetrator regarding CYP3A4/5 interaction in INT14972, 
in which a weak induction of CYP3A4/5 was obs erved at a dose of 400 mg as well as a weak 
inhibition of CYP2D6. These effects were more pronounced at a higher dose of 800 mg. It was 
concluded, that for the vast majority of drug s metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4/5 or 
CYP2D6, the clinical effect is negligible. Howeve r, caution is suggested for patients treated with 
narrow therapeutic index drugs. Patients taking sotagliflozin w ith concomitant digoxin should 
have digoxin concentrations monitored and doses  reduced as needed. In addition, other P-gp 
substrates may be affected and the labels of P-gp  substrate drugs should be consulted with regards 
to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
In trial 202, it has been demonstrated the systo lic blood pressure (SBP) in all the patients was 
decreased by 5.4 mmHg compared to the placebo while the decrease in patients with SBP 
>130 mmHg was 14 mmHg. 
More information on the safety of sotagliflozin and on the clinical program can be found in the 
IB.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 31 4.3 RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF DOSE 
Both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses are being developed in the Phase 3 program for sotagliflozin 
for the treatment of T2D. These doses are being tested in several Phase 3 trials, including the 
current trial in patients with T2D and CKD stage 3. 
The proposed sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses are based on the results of the 
Phase 2b study LX4211.1-202-DM. In this study, sotagliflozin doses of 75 mg once daily, 200 mg 
once daily, 200 mg twice daily, and 400 mg once daily were tested over a 12-week, double-blind 
period. The sotagliflozin 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses were chosen for further evaluation based on their HbA1c lowering effects and the overall safety and tolerability observed at these 
doses. At 12 weeks, the 200 mg and 400 mg once daily doses lowered HbA1c by a mean of 0.52% 
and 0.93%, respectively (p <0.001 for both arms), while placebo lowered HbA1c by a mean of 
0.14%. Sotagliflozin also produced statistically significant reductions in body weight (200 mg and 400 mg doses) and SBP (400 mg dose). 
The overall incidences of AEs on sotagliflozi n 200 mg and 400 mg once daily were similar to 
placebo. A maximum dose of sotagliflozin has not been established in terms of either safety or 
HbA1c reduction. From a safety perspective, sotagliflozin was well-tolerated across studies. In healthy subjects 
sotagliflozin was well-tolerated following single doses up to  2000 mg, and in multiple doses up to 
800 mg over 10 days. Furthermore, in a thorough QT  study, single doses of sotagliflozin (800 mg 
and 2000 mg) were well-tolerated a nd did not prolong the QT interval. Additionally, evaluation of 
metabolites in urine and plasma of healthy subjects resulted in no safety concerns following single doses of 400 mg sotagliflozin. In patients with T2D, single doses of sotagliflozin 400 mg in 
combination with sitagliptin, and multiple doses up to sotagliflozin 400 mg in combination with metformin over 12 weeks were also well-tolerated. 
Based on the pharmacokinetic (PK)  extrapolation and approximation the safe ty margin based on 
400 mg multiple dosing in CKD stage 3 patients (eGFR ≥ 30 to <60 mL/min/1.73m
2) is 3-fold and 
in CKD stage 4 patients the margin is 1.9-fold. 
4.4 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN AND CONTROL GROUPS 
This study is designed to demonstrate the efficacy  and safety of sotagliflozin when used as add-on 
therapy to standard care (any combination of oral agents and/or insulin deemed clinically 
appropriate) in patients with T2D and CKD stage 3A or 3B who have inadequate glycemic 
control. Sotagliflozin 200 mg daily, as well as sotagliflozin 400 mg daily, will be compared to 
placebo in this randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, 3-arm, para llel-group trial. The 
protocol stipulates that patients be provided antidiabetic agent rescue therapy according to a 
predefined algorithm. Safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of sotagliflozin are supported by Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies and animal toxicology data in rats up to 26 weeks 
and dogs up to 39 weeks as well as 2 year carcinog enicity data in rats. Efficacy and safety in 
patients with CKD stages 3A/3B are supported by 7 day PD and safety data  in patients with T2D 
and CKD (Trial LX4211.107).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 32 In a Phase 1 trial 31 patients with T2D and eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 were randomized to 
sotagliflozin or placebo. Despite reduction of more than 50%  in UGE, the patients with 
eGFR <45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and patients with eGFR >45 mL/min /1.73 m2 had the same level of 
reduction in the PPG (the primary endpoint).  
Randomization will be stratified by Screening Hb1Ac ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%), Screening SBP 
(<130 mmHg versus ≥130 mmHg), and CKD stage (3A, 3B) based on Screening eGFR. Since the 
reduction in the SBP for patients with SBP ≥130 mmHg was significantly higher than all the 
patients, these patients will be monitored for blood pressu re (BP) reduction closely. 
A placebo control will be used to allow for an unbi ased assessment of treatme nt effects and safety 
data. Bias will be minimized by randomizing the patients to treatment groups, blinding the 
patients, the Investigators, and the Sponsor to the treatment allocations, and by adjudicating 
endpoints in a blinded fashion. 
A 2-week Run-in phase has been implemented  to stabilize HbA1c and minimize response to 
placebo and effects inherent to participation in a controlled clinical trial. 
Sotagliflozin treatment for 26 weeks is likely to be of sufficient duration to observe effects on 
reduction of HbA1c, BP, and body weight, and is therefore selected as the timepoint for 
assessment of the primary endpoint HbA1c. Tr eatment up to 52 weeks will provide additional 
long-term data on safety and efficacy. 
Endpoints for evaluating renal function include eGFR, based on serum creatinine, and urine 
albumin to creatinine ratio as well as routine m onitoring of urine via dipstick and spot urine 
analyses. At 6 time points during the study (Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26 and 
Week 52), patients will be instructed to bring overnight/first of the day voids. Cystatin C, UGE, urine glucose:creatinine ratio (UGCR), and N-ter minal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide 
(NT-proBNP) are other valid markers of renal function and volume status, and will be assessed at 
appropriate timepoints in this study. 
In addition, although clinical outcomes are not expected to occur at a high enough rate to yield 
statistically significant information in this trial, outcomes such as death will be adjudicated by an independent adjudication committee. 
4.5 BENEFIT/RISK OF SOTAGLIFLOZIN 
Sotagliflozin is currently being investigated as  an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with T2D. The development program will also provide efficacy and safety data for sotagliflozin in combination with other antidiabetic medications. Sotagliflozin has effects on SGLT2 and SGLT1. Based on the GI c ontribution of sotagliflozin in reducing the

use of sotagliflozin in the treatment of T1D is  also being studied in a separate development 
program. 
Sotagliflozin may benefit a wide variety of diabetic patients based on multiple potential beneficial 
effects of dual SGLT2/SGLT1 inhibition, and its insulin-independent mechanism of action. 
Improvements in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG were observed with sotagliflozin in multiple studies. As 
anticipated from the mechanism of action, treatment  with sotagliflozin resulted in increased UGE 
(from inhibition of SGLT2) as well as increased le vels of the intestinal peptides GLP-1 and PYY 
(from inhibition of SGLT1). In addition, the impr ovements in body weight and BP observed with 
sotagliflozin treatment have the potential to benefit patients with diabetes through their effects on common diabetic comorbidities. 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no significant effect in patients w ith SBP <130 mmHg, and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients.  Since this could be of benefit to patients 
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary objective in this trial. 
SGLT2 inhibitors class have been associated with small decreases of glomerular filtration rate and 
increased rate of genital infections, which are usually mild and well tolerated in clinical trials. Overall, sotagliflozin has been well-tolerated in all studies to date, with the majority of events assessed as mild to moderate; most of which resolved spontaneously. Serious AEs and 
discontinuations due to AEs have been limited and balanced between treatment and comparator groups. 
Events of special interest (EOSI) are evaluated based on either their potential link to the drug’s 
mechanism of action, events that occur in other SGLT-inhibitor drugs, or regulatory 
interest/guidance for diabetes products, but found not  to be in imbalance in clinical trials. In 
addition to the identified and potential risks (genital mycotic infections [male and female], metabolic acidosis, DKA, urinary tr act infections [UTIs], volume de pletion, severe hypoglycemia) 
for the sotagliflozin program, other EOSI have been defined. These EOSI are: major adverse 
cardiac events (MACEs) and other CV events, venous thrombotic events (VTEs), drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase  >3 times the upper limit of normal 
(ULN), diarrhea, pancreatitis, bone fractures, re nal events, malignancies of special interest 
(including but not limited to: breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, prostate and thyroid cancer), and AEs leading to amputation. 
However, reports of these events have been in frequent and have responded to standard treatment. 
The improvement in glycemic control, the reductions in weight and BP, and the tolerability and 
safety profile of sotagliflozi n to date, demonstrate a favorab le benefit-risk assessment for 
sotagliflozin.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY 
This is a Phase 3, multicenter and multinationa l, 1:1:1 randomized, double-blind (single-blind 
Run-in phase), placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that is antic ipated to enroll approximately 
780 patients. 
The study comprises a 4-week Screening Period (c onsisting of a Screening phase of up to 2 weeks 
and a 2-week single-blind placebo Run-in phase ), a 26-week double-blind Treatment Period, a 
26-week double-blind Extension Period, and a 4-week post-treatment Follow-up Period. 
The study design is presented graphically in Section  1.1. 
6.1.1 Screening Period 
6.1.1.1 Screening phase (Visit 1) 
The Screening phase will last up to 2 weeks. It must  be long enough to collect the data required to 
establish whether the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Patients with T2D ( 14) who have inadequate glycemic c ontrol and documente d moderate renal 
insufficiency (CKD 3A, 3B; defined by an eGFR) ( 15) plus who do not have a Screening HbA1c 
of <7.0% or >11% are eligible for enrollment in this study. 
At the Screening Visit after signing of the informed consent form (ICF), eligibility criteria will be 
assessed and Screening assessments will be performed. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) not willing to use highly effective method(s) of birth control during the study treatment period and the follow-up period, or who are unwilling or  unable to be tested for pregnancy will be 
excluded from the study; guidance on highly effective contraceptive methods and collection of pregnancy information is provided in Appendix A . If another contraceptive method is used (such 
as a barrier method), it should be used in combinat ion with one of the highly effective methods in 
Appendix A  (such as oral contraceptive). 
The Interactive Response Technology (IRT); e ither Interactive Voice Response System or 
Interactive Web Response System) will be contacted  at Visit 1 for notification of Screening and 
for patient number allocation. 
6.1.1.2 Run-in phase (Visit 2) 
The Run-in phase will last 2 weeks. Patients will be treated in a single-blind manner with two (2) placebo tablets (identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg  in appearance) administered once daily during 
the Run-in phase, starting from Visit 2.

EFC14837 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 37 6.1.2 Double-blind Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 26) 
Eligible patients will be randomized on Day 1 (V isit 3). In order to qualify for randomization, 
patients must also demonstrate compliance during the single-blind place bo Run-in phase based 
upon tablet count ( ≥80%) and, as assessed, at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Randomization will be stratified by: 
• HbA1c at Screening ( ≤8.5% and >8.5%) 
• SBP at Screening (<130 mmHg and ≥130 mmHg) 
• CKD stage (3A, 3B) based on Screening eGFR ( 15)(16)(17 ). 
Following randomization, patients will be treated in a double-blind manner for 52 weeks. A total 
of approximately 780 patients ≥18 years of age (or ≥ legal age of the majority, whichever is 
greater) are planned to be randomly assigned  1:1:1 to the following 3 treatment groups: 
• Placebo, given as two (2) placebo tablets (identic al to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), 
once daily, before the first meal of the day 
• Sotagliflozin 200 mg, given as 2 tablets: 1 so tagliflozin 200 mg tablet and 1 placebo tablet 
(identical to sotagliflozin 200 mg in appearance), once daily 
• Sotagliflozin 400 mg, given as two (2) 200 mg tabl ets, once daily, before the first meal of 
the day. 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum) and HbA1c results will be masked to study sites and patients 
after randomization and until stud y end. To prevent partial unb linding, UGE and UGCR results 
will be masked to study sites and patients, and the central laboratory urine dipstick analysis will not include the measurement of urine glucose. 
Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, pho sphorus, magnesium, and creatinine will be 
measured separately at all on-site visits (e xcept for Visits 6, 8, 10, and 12) by the central 
laboratory. 
All visits will be on-site visits. If a patient discontinues treatme nt with investigational medicinal product (IMP) early during the 
Treatment Period, the patient will have Premature End of Treatment  (EOT) Visit, and a Follow-up 
Visit, 4 weeks (±5 days) after the last dose of IMP.  In addition, every effort  will be made to have 
all patients return to the site at the time corres ponding to their scheduled visits, particularly the 
Weeks 26 and 52 Visits. If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by telephone to inquire their 
safety information, particularly at the time of the initially scheduled end of study (EOS). 
6.1.3 Double-blind Extension Period (Week 27 to Week 52) 
From Weeks 27 to 52, patients will be in a 26- week double-blind Extens ion Period. Patients will 
continue to receive the blinded medication (sot agliflozin 400 mg, 200 mg, or placebo) to which 
they were randomized on Day 1. Patients who received rescue medication during the initial

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 38 26-week Treatment Period will continue on the same rescue medication during the double-blind 
Extension Period (unless the Inve stigator considers a change necessary for safety reasons). 
If a patient discontinues treatment with IMP early during the Extension Treatment Period, the patient will have a Premature EOT Visit, and a Follow-up Visit, 4 weeks after the last dose of 
IMP. In addition, every effort will be made to ha ve all patients return to the site at the time 
corresponding to their scheduled visits , particularly the Week 52 Visit. 
If a patient does not agree to site visits, he/she will be contacted by telephone to inquire about 
their safety status, particularly at the time of the initially scheduled EOS. 
6.1.4 Follow-up Period 
Following the last dose of the IMP (either as  scheduled or prematurely), a post-treatment 
follow-up should be scheduled for all patients 28 days (4 weeks) ±5 days after permanent IMP 
discontinuation.  
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The total duration of the study for each patient will be up to 60 weeks and will include a 
Screening phase of up to 2 weeks, a 2-week single-blind Run-in phase, a 26-week double-blind 
Treatment Period, a 26-week double-blind Extensi on Period, and a 4-week Follow-up Period after 
completion of study treatment. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of the study is defined as being the “las t patient last visit” pl anned with the protocol, 
including the Follow-up Visit. 
The Sponsor can terminate the trial prematurel y based on the advice of the independent Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) or other unforeseen developments. 
6.3 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.3.1 Steering committee 
The Steering Committee (SC) is composed of experts in diabetes and scientists with clinical and 
methodological expertise. This Committee, led by  a Chair, is responsible for producing and 
conducting a scientific ally sound study and for ensuring accurate reporting of the study. In that 
capacity, the SC must address and resolve scientific issues encountered during the study. The members will remain blinded until completion of the study.

review the recommendations from the DMC th roughout the study. The SC members will 
participate in face-to-face meetings at regula r intervals throughout the study and in regularly 
scheduled teleconferences. 
Detailed activities and re sponsibilities of the SC are provide d in a separate SC Charter. 
6.3.2 Data monitoring committee 
A DMC with members who are independent from the Sponsor and the Investigator will meet on a 
regular basis, and will be responsible for: 
• Review of accumulating clinical trial safety data by treatment. 
• Making a recommendation to the Sponsor rega rding the study following each meeting. 
Safety data to be reviewed w ill be unblinded data a nd include events and outcomes described 
below for adjudication, as well as any additional sa fety data considered relevant. To maintain 
continuous blinding and study integrity, the analysis will be conducte d by an independent 
statistician, and measures will be taken to ensure the validity of the data. 
Details describing the DMC processes and procedures are outlined in a separate DMC Charter. 
6.3.3 Clinical endpoint committee 
The Clinical Endpoint Committees (CECs) is/are comprised of experts in cardiology and 
nephrology (and other appropriate medical specia lties such as neurology and endocrinology as 
needed) who are independent of the Sponsor and the contract research organization (CRO). The 
CEC(s) will review and adjudicate all deaths, MACE/selected CV events (MI, stroke, unstable 
angina leading to hospitalization, and heart failu re leading to hospitalization), selected renal 
events, bone fracture, and DKA. 
The details regarding the CEC processes and procedures will be outlined in the CEC Charter(s). 
6.3.4 Safety adjudication of events requiring ongoing monitoring 
Two independent committees will review safety events that require ongoing monitoring to ensure 
timing protocol amendments in case a safety signal is identified. These events are: 1) potential cases of DILI, and 2) cases of amputations. 
The two committees will review the cases in a treatment-blinded manner and will present their 
assessments to the DMC. 
The members, roles and responsibilities of the two committees will be de scribed in separate 
Charters.

level (see details in Section  10.6.2), the Investigator should ensure  that no reasonable explanation 
exists for creatinine increase. Sites will be notified by central laboratory alert if a patient has a 
>50% increase from Baseline level or >50% above the mean of creatinine values from the last

the threshold, the IMP will be permanently discontinued but the patient will be asked to continue attending all study visits. 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Noninvestigational medicinal product (NIMP) treatme nt is defined as the rescue medication(s) 
that will be used to treat hyperglycemia when a patient’s hyperglycemia reaches the rescue threshold (see Section  8.2.1 for details). 
8.2.1 Rescue therapy 
The thresholds values are defined as  follows, depending on study period: 
• From Baseline Visit (V3, Day 1) to Visit 6 (Week 8) (including value at Visit 6): 
FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L). 
• From Visit 6 (Week 8) to Visit 7 (Week 12) (including value at Visit 7): FPG >240 mg/dL 
(13.3 mmol/L). 
• From Visit 7 (Week 12) up to the EOT Period Visit 11 (Week 52) (including value at Visit 11): FPG >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 8.5%  (the 8.5% criterion does not 
apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.0%). 
Routine fasting SMBG and central laboratory  alerts on FPG (and HbA1c at Week 12 and 
onwards) are set up to ensure that glycemic pa rameters remain under predefined thresholds. 
• If one fasting SMBG value exceeds the spec ific glycemic limit on 1 day, the patient 
checks it again during the 2 following days. If all the values in 3 consecutive days exceed 
the specific limit, the patient shoul d contact the Investigator and a central laboratory 
FPG measurement (and HbA1c at Week  12 and onwards) is performed as soon as 
possible, preferably within 7 da ys to confirm the hyperglycemia. 
• Upon receipt of a central laboratory rescue alert a central laboratory re-test must be 
completed and confirmed as exceeding the criterion  for rescue before rescue therapy is 
initiated. The re-test confirmati on should be performed as soon as possible, but within 
7 days of receipt by unscheduled visit. 
In the event that a confirmatory FPG and/or Hb A1c exceed the threshold, the Investigator should 
ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for in sufficient glucose control and in particular that: 
• The increased FPG has been tested at a fasting status (ie, no food intake for ≥8 hours).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 46 • IMP is given at the planned dose. 
• Absence of intercurrent disease, which may jeopardize glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease). 
• Compliance to treatment is appropriate. 
• Compliance to diet and lif estyle is appropriate. 
If any of the above can reasonably explain the in sufficient glycemic control, the Investigator 
should consider not initiating re scue medication and should unde rtake appropriate action, ie: 
• Assess plasma glucose in fasting conditi on (ie, after at least 8 hours fast). 
• Initiate an evaluation and treatment of intercurrent disease (to be reported in 
AE/concomitant medication parts of the electronic case report form (e-CRF) and the 
medical record). 
• Stress on the absolute need to be compliant with treatment. 
• Organize a specific interview with the patient and a Registered Dietician or other qualified 
nutrition professional and to reinforce on the ab solute need to be compliant to diet and 
lifestyle recommendations, a nd schedule an FPG/HbA1c assessment at the next visit. 
If none of the above mentioned reasons can be fo und, or if appropriate action fails to decrease 
FPG/HbA1c under the threshold values, re scue medication may be introduced ( 18). 
• Open label rescue medication(s)  to treat hyperglycemia must be in accordance with local 
standard of care and prescribing practice for patients with CKD and will be at the 
discretion of the investigator. Except for SGLT 2 inhibitors and medications with specific 
contraindications in renal impairment, an y approved medication(s) including oral 
antidiabetic drugs or insulin can be considered with appr opriate dose modification as 
indicated. 
• The patient continues the IMP (blinded) and stays in the study in order to collect efficacy and safety information. The planned visits and assessments should occur until the last 
scheduled visit. 
• Rescue therapy is considered an NIMP. Resc ue therapy is to be reported in the e-CRF. 
This information should include specific drug  name, dose, route of administration, and 
frequency. 
If not covered by health insurance, the cost of  rescue therapy will be reimbursed where permitted 
by local regulations. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
To maintain blinding sotagliflozin and their matching placebo tablets (including packaging) will 
be blinded and indistinguishable.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 47 During the double-blind Treatment Period and double-blind Extension Period, each treatment 
package will be labeled with a number, which is generated by a computer program from Sanofi. 
Investigators will not have access to the randomization (treatment) code except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2. 
The randomization and the treatment allocation will be performed centrally by an IRT. The study biostatistician provides th e randomization scheme to the IRT. Then, the IRT generates the patient 
randomization list from which it allocates treatment arms to the patients. 
Fasting glucose (plasma or serum) and HbA1c will  be masked to study sites and patients after 
randomization and until study end. To prevent partial unblinding, UGE and UGCR results will 
also be masked to study sites and patients. Additionally, urinalysis by dipstick will not include the 
measurement of urine glucose. 
Quantitative urine glucose, albumin, calcium, pho sphorus, magnesium, and creatinine will be 
measured separately at all on-site visits (e xcept for Visits 6, 8, 10, and 12) by the central 
laboratory. 
The CEC members will perform adjudication in a blinded manner. 
8.3.1.1 First step data analysis 
The Sponsor representatives that w ill be involved in the first step analysis will not be involved in 
the conduct of the study from that point forward, and unblinded patient level results at the first 
step analysis will not be provided to the study sites. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an AE, the randomization code should only be broken in circumstances when 
knowledge of the IMP is require d for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the IRT and/or by 
calling any other phone number provided by the S ponsor for that purpose. Code breaking can be 
performed by a local study Investigator, sponsor phy sician or healthcare professional with direct 
responsibility for patient care. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, 
time of day and reason for code breaking. The id entity of the unblinded personnel, how the code 
was broken, and the treatment kit number should also be recorded. The Sponsor should also be informed. If the code is broken by the Inves tigator, (or other medical doctor in emergency 
situation) the patient must be withdrawn from IMP administration. 
Randomization code breaking will also be performed during the analysis of the Pharmacokinetic plasma concentration samples. Only the Project manager and lead scientist at the Bioanalytical 
laboratory will have access to the randomization code to allow for th e sorting of the sotagliflozin 
plasma samples. The Bioanalytical lab and responsible personnel will follow the standard 
procedures to ensure the protection of the b lind within the Sponsor’s  clinical team. The 
randomization code or the individual analytical results will not be disclosed to any clinical team 
personnel prior to th e database lock.

Packaging will be undertaken in accordance with the administration schedu le. The content of the 
labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
The appropriate number of packages will be dispensed to cover up to the next dispensing visit 
(please refer to Section  1.2). Storage conditions and use-by-end dare are part of the label text. 
Treatment labels will indicate the treatment number (used for treatment allocation and reported in the e-CRF. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
Investigators or other authorized persons (eg, phar macists) are responsible for storing the IMP in a 
secure and safe place in accordance with local regulations, labeling specif ications, policies, and 
procedures.  
Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature and instructions for handling 
the Sanofi compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 
The expiry date and storage conditions are writte n on the IMP labels. The IMP should be stored 
between +15ºC and + 30ºC (59ºF and 86ºF). 
8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor or Delegate a nd in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements. All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator’s prescription and it is the 
Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that an a ccurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor or Delegate. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor in order to reca ll the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator suppl y IMP to a third party (except for direct-to-
patient shipment, for which a courier company ha s been approved by the Sponsor), allow the IMP 
to be used other than as directed by this clini cal trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other 
manner.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 50 8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Accounting and compliance for IMPs will be performed at Visit 3 and all subsequent visits. 
The Investigator will check the compliance to the study treatments based on the patient diary and 
will then complete the appropriate site treatment and patient treatment log forms. Returned IMP should be counted by site staff. In addition, the dosing information will be recorded on the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF. 
If compliance is inadequate as determined by the Principal Investigator, patients will be trained 
again and mentored. If suboptimal compliance continues after training and mentoring, patients may be discontinued at the discretion of the Principal Investigator after discussion with the 
Sponsor’s/CRO’s medical monitor. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Patients are to return all IMP (unused, in-use or empty wallet[s]) at each on-site visit, or at on-site 
visits after premature treatment discontinuation, as described in Section  1.2. 
At Visit 4 (Week 1), because no IMP re-supply is pl anned during this visit,  patients will be sent 
home after this visit with the in-u se wallet dispensed at Randomization. 
Patients are to return all the used, in-use and unused IMP at Visit 11 (or final assessment 
on-treatment visit in case of perm anent premature discontinuation). 
All used, partially used or unused IMPs will be retrieved by the Sponsor or Dele gate. A detailed 
site and patient treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the 
pharmacist) and countersigned by the I nvestigator and the monitoring team. 
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor (ie, rescue  therapy), tracking and reconciliation is to be 
undertaken by the Investigator (o r pharmacist if appropriate) acco rding to the system proposed by 
the CRO. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any tr eatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP. The 
IMP includes sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotag liflozin 200 mg, and matching placebo. 
Background antidiabetic medication: Except for SGLT2 inhibitor (eg, canagliflozin, 
dapagliflozin, or empagliflozin), at the study entr y patients can be treated with any injectable or 
oral antidiabetic medication(s) in accordance with the local medical care guidance. The type or dose of medication(s) should remain unchanged during the study course. The dose modification or 
discontinuation of an existing antidiabetic medica tion is allowed for safety concerns at the 
Investigator’s medical judgment.

includes all NIMP treatments that are taken by the patients at any time during the clinical study, 
beginning at Visit 1. 
Additionally, all medications take n in the 3 months prior to Visit 1 and any prior use of SGLT2 
inhibitor should be reported. 
8.8.1 Prohibited prior and concomitant medications 
During the study Treatment Period, the following medications are prohibited: 
• Initiation of any antidiabetic agents, including oral or injectable antihyperglycemic agents 
other than the IMP and NIMP is not allowed before the rescue therapy. The existing 
background medication (NIMP) should not be modified before the rescue. 
Note : short term use (<10 consecutive days) of  the prohibited medication, eg, short-acting 
insulin for treatment of acute illness or surgery is allowed. 
• SGLT2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin, dapaglif lozin, or empagliflozin) are not allowed for 
rescue.  
• Systemic use of glucocorticoids for more than 10 consecutive days (topical, intra-articular, 
ophthalmic, nasal spray or inhale d applications are allowed). 
• IMPs in any other clinical study. 
• Modification of antihypertensive medication before Week 12 is not allowed unless for 
safety reasons. 
• Initiation of any weight loss drugs (eg, phentermine, orlistat). 
Patients taking sotagliflozin w ith concomitant digoxin should have digoxin concentrations 
monitored and doses reduced as needed. In addition, other P-gp substrates may be affected and the 
labels of P-gp substrate drugs should be consulted with regards to monitoring and dose adjustments. 
Other medications which are unlikely to interfer e with the PK or PD of the IMP or confound 
interpretation of the study endpoints are allowe d as needed following discussion between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor/CRO. However, doses  of chronically administered medicines should 
be kept fixed during the study if at all possible. The dose of all antihypertensive agents should be  kept constant during the 12 weeks following 
randomization and no antihypertensive agents s hould be added or withdrawn for the 12 weeks 
following randomization unless it is consid ered necessary for safety reasons. 
8.8.2 Concomitant diabetes therapy 
Any background antidiabetic therapy (oral or inj ected including insulin) is permitted with the 
exception of other SGLT2 inhibitors.

inhibitors and medications with  specific contraindications in renal impairment, any approved 
medication(s) including or al/subcutaneous antidiabetic  drugs or insulin can be prescribed to treat 
the hyperglycemia as long as it is used within labeling guidelines for renal impairment. In addition, for patients already prescribed insulin the dose may be increase d. If a patient requires 
glycemic rescue, the IMP received during th e randomized, double-bli nd Treatment Period and 
Extension Period should continue and must remain blinded until th e end of the study. Background 
medication may need to be adjusted if hypoglycemia occurs. 
8.9 POSTSTUDY TREATMENT 
Because sotagliflozin may reduce BP, adjustment of antihypertensive medication may be needed 
during the study in patients with hypertension. Co nversely, monitoring for an increase in BP 
should be performed after withdrawal of study medi cation. If the BP is elevated after withdrawal 
of study treatment, the Investigator should cons ider adding or adjusting antihypertensive 
medication. Sotagliflozin will not be  provided after EOT. Patient’s further treatment, for diabetes 
and other pathologies will be at  the Investigator’s discretion ba sed on his/her clinical judgment.

Hemoglobin A1c will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 3), and all on-site visits 
during the double-blind Treatment Period and Extension Period, with the exception of Run-in 
(Visit 2), Week 2 (Visit 4), and Week 4 (Visit 5). HbA1c is measured by a certified Level I 
“National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program” central laboratory at time points described in the flow chart ( Section  1.2). 
9.1.4.2 Blood pressure measurements 
Systolic BP and DBP will be asse ssed at all on-site visits. Blood pr essure measurements must be 
taken as described in Section  9.2.1.5, with details provided in Appendix C . 
9.1.4.3 Body weight measurement 
Body weight is measured at all on-site visits. Body weight should be obtained with the patient 
wearing undergarments or very light clothing and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The same 
scale should be used throughout the study, and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by 
the manufacturer. Calibration should be documen ted in source documents. The use of balance 
scales is recommended; if digital scales are used, testing with standard we ights is of particular 
importance. The floor surface on which the scale re sts must be hard and sh ould not be carpeted or

9.2 SAFETY ENDPOINTS 
Assessments for safety include AEs, SMBG, clinical laboratory assessments, physical 
examination, ECG, weight, and vital signs. An independent DMC will meet on a regular basis to 
review accumulating clinical trial safety data by treatment. 
Adjudication of all deaths, MACE/other selected CV events, selected renal events, bone fracture, 
and DKA will be performed in a blinded manner by a CEC(s) comprised of experts. Details will 
be provided in the charter of the CEC( s). Further details are available in Section  6.3. 
Two expert committees will review all potential cases of DILIs and cases of amputation in a 
treatment-blinded manner to evaluate causality. 
The following safety endpoints will be assessed: 
• Incidence of TEAEs, AEs leading to discon tinuation from the IMP, adverse events of 
special interest (AESI), EOSI, SAEs and deaths 
• Hypoglycemia (all, severe and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) 
• Acute renal failure (see Appendix D ). 
• Clinical laboratory results (including fasting lipids; see Section  9.2.1.3), vital signs, ECG 
and bone mineral density (BMD) results 
• Markers of intestinal transit and absorption 
• Markers of bone and calcium metabolism. 
Observation period of safety endpoints  
The observation period of safety data will be divided into 3 segments: 
• The pre-Treatment Period is defined as the time between the date of the informed consent 
and the first dose of double-blind IMP 
• The on-Treatment Period (TEAE period) is defined as the time from the first dose of double-blind IMP up to 10 days (1 day for hypoglycemia) after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP, regardless of the introduction of  rescue therapy. The 10-day interval is 
chosen based on the half-life of the IMP (approximately 5 times the half-life of sotagliflozin) in patients with moderate renal dysfunction 
• The post-Treatment Period is defined as the time starting 11 days after the last dose of 
double-blind IMP (after the on-Treatment Period). 
The Baseline value for safety endpoints in the safe ty population is the last available value (or the 
average of all values for creatinine or eGFR) pr ior to the first administration of the double-blind 
IMP.

Events of special interest are separate from AESI . For a list of events defined as EOSI and their 
reporting requirements see Section  10.4.1.4 and Section  10.4.5, respectively. 
9.2.1.2 Hypoglycemia 
Hypoglycemia (all, severe and/or documented symptomatic hypoglycemia) will be assessed 
starting with signing of the ICF until 4 weeks af ter the last dose of IMP. Patients will also 
complete the patient diary, which will be regularly reviewed by Investigators. See Section  10.6.1 
for further details. 
9.2.1.3 Laboratory safety variables 
The clinical laboratory data consist of blood an alysis (including hematology and clinical 
chemistry, amylase lipase, and lipid profile) and urinalysis, according to the schedule presented in Section  1.2. Clinical laboratory values will be evaluated after conversion into standard 
international units. International units will be used in all listings and tables. Table 2 lists the 
hematology, clinical chemistry, and other blood sa fety parameters to be assessed by the central 
laboratory. 
In addition, for WOCBP a serum pregnancy test is  performed at Screening and urine pregnancy 
tests are taken at all on-site visits during the double-blind Treatment Period, excluding Visit 4 
(Week 2). Any positive urine test results must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. The 
Investigator may perform additional tests at thei r discretion or as required by local regulations. 
For women of nonreproductive potential ( Appendix A ), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
and/or estradiol levels should be tested if the definition of  postmenopausal or premenopausal 
cannot be satisfied, eg, no medical document of hysterectomy or cessation of menses <12 months 
without an alternative medical cause.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 59 9.2.1.4 Urinalysis 
Urinalysis (urine dipstick with microscopy) by central laboratory will be performed at Run-in 
(Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3), at all on-site visits during the doubl e-blind Treatment Period, and at 
Week 52 (Visit 11) during the Extension Period. To prevent partial unblinding, the central 
laboratory urine dipstick will not include the measurement of urine glucose. Central urinalysis includes: 
• Urine dipstick includes: specific gravit y, pH, protein, blood, ketones, bilirubin, 
urobilinogen, nitrite, a nd leukocyte esterase 
• Urine microscopy includes, but is not limited to: detection of formed cellular elements, 
casts, bacteria, yeast, parasites, and cr ystals in centrifuged urine sediment. 
In the event of abnormal urinalysis findings suspic ious of UTI, urine culture should be performed. 
Positive urine culture determina tion will be based upon the criteri a of the reporting laboratory. 
Additionally, urine culture should be performed if at any point th e Principal Investigator suspects 
the presence of a UTI. 
In addition, urine albumin, calcium, phosphorus, gl ucose, magnesium, and creatinine will be 
assessed at Baseline (Visit 3) and all subsequent on-site visits during the Treatment Period with 
the exception of Week 8 (Visit 6) and Week 18 (Visit 8).  If the urine dipstick is positive for blood, the centr al laboratory will perform reflexive testing to 
include microscopy. Additional testing will be performed according to the judgment of the 
Investigator. Referral to urology/urologic ev aluation is recommended for new or unexplained 
cases of confirmed hematuria (urology/urologic evaluation is not required where hematuria is 
considered to be related to diabetic nephropathy). 
9.2.1.5 Vital signs and physical exam 
A complete physical exam (including sitting BP and heart rate [HR], temperature, and respiratory rate) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 9 (Week 26), and Visit 11 (Week 52). Abbreviated physical exams (including sitting BP and HR) will be performed at Visits 2, 3, and 4 (Weeks -2, 0, and 2, respectively), and at the Follow-up Visit (Visit 12, Week 56). The abbreviated physical exam should focus on cardiac and respiratory systems, as well as any areas 
important for assessment of AEs, if necessary. 
Vital signs, including: sitting BP and HR will be assessed at Screening and Run-in (Visits 1 and 
2), and all on-site visits. Three se parate seated BP and HR measur ements should be taken with at 
least 1 minute between readings, following a 5-mi nute rest period, and prior to phlebotomy. Full 
details and directions for the meas urement of BP are presented in Appendix C . 
9.2.1.6 Electrocardiogram variables

(Visit 11). 
The 12-lead ECG should be performed  after at least 10 minutes in supine position and prior to the 
morning IMP administration. The Investigator  should review the ECG and document the 
interpretation, sign and date it on the ECG print out and report it in the e-CRF. Each ECG trace is 
analyzed in comparison with the Screening recorded trace. All original traces are kept as source 
data. Note: Any new ECG abnormality should be r echecked for confirmation and reported as 
appropriate for that finding. 
9.2.1.7 Bone Mineral Density 
Bone mineral density of femoral neck, lumbar spine and total hip will be assessed in all patients at 
Baseline (Week 0, Day 1 ±7 days) and at Visit 11 (Week 52, Day 364 ±7 days) using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Bone mineral density assessments will be performed locally with central reading. All DEXA scans will be retained as source data. 
9.2.1.8 Self-monitoring of blood glucose 
A meter for self-assessment of blood glucose will be dispensed at Run-in (Visit 2). In addition to 
home measurements of SMBG, SMBG will be performed at Run-in (Visit 2), Baseline (Visit 3) and all subsequent on-site visits w ith the exception of Week 2 (Visit 4). 
Patients will also receive a patient diary at all on-site visits from Visit 1 to Visit 9. The diary will 
be reviewed at all on-site visits from Vis it 2 to Visit 12, with the exception of Visit 11. 
Self-assessed blood glucose levels will be entered into the patient diary. 
Patients will be asked to self-assess blood glucose levels at least 3 times a week from the Run-in 
Visit (Visit 2) to the e nd of treatment, Visit 11. 
Patients will be re quested to self-assess blood gl ucose levels in the fasted state and whenever they 
experience any illnesses (eg, cold, flu), or symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. 
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include shakiness,  dizziness, sweating, hunger, headache, pale 
skin color, sudden moodiness or be havior changes (such as crying for no apparent reason), clumsy 
or jerky movements, seizure, difficulty paying attention or confusion, or tingling sensations 
around the mouth. Patients will be instructed to reco rd the presence or absence of hypoglycemic 
episodes or hypoglycemic symptoms in the patient diary provided. 
Patients will also be instructed to record SMBG values that are ≤70 mg/dL ( ≤3.9 mmol/L) in the 
patient diary. Patients should be instructed to contact the site if fasting SMBG values over 
3 consecutive days are: 
• FPG >270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L) from Baseline Visit (Visit 3, Day 1) to Visit 6 (Week 8)

criterion does not apply if the HbA1c decrease from Baseline was ≥1.0%). 
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics of sotagliflozin 
The PK endpoints for sotagliflozin are: 
• Plasma levels of sotagliflozin and sotagliflozin-3-O-glucuronide in the sotagliflozin 
treatment arms 
Pharmacokinetic sotagliflozin da ta may be subjected to a population PK analysis, which will be 
reported separately to the c linical study report (CSR). 
9.3.1.1 Sampling time 
At Weeks 4, 18, 26, and 52 (Visits 5, 8, 9, and 11, respectively), blood samples for PK assessment are to be drawn with the other laboratory asse ssments, prior to administration of IMP. An 
additional blood sample w ill be drawn at Week 26 (Visit 9) and Week 52 (Visit 11), 3 hours after 
administering the dose of IMP. The time of the last intake of study drug prior to visits were PK samples are taken should be recorded by the pa tient in the patient diary. Patients should be 
reminded of this at visits preceding PK time points to ensure these details are captured. In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, PK samples should not be drawn at the Premature EOT Visit, 
or at subsequent visits. See Table 3  for identification samples.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 64 The other efficacy and safety assessments in  this study are standard, well-established 
measurements for a Phase 3 study evaluating the treatment of T2D in adult participants. 
The length of the study is cons idered appropriate for detection of the primary endpoint given the 
power estimates (see Section  11.1). 
Phase 2 data indicated that sotagliflozin may reduce SBP by 10 to 15 mmHg in patients with SBP 
≥130 mmHg at Baseline, while having no significant effect in patients w ith SBP <130 mmHg, and 
did not induce hypotension in normotensive patients.  Since this could be of benefit to patients 
with T2D, this finding is being followed up as a secondary objective in this trial, as well as the 
potential in patients with DBP >80 mmHg. Although  effects on BP in Phase 2 data were observed 
with the 400 mg dose at 12 weeks, the effects will be examined at Weeks 12, 26, and 52. Because of potential effects on bone and calcium metabolism, bone density will be measured in 
all patients in this tr ial at Baseline and Week 52, and speci fic biomarkers fo r bone and calcium 
metabolism will be assessed at regular timepoints. In view of the SGLT1 inhibitory effects in the 
GI tract, specific markers of intestinal transit and absorption will also be measured. Because of rat 
toxicology studies of questionable clinical signif icance showing tubule dilation in the kidney, high 
bone density in the sternum, and hyperplasia of st omach glandular cells, the biomarkers for urine, 
bone, and GI tract will also be measured  at early timepoints of 2 and 4 weeks.

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments  are listed in the Study Flow Chart ( Section  1.2). 
The aim of this section is to provide details on how so me of the procedures/assessments should be 
performed. 
This is an out-patient study and consists of 12 on-site visits, although optional on-site and/or 
telephone visits can be scheduled at any time  for any reason during the study whenever 
considered necessary by the Investigator. The patients need to be fasting for on-site visits Visit 1 through Visit 11 (Week -4 through 
Week 52), unless instructed otherwise by the I nvestigator. Throughout the study, “fasting” is 
defined as 8 hours without food. Note:  If the patient is not fasting at  the visits specified above, the 
blood sample will not be collected  and a new appointment should be  given to the patient for the 
following day if possible, with instruction to be  fasted (other procedures can be performed as 
scheduled). All laboratory assessments will occur prior to IMP administration on the day of the visit. 
The Run-in visit (Visit 2) can be performed as soon as the results of all Screening tests are 
available and the patient is confirmed to be eligible for participation in the study. The visit window for on-treatment Visit 4 through Visit 11 s hould occur at the schedule ±5 days. Visit 11 
(EOT) should occur during Day 364 to 369. For the Follow-up (Visit 12), the visit window should occur within ±5 days, 4 weeks after last dose of IMP. 
If one visit date is changed, the next visit s hould occur according to the original schedule, ie, 
calculated from the date of Baseline visit (Visit 3, Week 0). 
For a complete list of procedures scheduled for each study visit please refer to the Study Flow 
Chart ( Section  1.2), which details the procedures to be performed. 
All data obtained during the study visits are reviewed by the Investigator and Sub-Investigators 
who are qualified in tr eatment of T2D and are trained on the study. 
10.1.1 Screening Period 
The Screening Period is up to 4 weeks and includes the Screening phase and the Run-in phase. 
10.1.1.1 Screening phase 
The Screening phase will be up to 2 weeks in duration and includes Visit 1 (Week -4) only. It must be long enough to collect the data to establish whether the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

For screen failure patients, the following source data must be verified: patient's identification 
details, the informed consent signed by the patient, the study identification (name), dates of study visits and the main reasons for screen failure. 
10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e-CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the stud y and followed for the remainder of the study to collect vital 
safety status and endpoint data. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs.  
Lower extremity complications (such as skin ulcers, infection, osteomyelitis, and gangrene) 
requiring treatment should lead to temporary discontinuation of IMP. If at any visit after Randomization up to Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% 
increase from Baseline level, where Baseline level is defined as the mean of creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomizati on) or if at any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% 
above the mean of creatinine values from last 2 visits, the Investigator should ensure that no 
reasonable explanation exists for creatinine increase.  
The IMP should be stopped for 2 weeks. Reinitiating of treatment with the IMP will be done under clos e and appropriate clinical/and or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator has considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment in the occurrence of the concerned even t was unlikely to be related to the IMP and if 
that the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
If at creatinine recheck the patient has returned to the below threshold then IMP will be restarted 
at a reduced dose (ie, dose reduced via IRT to 200 mg for those randomized to 400 mg; maintained at 200 mg for those randomized to 200 mg). Since the IMP received is blinded, patients must return to the site and IR T will be contacted for IMP re-initiation. 
It is in the interest of the patient to m onitor their blood glucose during the temporary 
discontinuation period, therefore regular deter mination of SMBG is to be performed and 
documented (see Section  9.2.1.8). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF  when considered as confirmed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 79 Temporary treatment discontinuation decided by th e Investigator corresponds to more than 1 dose 
not administered to the patient. 
Use of any other anti-hyperglycemic medication during the time of temporary treatment 
discontinuation (ie, insulin during a hospitalization) is to be recorded as concomitant medication 
with the name and dose recorded in the e-CRF. 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product 
Permanent treatment discontinuati on defined as any treatment disc ontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be th e Investigator’s decision. Patients should discuss 
stopping study medication with the site before doing  so in order that quest ions can be addressed, 
glycemic therapy adjusted, and a follow-up assess ment arranged. All effo rts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuation; this reason should be documented in the e-CRF. 
The following reasons can lead to permanent discontinuation: 
• At the patient’s own request (ie, w ithdrawal of consent for treatment). 
• If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuation with the administration of the study treatment 
would be detrimental to the patient's well-being. 
• Intercurrent condition that requires permanen t discontinuation of the study treatment as 
long as the abnormality persists and if the ca sual relationship of the concerned event and 
the IMP is possible (according to the In vestigator’s best medical judgment). 
• Deterioration of renal function (defined as increase in serum creatinine > 50% from 
Baseline) that is not recovered after a temporary IMP discontinuation for 2 weeks. 
• Patient requires renal replacement therapy (transplant or dialysis). 
• Pregnancy (in female patients). 
• Specific request of the Sponsor. 
Any abnormal laboratory value will be rechecke d immediately to confirm the result before a 
decision is made to permanent discon tinue IMP for the concerned patient. 
For patients who prematurely discontinue the IM P, the assessments planned at EOT visit  
(Section  10.1.3.2) will be performed at the Premature EOT Visit scheduled preferably prior to 
treatment discontinuation or as soon as possible after the time of discontinua tion (at the latest at 
the next scheduled on-site visit). In the case of premature IMP discontinuation, no sample for 
measuring plasma concentration s hould be taken at the Premature EO T Visit, or at any subsequent 
(electronic

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 visit. The reason(s) for IMP discontinuation will be clearly specified. This Premature EOT 
assessment may occur at a regularly scheduled or at an unscheduled visit. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Every effort should be made to maintain patients in the study. Patients should be followed up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed up as specified in this 
protocol, whichever comes later. 
If a patient decides to discontinue study treatment early, a Premature EOT Visit (see  
Section  10.1.3.2) should be scheduled prior to treatment  discontinuation, if possible. If not 
possible, the Premature EOT should be sche duled as soon as possible after treatment 
discontinuation. In the case of early disc ontinuation, no sample for measuring plasma 
concentration should be taken at the Premature EOT Visit, or at any subsequent visits. For 
patients who discontinue treatment but remain in the study,  the remaining study visits should 
occur as scheduled where possible. Th e IRT should be notified of EOT. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
Patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time 
and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of c onsent for treatment should be distinguished from 
withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits. Patients will be told that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without any adverse effect on their care; however, if they no longer wish to take the IMP, they will be encouraged to remain in the study and attend the remaining study visits. The value of all their study data co llected during their contin ued involvement will be 
emphasized as important to the pub lic health value of the study. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using th e procedure normally planned for the EOS visit. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing. 
All confirmed study withdr awals should be recorded by the Inve stigator in the appropriate screens 
of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unle ss the patient withdraws consent for follow-up, the 
Investigator should make the best effort to cont act the patient (eg, contact patient’s family or 
private physician, review available registries or health care databases), a nd to determine his/her 
health status, including at least his/her vital st atus. Attempts (3 phone call attempts followed by a

dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused. 
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING  
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events 10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a pa tient or clinical i nvestigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal 
relationship with the study treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or 
• Is a medically important event. 
Medical and scientific ju dgment should be exercised in deci ding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizati on but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical or surgical intervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for 
determining which conditi on has to be considered a medically  important event. The list is not 
intended to be exhaustive: 
• Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm

myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc)  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). 
• Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse. 
• ALT >3 times ULN + total bilirubin >2 times ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase 
>10 times ULN. 
• Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality. 
• Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling). 
• Bullous cutaneous eruptions. 
• Cancers diagnosed during the study or aggravated during the study. 
• Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An AESI is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such even ts may require further investigation in order to 
characterize and understand them. Adverse events of  special interest may be added, modified or 
removed during a study by protocol amendment. 
The AESI for this study are: 
• Pregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/NIMP: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient included in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient entered in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2) 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female  patient, IMP should be discontinued  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female patient or in a female partner of a male patient 
is mandatory until the outcome has been determined (see Appendix A ). 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or nonserious) with IMP/NIMP 
- A symptomatic overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event 
suspected by the Investigator or spontaneous ly notified by the patient and resulting in 
clinical symptoms and/or signs accompanied by administration of more than twice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour period. It  will be recorded in the e-CRF as an 
AESI with immediate notification "Symptomatic OVERDOSE (accidental or intentional)" in all cases and will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria

defined as administration of more than tw ice the intended daily dose within a 24-hour 
period, without clinical symptoms and/or signs,  either suspected by the Investigator or 
spontaneously notified by the patient, not based on accountability assessment. It will 
be recorded as an AE "Asymptomatic OVERDOSE, accidental or intentional." 
• ALT increase >3 times ULN. 
10.4.1.4 Events of special interest 
An EOSI is a serious or nonserious AE of scien tific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s 
product or program, for which ongoing monitoring may be appropriate. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize  and understand them. These events should be 
reported on the specific e-CRF page (where applicable) and will only qualify for expedited 
reporting when serious (fulfilling SAE criteria). 
The EOSI for this study are: 
• MACE (CV death, MI, or stroke) and other specif ic CV events (eg, heart failure leading to 
hospitalization). 
• Severe hypoglycemia (see Section  10.6.1). 
• Genital mycotic infections (to include vulvova ginal candidiasis in females and candidal 
balanitis in males). 
• Urinary tract infections. 
• Clinically relevant volume de pletion and events related/possibly related to volume 
depletion. 
• Diarrhea. 
• Pancreatitis. 
• Bone fractures. 
• Venous thrombotic events, to include deep venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (to 
include pulmonary embolism). 
• DKA. 
• Renal events, to include 50% decline in eG FR, end-stage kidney disease, renal death. 
• Malignancies of special interest (breast, bladder, renal cell, Leydig cell, pancreatic, 
prostate, and thyroid cancer). 
• AE leading to an amputation. 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the ICF until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF.

EFC14837 - sotagliflozin Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 84 • Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
• In this study, the use of concomitant medi cations including antidiabetic medications may 
make it difficult to assess the causal relationship, particularly for hypoglycemia. The Global Safety Officer, with input from othe r appropriate study team members, will 
determine the causal relationship when it is not clearly provided by the Investigator. 
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient's observations will continue until 
the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs, or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs if they are 
medically relevant based on the inve stigator’s medical judgment, eg: 
- Symptomatic, and/or 
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or 
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or 
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or 
- Defined as an AESI or EOSI. 
10.4.3 Instructions for reporting serious adverse events 
In the case of occurrence of an SAE, the Investigator or any designees must immediately: 
• ENTER (within 24 hours) the information related to the SAE in the appropriate screens of 
the e-CRF; the system will automatically send the notification to the Monitoring team and 
Pharmacovigilance after approval of the Investigator within the e-CRF. 
• SEND (preferably by fax or e-mail) a photocop y of all examinations carried out and the 
dates on which these examinations were perform ed, to the representative of the monitoring 
team whose name, fax number, and e-mail address appear on the clin ical trial protocol. 
Care should be taken to ensure  that the patient's identity is protected and the patient’s 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant 
medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to

Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest 
For AESIs, the Sponsor/CRO must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE notification guidelines described in Section 10.4.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the corresponding pages of the CRF (t o be sent) or screens in the e-CRF. 
10.4.5 Guidelines for reporting events of special interest 
If an EOSI fulfills the criteria of an SAE,  reporting should be performed according to the 
instructions for reporting of SAEs (see Section  10.4.3). Otherwise, reporting should follow the 
instructions for an AE (see Section  10.4.2). 
10.4.6 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities by Sanofi are provided in Appendix D . 
The following laboratory abnormalities should be monitored, docum ented, and managed 
according to the related flow chart in protocol appendices: 
• Neutropenia 
• Thrombocytopenia 
• Increase in ALT 
• Acute renal insufficiency 
• Suspicion of rhabdomyolysis. 
10.5 OBLIGATIONS OF THE SPONSOR 
During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
• All SAEs that are both unexpected and at leas t reasonably related to the IMP (SUSAR), to 
the regulatory authorities, IECs/ IRBs as appropriate and to the Investigators.  
• All SAEs that are expected and at least reasonably related to the IMPs to the regulatory authorities, according to local regulations.

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypoglycemia 
During the study, patients are instructed to do cument any hypoglycemic episodes in their study 
diary. The hypoglycemia will be reported in the specific e-CRF page with onset date and time, 
symptoms and/or signs, the SMBG value if available, and the treatment. If the event fulfills SAE criteria, hypoglycemia will also be reported as an SAE.  
Hypoglycemia is categorized according to the ADA workgroup on hypoglycemia classification 
(19)(20) and summarized in Figure 1.   
In addition of the threshold of less than or  equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L), hypoglycemia 
episodes with a plasma glucose of <54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) will be analyzed separately.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 87 Figure 1 - Hypoglycemia classification in Study EFC14837 
 
PG: plasma gluc ose; SAE: serious adverse event. 
Severe hypoglycemia 
Severe hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively administer 
carbohydrate, glucagon, intravenous glucose, or other resuscitative actions. These episodes may 
be associated with sufficient neuroglycopeni a to induce seizure, unconsciousness or coma. 
Self-monitored blood glucose values may not be ava ilable, but neurological recovery attributable 
to the restoration of plasma gluc ose to normal is considered sufficient evidence that the event was 
induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Note:  “Requiring assistance of another person” means that the patie nt could not help himself or 
herself to treat the hypoglycemia. Assisting a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not 
required, should not be considered a “requires assistance” incident. 
Any hypoglycemic event which leads to uncons ciousness, coma, or seizure should also be 
reported as an SAE. 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia accompanied by a measured plasma glucose concentration of ≤3.9 mmol/L 
(≤70 mg/dL).

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 88 Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode include increased 
sweating, nervousness, asthenia/weakness, tremor , dizziness, increased appetite, palpitations, 
headache, sleep disorder, confusion, seizures, unconsciousness, or coma. 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia 
Asymptomatic hypoglycemia is an event not acco mpanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycemia 
but with a measured plasma glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L ( ≤70 mg/dL).  
Note:  low plasma glucose values without symptoms or signs should not be reported more than 
once within 30 minutes. Repeated low glucose valu es within a short period could be due to 
malfunction of the device, error testing or following up a low glucose reading. The Investigator 
should try not to document false low SMBG va lues or redundant low glucose values as 
asymptomatic hypoglycemic events. Further clarification with the patients is needed. 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, ( but that was presumably caused by a plasma 
glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/L [ ≤70 mg/dL]), ie, symptoms treated with oral carbohydrate 
without a test of plasma glucose.  
Relative hypoglycemia 
Relative hypoglycemia, recently termed “pseudo-hypoglycemia” ( 20), is an event during which 
the patient reports typical symptoms of hypoglycemia, and interprets the symptoms as indicative 
of hypoglycemia, but with a measured plasma  glucose concentration >3.9 mmol/L (>70 mg/dL). 
10.6.2  Deterioration of renal function 
Patients will be monitored throughout the double-blind Treatment Period and Extension Period for 
signs of deterioration in renal f unction (eg, decrease in eGFR or in crease in creatinine as defined 
below) as well as other routine clinical and laboratory findings (see Study Flowchart, Section  1.2). 
If at any visit after Randomization up to Week 8 there is a rise in creatinine level (ie, >50% increase from Baseline level, where Baseline level is defined as the mean of creatinine values obtained at Screening and Randomizati on) or if at any visit after Week 8 there is a rise of >50% 
above the mean of creatinine values from last 2 visits, the Investigator should ensure that no 
reasonable explanation exists for creatinine increase and in particular the following causes: 
• Medications that increase creatinine 
• Decrease in cardiac output 
• Obstructive uropathy 
• Urinary tract infection 
• Volume depletion.

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size/power calculations were performed based on the primary endpoint. Assuming a 
common standard deviation (SD) of 1.2% and using a 2-sided test at a 0.05 α-level, 130 patients 
in each CKD stratum (3A or 3B) in each tr eatment group will provide the following power: 
• To detect a treatment difference of 0.6% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to 
Week 26 between sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo: 
- 98% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3A 
stratum. 
- 98% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3B stratum. 
- 99% power comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo in overall patient 
population. 
• To detect a treatment difference of 0.5% in mean HbA1c change from Baseline to 
Week 26 between sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo: 
- 91% power comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3A 
stratum 
- 91% power comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo in patients in CKD 3B 
stratum

11.3 ANALYSIS OF POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment group allocated by the IRT according to the 
randomization schedule at the Randomization Visit (as randomized), irrespective of the treatment 
actually received. 
11.3.1.1 Intent-to-treat population 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the intent-t o-treat (ITT) population, defined as all randomized 
patients irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be

Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least 1 dose of double-blind IMP (regardless of the amount of treatment administered). 
Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses  according to the treatment actually received. 
In addition: 
• Non-randomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately. 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety  population as randomized. 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotagliflozi n and placebo, the patient will be analyzed in 
the sotagliflozin group (depending on the treatment kit taken [400 mg or 200 mg]). 
• When a patient is exposed to both sotag liflozin 400 mg (treatment kit) and 200 mg 
(treatment kit), the patient will be anal yzed in the sotagliflozin 200 mg group. 
• Randomized patients will be excluded from the safety population only if there is 
documented evidence (ie, all study dates recorded as no medication taken) that patients 
have not taken the study medication. 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Continuous data will be summa rized by treatment group using the number of observations 
available (N), mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum. Categorical data will be summarized 
by treatment group using count and percentage. 
In general, descriptive statistics of quantitative efficacy and safety parameters (result and change from Baseline) by scheduled visits will be provided. 
The Baseline value is defined ge nerally as the last available value before the first dose of 
double-blind IMP or the last available value prior to randomization for patients who were 
randomized but never exposed to IMP. For serum creatinine and eGFR, the Baseline value is  defined as the average of all values before 
the first dose of double-blind IMP for those rando mized and exposed or before randomization for 
those who were randomized but never exposed to IMP. Analysis of demographics and Baseline characteristics, prior and concomitant medications will be 
provided in detail in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

The extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed by the duration of treatment exposure 
during the study.  
The duration of treatment exposure will be the total number of days of administration of the 
double-blind IMP, regardless of unplanned interm ittent discontinuations . The duration of IMP 
exposure will be calculated as: 
 (Date of the last double-blind IMP taken – Date of the first double-blind IMP taken) + 1 The number (%) of patients randomized and exposed to double-blind IMP will be presented by 
specific time periods for each treatment group. The time  periods of interest will be defined in the 
SAP. 
Descriptive statistics of duration of treatment  exposure (number, mean, SD, minimum, median, 
and maximum) and cumulative exposure in patient years will also be presented by treatment 
group in the safety population. 
11.4.1.2 Compliance 
A given administration will be c onsidered noncompliant if the pa tient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by the protocol. No imputations will be made for patients with missing or incomplete data. 
Treatment compliance, above-p lanned and under-planned dosing pe rcentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, mean, SD, medi an, minimum, and maximum). The percentage of patients with 
compliance <80% will be summarized. In addition, th e number and percentage of patients with at 
least 1 above-planned dosing admin istration will be given, as well as the number and percentage 
of patients with 0, 0 to 20%, and >20% under-planne d dosing administrations. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population. Statistical testing will be performed for primary  endpoint and secondary endpoints at Week 26 (or 
Week 12 for SBP). All efficacy endpoints after W eek 26 will only be summarized by descriptive 
statistics without formal statistical testing. 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
The statistical test will be two-sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level. Analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c; see 
Section  9.1.1) will be performed on the ITT populati on, using HbA1c measurements obtained 
from visits during the study, including those obtai ned after IMP discontinuation or introduction of

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 94 The primary efficacy endpoint of change in HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 will be analyzed 
with missing values imputed by control-base d multiple imputation method under the missing not 
at random framework: 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data. 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin group, missing da ta will be imputed as if the patients were 
on placebo throughout the study, where all patients' measurements including the on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
Each of the complete datasets will be analyzed  by an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, versus placebo in overall patient population (ie, CKD 3A and 3B patients combined), the model will include treatment (sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), randomization stratum of Screening 
HbA1c (≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratu m of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), 
randomization stratum of CKD stage (3A, 3B), an d country as fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c 
value as a covariate.  
To compare sotagliflozin 400 mg and 200 mg, respectively, versus placebo in each CKD stratum, 
the model will include treatment  (sotagliflozin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, and placebo), 
randomization stratum of Screening HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomizati on stratum of Screening 
SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), randomization stratum of CKD stage (3A, 3B), treatment by 
randomization stratum of CKD stage, and country as  fixed effects, and Baseline HbA1c value as a 
covariate. 
Results from each complete datase t will be combined to provide the adjusted mean change in 
HbA1c from Baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group, as well as the between-group 
difference (comparing each sotagliflozin group vers us placebo) and its associated 95% confidence 
interval (CI) using appropriate contrast statements. 
Summary statistics (for Screening value, Baselin e value, observed values, and observed changes 
from Baseline) at scheduled visits will be provided for each treatment group and by CKD stages 
(3A, 3B). The summary will include the number of observations, mean, SD, standard error (SE), 
minimum, median, and maximum. Graphical presentations will also be used to examine trends 
over time using mean values (± SE) and mean changes from Baseline (± SE) at each of the scheduled visits (using OC). 
Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup 
Descriptive analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined by the fo llowing Baseline or Screening factors: 
• Race 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic) 
• Age group (<50 years, ≥50 to <65 years, ≥65 years)

• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m²) 
• Baseline HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%) 
• Baseline SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥ 130 mmHg) 
• Country. 
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the ITT population, and using a similar 
approach to the analysis for the primary effica cy endpoint. The adjusted estimates of treatment 
mean differences (each sotagliflozin group versus  placebo) with SE and 95% CIs will be provided 
as appropriate across the subgroups. 
In the event that the subgroup factor is identi cal or similar to a randomization strata factor 
(eg, Baseline HbA1c category), only the subgroup fact or (as a single factor and/or an interaction 
term) will be included in the model in order to avoid the issue of collinearity in the analysis. The 
corresponding strata factor will not be included in the model. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary endpoints (see Section  9.1.2) will be analyzed using a similar approach to the 
primary efficacy endpoint with missing values  imputed by control-based multiple imputation 
method under the missing not at random framework. 
• For placebo patients, missing data will be imputed based on the placebo group data. 
• For patients in the sotagliflozin group, missing da ta will be imputed as if the patients were 
on placebo group throughout the study, where a ll patients' measurements including the 
on-treatment measurements will be considered as if the measurements were from the placebo group in the imputation model. 
For each of the continuous secondary endpoints, each  of the complete datasets will be analyzed by 
an ANCOVA model with treatment (sotagliflo zin 400 mg, sotagliflozin 200 mg, placebo), 
randomization stratum of HbA1c ( ≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratum of Screening SBP 
(<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), CKD stage at Screening (3A, 3B ), and country as fixed effects, and 
Baseline secondary endpoint value as a covariat e. Results from each comp lete datase t will be 
combined to provide the adjusted mean change from Baseline to Week 26 (or Week 12 for SBP) for each treatment group, as well as the between -group difference (comparing each sotagliflozin 
group versus placebo) and its associated 95% CI using appropriate contrast statements. 
The categorical secondary efficacy variables of  HbA1c <6.5%, <7% at Week 26 will be analyzed 
using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method stratifie d by the randomization stratum of Screening 
HbA1c (≤8.5%, >8.5%), randomization stratu m of Screening SBP (<130 mmHg, ≥130 mmHg), 
and CKD stage at Screening (3A, 3B). The pr oportion in each treatment group will be provided, 
as well as the difference of proportions between so tagliflozin and placebo w ith associated 2-sided 
95% CI. For HbA1c responders at Week 26 (<6.5%, <7% respectively), all values at Week 26 will

Graphical presentations will also be used to illustrate trends over time. 
11.4.2.4 Multiplicity considerations 
To control the family-wise type I error, a hi erarchical testing procedure will be applied. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c), the hypotheses 
of statistical superiority of sotagliflozin versus placebo will be tested at 2-sided 5% significance level in the following population and order. The testing will stop as soon as the endpoint is found 
to be not statistically significant at α  = 0.05 (2-sided). 
• Comparing sotagliflozin 400 mg versus placebo, in: 
- The overall patient population (i e, patients in stratum CKD 3A and stratum CKD 3B) 
- Patients in stratum CKD 3A 
- Patients in stratum CKD 3B. 
• Comparing sotagliflozin 200 mg versus placebo, in: - The overall patient population (i e, patients in stratum CKD 3A and stratum CKD 3B) 
- Patients in stratum CKD 3A 
- Patients in stratum CKD 3B. 
Once the primary variable (change from Baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c) is statistically significant 
at α = 0.05 (2-sided) in all 6 populations in the orde r above, a hierarchical testing procedure will 
be performed to test the following main stud y secondary efficacy variables in the overall 
population by the following prioritized order. The testing will stop as soon as an endpoint is found 
to be not statistically significant at α  = 0.05 (2-sided).

Safety endpoints are presented in Section  9.2. The summary of safety results will be presented by 
treatment group. The safety data will be summarized for the 26-week double-blind Treatment 
Period and the entire treatment peri od separately, unless specified ot herwise. All safety analyses 
will be performed on the safe ty population as defined in Section  11.3.2 using the following 
common rules: 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values for clinical laboratory 
tests and vital signs are define d as abnormal values considered  medically important by the 
Sponsor’s Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology department and in effect at the 
time of the final SAP approval. The PCSA criteria for parameters not cited in the protocol 
as safety parameters will not be analyzed. 
• The PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the on-Treatment Period, taking into account all eval uations performed during the on-Treatment 
Period, including unscheduled or repeated ev aluations. The number of all such patients 
will be the numerator for the on-treatment PCSA percentage.

determination of on-treat ment PCSA values and the last on- treatment value for the laboratory, 
vital sign and ECG parameters. 
11.4.3.1 Analysis of adverse events 
Pre-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
pre-Treatment Period. 
Treatment-emergent AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened  (according to the Investigator’s 
opinion) or became serious during the on-Treatment Period. Post-treatment AEs  are AEs that developed or worsened or became serious during the 
post-Treatment Period. The primary focus of AE reporting in the CSR will be on TEAEs. Pre- and post-treatment AEs 
will be described separately. 
All adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high-level group te rm (HLGT) and preferred term (PT) sorted in 
alphabetical order for each treatment group, th e number (n) and percentage (%) of patients 
experiencing an AE. Multiple occurrences of the same event in the same patient will be counted 
only once in the tables within a treatment phase. The denominator for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group.  
Summaries of all TEAEs in each  treatment group will include: 
• The overview of AEs, summarizing number (%) of patients with any 
- TEAE 
- Serious TEAE 
- TEAE leading to death 
- TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. 
• The number (n) and percentage (%) of patient s with at least one TEAE by primary SOC, 
HLGT, HLT, and PT. 
• Summary of TEAEs by maximal severity (severe, moderate, mild), presented by primary 
SOC and PT. 
• Summary of TEAEs possibly related to IMP, presented by primary SOC, HLGT, HLT and 
PT.

No formal interim analysis for efficacy is plan ned since analysis of primary and key secondary 
efficacy endpoints will be considered final at the t ime of first step analyses described below. The 
study analyses will be conducted in 2 steps. 
• First step: Efficacy analyses up to Week 26 and interim safety analyses 
The first step analyses will be conducted when  all patients have been  randomized and have 
their data at the minimum up to Week 26 collected and validated. The first step analyses will 
include: 
- Efficacy analyses up to Week 26, which ar e considered as the final analyses for 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. 
- Interim safety analyses which will be performed on all safety data collected and 
validated at the time of the first step analyses. 
The first step analyses will not be used to change the conduct of the ongoing study in any 
aspect. Since the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses would have been concluded at 
the time of the first step analyses, the signif icance level for the study remains at 0.05 (see 
Section  11.4.2.4). The first step analyses will be included in the submission dossier to health 
authorities. 
• Second step: Final analyses 
The second step analyses will be conducted at th e end of the study. The second step analyses 
will include the final analyses of efficacy e ndpoints at Week 52 and safety endpoints, which 
will be descriptive only. 
Individuals who are involved in the unblinding of th e first step analysis will not be involved in the 
conduct of the study afterwards. 
An independent DMC will monito r and assess the safety of patients from this trial through 
periodic review of the accumulated safety data  provided by an independent statistical group. 
Related details are provided in separate documents (D MC charter and DMC SAP).

DEFINITIONS 
Nonreproductive potential 
1. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: - Documented hysterectomy 
- Documented bilateral salpingectomy 
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy 
2. Postmenopausal - A postmenopausal state is defined as no mens es for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high FSH level in the pos tmenopausal range may be  used to confirm 
a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone 
replacement therapy (HRT). However, in th e absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a 
single FSH measurement is insufficient.  
- Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the highly effective contraception methods if  they wish to continue their HRT during 
the study. Otherwise, they must disc ontinue HRT to allo w confirmation of 
postmenopausal status before study enrollment. 
Reproductive potential  (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered of reproductive potential (WOCBP), ie, fertile, following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently  sterile. Permanent sterilization methods 
include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. 
CONTRACEPTIVE GUIDANCE 
Women of reproductive potential (WOCBP) must us e a highly effective method of contraception 
during the treatment period and the post-treatment follow up peri od (28 ±3 days). If another 
contraceptive method is used (such as a barrier method), it should be used in combination with 
one of the highly effective methods (such as an oral contraceptive).

Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctlya 
• Combined (estrogen- and progestogen-containing ) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation 
- oral 
- intravaginal 
- transdermal 
• Progestogen-only hormone contraception a ssociated with inhibition of ovulation 
- oral 
- injectable 
Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent 
• Implantable progestogen-only hormone cont raception associated with inhibition of 
ovulation 
• Intrauterine device (IUD) 
• Intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS) 
• Bilateral tubal occlusion 
• Vasectomized partner 
(Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole 
sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If 
not, an additional highly effective method(s) of contraception should be used. Spermatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days.)  
• Sexual abstinence 
(Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.)  
NOTE: 
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regul ations 
regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 117 COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
Male patients with partners of reproductive potential who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any female partner of a 
male study patient who becomes pregnant while participating in this study. This applies 
only to patients who receive study treatment. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed  consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy.  
• Partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor.  
• Generally, follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery 
date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence 
or absence of anomalies) or  indication for procedure.  
Female patients who become pregnant  
• The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient, who becomes pregnant while participating in this study.  
• Information will be recorded on the appropriat e form and submitted to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of learning of a participant's pregnancy.  
• Participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The Investigator will collect follow-up information on participant and neonate, which will be forwarded to 
the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be re quired for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond 
the estimated delivery date.  
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be  an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication 
or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. 
• Any SAE occurring as a result of a post-stud y pregnancy which is considered reasonably 
related to the study treatment by the Inves tigator, will be reported to the Sponsor as 
described in Section  10.4.3. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study patients, he/she  may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 118 Appendix B Recommendations on basic genito-urinary hygiene, maintaining 
hydration, and recognizing diabetic ketoacidosis 
Patients with T2D are at risk for developing GU infections. The following guidelines should be 
communicated to females and uncircumcised males regarding GU infections. Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
For females: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep your bladder and urethra free from 
infection: 
• Go to the toilet as soon as you feel the need to urinate, rather than holding it in.  
• Wipe from front to back after going to the toilet.  
• Practice good hygiene by washing your genita ls every day, and before having sex.  
• Empty your bladder after having sex.”  
For uncircumcised males: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to keep the foreskin free from infection: 
• Wash the end of your penis and foreskin with soap and water (do not let soap get in the 
opening).  
• After your shower or bath, dry the end of your penis and foreskin properly and replace the foreskin.  
• Also, when you urinate, slide the foreskin back enough so that urine does not get on the foreskin-this helps to keep it clean.” 
Maintaining Hydration: 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors are associated with osmotic diuresis and volume 
depletion, which may lead to dizz iness or hypotension, especially in the elderly. Before initiating 
study drug (at Screening, Run-in and Randomization)  and during all on-site study visits thereafter, 
assess volume status in patients with  renal impairment, the elderly, in patients with low SBP, or if 
receiving diuretics, angiotensin- converting-enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers. 
All patients will be advised to maintain proper fluid intake and to consider increasing it if they sense greater thirst, more urine producti on, or if they feel dizzy or faint. 
Patient communication cards will be printed with the following for patients with T2D: 
“The following advice may be useful in helpin g you to maintain prope r hydration and prevent 
dehydration: 
• Dehydration is when your body loses too much fluid, frequently due to diarrhea or 
increased urination

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 119 • Consider increasing the amount of fluids you drink if: 
- You sense greater thirst than usual 
- You have a dry mouth or cracked lips 
- You have a fever 
- You have diarrhea or vomiting  
- You urinate more frequently or in larger amounts than usual 
- You get up in the middle of the night to urinate (more than usual) 
- You feel dizzy or light-headed 
- You exercise, or when it is hot outside”  
Recognizing Diabetic Ketoacidosis 
Potential gastrointestinal (GI) AEs occurring with  sotagliflozin may mask presenting symptoms of 
diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Patient communication cards will be printed with the following: 
“If you have any of these symptoms on the list, then contact your study site immediately for 
assistance with managing your diabetes: 
• Inability to maintain oral intake 
• Generalized weakness 
• Abdominal (belly) pain 
• Increased weight loss 
• Fever 
• Frequent urination, including at night 
• Fruity-scented breath 
• Confusion 
• Acute illness 
• Consistently elevated blood glucose 
• Feeling very thirsty or drinking a lot 
• Nausea or vomiting 
• Having trouble thinking clearly or feeling tired 
It is possible to have DKA even if your blood glucose is not elevated. Regardless of your blood 
glucose level, if you have any of these sympto ms on the list, then contact your study site 
regarding the need to be evaluated for possible DKA, which will include specific blood testing. If 
your study site is closed and your study doctor is  not available, go to the nearest emergency room 
for evaluation.

please contact your study doctor fo r instructions on continuing study drug. In such cases your 
study doctor may advise you NOT to take your st udy drug from the day prior to the procedure or 
surgery until after the procedure or surgery is co mplete, and you are taking food and liquids as 
you normally do.” 
Whenever AE data is collected or the patient  reports DKA or intercurrent illness (including 
infections), generalized weakness, increased weight loss, GI symptoms including nausea, 
vomiting, or abdominal pain or other symptoms or signs that the Investigator believes may be 
consistent with DKA, then the site will determine if an assessment for DKA is appropriate. If 
laboratory testing confirms pres ence of metabolic acidosis, then the “Possible DKA” e-CRF will 
be completed.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 121 Appendix C Measurement of Blood Pressure and Pulse Rate  
Equipment 
1. Blood pressure measurements will be taken by an automated BP monitor or a manual 
sphygmomanometer 
2. Bladder Length – Should nearly or completely encircle the patient’s arm. For many adults, 
the standard “adult” size bladder is not l ong enough and the “large” size bladder is 
recommended 
3. Bladder Width – Should be at least 40% of the bladder length 
Patient Factors 
Extraneous variables associated  with the measurement of BP should be minimized. These include: 
1. Food intake, caffeine-containing beverages,  cigarette smoking, or strenuous exercise 
within 2 hours prior to measurement 
2. Full urinary bladder 
3. The patient should not be allowed to talk while BP is being measured 
4. The patient should be placed in the examination room and the cuff should be placed on the 
patient’s nondominant arm. The proper sized cuff should fit snugly with the lower edge 
2 to 3 cm above the antecubital fossa 
5. The patient should be allowed to sit quietly in a comfortably warm place (temperature 
around 25°C or 77°F) for 5 minutes with the arm supported at heart level, preferably with 
the cuff in place and with no restrictive cl othing on the arm. The patient should be 
encouraged not to tense his or her muscles. 
Determination of the arm with  the highest blood pressure 
At Visit 1 (week -4), seated BP should be meas ured in both arms after 5-minute rest period, and 
then again after 1 minute in both arms in seated position. The arm with the highest SBP will be determined at this visit, and BP should be  measured in this arm throughout the study.  
Measurement Technique (22) 
At Visit 1, immediately following arm selecti on, with the patient in the same position, an 
additional seated BP should be measured in th e selected arm (at least 1 minute after last 
measurement). 
At all other on-site visits, following the 5-minut e rest period, 3 separate seated BPs should be 
measured in the arm selected at Visit 1, with at least 1 minute between BP measurements and with 
the cuff fully deflated between measurements.

Study Title:  An In Vivo Recovery and Survival Study of Platelets Collected on the Trima 
Accel System and Stored in InterSol  Solution  
CIP #:  CTS-5066  
Amendment Version / Date:  Version 2.0/ 10 JUL 2017  
Replaces CIP Version / Date:  Version 1.0/27 FEB 2017 
Rationale:  This CIP was update d to clarify that participant s are not allowed to take aspirin 
or aspirin containing  medications, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs ), anti -platelet agents, or other drugs affecting platelet viability  for the 
duration of the study . Because the study’s primary endpoint s relate to platelet 
survival and recovery, this clarification is necessary to ensure the platelets being 
evaluated are not exposed to drugs affecting their viability throughout the study . 
Additionally, this amendment ensures  participant s are aware that they are not 
permitted  to take these medications , and if they do, they will be discontinued 
from the study. The  inclusion criteria, study procedures, and reason for study 
procedure discontinuation/termination were updated to better clarify this 
requirement . 
 Additionally, this CIP amendment addresses a minor typographical error noted 
by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the section of the 
CIP outlining the number of participants . The CIP incorrectly stated “an 
approximate 45% screen fail/ early termination rate  which would allow up to  40 
healthy adult participants to be enrolled in this study ”. Applying a 45% screen 
fail/early termination rate would result in total enrollment of 44 subjects. This 
study will only enroll up to 40 healthy adult participants, therefore the 
approximate screen fail/early termination rate was changed from 45% to 40%.  
Administrative changes, typographical error corrections,  abbreviations  and 
minor wording changes for clarity have been made and will not be reflected in 
the table below.

Study Title:  An In Vivo Recovery and Survival Study of Platelets Collected on the Trima Accel 
System and Stored in InterSol Solution  
Study Number:  CTS-5066 
Target Population:  Healthy Adult Volunteer Donors  
Device Description:  The Trima Accel® Automated Blood Collection  system (Trima Accel system) is an 
automated blood component collection system that uses centrifugal force to separate 
donor blood into platelet, plasma, and red blood cell (RBC) components and uses Acid Citrate Dextrose, Formula A (ACD -A) as the anticoagulant. The device is comprised 
of 3 major sub -systems: 1) the Trima machine itself ; 2) sterile, single use disposable 
blood tubing sets ; and 3) embedded software. There are additional optional accessories 
such as plasma bag, platelet bag, seal safe system, and barcode scanner kit.  
Terumo BCT’s Trima Accel system received United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance for hyperconcentrated platelet collections on 
17 December  2012 (BK120049).  
Fenwal’s InterSol
® was cleared by the FDA on 09 December  2009 (BN080041), as a 
platelet additive solution (PAS) for the replacement of 65% plasma in platelet components for use with Am icus™ Separator System.  
Intended Use:  The intended use for the Trima Accel system  and PAS (InterSol) combination to be 
evaluated in this investigational s tudy is to use the Trima Accel s ystem to collect 
platelet concentrates from normal healthy donors and  to re-suspend the platelets in 
35% plasma and 65% InterSol for storage and subsequent transfusion into patients requiring blood product support.  
Study Centers Planned:  2 centers in the United States . 
Objective:  The primary objective of this study is to determine the in vivo recovery and survival  of 
radiolabeled platelet s collected on the Trima Accel s ystem , diluted in 65% 
InterSol/35% plasma, and stored for 5 days .  
Efficacy Endpoints : Primary Efficacy Endpoint s: 
The primary endpoint for this study will  be recovery and survival as calculated using 
the COST software.  
1. For recovery: Test – 0.66*Control ≥ 0 with a 1 sided 97.5% confidence limit 
2. For survival: Test – 0.58*Control ≥ 0 with a 1 sided 97.5% confidence limit 
Safety Endpoint s: Safety will be monitored through the collection of adverse events (AEs), serious  
adverse events (SAEs), and unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) from  the 
start of the apheresis procedure venipunc ture until study completion . Products will be 
destroy ed per the site’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) after all testing has been 
completed.

Confidential  Page 8 of 46 Study Design:  This is a prospective, open -label, multicenter , controlled study to evaluate in vivo 
recovery and survi val of radiolabeled apheresis platelets collected on the Trima Accel 
system and sto red in 65% InterSol/ 35% plasma for 5 days . 
One ( 1) Test unit will be collected as a hyperconcentrated  platelet product. The Test 
unit will be diluted to a final ratio of 65% InterSol/ 35% plasma . 
After collection, the Test unit will be stored at room temperature with agitation for 
5 days.  
On Day 5, study sites  will follow the “Platelet Radiolabeling  Procedure” published by 
Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion ( BEST ) and their SOPs  for platelet 
radiolabeling, infusion, radioactivity sampling, and recovery and survival calculations . 
Following storage for 5 days, an aliquot of Test platelets will be radiolabeled with 
either 111In or 51Cr. Similarly an aliquot of freshly prepared platelets derived from a 
whole blood  sample  donated on Day 5 (Control) will be tagged with the radiolabel not 
used in the Test platelets. The identity of the label (51Cr or 111In) used for Test and 
Control platelets will be randomized . The labeled aliquots will then be infused 
simultaneously on Day 5  (BEST Day 0)  back to the autologous donor . On Study Day 5 
(BEST Day 0) samples will be drawn at 0 (pre- infusion)  and 2 hours ± 15 minutes 
post-infusion . Next, 1 sample will be drawn daily (except on weekends) from  Study  
Day 6 thr ough Day 12 (BEST Day  1  ̶  7) for a total of 5 samples. To conclude , 1 final 
sample will be drawn on Study Day 15, 16, or 17 (BEST Day 10, 11,  or 12). Recovery 
and survival will be calculated at each site according to the COST software.  
Study Duration:  Study participation will be up to  9 visits.  Screening may be done within 5 days prior to 
the apheresis procedure or combined as 1 visit, which includes screening and the 
apheresis procedure all in 1 day.   
The entire study is anticipated to last approximately 5 months . 
Statistical 
Methodology:  Primary Endpoints:  
The primary endpoint s of this study are to show that recovery and survival of  platelet s 
collected on the Trima Accel system,  diluted in 65% InterSol/35% plasma and stored 
for 5 days meet FDA standards defined by:  
• For recovery: Test – 0.66*Control ≥ 0 with a 1 -sided 97.5% confidence limit 
• For survival: Test – 0.58*Control ≥ 0 with a 1 -sided 97.5% confidence limit 
Recovery (at 24 hours) is expressed as a percentage of the extrapolated platelet count at time 0. Survival is expressed in hours and is approximated using linear regression.  
For each endpoint, paired differences within each participa nt will be used to construct 
the lower limit of a 1-sided 97.5% confidence intervals. If the lower limit is greater 
than 0 for both endpoints, the test product will be declared to meet the FDA  standard.

1.1 Background 
Platelet transfusions are used extensively for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding 
associated with major trauma, surgery , chemotherapy, and in thrombocytopenic individuals (have 
low platelet count) as well as those with  platelet dysfunctions. The p latelets used for platelet 
transfusions are separated from donor blood through either whole blood collections  or advanced 
apheresis techniques. In the United States, the majority of platelets used for transfusion are routinely collected and stored in 100% donor plasma.  
In Europe it is common practice to replace part of the storage plasma with a platelet additive 
solution (PAS). The rationale behind this is that diluting the plasma with PAS may reduce the 
risk of deleterious rea ctions such as allergic reactions because there are fewer  cellular mediators 
present  than found in 100% plasma.
1 Substituting PAS for plasma may have o ther advantages as 
well. Platelet additive solutions have  a more consistent composition than plasma from different 
donors, can be optimized for longer storage, and allow  for a more frugal use of blood 
components since more plasma can then be used for other applications instead of platelet 
storage.2,3 
Platelet additive solutions have been used for over 20 years in Europe. In the United States, the 
first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the use of PAS was in 2009. This first 
approval was for the use of the InterSol Solution ( a PAS-E) as a replacement of 65% plasma in 
platelet components. A second PAS, IsoplateTM Solution ( a PAS-F), has since been cleared by the 
FDA  (March 5, 2015, BN090067/0). In Europe, platelet additive solutions  and apheresis devices 
are approved separately, but in the United States the use of a PAS is linked to the specific apheresis device used to obtain the platelets. The Isoplate Solution is approved for use with the 
Trima Accel
® Automated Blood Collection Sys tem (Trima A ccel system) and the InterSol 
Solution (hereon referred to as InterSol) is approved for use with the AmicusTM Separator System  
(Amicus) . 
Terumo BCT is pursuing FDA clearance for InterSol in combination with the Trima Accel 
system in order to provide blood centers with the option to use InterSol as well as Isoplate Solution when collecting platelets to be stored in a  PAS.  
2 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
2.1 Trima Accel System Device Description  
The Trima Accel system is an automated blood component collection system that uses 
centrifugal force to separate whole blood into platelet, plasma, and red blood cell (RBC) 
InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 15 of 46 components. These blood components are either collected into storage bags, or returned to the 
donor . The Trima Accel system consists of:  
• The Trima Accel m achine 
• Embedded software 
• Disposable tubing s ets 
• Optional a ccessories, connected to the system which  can include: 
o Accessory storage plasma bag  
o Accessory storage platelet bag  
o Trima Accel seal safe system  
o Trima barcode scanner k it 
The products collected depend on the disposable tubing collection set used, the donor specific parameters (donor’s total blood volume, hematocrit [ HCT ] or hemoglobin [Hgb], and platelet 
count) entered at the time of collection, and the procedure selected. Donor blood type may also be used to limit which blood components are collected.  
The current Trima Accel system equipment is approximately 42 inches tall and 21 inches wide, 
and weighs less th an 200 pounds. The Trima Accel system uses disposable tubing sets with a 
cassette that automatically loads the tubing into the pumps, valves, and sensors. The touch screen 
display is designed to lead the operator through the setup and operating procedures, and provide 
detailed messages to assist in troubleshooting the collection procedures. 
Figure 2-1 identifies the major components of the Trima Accel system .

 a. The IV pole is a metal tube with an arm that 
contains hooks for hanging the product bags. 
The pole is lowered for transport.  
b. The product bags are part of the disposable tubing set. Product bags hold the collected  
RBCs, platelets, and plasma.  
c. The touch- screen display is the screen that is 
used to monitor and control the blood collection procedure. Throughout the procedure, the display guides the operator 
from step to step.  
d. The cassette is part of the disposable tubing set that snaps into place on t he front of the 
system. The cassette guides the flow of 
blood and blood products through the 
system. It also ensures that the tubing is 
positioned so that the pumps, valves, and sensors are loaded automatically.  
e. The 5 pumps are the components that push 
the blood and products through the system.  
f. The filler is designed with a groove in which 
the channel is loaded. The filler comprises 
the top portion of the centrifuge.  
g. The centrifuge is a rotating device that spins 
at up to 3,000 rpm, creating a gravitational force to separate the whole blood into its 
components.  
h. The wheels  can be locked in position to 
stabilize the Trima Accel system during a 
collection procedure or unlocked to easily 
move the Trima Accel system to a new 
location.  
The Trima Accel system was cleared by FDA for the collection of hyperconcentrated platelets 
stored in Isoplate (BK120049) on 17 December 2012 . There will be no modification to the Trima 
Accel device for this study and it will be used as described in the Trima Accel Operator’s 
Manual.  
The Trima Accel Platelet + Sampler + AutoPAS MultiPlasma, RBC disposable set was cleared 
by the FDA (BK120049) on 17 December 2012. This disposable set will be used for the collection of hyperconcentrated platelets in this study as described in the Trima Accel Operator’s 
Manual.  
2.2 InterSol Solution  
InterSol, from Fenwal™, a Fresenius Kabi company, was FDA approved for the storage of 
hyperconcentrated platelets (BN080041) on 09 December 2009. InterSol is an isotonic solution 

InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 17 of 46 designed to replace a proportion of the plasma used in the storage of Amicus derived 
leukoreduced apheresis platelets under standard blood banking conditions. 
The solution contains: sodium acetate as a nutrient, sodium citrate to prevent platelet clumping 
and activation, sodium phosphate for buffering, and sodium chloride for osmolarity. InterSol 
does not have a pharmacological effect in vivo, but rather acts to provide the appropriate environment for platelet storage in lieu of a portion of the plasma normally used. 
InterSol is provided as a 500 mL sterile and non-pyrogenic solution in a non-citrated polyvinyl 
chloride ( PVC ) plastic container with a sterile and non-pyrogenic fluid path. 
Each 100 mL contains 305 mg Dibasic Sodium Phosphate, Anhydrous, United States Pharmacopeia ( USP); 93 mg Monobasic Sodium Phosphate, Monohydrate, USP; 318 mg 
Sodium Citrate, Dihydrate, USP; 442 mg Sodium Acetate, Trihydrate, USP; 452 mg Sodium Chloride, USP; Water for Injection, USP quantity sufficient.

3 INTENDED USE STATEME NT 
The intended use for the Trima Accel system and PAS (InterSol) combination to be evaluated in 
this investigational study is to use the Trima Accel system to collect platelet concentrates from 
normal donors and to re-suspend the platelets in 35% plasma/ 65% InterSol for storage and 
subsequent transfusion into patients requiring blood product support.  
4 CLINICAL STUDY EXPER IENCE  
A randomized, paired, prospective, open-label, multicenter, controlled study was conducted in 
2016 to evaluate the in vitro quality of platelets collected on the Trima Accel system and stored 
for up to 7 days in 65% InterSol/35% plasma (Test) compared to platelets stored in 100% plasma 
(Control). All the Test products had a pH ≥ 6.2 after 5 and 7 days of storage and thus met the FDA acceptance criteria for pH.
5,6 
Secondary endpoint analyses of partial pressure of oxygen (pO 2), partial pressure of carbon 
dioxide (pCO 2), bicarbonate (HCO 3-), lactate, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), extent of 
shape change (ESC), hypotonic shock response (HSR), morphology, and P- selectin were 
performed after storage of the products for 5 and 7 days. Of these secondary endpoints, only 
ESC, HSR, morphology, and P- selectin had established acceptance criteria. Morphology met the 
established acceptance criteria but ESC, HSR , and P- selectin values did not. The results from this 
study of Trima Accel collected platelets stored in InterSol are consistent with results of similar 
studies evaluating Amicus collected platelets stored in InterSol.6,7

Confidential  Page 18 of 46 5 RATIONALE FOR THE CURRENT STUDY  
This is a prospective, open -label, multicenter , controlled study to evaluate the in vivo platelet  
recovery and survival of hyperconcentrated platelets coll ected on the Trima Accel system and 
stored for 5 days in InterSol. In order to promote better standardization among the industry for 
determining the safety and effectiveness of different platelets products (ie, different collection 
methods, different processing procedures, and/or different storage conditions), the FDA has 
issued guidance outlining the appropriate study design for in vivo platelet evaluation.8 This 
guidance recommends the radiolabeling of both st ored (Test) and fresh (C ontrol) platelets and 
their autologous reinfusion for the determination of recovery and survival.8 Using these 
recommendations, the Biomedical Excellence for Safer Transfusion  (BEST) Collaborative 
generated a platelet radiolabeling protocol that provides a detailed procedure  for the generation, 
infusion, timing of blood draws, and calculations needed to determine the platelet recovery and survival of new platelet products.
9  
Using the BEST Collaborative protocol, this study will determine the recovery and survival of 5 day platelets stored in 65% InterSol/35% plasma. Specifically, a single hyperconcentrated 
platelet unit will be collected on the Trima Accel system, diluted with 65% InterSol/35% plasma,  
and stored at room temperature with agitation for 5 days (Test). On Study Day 5, the T est 
platelets will be radiolabeled with either Indium 111 (
111In) or Chromium 51 (51Cr) according to 
a predetermined randomization scheme and their recovery and survival will be compared to fresh 
platelets (Control) radiolabeled with the other radio isotope (111In or 51Cr).  The recovery and 
survival of Test platelets will be calculated at each site according to the COST software.  
6 OBJE CTIVE 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the  in vivo recovery and survival of 
radiolabeled platelets collected on  the Trima Accel s ystem, dilut ed in InterSol , and stored for 
5 days. 
7 EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
7.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint s 
The primary  endpoint for this study will be the  recovery and survival of platelets as calculated 
using the COST software. Recovery (at 24 hours) is expressed as a percentage of the extrapolated platelet count at time 0. Survival is expressed in hours and is approximated using 
linear regression . 
1. In vivo radiolabeled platelet recovery > 66% 
2. In vivo radiolabeled platelet survival > 58%  
InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 19 of 46 For each endpoint, paired differences within each participant  will be used to construct the lower 
limit of a 1-sided 97.5% confidence interval. If the lower limit is greater than 0 for both 
endpoints, the test product will be declared to meet the FDA criteria . 
8 SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
Safety will be monitored through the collection of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), and unanti cipated adverse device effects (UADEs) from the start of the apheresis 
procedure venipuncture until study completion.  
9 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
9.1 Study Design

radiolabeled Test and Control platelets,  blood samples for radioactivity measurements and the 
calculations to determine platelet recovery and survival will be conducted by the sites as outlined 
in the BEST Collaborative.9 Recovery and survival will be calculated at each site according to 
the COST software . 
9.2 Study Duration  
Study participation will be up to 9 vis its. Screening may be done within 5 days prior to the 
apheresis procedure or combined as 1 visit, which includes screening and the apheresis  
procedure all in 1 day. The apheresis procedure can last from 25 to 150 minutes, depending on 
the machine configuration, participant parameters, the quality of the vascular access, and the 
tolerance of the participant to the Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose, Solution A ( ACD-A) .  
After the apheresis collection, participants will be asked to return to the site 5 days later  for the 
collection of fresh  (Control) platelets and to be infused with an aliquot of t he radiolabeled Test 
and Control platelets . Participants will then return to the site for whole blood sample collections 
as described in Section 11.  
The entire study i s anticipated to last  approximately 5 months. 
10 STUDY POPULATION  
10.1 Number of Participants  and Selection 
Assuming an approximate 40% screen fail/early termination  rate, up to 40 healthy adult 
participants will be enro lled in this study to ensure 24 evaluable data points across 
2 investigational s ites in the United States .  
Donors will be selected from the community donor and/or research pool and will be 
representative of the healthy adult volunteer population. Participants  will be recruited in a 
non-coercive manner and recruitment will be irrespective of ethnicity or gender . 
10.2 Inclusion Criteria  
1. Age 18 years or older

PAS collection on the Trima Accel system. These criteria are based on FDA Regulations 
and AABB standards. Note: Participants who are deferred from volunteer community 
donations because of travel restrictions, piercings, or tattoos may participate in the study, as products are not transfused  
5. Participant s of child- bearing potential (either male or female) must agree to use an 
effective method of contraception during the course of the study  
6. Female of childbearing potential must be willing to take a pregnancy test prior to infusion of radiolabeled platelets  
7. Has given written informed consent 
8. Participant s must agree to refrain  from using aspi rin or aspirin  containing medications, 
non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAID s), anti- plate let agents, or other drugs 
affecting platelet viability for the duration of the study 
10.3 Exclusion Criteria  
1. Previously received radiation therapy  
2. Has been diagnosed with a platelet disorder (ie, platelet dysfunction) 
3. Already participated in 4 research studies  involving radioisotopes within the 
contemporaneous calendar -year 
4. Pregnant or nursing females

10.4 Enrollment  
A donor is considered to be an enrolled participant following inform ed consent. It is expected 
that due to the screening and eligibility requirements, some fraction of participant s will not 
qualify for a platelet donation after consent and some who are enrolled may not complete all of 
their anticipated procedures. Participants  will be considered screen failures if they fail to meet 
any of the eligibility criteria  after signing informed consent. P articipants  who do not have a 
complete donation (donor receives rinseback, there was automated addition of PAS, and final 
platelet product has a platelet yield  ≥ 3.0 × 1011 and ≤ 5.1 × 1011)  or do not return for the 
recovery and survival sample collections per BEST Collaborative will be considered an early 
termination.

14 ADVERSE EVENTS/EFFECTS  
14.1 Anticipated Risks  
14.1.1 Venipuncture Related  
The risks associated with venipuncture for blood sampling or intravenous ( IV) access include 
apprehension, pain, discomfort, venospasm, fainting, bruising, infiltration at the venipuncture 
site, clotting in the IV tubing, and/or administrative errors. Occurrence rates of venipuncture AEs 
are summarized in Table 14-1.

b Faint defined as a brief loss of consciousness, usually less than 30 seconds.  
14.1.2 Apheresis Complications in Healthy Donors  
Donor reactions are mostl y transient self -limited events  and in very rare exceptions a donor may 
experience long- term morbidity or sustain permanent impairment.11,14 Small hematomas, 
presyncopal episodes, and citrate reactions account for the majority of complications in 
automated collection procedures, and younger or first- time donors are more likely to experience 
complications.11-14 Although rare (< 5 out of 10,000 apheresis donations), almost 40% of 
InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 32 of 46 reactions requiring medical care outside the donation premises are venipuncture related, 
including large hematoma, and possible nerve irritation.14 
Apheresis donation is reasonably safe and the majority of complications are mild in nature. While definitions on severity differ in the literature, commonly used paramet ers to assess 
severity are the necessity for outside medical care, recovery time, and potential life-threatening 
consequences. Mild reactions consist of signs and symptoms with a normal recovery time (within 
14 min). Moderate reactions usually require medical care and/or have a prolonged recovery time 
(within 30 min), and severe reactions comprise life- threatening risks and/or recovery time goes 
beyond 30 min.
11,13- 15  Mild citrate reactions are very common with apheresis procedures, while 
vasovagal reactions are substantially lower compared to whole blood donation.12-14 Some donor 
reactions that have been previous ly reported for automated collection procedures are anxiety, 
chills, digit and/or facial paresthesia, fever, headache, hematoma, hyperventilation, hypotension, 
light-headedness, nausea and vomiting, fainting, unpleasant taste sensations, urtica ria, and 
allergic reacti ons. Adve rse reactions listed in Table 14-2 are general apheresis risks and are not 
specific to the Trima Accel system .

Confidential  Page 33 of 46 14.1.3 Apheresis Risks with the Trima Accel System  
Trima Accel disposable tubing sets are sterilized with ethylene oxide which may cause 
anaphylactic reactions. Though cases of allergic reactions to ethylene oxide are reported in 
literature, the Sponsor has no knowledge that any such event has occurred with the Trima Accel 
system  to date. 
14.1.4 Potential Risks of Infusion of Radiolabeled Platelets  
The amount of radiation exposure received by the participant  is low and is not considered to be a 
health hazard .18 However, women who are pregnant or who are nursing will be excluded from 
the study, as the risks of radiation exposure to a fetus or infant are unknown. All enrolled women 
will have a pregnancy test performed before the re -infusion of the radiolabeled  platelets as an 
added precaution. Any participant  with a positive pregnancy test will be withdrawn from the 
study. 
14.2 Risk Mitigation  
To minimize risks of participant  injury, the following general procedures are to be followed: 
1. Ensuring that all Investigators are properly qualified and meet pre- specified criteria for 
Investigator selection and that they and their study teams successfully complete the 
following training: Site specific training, Human Participant  Protection, and C linical 
Investigation Plan ( CIP) training to include device and procedure training.  
2. Ensuring that participants who are enrolled meet all eligibility criteria, including 
minimum Hgb or HCT  and platelet limits for donation. The apheresis devices are 
programmed to allow collection of products only from participants  who will meet 
projected HCT /Hgb  and platelet standards at the completion of the collection. These 
limitations are for the safety of participants and apply to this CIP . 
3. If the Investigator deems appropriate, stopping the procedure if a moderate or severe AE 
occurs . The participant  can also request that the procedure be stopped at any time.  
4. With the collection of protected health information (PHI) associated with this research 
study, there is a small risk of violation of privacy and loss of confidentiality. The 
apheresis collections will be documented on the study s ite’s SD. Case report forms will 
be uploaded to the electronic data capture ( EDC) with only participant  and product 
number as participant  identifiers, to ensure confidentiality.  
5. Participants  will be questioned concerning adverse experiences throughout the apheresis 
procedure. Participants  will also be visually monitored for signs of distress during blood 
InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 34 of 46 donations . Suspected adverse reactions will be treated according to study sites’ SOPs and 
documented on the SD and e CRFs.  
14.3 Adverse Event Definitions  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a medical device, whether or not considered related to the 
medical device and/or procedure. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(inclu ding an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of the medical device and/or procedure. 
14.4 Adverse Event Recording  
Adverse events that occur after the start of the apheresis procedure venipuncture until study 
completion will be recorded on the AE e CRF.  
14.5 Adverse Event Reporting  
14.5.1 Severity  
This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Scale, 
Version 4.03 for AE grading.19 The CTCAE includes a grading (severity) scale for each AE term. 
Grades were developed using the following guidelines: 
Grade 0  – No AE or within normal limits.  
Grade 1  – Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; interve ntion not indicated. 
Grade 2  – Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 
Grade 3  – Severe; medically significant but not immediately life threatening . 
Grade 4  – Life threatening. 
Grade 5  – Fatal.  
14.5.2 Relationship  
The Investigator at each site will be asked to document his/her opinion of the relationship of the 
event to the device and/or procedure(s) as follows:  
Not Related: 
The event is clearly related to factors other than the study device and/or procedure(s), such as the 
participant ’s clinical state.  
InterSol In Vivo Platelet Quality Study  Terumo BCT, Inc.  
Clinical Investigation Plan: CTS -5066 Version 2 .0: 10 JUL 2017  
Confidential  Page 35 of 46 Possibly Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study treatment 
administration/ procedure, and/or follows a known response pattern to study device/procedure(s) 
but could have been produced by other factors , such as the participant ’s clinical state or other 
therapeutic interventions.  
Probably Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study device /procedure(s) 
and cannot be reasonable explained by other factors, such as the participant’s clinical state or 
therapeutic interventions.  
Definitely Related:  
The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of study device/procedure(s), 
and follows a known response pattern, and cannot be reasonably explained by other fact ors. In 
addition, the event occurs immediately following study procedure(s), and/or improves on stopping the study procedure, and/or re appears on resumption of study procedure(s). 
These criteria, in addition to good clinical judgment, should be used as a guide for determining the causal assessment . 
14.6 Adverse Event Follow -up 
All AEs must be followed in accordance with the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, and other applicable regulatory requirements 
(eg, United S tates Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] 812). The expected AE of mild hematoma 
(bruise) and/or mild infiltration are not required to be followed to resolution.  
14.7 Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Devi ce Effect  
14.7.1 Definition  
In the interes t of participant  care and to allow the Sponsor to fulfill all regulatory requirements, 
any SAE and/or UADE, regardless of causal relationship to study treatment/procedure(s), must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. 
Seriou s AEs are defined (21 CFR 312.32 and ISO 14145:2011 Sec. 3.37) as those AEs which 
meet any of the following criteria:  
• Results in death .  
• Led to serious deterioration in the health of the participant , that either resulted in  
o A life -threatening illness or injury, or

o Inpatient or prolonged hospitalization, or  
o Medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or 
permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. 
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition or a planned procedure, without 
serious deterioration in health, is not considered a n SAE . 
Per 21 CFR 812.3 an UADE is defined as any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a device, if that effect, problem or 
death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the CIP  and/o r 
Trima Accel Operator’ s Manual, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of participants . 
NOTE: Anticipated adverse device effects are effects, which by nature, incidence, severity or outcome have been identified in the CIP and/or Trima Accel Operator’ s Manual. 
14.7.2 SAE/UA DE Reporting  
Any SAE/UADE that occurs after the start of the apheresis procedure venipuncture until study 
completion/termination must be reported. Follow-up (regardless of relationship to the study 
treatment/procedure[s]) must be reported and an AE/SAE/UADE Form must be submitted to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to: 
Terumo BCT

14.8 Clinical Investigation Plan Deviations  
A CIP deviation is defined as any event where the Investigator or site personnel deviate from the 
study CIP or study procedures for any reason. 
The Sponsors is responsible for report ing all deviations into the EDC. Clinical Investigation Plan  
deviations that may affect the scientific soundness of the study or affect the rights, safety, or 
welfare of study participants , must be reported to the Sponsor and the IRB as per the IRB’s 
standard reporting procedure.  
14.9 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsi bility of the Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site. A Data 
Safety Monitoring Board will not be involved in this study because it involves healthy participants  undergoing a commonly practiced research evaluation procedure and no 
investigational product will be transfused. 
The Sponsor will monitor the safety of the study participants  from the venipuncture for the 
apheresis procedure and until conclusion of t heir participation in the study .  
15 STUDY DEVICE 
15.1 Device Deficiencies  
All devic e deficiencies involving any device component must be reported within 24 hours upon 
knowledge to the Sponsor utilizing the Device Deficiency Report Form. Every attempt should be 
made by the s ite to save or collect the defective device, and if appropriate, the packaging, for 
return to the Sponsor. A qualified company representative will investigate and determine root cause and corrective actions as applicable, and directives will be provided to the site if 
warranted.  
15.2 Device Accountability  
15.2.1 Receipt of Study De vice 
The contents should be examined upon receipt to ensure packaging and labeling is intact and the devices have not been damaged. Any damage should be immediately reported to the Sponsor.

The Trima Accel device, the InterS ol, and the disposables should be stored in a dry place at room 
temperature. Proper care should be taken to ensure that the study inventory will not be damaged. 
15.2.3 Accountability  
The Trima Accel device, disposables, InterSol, and software will be provided by the Sponsor for 
use in this study. The Trima Accel disposables, software, and InterSol are FDA cleared and 
marketed in the United States ; however platelets collected on the Trima Accel system and stored 
in InterSol is not, therefore the site must take appropriate measures to ensu re it is properly stored  
away  from approved inventory.  
16 STATISTICAL PLAN 
16.1 Sample Size  
Assuming an approximate 40% screen fail /early termination  rate, up to 40 healthy adult 
participants will be enrolled in this study to ensure 24 evaluable data points across 
2 investigational s ites in the United States.  
Donors will be selected from the community donor and/or research pool and will be representative of the healthy adult volunteer population. Participants  will be recruited in a 
non-coercive manner and recruitment will be irrespective of ethnicity or gender.  
16.2 Outcome Measures  
This study will determine the  recovery and survival of hyperconcentrated platelets collected on 
the Trima Accel system and stored for 5 days in 65%  InterSol/35% plasma . The recovery and 
survival of Test platelets will be compared to fresh Control platelets . 
16.2.1 Primary Endpoint  
The acceptance criterion for the recovery (%) of platelets is  the demonstration of non- inferiority 
by the rejection of the Null Hypothesis (H0) defined by the following hypotheses: 
Null Hypothesis  H 0:  µd ≤ 0 where µd=µT-0.66*µC 
Alternate Hypothesis   H 1:  µd > 0 
Let ∆Xi = (X Ti-0.66*X Ci) be a difference if recovery for patient i. The sample mean and standard 
deviations of these observed differences will be used to construct the lower limit of a 1-sided 
97.5% confidence interval for µd assuming a t -distribution with n -1 degrees of freedom. If the 
lower limit of the confidence interv al is greater than 0, the null hypothesis will be rejected in

Confidential  Page 39 of 46 favor of the alternative hypothesis suggesting the Test product meets the FDA acceptance criteria 
for platelet recovery.  
The acceptance criterion  for the survival (hours) of platelets is the dem onstration of 
non-inferiority by the rejection of the null hypothesis (H0)  defined by the following hypotheses: 
Null Hypothesis  H 0:  µd ≤ 0 where µd=µT-0.58*µC 
Alternate Hypothesis   H 1:  µd > 0 
Let ∆Xi = (X Ti-0.58*X Ci) be a difference in survival for patient i . The sample mean and standard 
deviations of these observed differences will be used to construct the lower limit of a 1-sided 
97.5% confidence interval for µd assuming a t -distribution with n -1 degrees of freedom. If the 
lower limit of the confidence interval is greater than 0, the null hypothesis will be rejected in  
favor of the alternative hypothesis suggesting the Test product meets the FDA acceptance criteria 
for platelet survival.  
16.2.2 Safety Measures 
Adverse even ts will be summarized by the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA 
Version 18.1 or later) and verbatim term . Tables will describe the frequency and percentage of all 
AEs, SAEs, and UADEs reported by participants  in the safety population. Pre sentations will 
summarize AEs by maximum reported severity and relationship to device and procedure. 
Adverse events leading to study or procedure discontinuation will also be tabulated.  
16.3 Analysis Population 
The safety population will include all participants enrolled in this trial who undergo any study 
related apheresis procedure.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will consist of all completed procedures/ products where the 
corresponding Test and Control values for the primary endpoint are valid. If any of the criteria 
outlined in Section 16.4 are met , the product will not be included in the FAS. The FAS will be 
used to examine the primary endpoints. 
16.4 CIP Analysis Exclusions  
Data points may be excluded from analysis in the following situations: 
1. Primary endpoint laboratory samples are lost or not available  
2. Failure  of the site  to follow post-collection handling procedures for endpoint assays

scope of the study, potential risks and benefits of participation, answer questions for the participant  and ask the participant  to participate in the study. The study will be explained to the 
study participant in lay terms , in their native language in a quiet, non-disruptive setting. Potential 
participants  will be given as much time and privacy as necessary to review the informed consent 
prior to agreeing to participate in the study. Additionally, if the participant  desires, they can take 
a copy of the consent with them so that they can discuss potential participation with others 
outside the study team. If the participant  agrees to participate, the participant has read the ICF, 
and has had all of their questions answered, then the ICF must be signed and personally dated by the participant and the person completing the consent process. A copy of the signed and dated 
ICF will be provided to the study participant.  
All participants  are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any time, for any 
reason (s), specified or unspecified, and without prejudice. The reason(s)  for the participant 
discontinuing or terminating from the study must be recorded on the e CRF.

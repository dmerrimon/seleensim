 Protocol Amendmen t Version 3:  
Summary of c hanges to the protocol due to the COVID -19 Pandemic  
 
This protocol has been amended to account for changes due to the COVID -19 pandemic, which has 
resulted in increased health and safety concerns for study participants  and clinical research  staff. 
Specifically, the risks are primarily due to how easily the virus can be transmitted with person- to-person 
contact.  
 
The specific changes to the protocol are summarized below. The primary rationale for these changes is to reduce contact time between patients and study staff, while maintaining their health and safety.  
 • Addition of 3 healthy volunteer practice participants.  Previously, we obtained IRB approval to test 
our protocol on 3 -5 healthy volunteers. Because we tested all 5 practice participants prior to the 
pandemic, we are requesting an additional 3 v olunteer  participants . Practicing the protocol on 3 
additional participants will ensure that the acupuncturists have recent protocol training prior to 
recruitment and will allow them to practice under the new COVID -19 policies and procedures (e.g. 
utilizing appropriat e PPE under COVID -19 guidelines).  
• Study visits completed via phone . All study visits, except for the acupuncture treatment visits, will 
be converted to phone visits. This will be done to decrease study staff and patient exposure time.  
• Informed consent and study assessments completed electronically.  Informed consent for the study 
will be obtained through a phone call with study staff and electronically through a Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) survey sent via e -mail. All study assessments will be obtained 
through REDCap surveys sent via e -mail.  
• Appropriate COVID -19 screening procedures and personal protective e quipment (PPE) will be 
utilized  for all acupuncture treatment visits. We will screen  participants  for COVID -19 by phone 1 -2 
days before each scheduled acupuncture treatment visit and also the day of the clinic visit. If a 
patient screens positive  for COVID -19, study visits will be postponed for the appropriate amount of 
time per current guidance , and we will follow the current clinic site process for COVID -19 positive 
screens, as defined by the medical group.  This study will  also align with the HealthPartners 
Neuroscience Center policies  regarding PPE  for in -person visits. This will be done to ensure the 
safety of patients and study staff.  
• Finally, this study will align with HealthPartners Neuroscience Center ’s COVID -19 policies and 
procedures.  
Protocol Amendment Version 4 : 
Summary of changes to the protocol due to the COVID -19 Pandemic  
• Addition of COVID -19 Questions . The addition of questions related to COVID -19 will be done to 
potentially explore whether acupuncture has an effect on post -COVID -19 symptoms. The questions 
below will be asked at 2 time points: at the beginning of first acupuncture appointment and at the 4 -
week post -treatment visit (4 weeks after the last acupunc ture treatment). They will be collected 
electronically via REDCap.  As an exploratory analysis, patients who report post -COVID -19 symptoms 
will be identified using the additional COVID -19 set of questions. Types and severity of post -COVID -
19 symptoms present within the group will be described. The t -test or non -parametric equivalent 
will be used to determine whether acupuncture had an effect on post -COVID symptoms.  The 
protocol has been updated to reflect the changes  and the questions are listed below . 
 Questions:  
1) Have you previously received a positive test for COVID -19? (yes/no)  
2) Were you exposed to someone with a positive test, subsequently developed symptoms, but 
did not get a COVID -19 test? (yes/no)  
3) Are you currently experiencing any of the following post -COVID -19 symptoms?  
(Drop down list with most common symptoms, select all that apply)  
a. Fatigue  
b. Difficulty breathing  
c. Joint pain 
d. Chest pain 
e. Brain fog, including an inability to concentrate and impaired memory  
f. Loss of taste and/or smell  
g. Sleep issues  
h. Other: Specify – (free text to type in)  
4) If a participant answers yes to any of the symptoms : How would you rate your symptoms?  
a. Mild: you have symptoms, but they are not a problem  
b. Moderate: your symptoms limit your normal daily activities  
c. Severe: your symptoms make normal daily activities challenging or impossible

  8 2  INTRODUCTION  
2.1 BACKGROUND & STUDY RATIONALE 
 
Chronic post -traumatic headache (CPTH) after a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is extremely 
debilitating, dramatically impacts function and quality of life, and is the most frequent type of chronic 
pain reported after injury.1 It has been estimated that approximately 17.1 million Americans suffer a 
traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year,2 with CPTH estimated to occur in 57.8% of these individuals.3 CPTH 
presents as: 1) tension -like (mild -moderate dull pain), 2) migraine headache (moderate -severe throbbing 
pain), or 3) combined tension- like and migraine headache.1 On average, the number of reported headache 
days each month for individuals suffering from CPTH is 26,4 which is almost daily. Individuals suffering 
from CPTH are more likely to have post -traumatic stress disorder, cognitive symptoms, and somatic 
symptoms.4 They are also more likely to perceive difficulties in their physical and social function.4 
Consequently, it is not surprising that CPTH is extremely agonizing and frustrating for individuals with mTBI.  
 There are currently no FDA approved pharmacological treatments specifically for CPTH and the long -term 
effects of pharmacologic treatments on recovery after TBI are unclear.
5 Thus, individuals are typically 
prescribed medications that target the particular type of headache (e.g. triptan for a migraine headache).5 
Non-narcotic analgesics, nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and triptans are often prescribed 
for headache and migraine treatment and have been recommended to be coupled with non-pharmacological treatments, such as physical therapy, biofeedbac k, and relaxation training.
6 However, 
because the long -term effects of pharmacologic treatments on recovery after TBI are unclear, non -
pharmacologic or behavioral treatments for CPTH are very appealing.5 
 As an alternative, acupuncture is a non- pharmacologic treatment that has been explored for CPTH. 
Acupuncture has been practiced in Chinese medicine for over 4,000 years.
7 It is a technique where fine 
needles are inserted into specific areas of the body to achieve  a therapeutic benefit .7 Historically, 
acupuncture is based on a Chinese/East Asian medical theory that acupuncture restores normal function 
to the body by balancing Qi.7 Although the mechanism of acupuncture is not fully understood, previous 
research has shown that it has a regulating effect on the nervous system8 and it has been effective for 
treating a wide range of chronic pain conditions, including headaches and migraines.9 
 Acupuncture has been shown to be safe and effective treatment for individuals suffering from headaches 
and migraines. Acupuncture has been used and reported by physicians in the United States as early as the 1600s and has been researched since the 1800s. Most of the early reports were of individual patient cases, whereas the first randomized controlled trial of acupuncture treatment was published in 1975.
10 While 
there are still many theories regarding the mechanism of acupuncture, research has provided evidence 
for the benefits of acupuncture in several medical indications, including for migraine and tension 
headache. Acupuncture has been shown to be effica cious for both acute migraine treatment, migraine 
prophylaxis, and tension headache treatment.11 In addition, acupuncture has been shown to be more 
effective than, or as effective as pharmacotherapy with fewer side effects.11-13 It has also been shown to 
decrease migraine11,12 and tension headache11 frequency, reduce pain intensity,11,12,14  decreas e the use of 
acute medication,14 and improve quality of life.12 Importantly, the safety of acupuncture has been well 
documented. Although both minor and serious adverse events  (AEs) have been reported, serious 
complications related to acupuncture are rare.15

  9 While acupuncture is currently well -accepted as a behavioral treatment for individuals with chronic pain, 
headaches, and migraines,9 it has not been extensively examined in individuals with CPTH. Although there 
have been studies as early as the 1980s that have shown improvements in headache symptoms with 
acupuncture for individuals who have suffered from mTBI,16,17 there have been a limited number of 
studies since. In two recent case reports, acupuncture combined improved acute post -traumatic 
headache symptoms in an individual who suffered a mTBI.18,19 In another recent study, acupuncture 
improved headache -related quality of life and reduced overall pain in adult service members with mild-
to-mod erate TBI suffering from CPTH.20 Therefore, although there is a paucity of research examining 
acupuncture for CPTH, it has shown efficacy in patients with chronic headaches and migraines,11 a nd 
researchers have suggested that it be investigated and considered for treatment of CPTH.21 In addition, 
while they did not examine CPTH specifically, four randomized controlled trials investigated acupuncture 
treatment in individuals with TBI and reported no AEs.22 Thus, acupuncture could potentially be a safe and 
viable alternative to medication for individuals with mTBI suffering from CPTH.  
 
Because acupuncture for CPTH has not been extensively examined, there is also no consensus on the 
number of acupuncture sessions that are necessary for improvement. In the study of service members 
with mild -to-moderate TBI suffering from CPTH, 10 sessions o f acupuncture were administered over 6 
weeks.20 Because the two case studies were examining acupuncture for acute post -traumatic 
headache,18,19 the specific treatment methods may not be applicable for CPTH. In a recent review of 
acupuncture for chronic headaches and migraines, 6 -10 weekly or twice -weekly acupuncture sessions 
were reported to be most effective.21 However, the amount of acupuncture necessary for improvement 
in individuals suffering from CPTH is unclear. Thus, the primary goal of this study is to determine the effect 
of a low versus high dose of acupuncture treatment on number of headache days for individuals suffering 
from CPTH.

Additional potential risks specific to  electroacupunture treatment and minimization of these risks  
Potential  risks24: 
• Increased depth and altered angulation of needles to ensure needles can support the weight of 
the leads and clips.  
o We plan to use microclips, which are much lighter than alligator clips, so this risk will be 
dramatically minimized.  
• Vigorous m uscle contraction causing needle movement  (e.g. need drawn deeper into the body).  
o The goal of acupuncture treatment in this study is not to illicit a muscle twitch. T he goal 
is to induce a mild level of sensation, which typically doe s not cause muscle contraction . 
Thus,  we do not anticipate vigorous muscle contractions or unsafe needle movement.  
• Minor risks have been reported for acupuncture treatment of the  abdominal muscles, over the 
rib cage,  the carotid sinus, the laryngeal muscles , and the vagus nerve.  
o For this study, we will not be performing acupuncture treatment in any of these areas, so we do not anticipate these risks.  
• Risk of cardiac arrest with e xcessive current (risks reported around 50mA ).  
o The Pantheon Research 8c.Pro stimulator we will use for this study has a current range of 
0-15 mA, therefore we will be simulating with a current that is much lower than the range 
for this risk.  
o There is also a risk of excessive current if electrostimulation devices are plugged into the 
main electrical supply. The Pantheon Research 8c.Pro stimulator that we will use for this 
study is battery operated, therefore we do not anticipate this risk.  
• Interference with implantable cardioverter defibrillators, pacemakers , or other implantable 
devices.  
o We have minimized this risk for our study by excluding anyone with a  history of cardiac 
arrhythmia or current pacemaker, neurostimulator, or other implanted stimulation 
device . 
• Seizures  
o We have minimized this risk for our study by excluding anyone with a history of seizures . 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  11 o In addition, there have not been any reports linking electroacupuncture to seizures.  
 
Assessments/Questionnaires (Headache Diary, PSQI, & TBI -QOL)  
Participants will be asked to complete a headache diary 3 times, each time for a duration of 4 -weeks. This 
may be difficult or tiring  for participants . The PSQI and the Traumatic Brain Injury- Quality of Life ( TBI-QOL) 
are standardized questionnaires that will measure personal perception of life and sleep quality. The 
questions on these assessments may make participants  feel uncomfortable because some parts may be 
easy to answer, while some parts may be difficult or tiring. Filling out the questionnaires may  also cause 
individuals  to feel uncomfortable or upset.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality  
There may be a slight possibility of breach of confidential information that was collected.  However, the 
following procedures will be implemented to reduce this risk:  
• Data collection and reporting tools will be developed and stored internally.  
• Data collected and stored electronically will remain confidential and secure (e.g. secured server 
and password protected files [REDCap]).  
• Study binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a locked office.  
• After the study is closed, all subject identifiers will be destroyed.  
 
2.2.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 
Acupuncture has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for individuals suffering from headache 
and migraines. Although there  is less evidence for individuals with mTBI suffering from CPTH, acupuncture 
treatment may provide headache relief to patients.  
 
2.2.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND B ENEFITS  
 
We believe the p otential risks to the participants i n this study are minimal and that the benefit of 
understanding how much acupuncture treatment is needed for headache relief in individuals with CPTH 
outweighs the potential risks.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
 
Study Design:  
This study is an unblinded, uncontrolled randomized, 2 -arm clinical trial.  
 
Hypotheses:  
Primary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that both treatment groups will have decreased headaches.  
Secondary Hypothesis : We hypothesize that acupuncture will be safe and tolerated in both groups.  
 
Randomization:  
Prior to the first acupuncture t reatment visit, participants will be randomized into two treatment groups.  
Randomization is explained in Section 6.3 . 
 
Acupuncture Treatment Groups:  
 Group 1:  18 participants will receive acupuncture treatment 1x per week for 5 weeks = 5 total.  
 Group 2:  18 participants will receive acupuncture treatment 2x per week for 5 weeks = 10 total.  
 
Study Intervention:  
Acupuncture treatment will consist of a standardized treatment protocol designed for this study. 
Specifically, 18 needles  will be inserted into  specific areas of the body for a duration of 30 minutes. 
Additional details of the treatment are discussed in Section 6.1 . 
 
4.2 SCIENTIFIC R ATIONALE FOR S TUDY DESIGN  
 
Justification  for an unblinded study:  Because it will be clear to both study personnel and participants who 
is receiving 5 vs. 10 treatments, neither will be blinded in this study. This will be reported as a limitation 
of the study.  
 
Justification for an uncontrolled study with no control group : Because there is already evidence that 
acupuncture treatment improved headache -related quality of life and reduced headache pain in 
individuals  suffering from CPTH20, the goal of this study was to provide treatment to both groups and to 
determine whether a low or high dose of treatment is more effective.  
 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR INTERVENTION  
 Acupuncture is a treatment that has been practiced for over 4,000 years and is well -accepted by many 
cultures. Although the mechanism is not well understood, acupuncture has been shown to be safe and effective at treating headaches and migraines. The numbe r of treatments will be examined to determine 
whether 5 or 10 treatments is more effective at treating CPTH . The 30 -minute treatment duration was 
based on clinical practice guidelines for acupuncture treatment.

N/A  
5.4 SCREEN FAILURES  
 Pre-screening Phone Call:  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  14 All potential participants will undergo a pre -screening phone call to determine whether they meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be considered ineligible  if they do not meet one or more of the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria during pre -screening. We will collect information on why participants are 
ineligible or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 
Pre-treatment Visit:  
Screen failures  are defined as participants who are considered eligible during the pre -screening phone 
call, but it was subsequently determined that they do not meet one or more of the incl usion/exclusion 
criteria at or after  the Pre -treatment (baseline) visit. We will collect information on why participants 
screen fail or decide not to move forward with the trial.  
 
Rescreening Patients:  
Individuals  who do not meet the criteria for participation in this trial (ineligible or screen failure) because 
of meeting one or more exclusion criteria that are likely to change over time may be rescreened  up to one 
time . Examples include : successful treatment for a substance use disorder; women who are no longer 
pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant; or participation in an interventional study ≥3 months  
prior . Rescreened participants will be assigned a new participant number.  
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
Recruitment:  Individuals with mTBI  suffering from CPTH will be recruited by physician and therapist  
referrals from HealthPartners’ clinics. We will also advertise our research study by distributing flyers to HealthPartners’ physicians and throughout HealthPartners’ clinics. Recruitment flyers will also be 
provided to our community partners for example, the Minnesota B rain Injury Alliance, TRIA, and Allina 
Health.  If we encounter difficulties with recruitment, we plan to submit an amendment to the IRB  to 
contact HealthPartners patients and members and invite them to participate.  
 To reach our target enrollment, w e anticipate that we will need to screen 100 people,  of those 50 
individuals will sign the informed consent, and of those 40 individua ls will be randomized to treatment 
groups . We expect that we will enroll approximately 35% (~13) women and 65% (~23) men, primarily 
between the ages of 41 -84, and approx imately 80% will be white. V alues are based on our Regions 
Hospital Rehabilitation census data.  
 
Remuneration:  Participants will be provided gift cards totaling $50 per person for completing certain time 
points of the research study.  Specifically, after completing all acupuncture treatment visits, participants 
will receive a $25 gift card. After completion of the 12 -week post -treatment visit (end of study visit) 
participants will receive another $25 gift card.

6.1.1  STUDY INTERVENTION OR EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION DESCRIPTION  
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  15 The study intervention for both groups is acupuncture treatment. Acupuncture is a treatment where fine 
needles are inserted into specific areas of the body to achieve  a therapeutic benefit. The treatment 
regimen is described next in more detail.  
6.1.2  ADMINISTRATION  AND/OR DOSING  
 Acupuncture Treatment Methods:  Group 1 will receive weekly acupuncture and Group 2 will receive twice -weekly acupuncture over five 
weeks.  Acupuncture treatments will be separated by a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 14 days , 
unless a participant has an illness, such as COVID -19. In this case, additional time may be allowed, as 
determined by the investigator.  Treatment methods will be identical for both groups and are described 
below . 
Standard, sterile stainless -steel, disposable needles (DongBang ™ Corporation, Spring Ten 0.25x30mm; 
Boryeoung, Republic of Korea) will be inserted in the acupuncture point locations (described below), with 
a total of 18 needles used for each treatment session. The depth of the needle insertion will be 
approximately 10 -20mm, depending on the region of the body undergoing treatment. Needle reaction 
(soreness, numbness or distended feeling around the point, also known as a Deqi sensation) will occur during the  initial insertion. Following 10 minutes of retention, all needles (except points St36 and LI4 under 
electrostimulation, and auricular points SM and PtZ) will be rotated in order to maintain Deqi sensation. 
Maintaining Deqi sensation has been shown to incr ease the effectiveness of acupuncture.
26,27 All needles  
will be left in place for a total of 30 minutes, which is a typical duration in acupuncture practice. It also is 
a common duration of previously reported clinical trials of acupuncture for headaches and migraines.
11,12,28  
 
Acupuncture points were selected for their classical indications, anatomical locations, effect on pain 
networks29,30 and influence on cerebral blood flow.31 The anatomical location for each point will be based 
on the World Health Organization’ s acupuncture point guideline.32 Electroacupuncture will be 
administered with Pantheon Research electrostimulation 8c pro machines (Pantheon Research Inc; 
Huntington Beach, CA), with a continuous milliampere wavelength of 2Hz at stomach 36 (ST36) and large 
intestine 4 (LI4). The intensit y will be gradually increased to a comfortable level  that participants can 
tolerate, without the sensation of pain. Traditional Chinese manual acupuncture will be used at eight 
acupuncture points: yin tang (YT) and Du20 and bilateral acupuncture of liver 3  (LV3), urinary bladder 2 
(UB2), small intestine 19 (SI19), extra point Anmian (EX -22), and two auricular points Shen Men (SM) and 
point zero (PtZ).  During treatment, acupuncture needles or electrical stimulation can be removed due to 
extreme pain or discomfort, so as not to exceed the removal of more than 2 of the 18 needles.  
6.2 FIDELITY  
 
6.2.1  INTERVENTIONIST TRAINING AND TRACKING  
 
Acupuncturists:  
Acupuncture treatments will be administered by MN licensed acupuncturists with a Master’s degree level 
of training in acupuncture (or higher) from accredited institutions, and five or more years of clinical 
experience. Prior to enrolling participants, the acupuncturists will complete practice sessions together of the treatment protocol and methods of administration to ensure consistency between providers  
 Training:  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  16 Following IRB approval and prior to recruitment and enrollment, the study acupuncturists will complete 
10 practice sessions. For the training, we will seek 12 volunteers who will sign a volunteer consent  form  
prior to participating. The purpose  of training  will be  to ensure consistency in intervention procedures  
and further standardized treatment methods . This includes, but is not limited to: needle location (18 
points) , needle depth, time of first and last needle placement,  total  treatment duration, and pre-defined 
electro -acupuncture settings.   
 
Tracking:  
All practice sessions will be documented on a training log. This will include  dates and times of the trainings, 
names of the volunteers, and printed names and signatures of the study acupuncturists. We will also keep 
a record of the volunteers’ signed treatment release forms.  
 
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS : RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING  
 Randomization:   
Randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Balanced treatment assignments will be achieved using permuted block randomization with random block sizes stratified by gender. This decision 
was based on evidence that females in this population reported higher rates of headaches.
33 The s t udy 
biostatistician will generate a randomization schedule using the SURVERYSELECT procedure in SAS. Assignments will not be seen by other study personnel in advance and will not be changed after randomization.  
 Blinding:   
Study personnel will be unblinded to the randomization, as it will be clear the number of participants who receive 5 acupuncture treatments versus those that receive 10.  In addition, it will be clear to participants 
which treatment group they are in and it will be impossible to blind them from this information.  
 
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  ADHERENCE 
 Participants will be asked to adhere to study visits and to complete  study assessments. Participants will 
remain active unless withdrawn from the study (see Section 7 ). We will track participants’ adherence to 
study visits, as well as completion of the assessments. These  will be documented in the relevant eCRF. 
 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
 For this protocol, participants may use non- opioid analgesics for pain control, including over -the-counter 
medications and dietary supplements, and prescribed medications . This includes use for rescue therapy 
in the event of exacerbation of symptoms due to acupuncture treatment. Medication  usage will be 
assessed at each study visit and documented in the relevant eCRF.  
 
6.5.1  RESCUE THERAPY  
 Any medications used for rescue therapy will be recorded in the Headache Diary.

  17  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION  OF STUDY INTERVENTION /EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 
When a participant  who signed the consent form chooses to discontinue  participation in the study or 
study intervention, or if the principal investigator and co -investigators determine that a participant should 
discontinue participation, they will be withdrawn from the study. A withdrawal will either be defined as ‘Patient Withdrawal’ or ‘Principal Investigator Withdrawal’. The participant will be asked to complete an 
early withdraw al phone call 7- 14 days  from the date the intervention was discontinued. The purpose of 
the phone call will be  to record  any AEs  or serious a dverse events (SAEs) that may have occurred after the 
discontinuation of treatment.  Research staff will attempt to call the par ticipant up to 3 times . 
 The data that will be collected at the time of study withdrawal will include the following:  
• The reason(s) for discontinuation of the study intervention 
 The data that will be  collected during the early withdraw al phone call will include the following:  
• AEs or SAEs that occurred since the time of withdrawal  
 
7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION /WITHDRAWAL FROM THE S TUDY  
 Participant s are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request.  
An investigator may discontinue  a participa nt from  the study for the following reasons : 
 
1. Participant has  not completed an acupuncture treatment for > 14 days , unless a participant has 
an illness, such as COVID -19. In this case, additional time may be allowed, as determined by the 
investigator.  
2. Significant study intervention non-compliance  
3. Lost -to-follow up; unable to contact subject  (see Section 7.3, Lost to Follow -Up) 
4. Any event or medical condition or situation occurs such that continued collection of follow -up  
study data would not be in the best interest of the participant  or might require an additional 
treatment that would confound the interpretation of the study  
5. The participant  meets an exclusion criterion (either newly developed or not previously 
recognized) that precludes further study participation 
 The reason for participant discontinuation or withdrawal from the study will be recorded on the relevant 
eCRF. Subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized but do not receive the study 
intervention may be replaced. Subjects who sign the informed consent form, and are randomized and 
receive the study intervention, and subsequently withdraw, or are discontinued from the study, will not 
be replaced.  
 
7.3 LOST TO F OLLOW -UP 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to attend  any scheduled study visit  and 
study staff are unable to contact the participant after at least 5 attempts , while maintaining the 14 day 
maximum between visits . 
 
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to attend any required study visit:  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  18  
• Study staff  will attempt to contact the participant , reschedule the missed visit , counsel the 
participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the 
participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee will m ake every 
effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, t elephone calls  or e -mail – if no 
answer leave a voicemail on the first and last attempt ). These contact attempts will be 
documented.  
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary rea son of lost to follow -up. 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
 
8.1 ENDPOINT AND OTHER NON -SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 
Demographics: Demographic information will be collected, including : gender, age, race, ethnicity, 
language,  height, weight, marital status, employment status , date of TBI, date of CPTH diagnosis , and e -
mail address for Headache Diary surveys (discussed below) . 
 Medication Review:  Medication data will be used for exploratory purposes for Specific Aim 3.  
 Headache Diary:  Participants will be sent an e -mail REDCap survey to complete and asked to record 
headache information for three 4 -week time periods.  During each 4 -week period, they will receive the e-
mail once per week. They will be provided paper headache diaries (Appendix 1 -3) to keep track of their 
headaches  and will be asked to complete each e- mail survey they receive. The headache diary  survey will 
include: how many headaches occurred each week  during the 4 -week period, duration, pain intensity (0 -
10 scale), type (e.g. tension),  and name of  medication taken and dosage (if applicable ). The outcome 
measure for Specific Aim 1 is number of headache days over 4 weeks; other variables will be exploratory.  
 Treatment Adherence:  The participant’s treatment adherence will be measured to determine tolerability 
of acupuncture. We will record the number of attended acupuncture sessions. We will also record participants’  ability to maintain the acupuncture duration of 30 minutes per session.  
 Sleep:  Participants will be asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which contains 
questions about one’s usual sleep habits during the past month.  Quality of Life:  Participants will be asked to complete the TBI -QOL  short forms. The TBI -QOL includes the 
following domains: ability to participate in social roles and activities, anger, anxiety, attention -
concentration, cognition -general concerns, communication, depression, emotional behavior dyscontrol, 
executive functi on, fatigue, grief -loss, headache pain, independence, learning -memory, mobility, pain 
interference, positive affect and well -being, resilience, satisfaction with social roles and activities , self -
esteem, stigma, and upper extremity.  
 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
 Assessment of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events:  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  19 AEs and SAEs  will be monitored by acupuncturists during acupuncture treatment sessions, and by study 
staff during the 4 -week and 12 -week post -treatment visits. The acupuncturists and research staff will 
immediately notify the Principal Investigator and utilize the e CRF to record any AEs or SAEs.  The PI and 
the study physician will review and categorize all AEs or SAEs and report them accordingly, as discussed 
below.  
 
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 This protocol uses the definition of AE from 21 CFR 312.32 (a) : any untoward medical occurrence 
associated with the use of an intervention in huma ns, whether or not considered intervention- related . 
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 This protocol uses the definition of SAE from 21 CFR 312.32 (a): An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered "serious" if, in the view of either the investigator  or study clinician , it results in any of the 
following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events t hat may not result 
in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
 
8.3.3.1 SEVERITY OF EVENT  
 
For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines will be used to 
describe severi ty.  
 1. Mild  – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant ’s daily 
activities.   
2. Moderate  – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. 
Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
3. Severe – Events interrupt a participant ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or 
other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.   Of note, the 
term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious”.  
  
8.3.3.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION/EXPERIMENTAL MANIPULATION  
 All AEs will have their relationship to study procedures, including the intervention, assessed  by an 
appropriately -trained clinician  based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree 
of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  20 • Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to study procedures administration and cannot be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the study procedures  should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive . 
• Probably Related  – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after  administration of the study procedures , is unlikely to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
• Potentially  Related  – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of study procedures ). However, other 
factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other 
concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it 
can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
• Unlikely to be related  – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose 
temporal relationship to study procedures  administration makes a causal relationship improbable 
(e.g., the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the study 
procedures ) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible 
explanations (e.g., the participant ’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
• Not Related  – The AE is completely independent of study procedures  administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an 
alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician.   
8.3.3.3 EXPECTEDNESS  
 A clinician with expertise in TBI, CPTH , and acupuncture will be responsible for determining whether an 
AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency 
of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study procedures . 
 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
 The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study participant . 
 
All AEs , not otherwise precluded per the protocol,  will be captured on the appropriate  eCRF. Information 
to be collected includes event description, time of onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship 
to study procedures  (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and 
time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study will be documented 
appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical or psychiatric condition that is present at the time that the participant  is screened will be 
considered as baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study participant’s condition  
deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  21 Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. Documentation of onset and duration of each episode  will be 
maintained for AEs characterized as intermittent . 
 Study staff  will record events with start dates occurring any time after the first acupuncture treatment 
session until t he 12 -week post -treatment visit. At each acupuncture treatment  visit (after the 1
st) and the 
4-week and 12 -week post -treatment visits , study staff  will inquire about the occurrence of  AE/SAEs since 
the last visit. All reported events will be monitored until the 12 -week post -treatment visit. Any reported 
event that is definitely or probably related to the intervention will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization.  
 
8.3.5  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
In consultation with the Principal Investigator (PI ) and the study clinician, a trained member of the study 
team will be  responsible for conducting an evaluation of an AE and shall report the results of such 
evaluation to the reviewing IRB either at the time of continuing review or within 10 working days of 
becoming aware of the event if the event is considered to be serious or meets the definition of an 
unanticipated problem involving risks to study subjects or others.  
 
8.3.6  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 In consultation with the PI  and the study clinician, a trained member of the study team will be  responsible 
for conducting an evaluation of a SAE and shall report the results of such evaluation to the reviewing IRB 
as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 working days after the  investigator first learns of the 
event.  
 
8.3.7  REPORTING EVENT S TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Following IRB review of any AEs or SAEs, the PI will follow the IRB’s recommended actions. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the informed consent document or process, re -consenting current 
participants, providing information to past or current participants (e.g. whenever the information may 
relate to the participant’s willingness to continue participants), and modifications to the 
protocol/research plan.  
 
8.3.8  EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
 N/A 
 
8.3.9  REPORTING OF PREGNANCY  
 
Women who are currently pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant during the study are 
excluded from this study. This is due to the hormonal changes that may alter headache patterns. I f a ny 
participant who is still undergoing acupuncture treatment expectedly or unexpectedly becomes pregnant while active in the trial, the participant will be withdrawn from the study by the Principal Investigator. The participant will be asked to complete an early withdrawal phone call in 7 -14 days from  the date the  
intervention was discontinued for safety follow -up. 
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  22 If any participant  who has completed all acupuncture treatment sessions expectedly or unexpectedly 
becomes pregnant, the participant may remain in the study until study completion.  
 
8.4 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
8.4.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
This protocol uses the definition of Unanticipated Problems as defined by t he Office for Human Research 
Protections ( OHRP ). OHRP  considers unanticipated problems involving risks to  participant s or others to 
include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
 
1. Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant  population being 
studied;  
2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the 
procedures involved in the research); and 
3. Suggests that the research places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM S REPORTING  
 The PI will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing IRB. The UP report will include the 
following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome   
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP  
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs will be reported to the IRB  as soon as possible, but no  later than 10 working days after the 
investi gator first learns of the event  
 
8.4.3  REPORTING UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  TO PARTICIPANTS  
 Following IRB review of any unanticipated problems, the PI will follow the IRB’s recommended actions. This may include, but is not limited to, modifying the informed consent document or process, re -
consenting current participants, providing information to past or current participants (e.g. whenever the information may relate to the par ticipant’s willingness to continue participants), and modifications to the 
protocol/research plan.

  23 9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Endpoint : Number of headache days over 4 weeks  
We hypothesize that 10 treatments will greater alleviate headaches when compared to 5 
treatments over a 5 -week treatment period. We also hypothesize that both treatment groups will 
have decreased headaches.  Alternatively, our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference 
between 5 and 10 treatments.  
 
• Secondary Endpoints : 1) Ad verse or Serious Adverse Events and  2) Completion of treatment 
durations and sessions  
We hypothesize that acupuncture will be safe and tolerated in both groups.  
 
• Exploratory  Endpoints: 1) Sleep , 2) Quality of life , 3) Headache Outcomes, and 4) Medications  
 
9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
 
We require 18 subjects in each study group to achieve 80% power at a 5% significance level for our primary hypothesis (PASS software version 11). The primary analysis is a  a two -sided two -sample t -test compa ring  
the mean number of headache days over 4 weeks from a parallel -group design. We hypothesize that, 
while both groups will have decreased headaches, 10 treatments will greater alleviate headaches when compared to 5 treatments over a 5 -week treatment period. For analysis purposes, we will analyze the 
data such that the opposite could be shown (5 treatments better reduces headaches). The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference between treatment groups. To conduct the power calculation, we 
assumed an equal standard deviation of 4.47,
33 equivalence  limits of ±1 SD, and a true difference between 
means of 0. No interim analyses are planned. The potential effect on our power if our estimates for the effect size are inaccurate are displayed in the table below.  
 
N δ Σ Power  Alpha  
36 4 4.5 0.742  0.05  
36 4.5 4.5 0.83 5 0.05  
36 5 4.5 0.903  0.05  
N = total sample size; δ = treatment effect (change);  
σ = standard deviation.  
 Based on preliminary estimates, we do not anticipate dif ficulty recruiting 40 subjects. HealthPartn ers 
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation p hysicians  see approximately 25 individuals  with CPTH  per month at 
the Neu roscience  Center . Therefore we will need a 16% enrollment rate to reach our recruitment goal in 
the allotted time  frame.  In addition, we also plan to recruit and enroll from other HealthPartners clinics 
and within the community.  If we see a 20% reduction in sample size due to dropout, withdrawal, or 
missing data, our power will be 75.8% to detect a similar effect size. This, and other possible changes in power due to at trition, are listed in the table below.

9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES 
 
All analyses will be performed on an intention- to-treat basis. If poor attendance at acupuncture 
treatments is observed, we will perform a per -protocol analysis as a sensitivity analysis.  
 
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
9.4.1  GENERAL APPROACH  
 Discrete variables will be summarized using frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables will be summarized by means and standard deviations. If the continuous variables are found to be skewed, we will instead report medians and interquartile ra nges. Statistical significance will be determined using 
p-values less than 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals, unless otherwise indicated. All inferential tests will 
be two -sided. For descriptive statistics (means, SDs, proportions) where no inferential sta tistics were 
conducted, we will refrain from making confirmative statements. All covariates will be pre -specified in the 
sections below. Any additional analyses will be described as post -hoc and exploratory.  
 Distribution of the outcome variables will be assessed prior to conduct of our analyses to determine if the planned tests are appropriate. If variables are found to be non- normally distributed we will explore the 
use of log -transformations or non -parametri c tests such as the Wilcoxon -Rank Tests.  
 
9.4.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
The number of headache days per 4 weeks will be captured via a headache diary. The primary outcome, 
change in number of headache days per 4 weeks between the pre -treatment assessment and 4 -week post 
treatment assessment, will be compared using a two sample  t-test. We will present the mean change by 
group with corresponding standard deviations. If baseline differences are found between study groups, they will be adjusted for using a linear regression model. In addition, a mixed- model analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) will be performed with data  from all three time points. The outcome will be number of headache 
days per 4 weeks and it will be adjusted for group, time, and a group*time interaction. If significant interactions exist, line plots and post hoc tests will be used to define the nature of the interaction.  
 
Prior to analysis, we will plot our outcomes to examine their distribution and decide whether we should 
consider non- parametric analyses. Only subjects with complete data from both pre -treatment assessmen t 
and 4 -week post treatment assessment will be inclu ded in the final analysis. Data will be analyzed per an 
intent -to-treat approach regardless of actual treatment received. If a large proportion of missing data is 
noted, we will compare baseline characteristics of subjects who completed the treatment with those who 
were lost to follow -up.  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  25  
Secondary analysis  are not dependent on results of primary endpoint. All secondary outcomes are 
measured as a single summary measure.  
 Frequencies and proportions of each study group with at least one AE/SAE will be presented together with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. To assess compliance with the protocol, the amount of 
acupuncture treatments completed in the two groups will  be reported in absolute numbers and 
percentages of target treatments. We will also report the proportion of participants who were unable to 
tolerate a 30 -minute session of acupuncture in each treatment group. No inferential statistics will be 
conducted on these secondary outcomes.  
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES 
 
AE/SAEs will be reported as described in section 8.3 of this document. They will be classified by severity, 
relationship to study procedures, and expectedness. No other formal safety analyses will be conducted.   
9.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
 Baseline variables will be compared between groups to ensure randomization achieved balanced treatment assignments. This will include demographics (e.g. gender, age, race) and medical history (e.g. 
length of stay in hospital after injury, discharge destina tion). All such variables are listed in section 8.1 of 
this document. Variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g. mean and SD, or frequency 
and proportion) and compared inferentially. Continuous variables will be compared using two- samp le t-
tests or Wilcoxon rank tests and discrete variables will be compared using chi -square tests for 
independence or Fisher’s exact tests.  
 
9.4.6  PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES  
 
N/A 
 
9.4.7  SUB -GROUP ANALYSES  
 Both primary and secondary outcomes will be descriptively summarized based on gender. Our sample size 
is unlikely to allow for other meaningful sub -group analyses.  
 
9.4.8  TABULATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT DATA 
 
N/A 
 
9.4.9  EXPLORATORY ANALYSES  
 Exploratory outcomes (headache: intensity, duration, type; sleep; and QOL) will be compared between 
groups with Student’s t -test, Chi -square test, and Mann- Whitney- U test and mixed- model ANOVAs, as 
appropriate.  As an exploratory analysis, patients who report post -COVID -19 symptoms will be identified 
using the additional COVID -19 set of questions. Types and severity of post -COVID -19 symptoms present 
within the group will be described. The t -test or non -parametric equivalent will be used to determine 
whether acupuncture had an effect on post -COVID symptoms.  
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  26  
As some patients’ medication adherence and regimens are expected to change throughout the 
intervention period, a sensitivity analysis will be performed for all primary and secondary endpoints in 
which we exclude patients with medication reginmen ammendments. These results will be compared to our main analysis to help contextualize any observed intervention effect. Patients with and without changes to their medications during the trial will be described separately and any differences will be 
presented. If necessary, we will conduct a sensitivity analysis in which we exclude participants that had 
protocol deviations (e.g. large delays between treatments) due to illness, for example COVID -19.

10.1.3  CONFIDENTIALITY  AND PRIVACY   
 
Participant  confidentiality  and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, 
the safety and oversight monitor(s), and the sponsor(s)  and funding agency. This confidentiality is 
extended to the data being collected as part of this study. Data that could be used to identify a specific study participant will be held in strict confidence within the research team . No personally -identifiable 
information from the study will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval 
of th e sponsor /funding agency .  
 All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 All study regulatory binders will be stored in a locked file cabinet within a secure office. The internal study 
monitor, representatives of the I RB, or regulatory agencies , may inspect all documents and records 
required to be maintained by the investigator, for the participant s in this study. The clinical study site will 
permit access to such records.  
 The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at the  clinical site for internal use 
during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a period as dictated by the reviewing  IRB, Institutional policies, or sponsor /funding agency  
requirements . 
 Study participant research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, will 
be password -protected and stored on REDCap, a secure web- based system. Only research study staff will 
have access to the data . Individual participants and their research data will be assigned  a unique study 
identification number.  While the study is active, subject identifiers (e.g. name, MRN) will be stored in 
REDCap, however, after the study is closed all subject identifiers will be removed . 
 The PI will ensure all mechanisms used to share data will include proper plans and safeguards for the 
protection of privacy, confidentiality, and security for data dissemination and reuse  (e.g., all data will be

10.1.6  SAFETY OVERSIGHT  
 
There is no Data Safety Monitoring Board for this study, as acupuncture has been previously shown to be 
safe and have minimal risks. During team meetings, the PI and study will review a rolling report of adverse events and report them appropriately.  
 
10.1.7  CLINICAL MONITORING  
 
N/A, refer to next section.  
 
10.1.8  QUALITY ASSURANCE AND QUALITY CONTROL  
 
Study staff  will perform internal quality management of study conduct, data collection, documentation 
and completion.  
 Quality control ( QC) procedures will be implemented as follows:  
 Informed consent --- Study staff will review both the documentation of the consenting process and 10%  
of th e completed consent documents. Feedback will be provided to study staff  to ensure proper 
consenting procedures are followed.  
 
Source documents  and the e lectronic data --- The majority of data  will be directly entered into eCRFs in 
REDCap. To ensure accuracy  for data not directly entered in REDCap, study staff will compare a 
representative sample of source data against the database, targeting key data points in that review.  
 Intervention Fidelity  — Consistent delivery of the study interventions will be monitored throughout the 
intervention phase of the study. Procedures for ensuring fidelity of intervention delivery are described in 
Section 6.2.1, Interventionist Training and Tracking . 
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  29 Protocol Deviations  – The study team will review  documented protocol deviations on an ongoing basis 
and will implement corrective actions when the quantity or nature of deviations are deemed to be at a 
level of concern.  
 
Should independent monitoring become necessary, t he PI will provide direct access to all trial related 
sites, source data/documents, and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by the 
sponsor /funding agency, and inspection by local and regulatory author ities.  
 
10.1.9  DATA H ANDLING  AND  RECORD  KEEPING  
 
10.1.9.1 DATA COLLECTION AND  MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
 
Data collection will be  the responsibility of the research study staff  under the supervision of the PI . The PI 
will be  responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported . 
 
All data  will be entered directly into eCRFs in REDCap. The data system includes password protection and 
internal quality checks  by study staff  to identify data that appear inconsist ent, incomplete, or inaccurate. 
Treatment logs from the acupuncture treatment sessions will be scanned into  and stored in REDCap.  
 
10.1.9.2 STUDY RECORDS RETENTION  
 
Investigator records will be retained in accordance with regulatory, organizational and sponsor or grantor 
requirements, but no less than 6  years following the completion of the research.  All records will be 
maintained securely with limited access. Disposal of investigator records will be done in such a manner 
that no identifying information can be linked to research data.  
 
10.1.10  PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS   
 This protocol defines a protocol deviation a s any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the participant , the investigator, or the study site staff. As a 
result of deviations, corrective actions will be developed by the site and implemented promptly.  
 It will be  the responsibility of the PI to use continuous vigilance to identify, document,  and report 
deviations as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after  identification of the protocol 
deviation. Minor deviations, which do not impact participant safety, compromise the integrity of study 
data and/or affect the participant’s willingness to participate in the research are to be reported at the time of continuing review. Protocol deviations will be addre ssed in study source documents and sent to 
the reviewing  IRB per their policies.  The PI  will be  responsible for knowing and adhering to the  reviewing 
IRB requirements.  
 
10.1.11  PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY  
 This trial will be  registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , and results information  from this  trial will be submitted to 
ClinicalTrials.gov.  In addition, every attempt will be made to publish results in peer -reviewed journals.  
 
10.1.12  CONFLICT OF INTEREST POLICY  
 
A19-094 AccuTBI   Version 11.0  
  03 March 20 23 
 
  30 The independence of this study from any actual or perceived influence, such as  by the pharmaceutical 
industry , is critical. Therefore, any actual conflict of interest of persons who have a role in the design, 
conduct, analysis, publication, or any aspect of this trial  will be disclosed and managed. Furthermore, 
persons who have a perceived conflict of interest will be required to have such conflicts managed in a way 
that is appropriate to their participation in the des ign and conduct of this t rial. The study leadership in 
conjunction with HealthPartners Institute  has established policies and procedures for all study group 
members to disclose all conflicts of interest and will establish a mechanism for the management of all reported dualities of interest.

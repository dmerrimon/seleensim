The objective  of this  project is to validate a blood test that can distinguish safe from trigger foods for 25 
protein- induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES). 26 
27 
Background: FPIES is an allergic disease that leads to r epetitive profuse vomiting in response to solid food. 28 
In severe cases, when patients fail to thrive, FPIES requires nasogastric tube installment or total parenteral 29 
nutrition (TPN). The major challenge in managing FPIES is the identification of safe (non -trigger) foods in a 30 
timely manner, while avoiding repetitive allergic reactions and recovery periods. This study proposes a 31 
solution to the problem by developing a new blood assay that screens a large number of foods (more than 32 
20) in a culture plate. Its purpose is to rapidly predict what the safe foods are. The outcome will overcome 33 
the time- lapse required to identify such safe foods, which could normally extend past a year or longer, by 34 
which time the child may have failed to thrive or developed food aversions due to association with negative 35 
experiences. 36 37 
FPIES leads to repetitive hospital and ER visits with 2,064 encounters  occurring at the University of 38 
Michigan Health System (UMHS) in the past year (from 11/01/17 until 11/01/18; data obtained using 39 
Datadirect for cohort discovery results; FPIES ICD10 K52.2). The latter number  of encounters  only 40 
comprises  newly diagnosed patients . 41 42 
In this study, FPIES patients will be recruited from the UMHS patient cohort. From  11/01/17 – 11/01/18, this 43 
cohort comprised 223 newly diagnosed patients at UMHS. T wo sub-groups will be identified as follows : i) 44 
children exhibiting FPIES  reactions to 2-3 foods, ii) children exhibiting FPIES reactions to 4 or more foods.  45 
The reason for separating patients into these two groups is due the existence of two separate groups [one 46 
with 2 -3 food triggers, and another with more than 4 food triggers] as  previously  described by the UMHS 47 
Allergists who care for FPIES patients  (Volertas S., Hudson E., McMorris G., and G. Sanders . Annals of 48 
Allergy, Asthma & Immunology  121:S119 2018) . 49 
50 
The plan is to enroll  up to 20 patients with FPIES: up to 10 exhibiting reactions  to 2-3 foods , and up to  10 51 
exhibiting FPIES reactions to 4 or more  foods . Recruitment will take place at the University of Michigan 52 
Allergy Clinics, and University of Michigan Pediatric outpatient clinics . 53 
54

 Hypotheses:   55 
1. Our blood test that we developed will distinguish safe from trigger foods for FPIES patients.  56 
2. The mechanism of FPIES involves innate immunity and the identified heatmap pattern for trigger foods 57 
will remain after foods are tolerated.  58 
 59 
Specific aims: 60 
1,  Assess the assay’s precision by its predictive accuracy in distinguishing safe foods from trigger foods.  61 
2. Evaluate the reliability  of the test when using  a panel of  standardized, frozen foods vs freshly prepared 62 
foods  63 
3. Demonstrate persistence of the immune reaction to trigger foods by comparing results of the test after 64 
trigger foods are tolerated to the initial results  65 
 66 
Exploratory aim:  67 
1. Gain further insight into the pathophysiology of FPIES through single cell RNASeq  68 
 69 
Statistical Design: A random -effects logit model will be used to model the binary outcome (safe or trigger 70 
food) as a function of the 9 biomarker measurements in the assay. The random effect in the logit model will 71 
take into consideration of the correlated data measured within the same subject. A cluster Receiver 72 
operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be used to assess the precision of the assay. Specifically, 73 
we will compute the area under the cluster ROC curve (AUC), along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). 74 
The assay is predictive if the lower limit of the 95% CI is above 0.5, which is the null value indicating no 75 
predictive ability.  76 
 77 
Brief description of the proposed study  78 
FPIES is a severe food allergy to a wide variety of foods in babies and toddlers. Usually, the symptoms 79 
resolve between the ages of 3 to 5 years old. However, the children are at risk of failing to thrive, and 80 
requiring a nasogastric tube or TPN. The objective of the  study is to validate a newly developed blood assay 81 
that will rapidly predict safe (non- trigger) foods for the affected children. In our preliminary data  (Case  Study  82 
HUM00155216),  the blood assay safely predicted more than 10 consecutive safe foods  without triggering 83 
an allergic response. Prior to the assay , allergic reactions and ER visits were repeatedly occurring.  84 
Subject Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited through the University of Michigan Allergy Clinics, and 85 
University of Michigan Pediatric outpatient clinics :  86 
1. Patients may be referred by the clinician caring for the patient.  87 
2. Pre-screening by reviewing FPIES visits in the past 2 years will be performed. Data Direct, EMERSE 88 
and billing codes may be used to identify potential subjects. The patient's primary allergist or 89 
pediatrician will be informed about study team’s contact with the identified patients.  90 
o Patients will then be contacted by email  and/or telephone by the clinical members of the 91 
study team to explain the study and determine whether they are interested in participating.  92 
Opt out information will be provided in the email and by phone contact. 93 
3. Patients may self -refer:  94 
o The study will be listed in UMHealthResearch.org  95 
o Flyers describing the study, with study team contact information,  will be posted in the 96 
participating clinics. 97

Study Design  116 
 117 
1. Potential participants will be contacted by email and / or telephone after pre- screening of  physician- 118 
diagnosed FPIES patients who have visited the UM allergy clinics within the past three  years, or who 119 
are currently in contact with the UM allergy clinic nutritionist. An option for the patients  to opt out will 120 
be provided.  The patient's primary allergist or pediatrician will be informed about study team’s 121 
contact with the identified patients.   Patients may be referred by their primary allergist during a clinic 122 
visit. 123 
2. If a parent/guardian expresses interest in the study, they will be sent/given a copy of the informed 124 
consent to review.  125 
3. An appointment will be scheduled with a study team member at the UM allergy clinics.  126 
4. The protocol will be discussed face- to-face with parent/guardian with an opportunity to ask questions 127 
and review the informed consent document.  After written informed consent  is signed by  one 128 
parent/guardian, study procedures can begin.  Parent/guardian will be given a copy of the signed 129 
informed consent and it will be imaged into the chart.  130 
5. Parent/Guardian will be asked to fill out Questionnaire One at the time of entry into the study.  131 
6. Parent/Guardian will be instructed regarding scheduling the blood draw for analysis:   132 
a. Only known “safe foods” (foods that do not induce repetitive vomiting) are to be consumed 133 
for one week before blood draw.  134 
b. Blood draw will be performed at the MLabs Blood Draw Stations  at Michigan Medicine 135 
outpatient clinics.   136 
7. Patient will have 6 ml  of blood drawn for analysis:  137 
a. 5.5 ml of blood for testing of potential food reactions  138 
b. 0.5 ml of blood for RNA/DNA analysis , which will be stored. 139 
8. After blood draw, diet will be managed per the primary clinician and nutritionist.  140 
a. Parents will be given Questionnaire Two to fill out detailed information about all foods 141 
introduced until the results of the assay are received.  142 
b. During that time, food introduction will continue as directed by primary allergist and/or 143 
nutritionist  144 
9. Blood will be analyzed by the PI  in a research lab at the University of Michigan to determine 145 
differences in the PI’s assay between potentially tolerated and not tolerated foods (see description of 146 
laboratory test lines 216-232 )   147 
10. After identification of potentially “safe foods” to be introduced in the future, the information will be 148 
given to the clinical study team  and child’s clinician , who will contact parents by phone or email 149 
(parental preference).   150 
a. Parents will be asked to detail current nutritional status, including foods tolerated or not 151 
tolerated since the initial blood draw.   Results will be recorded by the study team and the 152 
parents will be asked to return Questionnaire Two.  153 
b. After discussion within the clinical team (including clinical research team and child’s 154 
clinicians), p arents  will be instructed to introduce new foods identified as potentially safe into 155 
the diet, one at a time for seven days.  156 
c. Results of these trials will be recorded on Questionnaire Three  and returned to the study 157 
team 3 month intervals . 158 
4 
 11. A second blood draw will be performed, at least 2 weeks after the initial blood draw. 6 cc will be 159 
drawn:  160 
a. To explore the consistency of a standard panel of foods vs individually prepared foods 161 
b. To perform additional analyses including single cell RNASeq (scRNA -seq) on WBCs 162 
following treatment with foods.  163 
12. Subjects will be followed at 3 month intervals with review of tolerated foods, number and types of 164 
known triggers  assessed .  When a subject is tolerating two or more triggers foods for 3 or more 165 
months:  166 
a. Questionnaire Four will be given to fill out and return  167 
b. Subject will have 6 mL drawn for analysis  168 
i. 5.5 mL to rerun the initial assays  169 
ii. 0.5 mL for RNASeq on WBCs following treatment with foods.  170 
Study Grid  171 
 172 
 173 
B. Sources of Materials  174 
 175 
The research material obtained from the human subjects  176 
1. 6ml of blood in a K2 EDTA (lavender top) blood tube withdrawn by specialized phlebotomists in 177 
the blood draw unit ( 0.5 ml of this will be used to isolate DNA for potential future sequencing under a 178 
separate IRB ). White blood cells (WBCs) will be isolated from 5.5 ml of blood using ACK buffer lysis of red 179 
blood cells, within 1 hour of blood collection, as performed previously for the Case Study ( HUM00155216). 180 
Blood will be kept on ice in the K2 EDTA tubes during the waiting period (< 1 hour). WBCs will be plated in 181 
24 well plates, and exposed to different food homogenates for 3 hours. Total RNA will be extracted, and RT- 182 
qPCR for our gene panel will be used to generate the heatmap.  183 
A second blood draw may be requested from a limited number of patients, at least 2 -4 weeks after 184 
the initial blood draw, for scRNA -seq. In this case, the blood will be prepared in the same manner as for the 185 
initial draw above, but instead of extracting RNA, samples will be submitted to the UofM Advanced 186 
Genomics Core for them to perform scRNA -seq on the samples. The data will be analyzed using the cloupe 187 
software by 10x Genomics.  188 
A third blood draw may occur (or second blood draw if scRNA were not performed for that patient) 189 
after the patient recovers from several triggers. The patient will be screened at 3 month intervals, so the 190 
third (or second if no scRNA -seq) will be performed for this purpose at least 3 months after the initial blood 191 
draw. In this case, the cells will be prepared in the same manner as the initial blood draw, but treated with 192 

5 
 only a limited number of safe, trigger foods, and outgrown trigger foods.  193 
2. At the termination of the protocol samples and data will cease to be accessed, or  otherwise 194 
accessed again after IRB approval transferred to another existing protocol.  There are no plans to destroy 195 
records or samples.  196 
 197 
Protection of Information:  198 
All data will be kept on REDCap, a password- protected, HIPAA compliant, web-based application 199 
developed by Vanderbilt University to capture data for clinical research and create databases and projects. 200 
The databases use instruments such as surveys and forms as research capture tools. Projects are self - 201 
sufficient and secure databases that can be used for normal data entry or for surveys across multiple 202 
distinct time points.  Only study team members will have access to this data.   203 
1. A master list that includes identifiable data will be kept in a REDCap “Study Housekeeping” 204 
database that includes subject number, patient name, parent names, MRN, contact information 205 
including address, email, phone number, documentation of blood draw, samples saved and filling 206 
out of questionnaires.  207 
2. All data variables will be kept in a separate “Research Data” REDCap database.  Subjects will be 208 
identified only by subject number in this database.  Data will include:  209 
a. Results of blood tests  210 
b. Questionnaire answers  211 
c. Age 212 
d. Number of food reactions  213 
e. Identified trigger foods  214 
f. Identified tolerated foods. 215 
3. Data downloaded for analysis will have only subject number included.  216 
4. Stored RNA, DNA or cDNA samples will contain only the subject number without personal 217 
identifiers.  218 
5. Parents/guardians may request that stored blood samples be destroyed at the end of the study.  219 
 220 
C. Potential Risks  221 
 222 
Describe potential risks  223 
The risk in this study arises due to incorrect predictions by the test. The current test being validated is not 224 
an FDA -approved or cleared test. However, current standard of care recommends which foods to trial in a 225 
random fashion, and incorrect predictions frequently occur leading to reactions. Hence this study will not 226 
pose an added risk to the current standard of care. The indication of what to trial will be communicated to 227 
the patients by the allergist and nutritionist as currently occurs in the standard of care. However, the only 228 
difference is that the allergist and nutritionist will in this study use this assay for indication regarding what 229 
foods to trial. If a food is falsely identified as safe by the assay but triggers a reaction, then these reactions 230 
will be managed by the nutritionist and allergist as per current standard of care for failed trials.  231 
 232 
Blood draw from infants and toddlers is a safe procedure with minimal risks. Trained and experienced 233 
phlebotomists at UMHS perform blood draws on infants and toddlers routinely. The procedure may cause 234 
anxiety for the infant/toddler. The test can result in a small bruise or mild soreness for the child at the site of 235 
blood draw. The bruise can last for a few days.  236 
 237 
A risk of breach of confidentiality always exists in all studies.  238 
 239 
Describe alternate treatments and procedures  240 
The parent/child can proceed with introduction of new foods per guidance of the nutritionist.  This is based 241 
on historically better tolerated foods in the general FPIES population and may or may not apply to the 242 
patient.  243 
 244 
6 2. Adequacy of protection against risks 245 
246 
A. Recruitment and Informed Consent 247 248 
Plan for recruitment 249 
All FPIES patients will be recruited from the University of Michigan Allergy Clinics, and University of 250 
Michigan Pediatric outpatient clinics . The patients will be identified by pre -screening of the UM FPIES 251 
patient cohort. Pre -screening will be performed by members of the Division of Allergy and Immunology at 252 
Michigan Medicine. Patients will not be contact ed by the study team until pre- approval is obtained from  the 253 
primary allergist or pediatric clinician. Suitable FPIES patients who fulfill the inclusion and exclusion criteria 254 
will be  contacted by email and / or phone. An option to opt out will be provided. If patients are interested in 255 
participating, a meeting with the study team will be scheduled at the UM allergy clinics. The patients will be 256 
presented with the consent form by the study team member to consider consenting for the study and the 257 
blood draw procedure.  Patients will be told that their decision whether to participate in the study will not 258 
affect their clinical care.  259 260 
Describe the circumstances of consent 261 
A study coordinator  or clinical study team member  familiar with the study protocol will obtain informed 262 
consent for all participants. Consent/assent will be obtained prior to any study measures/questionnaires. 263 
Each participant will receive a verbal and written explanation of the purposes, procedures, risks, and 264 
potential benefits of the study in language appropriate for the individual. 265 
266 
B. Protections Against Risk 267 
268 
Planned procedures for protecting against risk 269 270 
1. The risk of a false result will be managed by the allergist and nutritionist as per current standard of care in 271 
managing reactions to failed trials.  272 273 
2.The risk from blood draw is minimal and routinely performed by the phlebotomists at UMHS . 274275
3. All data variables will be kept in a separate “Research Data” REDCap database.  Subjects will be 276 
identified only by subject number in this database. 277 278 
4. A separate “Housekeeping” REDCap database will be used to link the patient identifiable information and 279 
the study number.  280 
281 
3. Potential benefit of the proposed research to the research subjects and others 282 283 
Potential benefits 284 
There may be direct benefit to the patient by the potential of identifying tolerated foods, thus avoiding the 285 
adverse reactions of frequent emesis and potential dehydration, as well as the trauma parents encounter 286 
when giving their infant a food that causes such reactions. There may be benefit to the larger community of 287 
FPIES patients if this protocol indicates the new assay can identify tolerated vs non -tolerated foods.  288 
289 
Discuss why risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to benefits 290 
Patients already encounter false predictions and failed trials with allergic reactions regularly. The indication 291 
from the assay is expected to predict safe foods at a higher rate than the guesswork utilized in the current 292 
standard of care. 293 294 
4. Importance of the knowledge to be gained 295 
296 
Discuss importance of the knowledge to be gained 297 
Validation of this test has the potential to modify patient care strategy for patients with FPIES. As such, 298 
random guessing of safe foods would be replaced by a scientific “guide” to what might be hypoallergenic to 299 
the body’s immune cells using this test.  300 
7 
  301 
Discuss why the risks are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge to be gained  302 
Currently, trialing food is random. Obtaining a guide for what might be a safe food, by utilizing  our proposed 303 
assay, would be invaluable. Incorrect predictions cannot pose more risk than random selection of foods to 304 
trial. Hence, there is only benefit to be gained if the test is predictive or partially predictive. 305 
 306 
II. INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES   307 
 308 
Inclusion of Women  309 
This study will include children of both  gender s.  310 
 311 
Inclusion of Minorities  312 
The disease is overwhelmingly predominant in White Caucasian children ( Based on personal communication with 313 
allergist s caring for FPIES patients  at UofM clinics,  and the following published abstract: R. Tarrant  and A. and Byrne. Clinical 314 
Presentation and Food Allergens Associated with Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome – a frequently misdiagnosed rare 315 
form of gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity. European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition 62(1); DOI: 316 
10.13140/RG.2.1.1621.2087 ). Therefore, for the purpose of feasibility of meeting the required proposed patient 317 
numbers for statistical analyses, we have chosen a majority of White Caucasian subjects for this initial 318 
study. If patients from other ethnicities – who do not usually have FPIES enroll – they will not be excluded 319 
from the study.  320 
 321 
Inclusion of Children  322 
Children with FPIES will be included in this study.  323

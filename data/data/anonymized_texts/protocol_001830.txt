Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  16 1 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter Phase 1b Randomized, Placebo -controlled, Blinded Study to 
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Microbiome Study Intervention Administration 
in Combination with Anti -PD-1 Therapy in Adult Patients with Unresectable or Metastatic 
Melanoma  
Short Title:   Melanoma Checkpoint and G ut Mic robiome A lteration w ith Microbiome 
Intervention (MCGRAW)  
Rationale:  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral microbiome study interventions ( fecal microbiota transplant [ FMT ] or SER -401) or matching placebo in 
combination with anti -programmed cell death 1 ( anti-PD-1) therapy (nivolumab) in participants 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study  also intends to assess clinical outcomes, 
the impact of  microbiome study intervention administration on the microbiome profile , and its 
association with clinical and i mmunological  outcomes. 
Synopsis Table 1: Key Objectives and Endpoints:  
Objectives Endpoints  
Primary   
• To determine the safety of microbiome  study  
intervention administration with anti- PD-1 therapy.  • Incidence and severity of AEs  
• Change from baseline in vital signs, clinical 
laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and ECOG 
performance status.  
Secondary   
• To evaluate the engraftment of FMT and SER -401 
bacteria into the intestinal microbiome community in stool samples.  
• To assess the association of microbiome study 
intervention administration with clinical outcomes 
(objective response rate [ORR], disease control rate 
[DCR], progression- free survival [PFS] rate , overall 
survival [OS] , and duration of response ). 
• To assess t he change in percentage of tumoral CD8 
cells in tumor samples in response to anti -PD-1 
therapy with or without microbiome study intervention administration.  • Determination of the engraftment of FMT or 
SER-401 bacteria into each of the microbiome study 
intervention groups  relative to placebo . 
• ORR: Defined as CR or PR as best response by 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 assessment. Participants who 
do not have RECIST assessment for any reason will be counted as not responding.  
• DCR: Defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for 
≥ 24 weeks as best response by RECIST v 1.1. 
Participants who do not have RECIST assessment for any reason will be counted as not responding.  
• PFS: Defined as the time from randomization to date 
of first docu mented  radiographic progression of 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  17 Objectives Endpoints  
disease  or date of death due to any cause , whichever 
occurs first . 
• PFS rate at 1 year: Defined as the proportion of 
participants without documented progression of disease or death due to any cause at 1 year.  
• OS: Defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause.  
• OS rate at 1 year: Defined as the proportion of participants alive at 1 year.  
• Duration of response: Defined as time from date of 
documented CR or PR to date of first documented 
radiographic progression of disease  or date of death 
due to any cause , whichever occurs first . 
• Change in the percentage of CD8 cells in tumor 
tissue from baseline at Cycle 2.  
AE = adverse event; CR = complete response; CTCAE = Common Terminology for Adverse Events ; DCR = disease 
control rate; ECOG = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; ORR = objective response rate; OS = overall survival; 
PD-1 = programmed cell death -1; PFS = progression- free survival; PR = partial response; RECIST = Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors; SD = stable disease; TOX = trial- limiting toxicities  
 
Overall Design:  
This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled, blinded study in adult 
participants  with unresectable or  metastatic melanoma to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
FMT, SER -401, or matching placebo in combination with anti -PD-1 therapy (nivolumab) . Prior 
to initia ting microbiome study intervention and nivolumab, participants will undergo an 
antibiotic or  antibiot ic placebo  treatment lead -in to prime the  gut microbiome for engraftment of 
the oral microbiome study intervention. Study intervention groups  will be assessed for safety , 
changes in the microbiome, changes in percentage of tumoral CD8 T cells , and antitumor 
activity.  Participants must have measurable disease that can be biopsied and consent to baseline 
and on- treatment biopsies , as well as stool and blood biomarker collection throughout the study. 
Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 2 oral  microbiome study interventions and randomized 
within each microbiome study intervention to the following groups:  
• FMT:  Group 1 ( FMT ) or Group 2 ( FMT matching placebo ) 
• SER-401: Group 3 ( SER-401 matching placebo ) or Group 4 (SER -401) 
 
Partic ipants randomly assigned to receive placebo in Groups 2 or  3 and who have progression of 
disease while on study will be offered the option of receiving active S ER-401 and nivolumab 
treatment  as part of  a cross -over to Grou p 5.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  18 Number of Participant s: 
Approximately 60 participants will be treated . Since the primary objective is safety, no formal 
power/sample size computation is performed.  
Enrollment caps will be utilized to ensure  adequate representation of participants with low (ie, 
“unfavorable”)  fecal microbiome composition of the Ruminococcaceae  abundance -based metric 
at screening. Each study intervention (FMT or SER -401) will enroll a minimum of 18 
participants (60%) with low Ruminococcaceae  (see Section 2.2.2) . 
Intervention  Groups and Duration:  
Participants will be assigned  to 1 of the  2 oral microbiome study interventions (FMT or 
SER-401) by the I nvestigator based on clinical judgment and availability or feasibility of the 
interventions. Within  each  microbiome study intervention, participants will be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to the oral microbiome study intervention or  matching placebo.  
Prior to initiating the microbiome study intervention, participants will undergo a 4- day lead -in 
pretreatment with either antibiotic (vancomycin) or antibiotic placebo to prime the gut 
microbiome for engraftment of the oral microbiome study intervention, w hich will be 
administered following a 2- 3 day washout.

b The End of Treatment Visit will be completed following the last dose of study intervention (ie, after  12 cycles of study intervention or  at early discontinuation). All participants , 
including those who disc ontinue early after receiving any study intervention,  should have the End of Treatment  visit to complete the visit procedures. The visit at which disease 
assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the End of Treatment visit if it occurs 30 (+5) days after the last dose of nivolumab. Every effort should be made to 
complete the visit within the 30 (+5) da y window; however, the visit should be conducted even if outside the window.  Participants who have received any microbiome study 
intervention should continue to be followed for SAEs and AESIs up to 26 weeks  after the last dose of microbiome study intervention (see Section 8.3.1 ).

beyond the 12 cycles administered in  this clinical trial  will not be  considered alternative therapy). If the participant has started alternative therapy within that 100 days after the 
last dose , the first follow up visit will be contact by telephone only.  AEs, concomitant medications, or other assessments are r eported up t o the date of start of alternative therapy . 
d For approximately 2 years from the initiation of study intervention, participants will be contacted by telephone every 3 months to determine their survival status.  
e Participants randomly assigned to receive placebo in Groups 2 or 3 and who have radiographic evidence of progression of disease while on study will be offered the option of 
receiving active SER -401 and nivolumab treatment as part of a cross -over to  Group  5. Participants who agree to this o ption will provide informed consent and will enter

g Circulating soluble analytes and blood immune biomarkers will be assessed at screening, Microbiome Lead -in (Day -7), Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycles 2 -4 Day 1, and EOT.  
h Stool will be collected at screening for assessment of the fecal microbiome composition of the Ruminococcaceae abundance -based metric for stratification  and other microbiome 
assessments . A second screeni ng collection will be allowed if the results of the initial screening collection are indeterminate. Following randomization, stool will be collected 
with a window of up to 2  days prior to the following timepoints, when feasible:  start of microbiome study intervention ( ie, collected after completion of ABX or ABX placebo 
and prior to the start microbiome study intervention)  and Cycle 1 Day 1 (ie, 7 days after start of microbiome study intervention). Thereafter, stool will be collected w ith a

weeks after last dose of microbiome study intervention); Cycle 7 Day 1; and at  EOT.  
i Participants will undergo 2 -3 tumor biopsies: prior to beginning any protocol therapy including antibiotic treatment (ie, baseline biopsy, mandatory), and during treatment (ie, 
on-treatment biopsy during Cycle 2, if medically feasible ). On-treatment biopsy should occur as early as possible after the second dose of nivolumab (ie, Cycle 2, Day 2 – 
Day 12); however, any on-treatment biopsy after Day 1 of Cycle 2 will be accepted. An optional biopsy may be obtained during the course of the st udy or at the time of disease 
progression, including  from participants who respond and subsequently progress.  
j All SAEs will be collected from the time the participant signs informed consent. All AEs , including AESIs, will be collected from the start of study intervention.   
k Randomization occurs prior to ABX administration.  
l Participants will be asked to bring the participant diary to each clinical visit so that the clinical staff can record the compliance and safety information on an ongoing basis.  
m Four days of oral QID vancomycin (125 mg) or placebo pretreatment, which can be self -administered at home, followed by a washout prior to starting microbiome study 
intervention. The washout duration will be a minimum of 2 days (48 hours), with a w indow of 1 additional day (24 hours), if needed to accommodate scheduling. Microbiome 
study intervention should be initiated no more than 3 days (72 hours) after stopping the antibiotic or antibiotic placebo.  
n The first dose of FMT or matching placebo wil l be administered in the clinic  and will be followed by a 1-hour observation period after dos ing. The participant should have 
nothing by mouth for 4 hours prior to and 45 minutes following FMT administration. Subsequent doses of FMT or matching placebo wil l be dispensed for administration at the  
study  site. FMT or matching placebo will be administered  QOD for 3 doses for the first week . If needed to accommodate scheduling, no more than 1 of the 3 doses may be 
administered with a window of 1 additional day ( ie, dosing interval of up to 3 days instead of 2 days).  Tests and procedures as indicated are required at the time of the first dose 
(Day -7) only and do not need to be repeated at the visits for  the second and third doses.  Starting on Cycle 1 Day  1, FMT or matching placebo will be administered QW for 8 
weeks.   
o The first dose of SER -401 or matching placebo will be administered in the clinic  and will be followed by a 1 -hour observation period after dosing.  SER-401 should be taken at 
approximately the same time on each day. The participant should observe an overnight or at least a 6-hour fast (no food or drink except for small amounts of water) prior to 
SER-401 administration. Subsequent doses of SER -401 or m atching placebo will be dispensed to the participant for self-administ ration  QD at home. Compliance will be 
recorded on the participant -reported diary.   
p Nivolumab will be administered at a dose of 480 mg IV over 30 minutes Q4W starting on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and will continue for up to 12 cycles, unless the participant 
experiences confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in the judgment of the treating physician. A cycle is defined as 4 calendar weeks. The time between 
nivolumab doses should not be less than 25 days.

2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
This study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral microbiome 
study interventions (fecal microbiota transplant [FMT] or SER -401) or matching placebo in 
combination with anti -programmed cell death 1 (anti -PD-1) therapy  (nivolumab)  in participants 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The study also intends to assess clinical outcomes , 
the impact of microbiome  study intervention administration on the microbiome profile , and its  
association with clinical and immunological  outcomes. 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer with an incidence that is rising rapidly ( Tripp et al., 
2016). It was estimated that 80,000 patients would be diagnosed with melanoma in 2017 in the 
United States, with over 10,000 patients dying of metastatic disease ( Siegel et al., 2017). 
Melanoma disproportionately causes a significant number of life years lost per cancer -related 
death, resulting in substantial fi nancial burden (US $3.5 billion per year) ( Ekwueme et al., 2011 ). 
Historically, <  10% of patients with stage IV melanoma achieve long- term (>  5 years) survival 
(Balch et al., 2010).  
Four immune checkpoint inhibitor (CPI)  monotherapy or combination regimens, each of which 
can produce long- term clinical benefit, have been approved since 2011 for the treatment of 
patients with stage IV melanoma. Ipilimumab, a humanized antibody that blocks  cytotoxic T -
lymphocyte -associated protein 4 ( CTLA -4) on the surface of T cells , approved in 2011, achieves 
clinical responses in ~10% of patients, but results in 3 year overall survival (OS) rates of ~22% 
with many durable responses ( Hodi et al., 2010; Balch et al., 2010; Schadendorf et al., 2015). 
Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, approved in 2014, are antibodies against PD -1 on the surface of 
T cells;  both achieve clinical responses in 35- 45% of treatment -naïve patients, with most 
responses lasting >2 years ( Hodi et al., 2010; Ribas et al., 2016). Importantly, high- grade toxicity 
rates are much lower for the more active anti -PD-1 therapies (8%) compared with ipilimumab 
(27%) (Robert et al., 2015a ). While the results with single -agent anti -PD-1 therapy are  
impressive, combined treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab (FDA -approved 2015) produces 
clinical responses in 55- 60% of metastatic melanoma patients ( Ribas et al., 2017; Larkin  et al., 
2015). The increased activity of ipilimumab/nivolumab, however, is accompanied by increased 
side effects; 55% of patients experience significant toxicities, some long lasting or lethal, and 
~30% of patients have to stop treatment due to toxicity. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new approaches that are safer, and which may also overcome resistance in patients who fail this treatment.

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  29 2.2.1 Microbiome Modulation  
The microbiome is the collection of microbes – bacteria, viruses and fungi – that live on and in 
the human body. The composition of the gut microbiome has received particular scientific 
attention due to its correlation with various disease processes. Our understanding of the bacterial 
component of the gut microbiome in particular has been advanced in the last decade due to the 
use of next generation sequencing to elucidate  the complex and variable ecology of commensal 
species and pathobionts (commensal species that, under certain circumstances can play a role in disease). The gut microbiome is thought to play a role in health in the following broad ways:  
promoting resistance to colonization and infection by pathogenic bacteria; educating and 
regulating the immune system; maintaining gut epithelial barrier integrity; modulating host metabolism; and potentially altering the function of the central nervous system  (Lynch and 
Pedersen, 2016) . 
Fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) is a procedure where minimally processed stool is transferred from a donor to a person with disease. FMT can be administered via oral capsules ( Youngster et 
al., 2016), nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube, colonoscopy or enema. FMT has been shown to 
prevent recurrence of Clostridium difficile  infection (CDI), and reported rates of efficacy var y 
from 50% to 90+%. However, the largest blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled study using 
enema delivery suggested prevention of recurrence in 63.9% of subjects receiving FMT 
compared to 45.5% for placebo (p = 0.046, Dubberke et al., 2016). The other indication in which 
FMT has shown efficacy in blinded, randomized, placebo- controlled setting is active, mild -to-
moderate ulcerative colitis with remission rates of ~20% above placebo ( Moayyedi et al., 2015; 
Paramsothy et al., 2017). Unlike CDI, efficacy in treating active ulcerative colitis requires repetitive FMT, for instance weekly or daily over a 6- 8 week period. FMT is generally regarded 
as well tolerated with adverse events (AEs) limited to nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, 
and diarrhea ( Vermeire et al., 201 6; Pigneur and Sokol, 2016). While FMT has been evaluated in 
other disease conditions, there is as yet no compelling evidence for clinical utility  for indications 
other than CDI.  
The activity of repetitive FMT in the setting of ulcerative colitis demonstrates the causal relationship between microbiome c omposition and immune tone. In animal models  and studies in 
human cohorts , bacterial genera such as Bacteroides , Clostridium , and Faecalibacterium  have 
been reported to modulate antitumor immunity via  expansion of T -regulatory cells, activation of 
dendriti c cells or secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018, Sivan et 
al., 2015; Routy et al., 2018; Matson et al., 2018). The link between gut microbiota composition and immune state has prompted an evaluation in cancer and particularly, in regard to treatment with immunotherapy such as CPI ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  30 SER-401 is a spore preparation made from the stool of a healthy donor whose fecal microbiome 
embodies characteristics of the “ favorable ” microbiome  profile  identified by Gopalakrishnan et 
al. (Gopalakrishnan et a l., 2018)  as discussed in Section 2.2.3. Spore preparations from healthy 
donors that embody characteristics of th e “favorable ” microbiome  have been  shown to be 
efficacious in improving response to anti -PD-1 treatment in several mouse models of cancer  
(SER-TSC-18-002 Report, 2018;  SER -TSC-18-003 Report, 2018;  SER -TSC-18-006 Report, 
2018) . 
2.2.2 Combination of Oral Microbiome and Checkpoint Inhibitor 
Therapy  
Despite the impressive benefits of single -agent CPI in patients with Stage IV melanoma, less 
than 10% of patients achieve complete  response to therapy ( Robert et al., 2015a ; Robert et al., 
2015b; Ribas et al., 2016). While CPI is now standard- of-care for the treatment of advan ced 
metastatic melanoma patients, there is a global effort to improve response to these therapies in 
order to extend this benefit to the majority of patients, most of whom will die as a result of their 
cancer.  
The microbiome of metastatic melanoma patients  prior to treatment with anti- PD-1 monoclonal 
antibody has been studied by investigators at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer 
Center (MDACC). These findings, which were recently published ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018), 
demonstrate that the pretreatment composition of the fecal microbiome in patients who respond 
to anti -PD-1 therapy ( responder [ R]) has a distinct bacterial signature compared to patients who 
do not respond to anti -PD-1 therapy ( non-responder [ NR]). Specifically, higher alpha -diversity 
(ie, a higher number of different species) and relative abundance of the bacterial genus Faecalibact erium  (within the order Clostridiales and Family Ruminococcaceae) was associated 
with better treatment response  and prolonged progression- free survival (PFS) (Figure  2A-C). 
Conversely, lower alpha -diversity and higher abundance of the bacterial order Bacteriodales was 
associated with lack of treatment response and shorter PFS ( Figure  2A-B, D ). The bacterial  
signature in patients who achieved a response to anti -PD-1 treatment was also associated with a 
more favorable tumor immune profile in a subset of melanoma patients with available tumor 
samples ( Figure  2E-F). Analysis of the stool microbiome and clinical response to anti -PD-1 
treatment from an additional cohort of metastatic melanoma patients also supported the use of a 
Ruminococcaceae abundance -based metric (unpublished data). Across the Gopalakrishnan study 
(43 patient s), the additional cohort (69 patients), and the combined dataset (112 melanoma 
patients), Ruminococcaceae  family abundance, and the higher order taxa containing 
Ruminococcaceae, were the only common statistically significant enrichment in Responders vs Non-responders.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  31 In order to evaluate causality in a preclinical model, the MDACC team transplanted the fecal 
microbiota  (FMT)  from human melanoma patients who either responded to CPI (Rs) or failed to 
respond to CPI (NRs) into germ free mice via oral gavage. After several weeks for microbiome equilibration, syngeneic murine tumors were implanted, and mice were treated with CPI 
(anti-programmed cell death ligand 1 [ PD-L1] antibody). Mice who received FMT from R 
patients  experienced a significantly lower tumor burden and improved responses to PD -L1-based 
therapy compared to mice who received NR FMT (n =  6, Figure  2G). The differences in tumor 
size (expressed as a fold change relative to control) were computed using the Mann -Whitney test  
(p < 0.01) . Fecal microbiota transplant  alone was not evaluated in these preclinical studies as it 
has been reported to have minimal antitumor activity as a single agent treatment ( Matson et al., 
2018).

Based on these analyses, healthy donors  whose stool ha s a “favorable” microbiome composition 
of high Ruminococcaceae, similar to that of melanoma patients w ho achieved  a response to anti -
PD-1 treatment, will be  enrolled in a stool donor collection protocol for the oral FMT 
manufacturing to be used in this study. Ruminococcaceae abundance for an “unfavorable” 
microbiome will be used as a stratification metric for this study. 
2.2.3 Background on Microbiome Study Intervention  
Support for the use of microbiome study intervention is provided in Section 2.2.1. 
Two investigational microbiome products will be used  in this program. The FMT investigational 
product will be collected and process ed from qualified healthy donors according to established 
FMT procedures described by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Investigational New Drug 
(IND) 16011. The FMT will be delivered in capsule form . This group is intended to test the 
safety of an intervention whose composition is enr iched in the family Ruminococcaceae that is 
characterized as a “ favorable ” microbiome  (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018). By virtue of  possessing 
spore formers and non- spore fo rmers, the FMT investigational product represents a broader  set 
of bacterial taxa. It will be ad ministered at  a dose and regimen consistent with a  prior study of 
FMT in chronic disease settings ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
SER-401 is an investigational product containing microbial spores purified from the stool of 
qualified healthy donors and delivered in capsule form. This group is intended to test the safety 
of an intervention whose composition is enriched in spore -forming members of the family 
Ruminococcaceae that is characterized as a “favorable” microbiome ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 
2018). It will be administered  at a dose and regimen similar to that used in prior studies of spore -
based products for the treatment of active mild -to-moderate ulcerative colitis ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
The study design, evaluating FMT and SER -401 in the same clin ical study , provides the  
opportunity to define how the participant’s microbiome influences CPI therapy outcomes by including a wide range of bacterial species from 2 microbiologically -diverse investigational drug 
products. The aim of this clinical study is  to determine : 
(1) safety and tolerability of each study intervention group (microbiome study interventions  
or matched placebo, each combine d with anti- PD-1 therapy ). 
(2) whether microbiome administration increases  the percentage of tumoral CD8 cells and 
enhances response to anti -PD-1 therapy  as deter mined by clinical endpoints of ORR, 
DCR, PFS, and OS ; and if so, 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  34 (3) the changes in the fecal microbiome as a result of administration  of microbiome study 
intervention, and , in an exploratory setting, to identi fy species and metabolites that 
correlate with clinical and immunological outcomes . 
 
2.2.4 Background on Nivolumab  
Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD -1 
receptor and blo cks its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2, releasing PD -1 pathway -mediated 
inhibition of the immune response, including the antitumor immune response. Opdivo® 
(nivolumab) is approved in the US for the treatment of several cancer types, including unresectabl e or metastatic melanoma (as monotherapy or in combination with ipilimumab) and 
as monotherapy in previously- treated metastatic non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), advanced 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC), relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) , locally 
advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma; recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H) or mismatch repair 
deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).  
Refer to the approved prescribing information ( Opdivo USPI, 2019) for detailed background 
information on nivolumab. 
2.3 BENEFIT/RISK ASSESSMENT  
Nivolumab has demonstrated durable responses exceeding 6 months as monotherapy in several tumor types, including NSCLC, melanoma, RCC,  cHL, small cell lung cancer , SCCHN , 
urothelial cancer, HCC, and MSI -H or dMMR CRC. In confirmatory trials , nivolumab 
demo nstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS as compared with the current standard 
of care in subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, advanced or metastatic NSCLC, 
advanced RCC, or SCCHN. 
The safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is similar across tumor types. There is no pattern in 
the incidence, severity, or causality of AEs  to nivolumab dose level. In Phase 3 controlled 
studies, the safety profile of nivolumab monotherapy is acceptable in the context of the observed 
clinical effica cy, and manageable using established safety guidelines. Clinically relevant AEs 
typical of stimulation of the immune system were infrequent and manageable by delaying or 
stopping nivolumab treatment and timely immunosuppressive therapy or other supportive care (Opdivo USPI, 2019).  
Overall, these findings support a favorable benefit -risk profile for nivolumab across various 
tumor types. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y expected AEs of nivolumab may be found in the prescribing information ( Opdivo 
USPI, 2019).  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  35 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has emerged as an important tool for investigating the 
role of the microbiome in humans. FMT is most commonly used for preventing Clostridium 
difficile  recurrence in patients with multiple  recurrent infection s and is considered standard of 
care (McDonald et al. , 2018).  Due to its reported safety profile (see below), the experimental use 
of FMT has expanded to include indications as diverse as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
hepatic encephalopathy, autism spectrum disorder, metabolic syndrome and Parkinson’s disease 
(reviewed in Choi and Cho, 2016). Indeed, there are now studies in patients with refractory 
melanoma evaluating FMT derived from stool donor(s) who were responders to CPI tre atment 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) or FMT derived from stool donors who were complete responders to CPI in 
combination with anti -PD-1 treatment ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . A third study is evaluating microbiome 
drug product in combination with anti -PD-1 treatment in patients with solid tumors 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).   
Short -term reported adverse events following FMT include abdominal discomfort, bloating, 
flatulence, diarrhea, vomiting, fever , and constipation ( Choi and Cho, 2016). IBD flares have 
been reported in patients with a history of IBD in multiple studies, including those not being 
actively treated for IBD ( Qazi et al.,  2017). Procedural complications, including perforations and 
bleeding following endoscopy or pulmonary aspiration following naso- duodenal administration, 
have also been reported ( Choi and Cho, 2016) . The long- term evaluatio n of FMT safety has been 
limited since most CDI studies are IND -exempt and conducted by individual investigators or 
physicians. Potential serious adverse events (SAEs) include infection by undetected or 
unscreened enteric pathogens (bacteria, viruses, fungi and protists) present in the FMT product  
(Wang et al., 2016) , and mortality ( Lee et al., 2016 ; Dubberke et al., 2018).  In addition to the risk 
of transfer of infectious agents, additional potential concerns include increased frequency of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, obesity or liver disease including non- alcoholic 
steatohepatitis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), immunological/inflammatory disorders such as 
IBD, asthma and autoimmune conditions. Most of these long- term concerns have not been 
reported but have a scientific basis due to the association of the microbiome in humans with 
many of these diseases. There is  one case report suggesting the transmission of obesity from 
stool donor to the FMT patient in the setting of CDI ( Alang and Kelley , 2015).  
Several studies have shown that following FMT delivered via colonoscopy or ene ma, the 
recipient microbiome changes within days and tends to be more similar to the donor than the pre -
FMT baseline ( Hamilton et al., 2013; Weingarden et al., 2015; Khanna et al., 2017). There can 
be variation in the recipient’s microbiome composition over time. The donor -recipient similarity 
is strongest immediately following FMT; as time progresses, the patient tends to diverge from the donor microbiome profile, and the patient’s microbiome assumes a unique composition, distinct from either the donor or the starting state post -antibiotics ( Hamilton et al., 2013; 
Weing arden et al., 2015; Khanna et al., 2017).  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  36 Frozen oral formulations of FMT have been reported in the literature for patients with recurrent 
CDI ( Youngster et al., 2016). Participants with CDI  received a regimen of 15 FMT capsules 
orally per day for 2 days. Resolution of diarrhea was observed in 14/20 (70%) patients after a single regimen with no serious adverse events attributed to the treatment. Of the 6 non-
responders, 4 responded to a subsequent treatment ( Youngster et al., 2016) , demonstrat ing that 
oral administration of frozen FMT capsules can be effective in the treatment of CDI and 
restructures the gut microbiome. 
SER-401 is a purified suspension of Firmicute  spores derived from a donor whose microbiome 
meets the Ruminococcaceae  metric characterized as favorable ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018
). 
While SER -401 has not been evaluated in huma ns, related donor -derived spore products, 
SER-109 and SER -287, have been evaluated in clinical studies in subjects with recurrent CDI 
and ulcerative colitis ( [UC]; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED];  NCT 02618187) at a dose of 1 x 108 SporQs (“ spore 
equivalents ”, a biochemical measure of spor e content equivalent to approximately 1 x 107 spore 
colony- forming units [ SCFUs ]) in 1 or 2 doses  (SER -109) or a weekly or daily dose for up to 
8 weeks  (SER -287). 
Subjects with multiply recurrent CDI or with mild -to-moderate UC may differ from individuals 
considering a study of SER -401. In Seres’ studies of SER -109, the average age of subjects  who 
received  SER -109 was ~ 65 years, whereas in studies with SER -287, the ave rage age of subjects  
was 47 years. This difference may influence the  AEs  that may be antic ipated in  subject s 
administered  SER -401. 
In 3 completed clinical studies (SERES -001, SERES -004, and SERES -005) a total of 141 
subjects received 1 or 2 doses of SER -109. The available safety data from these 3 studies, 
including 2 open- label studies and 1 placebo -controlled study, suggest that SER -109 is safe and 
well-tolerated in subjects with multiply recurrent CDI, although in these subjects SER -109 is 
associated with a slight increase in gastrointestinal (GI) AEs , particularly diarrhea , compared 
with placebo (25% vs. 14% , respectively ). 
Across c ompleted studies of SER -109 as of April 19, 2017, 87% of the subjects (123/141) who 
had received 1 or 2 doses of SER -109 had experienced at least one AE. Most adverse events 
were mild to moderate in intensity , and the most common events ( ie, incidence ≥ 5%  in either  
study) were  GI disorders. Overall, 24% (34/141) of subjects had an AE reported to be related to 
SER-109 (ie , probably or likely due to SER -109). In total, 15% of subjects who had received 
SER-109 (21/141) had experienced at least 1 SAE ; however, no SAEs were reported to be 
related  to SER -109. There have been 6 deaths in subjects who received SER -109, all of which 
were unrelated to SER -109 and 1 of which occurred after the subject left the study. 
Clinical experience with SER -287 includes a completed Phase 1 b study (SERES -101), a 
multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multiple dose study that  evaluated 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  37 the safety and tolerability of SER -287, in addition to the microbiome alterations and 
pharmacodynamics associated with 2 dosing regimens of SER -287 in adult subjects with active 
mild-to-moderate U C. The study enrolled a total of 58 subjects who were randomized into 1 of 4 
treatment groups;  endpoints were assessed following a 6- day pretreatment period (vancomycin 
or placebo) f ollowed by an 8- week induction treatment period (SER -287 or matching placebo). 
This regimen is similar to the proposed use of SER -401. 
As of September 19, 2017, safety information was available for all subjects who were followed 
for up to 92 days (11.5 wee ks), including subjects who withdrew from the study at an earlier 
time point.  Forty -seven subjects received SER -287; 15 subjects received daily SER -287 and 32 
subjects received weekly SER -287. The available safety data from this study suggest that SER -
287 is safe and well -tolerated in subjects  with UC , with a safety profile similar to placebo.  
Among the 47 subjects who received SER -287:  
• Overall, there were a total of 91 treatmen t-emergent adverse events (TE AEs) reported in 
subjects who received SER -287; al l were considered to be mild to moderate in intensity.  
A total of 66% of subjects (31/47) who received SER -287 experienced at least 1 TEAE.  
• 27.7% of subjects  (13/47) had a least 1  TEAE  reported to be related to  SER -287, the most 
common being abdominal pain (8.5% compared with  0% in the placebo group) and 
diarrhea (6.4% compared with  9.1% in the placebo group).  
• There was one SAE ( worsening depression in a subject with a history of depression) , 
which was considere d not to be related to study drug by the investigator. 
• There were no deaths in the study. 
 
One of the primary objectives of the SER -287 Phase 1b UC trial was to determine the 
engraftment of SER -287 bacteria in each of the treatment groups relative to placebo. The data 
support oral administration of a spore -based microbiome drug product following vancomycin 
pretreatment and demonstrate conversion to the Ruminococcaceae metric characterized as a 
favorable in the majority of the UC participants ( SER-DSC -0043 Report, 2018). In the absence 
of antibiotic pretreatment, engraftment of SER -287 was neither robust nor durable. SER -287 
given daily after vancomycin led to rapid engraftment which reached a maximum by Day 10. 
Engraftment  did not change between Day 56, the last day of treatment, and 4 weeks thereafter, 
consistent with properties expected of a living drug. 
In addition, c linical remission  and endoscopic improvement  were  improved with daily dosing 
compared with weekly dosing of SER -287.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  38 Overall, these findings support a favorable benefit -risk profile for FMT  and SER-401 in humans 
across a range of diseases.  The treatment of participants with metastatic melanoma with oral 
FMT or SER -401 in combination with anti -PD-1 therapy is expected to be safe and tolerable. 
Additionally, we postulate that treatment with oral FMT or SER -401 will favorably impact the 
microbiome profile of participants treated with the combination and cor relate with clinical

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
This is a Phase 1b, multicenter, randomized, placebo- controlled, blinded study in adult 
participants  with  unresectable or metastatic melanoma to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
FMT, SER -401, or matching placebo in combi nation with anti -PD-1 therapy. Participants must 
have measurable disease that can be biopsied and consent to baseline and on- treatment biopsies.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  40 Approximately 60 participants will be treated  with  microbiome study intervention or placebo in 
combination with nivolumab. Enrollment caps will be utilized to ensure adequate representation 
of participants with  low (ie, “unfavorable”) fecal microbiome composition of the 
Ruminococcaceae abundance -based metric at screening. Each study intervention (FM T or 
SER-401) will enroll a minimum of 18 participants (60%) with low Ruminococcaceae.  
After consenting to participate in this clinical trial, participants will undergo screening for eligibility, including blood and stool biomarker  sampling , assessment of stool for the 
Ruminococcaceae abundance -based metric for stratification,  and tumor biopsies ( baseline and 
on-treatment core needle or incisional biopsies are required; fine needle aspiration is not 
acceptable). Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 2 oral microbiome study interventions (FMT or SER -401) by the Investigator based on clinical judgment and availability or feasibility  of the 
interventions. Within each study intervention, participants will be  randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
the oral  microbiome study intervention or matching placebo ( Figure 1 ). 
The 2 -week antibiotic/microbiome study intervention lead -in phase  of the study will consist of 4 
days of pretreatment with oral vancomycin (125 mg) or placebo administered 4 times daily 
(QID), starting on Day - 14, followed by a 2 (+1) day  wash out. The washout may be extended by 
the additional day, as indicated,  if neede d to accommodate scheduling. Participants unable to 
tolerate the antibiotic pretreatment will be discontinued from the study and replaced  prior to 
administration of the microbiome/anti- PD-1 combination. 
A 1-week loading regimen of the microbiome study intervention will be performed 2- 3 days 
following antibiotic/placebo administration. Participants  assigned to the FMT  arm will receive 3 
doses of FMT investigational intervention or placebo administered every other day ( QOD) . If 
needed to accommodate scheduling, either  the second or third dose of FMT (but not both), may 
be administered with a window of 1 additional day (ie, dosing interval of up to 3 days instead of 
2 days). All FMT  doses  will be  dispensed for  administration  at the study site.  The participant 
should observe a fast of at least  4 hours (no food or drink except for small amounts of water) 
prior to and 45 minutes after FMT administration. 
Participants  in the SER -401/placebo arm will receive 7 doses of SER -401 investigational 
intervention or placebo administered every day (QD) for one week. The first dose of SER -401 or 
matching placebo will be administered in the clinic and will be followed by a 1 -hour observation 
period after dosing. SER -401 should be taken at approximately the same time on each day  and 
the administration date recorded on the diary card. The participant should observe an overnight 
or at least a 6- hour fast  (no food or drink except for small amounts of water) prior to SER -401 
administration. Subsequent doses of SER -401 or matching placebo will be dispensed to the 
participant for self -administration QD at home.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  41 During the antibiotic/microbiome lead -in phase, participants will use a participant- reported diary 
to track  compliance to the oral antibiotic and SER -401, as well as  to record , on a daily basis  
during administration, the occurrence of solicited symptoms commonly associated with 
microbiome study intervention (see Section  8.2.5) . 
Nivolumab therapy will begin on Cycle 1 Day 1, which is  approximately one day following the 
7-days of lead -in with the microbiome intervention. A n anti -PD-1 study intervention cycle will 
be defined as 4  calendar  weeks, starting on the day of each anti -PD-1 infusion. The protocol 
active treatment phase with anti -PD-1 therapy (nivolumab) will continue for up to 12 cycles, 
unless the participant experiences confirmed disease progression or unac ceptable toxicity in the 
judgment of the treating physician. Participants will be followed for appro ximately  2 years  from 
the time of the initiation of study intervention.  
Participants assigned  to blinded FMT (Group 1) or matching placebo (Group 2)  will have 3 
clinic visits (QOD) during the antibiotic/microbiome lead -in phase and weekly clinic visits 
during the microbiome/anti -PD-1 treatment phase for administration of the blinded microbiome 
study intervention. 
Participants assigned  to blinded SER -401 (Group 4) or matching placebo (Group 3)  will receive 
enough capsules of the blinded microbiome study intervention to cover administration until the 
next clinic visit.  
Participants will be monitored for safety  and will report solicited symptoms using a diary card 
during the antibiotic and microbiome dosing portions of the trial. Adverse events, including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) , will be collected from the start of study intervention  
until at least 100 days after the last dose of study intervention. 
In addition, the first 5 participants enrolled in each microbiome study intervention group (ie, 
FMT/matching placebo or SER -401/matching placebo)  will be contacted  twice  following the 
first dose of nivolumab, as follows : once between Days 2 – 4 and once on Day 7 [ ± 1 day to 
accommodate weekends or holidays] ). The intent of these phone calls is to assess for emerging 
AEs that may require early intervention. Blood and stool  biomarker s will be collected  throughout the study. Participants will be supplied 
with home fecal collection kits to obtain stool samples for metagenomic and metabolomic 
analyses . Following randomization, stool will be collected with a window of up to 2 da ys prior to 
the following timepoints, when feasible: start of microbiome study intervention ( ie, collected 
after completion of  antibio tic/placebo  and prior to the start microbiome study intervention)  and 
Cycle 1 Day 1 (ie, 7 days after start of microbiome study intervention). Thereafter, stool will be collected with a window of ± 3 days of the following timepoints, when feasible: Cycle 1 Day 8 
(ie, 7 days after first dose of nivolumab); Cycle 2 Day 1; Cycle 3 Day 1; Cycle 4 Day 1 (ie, 4 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  42 weeks aft er last dose of microbiome study intervention); Cycle 7 Day 1; and at the End of 
Treatment  visit.  
A screening biopsy is required. An on- treatment tumor biopsy is required when medically 
feasible. The on -treatment biopsy should occur  ideally  from the same t umor lesion and after the 
second dose of anti -PD-1 therapy  (ie, Cycle 2, Days 2 – 12) ; however , any on treatment biopsy 
will be accepted.  
An optional biopsy may be obtained during the course of the study or at the time of disease 
progression, including from participants who respond and subsequently progress. Participants 
must provide additional consent for this procedure.  
4.1.1 Cross- over for Participants on Placebo  in Groups 2 or 3 
Participants  who were  randomly allocated  to receive placebo in Groups 2 or  3 and who have 
radiographic evidence of progression of disease while on study (as described in Section 4.4) will 
be offered the option to re ceive active SER -401 and nivolumab treatment as part of a cross -over 
to Group 5. Participants who agree to this option will provide informed consent and will enter 
Group 5 following unblinding in the I nteractive Web Response System (IWRS) . The procedures 
in Group 5 will be identical to those in Group 4 and need to be repeated according to the Schedule of Activities  beginning with the antibiotic administration 14 days prior to Cycle 1. 
To be eligible for treatment in Group 5, participants must be unblinded and found to have been assigned to the placebo microbiome intervention arm. Participants must continue to meet all 
safety -related eligibility criteria described in Section 5.1 and Section 5.2. Additionally, 
participants must have tolerated nivolumab therapy without unresolved toxicity or toxicity 
requiring permanent treatment discontinuation as defined in Table 4 . A new baseline biopsy is 
optional and not required for entry into Group 5.  
4.2 SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
This study is designed to assess the safety  and tolerability of treatment with  oral microbiome 
study interventions or matching placebo in  enhanc ing the response to anti -PD-1 therapy in 
participants  with advanced melanoma. The study uses 2 complex, donor -derived products to be 
tested in combination with anti- PD-1 treatment in adult p atients with advanced metastatic 
melanoma: FMT formulated for oral delivery ( Youngster  et al.,  2016) derived from healthy 
donors and SER -401, a healthy donor -derived spore composition formulated in capsules for oral 
administration . The justification for evaluating FMT and SER -401 in separate groups of the same 
clinical study is that this approach enhances the opportunity to define how the participant  
microbiome influences CPI therapy by including a wide range of bacterial species from two diverse products . Based on the mechanism of action of improving immune responsiveness to 
immunotherapy and the lack of antitumor activity of single agent FMT in preclinical tumor 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  43 models ( Matson  et al., 2018), this first in man study is evaluating FMT or SER -401 
administration in combination with anti- PD-1 therapy. Donors for each of these products have 
been selected to have a “ favorable ” microbiome profile ( see Section 2.2.2 and Section 2.2.3) 
based on the findings of Gopalakrishnan et al. ( Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018) . In addition to 
evaluating  the safety of these compositions in combination with anti -PD-1 treatment , this study 
will evaluate the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences  immune response and clinical 
outcomes to CPI treatment.  
The study population rationale is provided in Section 2. 
4.3 JUSTIFICATION FOR DOSE  
Nivolumab w ill be administered using the established dosing regimen for metastatic melanoma  
(Section  4.3.1).  The dose and schedule proposed for oral FMT ( Section 4.3.2) and SER -401 
(Section  4.3.3) are based on precedent s in other indications and experience s with other bacterial 
spore product s in other clinical trials , respectively. 
4.3.1 Rationale for Nivolumab  Dose and Schedule  
Nivolumab will be administered at a dose of 480 mg Q4W, as approved by the FDA in March 
2018 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma  (Opdivo USPI, 2019) .  
4.3.2 Rationale for Oral FMT Dose and Schedule  
Oral FMT dose and schedule is guided by historical precedent in other indications; a dose of 10 – 15 capsules is typical  in CDI, delivered over 2 consecutive days. As the capsules are large 
(Size 00, about the size of a multi -vitamin), la rger numbers are not considered generally 
tolerable , and thus, a dose of 10 capsules was selected. Additionally, this dose level (ie, capsule 
number)  and frequency has precedent for chronic oral FMT administration in a clinical trial at 
Massachusetts Gener al Hospital studying patients with metabolic syndrome  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  
4.3.3 Rationale for SER- 401 Dose and Schedule  
SER-401 dose and schedule are guided by recent experience with another bacterial spore 
product, SER -287, in a setting of mild -to-moderate ulcerative colitis. In the SERES -101 trial, a 
6-day pretreatment antibiotic lead -in with vancomycin 125 mg  QID followed by a daily dose of 
1 x 108 SporQs (equivalent to approximately 1 x 107SCFU s) for 8 weeks  resulted in significant 
engraftment of spore species  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . Clinical remission, endoscopic improvement, and 
engraftment was improved with daily dosing compared with weekly dosing. There were no treatment -related drug  discontinuations in the SER -287 daily study intervention group, and all 
treatment -emergent AEs were mild or moderate with no drug- related SAEs. Thus, a similar 
regimen , 4-day vancomycin 125 mg QID pretreatment antibiotic lead- in followed by daily 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  44 SER-401 5× 106 SCFU for 9  weeks , is proposed for participants with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma in the current study. 
4.4 TREATMENT BEYOND DISEASE PROGRESSION  
Accumulating evidence indicates that a minority of patients treated with immunotherapy may 
derive clini cal benefit from continued treatment despite initial evidence of disease progression 
(Wolchok et al ., 2009 ). Therefore, p articipants will be permitted to continue study intervention 
beyond initial RECIST v1.1- defined disease  progression (PD) assessed by the Investigator , 
provided they meet the following criteria:  
• Investigator -assessed clinical benefit  
• Participant is tolerating study intervention and has no unresolved toxicity (ie, has returned to baseline grade/severity)  
• Participant has a stable performance status  
• Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious complications of disease progression (eg, central nervous system metastases)  
• Participant agrees to continue treatment beyond progression and has been informed of alternate treatment options as part of the documented informed consent process  
 
All decisions to continue treatment bey ond initial progression must be discussed with and agreed 
upon by the Sponsor and documented in the study records.  
A follow -up scan should be performed at the next scheduled imaging evaluation (no sooner than 
4 weeks) following initial investigator -assesse d progression to determine whether there is 
evidence of further progressive disease.  
If the investigator feels that the participant continues to achieve clinical benefit by continuing 
treatment, the participant may  remain on the trial and continue to receive  study intervention( s) 
and undergo monitoring according  to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.3) . Participants 
should discontinue study intervention upon evidence of further progression, defined as an additional ≥ 10% increase in tumor burden from the time of initial progression (including all 
target lesions and new measurable lesions).  
4.5 END OF STUDY AND END OF TREATMENT DEFINITION S 
Each participant will have an End of Treatment date and an End of Treatment visit. The End of 
Treatment date is the calendar date when all study interventions are discontinued. The End of Treatment visit is the date that a clinic visit was completed following the last dose of study intervention (ie, after 12 cycles of study intervention or at early discontinuation). All 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  45 participants, including thos e who discontinue early after receiving any study intervention, should 
have the End of Treatment visit and date to complete the visit procedures. The clinic visit at 
which disease assessment shows progressive disease may be used as the End of Treatment vis it if 
it occurs 30 (+5) days after the last dose of nivolumab. Every effort should be made to complete 
the End of Treatment visit within the window; however, the visit should be conducted even if 
outside the window. 
For each participant, the End of Study t ime point is defined as the date when the  last study visit 
or procedure for that participant occurs.  
The End of Study for the study is the date at which the last data point required for statistical 
analysis or safety follow -up is received from the last participant , whichever occurs later .

MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  50 Participants will be assigned  to receive 1 of the  following oral microbiome study interventions 
(FMT or SER -401) in combination with anti- PD-1 therapy . Within each study intervention, 
participants  will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to the oral microbiome study intervention or 
matching placebo :  
• FMT or matching placebo wi ll be administered QOD x  3 days during the lead- in phase, 
followed by QW x 8 weeks during the microbiome/anti -PD-1 treatment phase. The dose 
of FMT product  will be  10 capsules given 3 times for the first week (3  doses), followed 1 
time per week for the next 8 weeks (1 dose). This roughly corresponds to 109 or more 
colony forming units (CFU) per 10 capsule dose.  
• SER-401 or matching placebo will be administered QD x 7 days during the lead- in phase, 
followed by QD x 8 weeks during the microbiome/anti -PD-1 treatment phase. The dose 
per day of SER -401 will be 5 x 106 SCFU  or 2 capsules .  
 
Prior to initiating the micro biome study intervention, participants will undergo a 4- day lead -in 
pretreatment with either antibiotic (vancomycin) or antibiotic placebo, depending on group 
randomization assignment, to prime the gut microbiome for engraftment of the oral microbiome 
study intervention, which will be administered following a 2- 3 day washout. Participants unable 
to tolerate the antibiotic pretreatment will be discontinued from the study and replaced.  
Administration of study intervention will be staggered by at least 1 day f or the first 5 participants 
enrolled in each microbiome study intervention group (ie, FMT/matching placebo or SER -
401/matching placebo) to monitor for safety.  
The protocol active treatment with a nti-PD-1 therapy (nivolumab, 480 mg) will be administered 
intravenously (IV) according to institutional guidelines Q4W for up to 12 cycles , unless the 
participant experiences confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity in the judgment of the treating physician. A cycle is defined as 4 calendar weeks.  
Study intervention administered by site personnel  will be performed in a monitored setting in 
which there is immediate access to trained personnel and adequate equipment and medicine to 
manage potentially serious re actions.  
6.2 PREPARATION/HANDLING/STORAGE/ACCOUNTABILITY 
The study intervention administered in this protocol is for investigational use only. 
All study intervention must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored 
(manual or automated) ar ea in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited 
to the Investigator and authorized site staff. Storage requirements for the study intervention are 
as follows:  
• Vancomycin study intervention and matching placebo should be stored at r oom 
temperature for both clinical site storage, as well as at -home use.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  51 • FMT study intervention and matching placebo must be stored at ≤  -65°C at the clinical 
site. 
• SER-401 study intervention and matching placebo must be stored at  ≤ -15 °C at the 
clinical s ite and refrigerated at 2 °C to 8 °C during at -home use.  
• Nivolumab must be stored at 2° C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46°F) and protected from light and 
freezing.  
 
The Investigator  or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study intervention  received and any discrepancies are reported 
and resolved before use of the study intervention. 
Only participant s enrolled in the study may receive study inter vention and only authorized site 
staff may dispense and/or administer study intervention. In this study, oral study intervention, 
including vancomycin and oral microbiome study intervention, will be dispensed to the 
participant for self -administration.  
Participants should return any unused study drug to the site at their next study visit. Returned 
study intervention should not  be re-dispensed to other participants. The Investigator , institution, 
or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final 
disposition records).  
Further guidance and informa tion for the final disposition of unused or returned study 
interventions  are provided in the Pharmacy  Manual.  
6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION AND 
BLINDING  
6.3.1 Intervention  Assignment  
Assignment to 1 of the 2 microbiome study interventions will be made by the Investigator based 
on clinical judgment and availability or feasibility of the interventions. All participants will be 
randomly allocated (in a 2:1 ratio ) to the oral microbiome study intervention or place bo within 
the 2  microbiome study interventions  using an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 
Before the study is initiated, log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to 
each site.  
Randomization will be stratified by fecal microbiome composition of Ruminococcaceae at 
screening  (see Section 2.2.2) : high (ie, “favorable”) vs low  (ie, “unfavor able”).  Each study 
intervention (FMT or SER -401) will enroll a minimum of 18 participants (60%) with low 
Ruminococcaceae.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  52 6.3.2 Blinding  
Within the 2 microbiome study interventions, participants will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 
ratio to the oral microbiome  study intervention or m atching placebo . Nivolumab will be 
administered open- label as standard of care to  all groups. Investigators , site personnel, and 
participants  will remain blinded to the assignment of microbiome study intervention throughout 
the course of the study. Select Sponsor personnel, including but not limited to the Medical Monitor, Clinical Scientists, Biostatistician, and Patient Safety, will be unblinded to treatment assignment for ongoing safety monitoring. 
6.3.3 Unblinding  
The IWRS wi ll be programmed to accommodate unblinding and cross -over cases . In case of an 
emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a 
participant’s intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor  prior to 
unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignme nt is unblinded, the S ponsor must be 
notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken 
must be recorded in the source documentation and case report form, as applicable.  
If a participant has radiographic eviden ce of progression of disease while on study (see 
Section  4.4), the Investigator will be able to unblind the participant’s intervention assignment. I f 
the participant was allocated to one of the placebo groups (Group 2 or Group 3), the participant 
will be offered the option to receive active SER -401 and nivolumab treatment  (Group 5) . The 
study intervention ( active SER -401 and nivolumab) will be offered open label ; Investigators, site 
personnel, and participants will be unblinded to study intervention administered  in Group 5.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION  COMPLIANCE  
Participant compliance with study intervention will be assessed at each visit. Compliance for study intervention administered by site personnel will be assessed u sing site drug accountability 
records . Study intervention that is self -administered by the participant will be  tracked by the 
participant using a participant -reported diary and reconciled with any returned study 
intervention. 
For study medication self -administered by the participant at home , missed doses should be taken 
as soon as the participant remember s the missed dose . However, if it is almost time for the next 
dose, the missed dose should be skipped, and the regular dosing schedule should be followed. 
The p articipant should not take a double dose to make up for a missed dose. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  53 Deviation(s) from the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded in the electronic case report 
form  (eCRF ). 
6.5 CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, 
probiotics, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant  is receiving at the time of enrollment 
through at least 100 days post last dose of st udy intervention must be recorded along with:  
• Reason for use  
• Dates of administration including start and end dates  
• Dosage information including dose and frequency  
 
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or 
prior therapy.  
6.5.1 Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant medications or treatments (eg, acetaminophen/paracetamol, diphenhydramine) may 
be prescribed if considered necessary for adequate prophylactic or supportive care except for 
those medications identified as “exclu ded” in Section 5.2. 
6.5.2 Cautionary Therapy  
Participants with planned  or required  antibiotic prophylaxis  for more than 24 consecutive hours 
during the course of the study should not be enrolled. Once enrolled, if the need for antibiotic treatment arises, the decision to continue the participant will be at  the discretion of the 
Investigator, after discussion and agreement with the Medical Monit or. 
6.5.3 Prohibited Therapy  
The medications listed below are prohibited during the study. The Sponsor must be notified if a participant receives any of these during the study.  
• Any concurrent investigational anticancer therapy.  
• Immunosuppressive medications, inc luding chronic systemic steroids at physiologic 
doses (equivalent to a dose >  10 mg oral prednisone) , 14 days prior to  the first dose of 
antibiotic treatment (except for participants who require hormone replacement therapy 
[HRT ] such as hydrocortisone). A temporary course of steroids (ie, contrast allergy, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) may be permitted, depending on the duration and dose, after discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor. 
• Any concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy (except pall iative radiotherapy), 
immunotherapy, biologic, or hormonal treatment.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  54 • Any live attenuated vaccine therapies used for the prevention of infectious diseases (for 
up to 30 days prior to the first dose of antibiotic treatment and 100 days after the last dose of study intervention), including for influenza (eg, FluMist), for up to 30 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab and 100 days after the last dose of study intervention.  
• Herbal and natural remedies , including probiotics, unless discussed and agreed wit h the 
Medical Monitor. 
 
6.6 DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
Immuno- oncology agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severity and duration from 
AEs caused by other therapeutic classes. Early recognition and management of AEs associated 
with immuno -oncology agents may mitigate severe toxicity. Management algorithms ( Opdivo 
Immune -Mediated Adverse Reactions Management Guide, 2019) have been developed to assist 
Investigators in assessing and managing the following groups of drug- related AEs:  
• Immune -mediated colitis  
• Immune -mediated hepatitis  
• Immune -mediated endocrinopathies (hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, Type 1 diabetes mellitus)  
• Immune -mediated skin adverse reactions  
• Immune -mediated encephalitis  
• Immune -mediated pneumonitis  
• Immune -mediated nephritis and renal dysfunction  
• Other i mmune -mediated AEs 
 
Based on the available characterization of the mechanism of action, and preliminary data from 
ongoing studies, nivolumab may cause AEs similar to, but independent of, concurrent therapy, may exacerbate the frequency or severity, or may have non- overlapping toxicities. The 
anticipated important safety risks are outlined below. Refer to the approved prescribing 
information  for nivolumab for  a complete summar y of safety information  (Opdivo USPI, 2019) .  
6.6.1 Dose Reductions of St udy Intervention  
There will be no dose escalation s or dose reductions  to any of the study interventions .  
Dose administration timing may be held or delayed according to Section 6.6.2. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  55 6.6.2 Dose Delays or Discontinuations Due to Toxicity  
Participants who experience an AE described in Table 4  will be discontinued from all study 
interventions  and should continue follow -up assessments as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities.  
Grade 3 and 4 toxicities are observed in all trials of nivolumab in multiple tumor types. As such 
toxicities are anticipated; monitoring for AEs described in Table 4  will continue throughout the 
study. 
The Investigator may attribute each AE to the antibiotic,  combination of nivolumab and oral 
microbiome  study intervention, or to nivolumab or oral microbio me study intervention alone. 
Study participant s may not  have any dose reductions  of vancomycin, nivolumab or oral 
microbiome study intervention in this study. If toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for 
resuming study intervention are not met, the par ticipant must be discontinued from the study 
intervention. 
Holding of 1 study intervention and not the other study intervention(s) is appropriate if, in the 
opinion of the I nvestigator, the toxicity is clearly related to 1 of the study interventions . 
Appropriate documentation is required regarding the drug to which study intervention the  
Investigator is attributing the AE. If, in the opinion of the Investigator, the toxicity is related to a  
combination of 2 study interventions , then all  drugs should be held according to recommended 
dose modifications. 
Specific anticipated or potential toxicities associated with the administration of nivolumab or 
oral microbiome study intervent ion, as well as the measures intended to avoid or minimize such 
toxicity in this trial, are described in the following sections. Guidance with respect to the 
individual study intervention is provided in Section 6.6.3 and Section  6.6.1, respectively.  
Dose delays and interruptions are permitted for toxicity reasons (see Section  6.6.1 an d 
Section  6.6.3). Dose delays and interruptions for reasons other than toxicity, such as surgical 
procedures, may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on agreement between Investigator and Medical Monitor, but in general 
should not exceed 6 weeks. 
Refer to the approved prescribing information nivolumab (Opdivo USPI, 2019) , vancomycin 
(Vancocin  USPI, 2018 ), and the Investigator’s  Brochures for FMT  and SER -401 for complete 
summaries of safety information.

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  56 Table 4:  Toxicity Criteria Requiring Permanent Treatment Discontinuation  From 
Nivolumab or Microbiome Interventions  
Participants should be monitored for the occurrence of any of the following AEs that are considered by the 
Investigator to be related (ie, possibly, probably, or definitely related) to nivolumab, microbiome study 
intervention, or the combination of nivolumab and microbiome study intervention. Treatment with all study 
intervention should be permanently discontinued for the following:  
• Any Grade 2 uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision related to study intervention that does not respond to 
topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re -treatment period OR requires 
systemic treatment  
• Any Grade 3 non- skin AE related to study intervention lasting > 7 days or recurs, with the following 
exceptions for laboratory abnormalities, study intervention- related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, 
neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, and endocrinopathies:  
o Grade 3 study interventi on-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, neurologic toxicity, 
myocarditis, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any duration requires discontinuation  
o Grade 3 study intervention- related endocrinopathies, adequately controlled with only physiologic 
hormone replacement do not require discontinuation. Adrenal insufficiency requires discontinuation regardless of control with hormone replacement.  
o Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities related to study intervention do not require discontinuation, exc ept: 
 Grade 3 thrombocytopenia related to study intervention lasting > 7 days or associated with bleeding requires discontinuation  
 Any liver function test abnormality related to study intervention meeting the following criteria requires discontinuation:  
­ Grade ≥ 3 AST or ALT (> 5 x ULN), unless a possible favorable benefit/risk warrants continuation and a discussion between the Investigator and Medical Monitor occurs  
­ Grade ≥ 3 total bilirubin (> 3 x ULN), unless a possible favorable benefi t/risk warrants 
continuation and a discussion between the Investigator and Medical Monitor occurs  
­ Concurrent AST or ALT > 3 x ULN and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN  
• Any Grade 4 AEs or laboratory abnormalities (including but not limited to creatinine, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin) related to study intervention, except for the following events that do not require discontinuation:  
o Grade 4 neutropenia ≤ 7 days  
o Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia or asymptomatic amylase or lipase  
o Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances /abnormalities that are not associated with clinical sequelae and 
are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management within 72 hours of their onset  
o Grade 4 endocrinopathy AEs related to study intervention, such as, hyper - or hypothyroidism, or 
glucose intolerance, which resolve or are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids, thyroid hormones) or glucose -controlling agents, respectively, may not require 
discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the Medical Monitor.  
• Any AE, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness, which in the judgment of the Investigator presents 
a substantial clinical risk to the participant with continued administration of study intervention  
• Any infection with an organism acquired from FMT or SER -401. 
AE(s) = adverse event(s); ALT = alanine aminotransferase; AST = aspartate aminotransferase; ULN = upper limit of 
normal  
 
6.6.2.1  Potential for Overlapping Toxicities with Nivolumab  and Oral 
Microbiome Study Intervention  
Adverse event s commonly associated with microbiome study intervention include: fever; nausea, 
diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and flatulence . Among these AEs, 
diarrhea and nausea have  been reported in ≥  10% of patients receiving nivolumab monotherapy 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  57 and are most likely to have the potential to overlap when nivolumab and oral microbiome study 
intervention are administered together. The remaining AEs have been reported with nivolumab 
monotherapy, but at a  lower incidence (ie, < 10%) , and thus, are less likely to overlap.  
6.6.3 Dose Modifications for Nivolumab  
Specific anticipated or potential toxicities associated with the administration of nivolumab, as well as the measures taken intended to avoid or minimize such toxicity in this trial, are described in the following table and sections . 
This study will include set dosing for nivolumab (480 mg Q4W). No dose escalation s or 
reductions  of nivolumab are allowed. If toxicity does not resolve or the criteria for resuming 
study intervention are not met within 6 weeks (ie, 42 days ), the participant must discontinue 
nivolumab. 
Specific anticipated or potential toxicities associated with the administration of nivolumab, as 
well as the measures to be taken to avoid or minimize such toxicity in this trial, are described in  
Table 5 . 
AEs associated with nivoluma b exposure may represent an immunologic etiology. These 
immune -related adverse events (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months 
after the last dose of treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously. 
Therefore, earl y recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based 
on existing clinical study data, drug- related AEs have included pulmonary toxicity, renal toxicity 
(including acute renal failure), endocrine abnormalities, GI  toxicity, dermatologic toxicity 
(including rash), and hepatotoxicity. For nivolumab monotherapy, as well as when administered in combination, the majority of these AEs have been managed successfully with supportive care and, in more severe cases, a combination of dos e delay, permanent discontinuation, and/or use of 
corticosteroids or hormone replacement therapy (endocrinopathies). For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, and skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation.  
Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with nivolumab are 
provided in Table 5 .

Potential AESIs  include  invasi ve infections (eg, bacteremia, abscess, meningitis).  Among 286 
subjects  enrolled in completed studies conducted by Seres Therapeutics who have received a 
microbiome investigational drug, a single event of invasive infection ( moderate submental 
abscess unrelated to microbiome investigational drug) has been reported . Notable findings of the 
report include : the subject had a prior history of a dental infection;  and a t the time of the report, 
the subject did not experience fever, swelling, warmth, erythema, or enlarged or tender lymph 
nodes. The submental ab scess, diagnosed by an Ear, Nose, and Throat  examination , resolved 
following treatment  with broad spectrum antibiotics . 
The protocol monit ors such toxicities (see Appendix 5). All SAEs and AESIs  will be collected 
and reported as described in Section 8.3.1. 
Participants who develop an invasive infection should be managed  according to institutional 
guidelines. A study- wide hold and evaluation by the DMC will be initiated if, 1) any SAE or AESI 
considered by the Investigator to be related to FMT or SER -401 occurs, or 2) any infection with 
an organism acquired from FMT or SER -401 occurs in any participant  during the study. 
Microbiologic testing for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms will be requested  to assess 
whether the infection is likely  related  due to an organism acquired from FMT or SER -401. Any 
isolates obtained should be retained for genomic sequencing.  
6.7 INTERVENTION AFTER THE END OF THE STUDY  
There will be no study intervention  provided following the end of the study. 
7 DISCONTINUATIONS OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND 
PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
7.1 DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION  
Participant s must discontinue study intervention if they experience any of the following:  
• Any toxicity described in Table 4  
• Intolerable toxicity related to study intervention, including the development of an AE  
determined by the Investigator  to be unacceptable even with the participant ’s potential 
response to intervention due to the severity of the event  
• Any dosing interruption lasting > 6 weeks with the following exceptions:  
o Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage AE s related to 
study intervention 
o Dosing interruptions > 6 weeks for  AEs unrelated to study intervention may be 
allowed if approved by the Medical Monitor  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  63 • Any medical condition that may jeopardize participant  safety if he or she continues to 
receive study intervention 
• Use of another anticancer therapy  
• Pregnancy (see Appendix 6)  
• Symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression 
• Progression of disease: Either unequivocal symptomatic progression necessitating a 
change in therapy in the opinion of the treating physician or confirmed radiographic  
progression as defined by cross -sectional imaging utiliz ing RECIST v1.1 criteria  (see 
Appendix 3)  
 
Participant s have the right to voluntarily withdraw from study intervention at any time for any 
reason. In addition, the Investigator  has the right to withdraw a participant  from study 
intervention at any time. Reasons for withdrawal from the study may include, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
• Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the participant  
• Participant  noncompliance  
 
The primary reason for study intervention discontinuation should be documented on the 
appropriate eCRF  page.  
The visit at which disease assessment shows progressive disease  may be used as the treatment 
discontinuation visit  if it occurs 30 (+5)  days after the last dose of nivolumab; p articipants who 
discontinue study intervention for any reason other than PD or loss of clinical benefit should have an end of treatment  discontinuation assessment  as outline d in the Schedule of Activities  
(SOA; see Section 1.3) . All partic ipants should to continue follow -up assessments as outlined in 
the SOA ( Section  1.3). Additionally, participants who have received any microbiome study 
intervention should continue to be followed for SAEs and AESIs  up to 26 weeks  after the last 
dose of microbiome study intervention (see Section 8.3.1).  
7.1.1 Study -wide  Hold  for Spe cified Safety Events  
A study- wide hold and evaluat ion by the study DMC will be initiated if, 1) any SAE or AESI 
considered by the Investigator to be related to FMT or SER -401 occurs, or 2) any infection with 
an organism acquired from FMT or SER -401 occurs in a ny participant  during the  study. All 
study par ticipants will immediately discontinue administration of the oral microbiome study 
intervention but may continue to receive nivolumab should one of these events occur . In 
addition, further enrollment of new participants into the study will be suspended until the event is 
adjudicated by the Data Monitoring Committee (see Section 9.5.1).  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  64 7.2 PARTICIPANT  DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM 
STUDY 
When study intervention is discontinued, participants should have an end of treatment  
discontinuation assessment follow ed up by assessment 100 days post last dose as outlined in the 
SOA (see Section 1.3). Information on survival follow -up will be collected for every 3 months 
for approximately 2 years  from the initiation of study intervention until any of the following 
occurs:  
• Death  
• Lost to f ollow -up 
• Study termination by the Sponsor  
• Participant requests to be withdrawn from follow -up 
• Investigator requests that the participant is withdrawn from follow -up 
 
A participant may withdraw a consent at any time and discontinue study intervention and fu rther 
participation on the study. This  request must be documented in the source documents and signed 
by the I nvestigator. T he Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such 
withdrawal of consent. Participants who withdraw consent wil l not be followed for any reason 
after consent has been withdrawn. However , the study staff may use a public information source 
(eg, county records) to obtain information about survival status only. Other reasons for discontinuation of study intervention a nd/or participation in a follow -up phase 
of the study may include death, adverse events, physician decision, protocol deviation, eligibility 
not met, progressive disease. A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she 
has completed all p hases of the study, including the antibiotic/microbiome lead- in phase, the 
microbiome/anti- PD-1 phase, the anti -PD-1 phase, and the safety and survival follow -up. 
The primary reason for treatment and study discontinuation are documented on the appropriate 
eCRF page.  
7.3 LOST TO FOLLOW-UP 
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact the participant  and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant  on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  65 schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant  wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study. 
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record or study file. 
• Should the participant  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study. 
 
8 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
Please see Section 1.3 for the schedule of activities to be performed during the study. All 
activities must be performed and documented for each participant  in the order of schedule of 
activities . Participant s will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. 
Participant s should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the 
clinical assessment and local l aboratory test values are acceptable as deemed by the P rincipal 
Investigator  (PI). 
If the timing of a protocol -mandated s tudy visit coincides with the holiday, weekend, or other 
administrative disruption that precludes the visit, the visit should be scheduled on the nearest 
following feasible date. The time between  nivolumab doses must not be less than 25 days . Refer 
to the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.3) for visit windows. 
Collection of any non- safety -related data or participant  samples may  be terminated by the 
Sponsor at any time if further collection of such data or samples is also not related to the study’s primary or secondary objective s. The decision to discontinue any data collection w ill be  
communicated to the si tes and Institutional Review Board /Independent Ethics Committee 
(IRB/IEC ) by means of a memorandum and will not require a protocol amendment. 
8.1 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
Participant s will undergo tumor assessments as designated in the schedule of activities  (see 
Section  1.3) regardless of dose delays, until loss of clinical benefit as determined by the 
Investigator  (unless the pa rticipant withdraws consent or the Sponsor terminates the study). All 
participant s who discontinue study intervention for reasons other than disease progression (eg, 
AEs) will continue tumor assessments for up to 1 year from initiation of nivolumab treatment or 
until study completion, death, disease progression, initiation of another systemic anticancer 
therapy, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination, whichever occurs first. 
At the  Investigator’s discretion, tumor assessments may be repeated at any time if progressive 
disease is suspected.   
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  66 Measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at screening. Tumor 
assessments performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 
28 days prior to randomization do not have to be repeated at screening  
Screening assessments must include CT  scans (with IV contrast unless contraindicated and oral 
contrast as appropriate per institutional standards)  of the  chest, abdomen, and pelvis . A spiral CT 
scan of the chest may be obtained but is not a requirement. If a CT scan with contrast is contraindicated (ie, in participant s with contrast allergy or impaired renal clearance), a non -
contrast CT scan of the chest may  be performed , and MRI scans may  be performed. If the 
participant has a known history of brain metastases or is symptomatic  in the opinion of the 
Investigator , scans of the  head should be obtained.  
If a CT scan for a tumor assessment is performed in a p ositron emission tomography (PET)/CT 
scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with the standards for a full contrast diagnostic 
CT scans.  
Bone scans (technetium -99m [TC -99m]) should be performed at screening if clinically indicated. 
If bone metastases are present at screen and cannot be seen on CT or MRI scans, or if clinically indicated, TC -99m bone scan should be repeated when complete response (CR) is identified in 
target disease or when progression in bone is suspected.  
CT scans of the neck or ext remities should also be performed if clinically indicated and repeated 
throughout the study if there is evidence of disease at screening.  
All measurable and evaluable lesions should be reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. The same radiographic procedures used to assess disease sites at s creening should be used for 
subsequent tumor assessments (eg, same contrast protocol for CT scans).  
Response will be assessed by the I nvestigator  using RECIST v1.1 (see Appendix 3). 
Assessments should be performed by the same evaluator, if possible, to ensure internal consistency across visits. Results must be reviewe d by the I nvestigator  before dosing at the next 
cycle.  
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs , including serious adverse 
events (SAEs) and adverse events of special interest  (AESIs) , performing protocol -specified  
safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specif ied vital signs, and conducting other 
protocol -specified test s that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Planned 
timing for all safety assessments is  provided in the schedule of  activities  (Section  1.3).  
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as described in Section  8.3.1.1. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  67 8.2.1 Medical History and Demographic Data  
Medical h istory , including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including, 
stage, date of diagnoses, and prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, 
smoking history, use of alcohol, and drugs of abuse , will be recorded at bas eline. In addition, all 
medications ( eg, prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic 
remedies, probiotics, nutritional supplements , FMT)  used by the participant within 28 days  prior 
to initiation of study intervention will b e recorded . Demographic data may  include age, sex, and 
race/ethnicity.  
8.2.2 Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination should be performed at screening and should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems . Any 
abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF  page.  
ECOG Performance Status (see Appendix 2
) should be assessed per the s chedule of a ctivities  in 
Section  1.3. 
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom- directed physical 
examinations should be performed. Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in 
participant  notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as 
AEs on  the Adverse Event eCRF  page . 
8.2.3 Vital Signs  
Vital signs should include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure, pulse oximetry ( required only at  screening), and temperature and should be 
collected as outlined in the Schedule of Activities  (Section 1.3). Vital signs collected at the 
screening visit should be recorded on the  appropriate  eCRF. For each visit thereafter, only vital 
signs obtained prior t o the study intervention a dministration  as outlined in the Schedule of 
Activities  or during an AE (eg, temperature or event of fever) should be recorded on the eCRF. 
All vital signs collected per protocol should be documented in the participant’s medical r ecord.  
Vital signs should be measured within 15 minutes prior to and after the administration of nivolumab (see Section 6 ). Vital signs may be measured, if medically indicated, at other time 
points . 
8.2.4 Electrocardiograms  
Single electrocardiogram ( ECG ) recordings will be obtained at specified time points, as outline d 
in the Schedule of Activities ( Section  1.3), and may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints as 
indicated.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  68 All ECG recordings must be performed usi ng an institutionally- approved ECG. Lead placement 
should be as consistent as possible. ECG recordings should be performed after the participant  has 
been resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. 
For safety monitoring purposes, the Investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. 
Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the participant 's permanent study file at the 
site. The investigator’s assessment  (ie, normal, abnormal [not clinically significant], or abnormal 
[clinically significant])  should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF . 
8.2.5 Participant Diary  
Participants will complete a paper diary to track compliance to t he self -administered oral 
antibiotic and microbiome interventions  throughout the  study and to  record  the occurrence of 
solicited symptoms commonly associated with microbiome study intervention. Symptoms 
collected include: gas or flatulence; abdominal disco mfort (distention, bloating, pain or 
cramping); diarrhea; vomiting; constipation, and oral temperature. Symptoms will be tracked on a daily basis from the start of the study intervention administration through the end of Cycle 2 using a paper diary card  (Appendix 8) . Participants will be asked to bring this diary  to each 
clinical visit so that the staff can discuss  the compliance and safety informat ion with the 
participant . After discussion with the participant , should the Investigator determine a symptom is 
on an AE, the event should be documented in the medical record s and on his/he r eCRF , as 
appropriate . 
8.2.6 Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments 
Clinical laboratory tests will be performed as described in the Schedule of Activities 
(Section  1.3). 
The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and designate results 
as being not clinically significant or clinically  sign ificant.  Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings include those are those for which an action was taken (ie, providing fluid, transfusion, medication, and/or holding, delaying, or discontinuing study intervention) or those 
that are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more 
severe than expected for the participant's condition. Clinically significant changes occurring 
during the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. The laboratory reports must be 
filed with the source documents. 
In the event of a Grade 3 or Grade 4 laboratory toxicity, the test for the abnormal laboratory 
value should be repeated until the event is resolved to ≥  Grade 1 or baseline.

8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS  AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 5. 
Investigators will seek information on AE s at each participant  contact. Symptoms  reported by the 
participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized 
representative), including those captured on the participant diary, or those noted by study personnel should be assessed by the Investigator according to Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v ersion 5.0, which can be found at: 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm . If the event meets 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  70 the definition of an AE, it should be recorded in the participant’s medical record and on the 
Adverse Event eCRF page, as appropriate . 
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE , AESI , or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study 
procedures, or that caused the participant  to discontinue the study intervention (see Appendix 5 ). 
8.3.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE , AESI, SAE , and 
Other Reportable Safety Event  Information  
All SAEs  will be collected from the  time the participant  signs informed consent until at least 100 
days after the last dose of nivolumab. However, in the case of early discontinuation, participants 
should be followed for SAEs for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of microbiome study intervention.  
All AE s, including AESIs , will be collected from the start of study intervention until  at least 100 
days after the last dose of study intervention. However, in the case of early discontinuation, 
participants should be followed for AESIs for up to 26 weeks after the last dose of microbiome study intervention. 
Prior to initiation of study intervention, only SAEs that are related to a protocol -mandated 
intervention, including those that occur prior to the assignment of study procedures (eg, 
screening invasive procedures, such as biopsies)  should be reported. After  obtaining informed 
consent , but prior to initiation of study intervention, other medical occurrences  will be recorded 
as medical history . 
If the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after the end of the AE reporting period, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor or its designee. The Investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or 
emailing the SAE r eport form. 
The method of recording and reporting AE , AESI,  and SAE are provided in Appendix 5. The 
procedure for submitting  SAE reports is provided in Section 8.3.8.2. 
During the 9- week microbiome study intervention administration, participants will use a 
participant -reported diary to record, on a daily basis  during administration, the occurrence of 
solicited symptoms  commonly associated with microbiome study intervention. For this study, 
solicited symptoms  include : gas or  flatulence;  abdominal discomfort (distention, bloating, pain 
or cramping) ; diarrhea ; vomiting ; and c onstipation. 
The method of  reporting all deaths are provided in Appendix 5. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  71 8.3.1.1  Events Requiring Expedi ted Reporting to the Sponsor  
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to 
address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The Investigator  must report such events to the 
Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours 
after the Investigator  becomes aware of the event. The following is a list of events that the 
Investigator mus t report to the Sponsor within 24 hours of  becoming aware  of the event, 
regardless of relationship to study intervention:  
• All SAE s (defined in Appendix 5)  
• Protocol -specified AEs  of special interest  (defined  in Section  8.3.7)  
• Pregnanc y (see Section 8.3.5 for details on reporting requirements)  
• Occur rence of overdose (see Section 8.4 for details on reporting requirements)  
 
8.3.2 Follow-up Event Reporting  
The Investigator  must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (ie, no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New 
significant information includes the following:  
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
• Significant new diagnostic test results  
• Change in causality based on new information  
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
 
After the initial AE/AESI /SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant  at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs, SAEs, and AEs  of special interest (as d efined 
in Section  8.3.7)  will be followed  through at least 100 days post -last dose of study intervention, 
until event resolution or death , the participant  is lost to follow -up (as defi ned in Section  7.3), or 
the participant  withdraws consent. Further information on follow -up procedures is provided in 
Appendix 5. 
For SAEs  and AEs of special interest, the  Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by telephone, 
fax, electronic mail, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome 
information (eg, from hospital discharge sum maries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order 
to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  72 8.3.3 Method of Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
A consistent methodology of non- directive questioning should be adopted for discussion of 
symptoms and eliciting AE information at all participant  evaluation time points. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant  is the preferred method to inquire about AE 
occurrences  including symptoms reported on the diary cards . Examples of non- directive 
questions include: “How have you felt since your last clinic visit?”, “Have you had any new or 
changed health problems since you were last here?”  
8.3.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
Prompt notification by the Investigator  to the S ponsor of an  SAE is essential so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participant s and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met (see Section 8.3.1.1) . Investigators must also 
comply with local requirements for reporting SAEs  to the IRB /IEC  or other local health 
authorities.  
The S ponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relat ing to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC, Investigators , and drug manufacturer (s). 
Expectedness will be assessed using the Investigator Brochure(s) as reference documents. Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator's assessment of causality and 
seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and S ponsor policy and forwarded to 
Investigators  as necessary.   
An Investigator  who receives specific safety -related  information ( eg, SUSAR notification; 
summary or listing of SAEs ) from the S ponsor will review and then file it along with the 
Investigator ’s Brochure a nd will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local 
requirements.  
8.3.5 Pregnancy  
Details of all pregnancies in female participant s and  female partners of male participant s will be 
collected after the start of study intervention and until at le ast 7 (female partners of male 
participants) and 5 (female participants) months after the last dose of nivolumab. Female 
participant s, as well as female partners of male participant s, of childbearing potential will be 
instructed to immediately inform the Investigator  if they become pregnant during the study or 
within 5 or 7 months, respectively, after the last dose of nivolumab. If a pregnancy is reported, 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  73 the Investigator  should inform the S ponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the pregnancy 
and should f ollow the procedures outlined in Appendix 6. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes that 
meet serious criteria (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, 
ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs.  
A clinical trial specific  Pregnancy Reporting form should be completed and submitted 
immediately to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the 
form using the fax number or email address provided to I nvestigators (see Section  8.3.8.2). 
Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page . The I nvestigator should 
discontinue study intervention and counsel the participant , discussing the risks of the pregnancy 
and the possible effects on the fetus. Monit oring of the participant  should continue until 
conclusion of the pregnancy. Any SAEs associated with the pregnancy (eg, an event in the fetus, 
an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the  SAE  report f orm. In addition, the Investigator  will submit a n 
updated c linical t rial s pecific Pregnancy Reporting form when updated information on the course 
and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available.  
8.3.6 Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not 
Qualifying as AEs or SAEs  
Progression of the cancer under study, as judged by the Investigator, is not c onsidered a 
reportable event.  If upon further review by the Investigator , the event  is determined as not being 
associated  with underlying progression of disease, it must be reported as an SAE  within  24 hours 
to the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Pharmacovigilance Group as described in 
Section  8.3.8.2. 
8.3.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Selected non -serious and serious AE s, known as adverse events of special interest ( AESIs ), are 
those of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or program for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the I nvestigator to the S ponsor is appropriate.  
Adverse  events of special interest fo r this trial include: 
• An invasive infection (eg, bacteremia, abscess, meningitis)  at least possibly related to 
FMT or SER -401 interventions . Microbiologic testing should be performed, if possible, 
to assess whether the infection is due to an organism acquired from FMT or SER -401. 
 
All AEs and AEs of special interest will be collected and reported according to Section 8.3.1. 
Serious AESIs will be adjudicated by the DMC.

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  75 8.5 PHARMACOKINETICS  
Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study.  
8.6 ANTI -DRUG ANTIBODIES  
Antibodies to nivolumab are not evaluated in this study. 
8.7 BIOMARKERS  
The secondary biomarker objective of this study is to determine the engraftment of FMT and 
SER-401 bacteria into the intestinal microbiome community in stool samples and if the 
percentage of tumoral CD8 cells changes from baseline (prior to antibiotic treatment) in response 
to microbiome administration and nivolumab treatment.  Engraftment will be determined by 
evaluation of baseline and on treatment stool samples using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  
sequencing and a comparison to the stool samples from the placebo group. An engrafting species 
is defined as any species which is detectable in the microbiome intervention, absent in the 
participant at baseline, and present in t he participant at any time point after treatment initiation. 
The number of engrafting species will be summarized by participant, study intervention group, and time point .  
The composition of the GI microbiome of participants will be characterized using genomic data sets generated from stool. Genomic data sets will define the bacterial composition of the microbiome of a participant at a given time point and relative to baseline. Genomic sequence read data sets will be analyzed to assign a taxonomic identity at the resolution of an operational 
taxonomic unit (OTU) and, further, to define the relative proportion of each OTU to all other 
OTUs in a given sample. Changes in the composition of the fecal microbiome will be measured in terms of both the total number of unique types of bacteria (ie, α -diversity) and the microbial 
composition (ie, β -diversity). The composition of other constituents of the microbiome such as 
fungi and viruses in the stool may be characterized. 
Non-parametric and machine learning computat ional methods will be applied to the genomic 
datasets to characterize a participant’s GI tract post -treatment compared to baseline.  
Differences between changes in the microbiome across the various study intervention groups will 
be evaluated in terms of ch anges in α -diversity, β -diversity, and the prevalence and relative 
abundance of specific OTUs.  
The percentage of tumoral CD8 cells will be determined from tumor tissue using 
immunohistochemistry (IHC). Tumor biopsies at baseline and on- treatment will be a ssessed for 
the percentage of tumoral CD8 cells and any change in percentage of tumoral CD8 cells in 
response to treatment. Immunohistochemistry will be performed using an anti -CD8 antibody 
with 3,3' diaminobenzidine chromogen, counterstained with hematoxylin .

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  76 The exploratory biomarker objectives of this study are to identify biomarkers associated with 
nivolumab and microbiome  study intervention by assessing tumor tissue and circulating soluble 
factors, including, but not limited to, DNA, ribonucleic acid (RNA), enzymes, growth factors, cytokines, antibodies, and immune cells in tissue  and blood and their association with treatment 
outcome . Additionally, microbiome profile , DNA, and metabolomics, may be evaluated from 
stool samples. Changes from baseline in the functional profile of the GI tract will be delineated 
using metabolomics data sets. Non- parametric and machine learning computational methods will 
be applied to metabolomic datasets to characterize changes in the functional profile of 
participants acr oss different study intervention groups. Evaluation of baseline levels and/or 
changes with study intervention may be performed to determine association with clinical 
outcomes, including clinical response and resistance, as well as study intervention tolera bility.  
• Collection of samples for biomarker research is part of this study. The following samples 
for biomarker research are required and will be collected from all participant s in this 
study as specified in the Schedule of Activities  (Table 1)  and processed in accordance 
with the laboratory manual : 
o Blood 
o Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC s) 
o DNA  
o RNA 
o Tumor tissue biopsy, ideally from the same tumor lesion  (before and while on 
study intervention)  
o Stool  
• Samples may be tested for genetic analysis on tumor and blood samples, including, but not limited to, assays on circulating free DNA, DNA from tumor, blood, and/or immune cells and T cell receptor sequencing may be performed. This  research may evaluate 
whether genetic variations correspond with outcomes of treatment. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in cancer patients. Circulating soluble analytes may be assess ed that may include but are not 
limited to immune cytokines, growth factors, antibodies, and/or markers associated with immune characteristics and activation or cancer. Additionally, tumor and blood samples will be collected before and on study intervention for immune and/or tumor cell profiling, which may include immune cell phenotyping, enumerations, and/or activation state. Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA expression profiling and sequencing in tumor 
and/or blood may be performed to define gene signatures that correlate with treatment outcomes. Epigenetic analyses may also be performed as these are important biomarkers for some cancers. Stool samples at baseline and on treatment will be evaluated for microbiome and/or metabolite profiling and m ay be used  to determine if there is any 
association with treatment outcome.  
• Other samples may be used for research, including future research to develop methods, assays, prognostics, and/or companion diagnostics related to immuno- oncology

8.7.1 Genetics  
Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for planned genetic analysis samples will 
be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Samples should be collected for planned analysis of 
associations between genetic variants in germline/tumor DNA and clinical outcomes to study 
interventions(s). Blood for planned genetic analysis will be collected for DNA  as described in  
the Schedule of Activities in Section 1.3. If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or local IRB/IEC does not approve) sample collection for these purposes, then such samples should not 
be collected at the corresponding sites. Additional DNA extracted from planned genetic analysis 
samples will be stored for future biomedical research only if participant signs the Future Biomedical Research consent.  
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be r equested 
from the participant . Signed informed consent will be required to obtain a replacement sample 
unless it was included in the original consent.  
See Appendix 7 for Information regarding genetic research.  
8.7.2 Enrollment Biomarker  
Stool samples are  required at screening to assess fecal  microbiome composition of the 
Ruminococcaceae abundance -based metric at screening (high, low ) for the randomization. This 
test is required to determine stratification. The test for Ruminococcaeae is a laboratory -
developed test . It is not an FDA -approved device , and its use is investigational. Sample 
collection, storage, and shipment instructions are provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) on DNA extracted from stool will be performed 
and the Ruminococcaeae  abundance -based metric will be reported.  
8.7.3 Exploratory Biomarkers  
A fresh tumor biopsy is required at screening  (prior to antibiotic or antibiotic placebo 
administration) . An additional on- treatment bio psy is required after 2 infusions  with anti -PD-1 
study intervention, when medically feasible. An optional biopsy may be obtained during the 
course of the study or at the time of disease progression, including from participants who respond and subsequently progress . Core needle or incisional tumor biopsy samples are required. 
Further, every attempt should be made for the on- treatment biops y(ies)  to be taken from the sam e 
lesion site. Fine needle aspiration is not allowed.

8.7.4 Sample  Collection  for Long -term Future Biomedical Research  
8.7.4.1  Overview of L ong-term Future Biomedical Research  
Participant s in this clinical trial will be asked to consent to provide biological samples for long-
term future biomedical research. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for future 
biomedical research is to explore and identify biomarkers that inform the scientific understanding of disease and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such 
information to understand disease, safety, and potential treatments for future participant s. Such 
research is for biomarker testing and hypothesis testing to address emergent questions not 
described elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main trial).  
This research may include genetic and genomic analyses (DNA), gene expression profiling (RNA), proteom ics, microbiome, metabolomics (serum, plasma, stool) and/or the measurement 
of other analytes, depending on which specimens are consented for future biomedical research.  
The collection and submission of biological samples to be stored for long- term future biomedical 
research must be detailed in the IRB/IEC -approved ICF.  Participant s who do not wish to 
participate in the future biomedical research may still participate  in the study. 
8.7.4.2  Sample Collection  
The following samples will be collected and stored in accordance with applicable law for long -
term research purposes, including but not limited to, research on biomarkers related to 
immunotherapies, such as ant i-PD-1, and diseases such as cancer or inflamm atory disorders:  
• Blood, including but not limited to PBMCs, plasma, and/or serum  
• DNA  
• RNA 
• Tumor tissue  
• Stool  samples  
 
These samples may be sent to one or more laboratories.

Manual.  
8.7.4.3  Withdrawal from Long -term  Sample Storage  
Participant s have the right to withdraw their consent for the future biomedical research of his/her 
specimens at any  time for any reason and request that their specimens be destroyed. If the 
participant  wishes to withdraw consent for this testing, the I nvestigator  must inform the Sponsor  
in writing.  Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal or alrea dy performed 
prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall 
research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. 
In the event that the medical records for the  main trial are no longer available (eg, if the 
Investigator  is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the 
specimens have been completely anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the 
participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for specimen 
withdrawal cannot be processed.  
8.7.4.4  Protection of Data  Privacy and Data Generation  
Participant  specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique participant  identificatio n 
number. Participant  medical information associated with the long- term storage of specimens is 
confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the ICF signed by the 
participant  or as  permitted or required by law.  
Given the complexi ty and research nature of the exploratory analyses, data derived from long-
term stored specimens will generally not be provided to study I nvestigators or participant s unless 
required by law.  
Data generated from specimen s that are stored long term must be available for inspection upon 
request by representatives of national or local health authorities and S ponsor monitors, 
representatives, and collaborators as appropriate and as described in Section  10.1.11.

There are no primary efficacy objectives or endpoints for this study. 
9.4.1.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
The secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
• ORR: Defined as CR or PR as best response by RECIST v1.1 assessment. Participants 
who do not have RECIST assessment for any reason will be counted as not responding. 
• DCR: Defined as CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for ≥ 24 weeks as best response by RECIST v1.1. Participants who do not have RECIST assessment for any reason will be counted as not responding. 
• PFS: Defined as the time from randomization to date of first documented radiographic progression of disease or date of death due to any cause, whichever o ccurs  first. 
Participants who have not progressed or died will be censored at the last tumor assessment  date.  
• PFS rate at 1 year: Defined as the proportion of participants without documented progression of disease or death due to any cause at 1 year.  
• OS: Defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause. Participants  
who have not died will be censored at the most recent contact date they were known to be alive.

The above exploratory endpoints will be analyzed on the Cross -over Efficacy Population. 
Further analysis details will be described in the SAP.  
9.4.2 Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Population, consisting of all participants who 
receive at least 1 dose of any study intervention ( vancomycin, FMT, SER -401, nivolumab, or 
placebo ). Participants will be analyzed according to the study intervention they actually rece ived. 
A subset of safety analyses will also be conducted on the Anti -PD-1 Safety Population, as 
described in the SAP.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs, laboratory test results (hematology and serum 
chemistry), vital signs, ECGs, and ECOG performance score. Verbatim descriptions of 
treatment -emergent AEs (defined in Section  10.5.1.4) will be coded  using the current version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ), and their incidence will be 
summarized by study intervention group. In addition, separate summaries will be generated for 
AESIs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to study discontinuation, and AEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation. 
Safety analyses will also be performed for events and assessments that occur during the 
antibiotic/microbiome lead -in phase. Events and assessments occurring during the antibiotic or 
antibiotic placebo administration and washout (Day - 14 to Day - 7) will be summarized for the 
Antibiotic Safety Population, defined as all participants who receive at least 1 dose of any 
antibiotic study intervention (vancomycin or placebo). Events and assessments occurring during 
the microbiome lead -in (Day - 7 to Cycle 1 Day 1) will be summarized for the Microbiome

• Determination of the engraftment of FMT or SER -401 bacteria into each of the 
microbiome study intervention groups relative to placebo.  
• Change in the percentage of CD8 cells in tumor tissue from baseline at Cycle 2.  
The exploratory biomarker endpoints include:  
• Changes in the composition of the fecal  microbiome from baseline to on treatment 
following administration of FMT, SER -401, or placebo.  
• Functional changes in transcriptomic, metabolomi c, and/or proteomic profiles from 
baseline to on treatment.  
• Association of T -cell phenotypic characteristics and immune characteristics in the tumor 
with clinical outcomes (eg, ORR, DCR, PFS, OS) and/or AEs.  
• Molecular (genomic, metabolic, and/or proteomic)  or microbial biomarkers that may be 
indicative of clinical response/resistance, safety, pharmacodynamic activity, and/or 
mechanism of action of anti -PD-1 therapy and their relationship to microbiome study 
intervention administration.  
 
Absolute change in percentage of CD8 tumoral cells will be summarized by study intervention 
group using means and 95% CIs. Other biomarker analyses will be performed as described in 
Section  8.7. 
9.5 INTERIM ANALYSES  
No interim analyses are planned for this study. 
9.5.1 Data Monitoring Committee  
Ongoing safety data review will be conducted by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). This is a committee that is formed of select Sponsor personnel, including the Medical Monitor and 
representatives from other functions including, but not limited to, Biost atistics, Clinical Science, 
and Drug Safety. Members of the DMC will be unblinded to participant treatment assignment. 
To ensure participants’ safety during the study, the DMC will review the emerging safety data on a regular basis. Roles and responsibilit ies of the DMC will be detailed in a separate charter.  
Safety monitoring will include unblinded evaluation of all AEs , AESIs, SAEs , relevant protocol 
deviations, and laboratory data. If the DMC deems a benefit -risk assessment necessary, the DMC 
may also review unblinded efficacy data. The DMC may decide to stop the study early or 
suspend enrollment of a study intervention group for safety reasons.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  85 Study- holding criteria as described in Section 7.1.1 will be adjudicated by the DMC per the 
study- specific DMC charter.  
For safety monitoring purposes, a trial -limiting toxicity is defined as: 
1. Any event listed in Table 4. 
2. Any SAE assessed  as at least possibly related to the study intervention. 
3. Any AESI (defined in Section 8.3.7) assessed as at least possibly related to the 
microbiom e study interventions . 
 
A Bayesian rule will be employed to monitor toxicity throughout the study ( Table 10 ). A 
minimally informative beta (0.5, 2.5) prior has been assumed. For each study intervention group, 
if the number of participants  with a trial- limiting toxicity (defined above) is greater th an or equal 
to the number in Table 10 , then enrollment and dosing of that study intervention group will be 
immediately halted, as it is likely that the  toxicity rate is >30%, as noted by the Bayesian 
posterior probabilities. The rule is intentionally conservative early in the enrollment phase. If administration  of a study intervention group is halted, all available safety data will be reviewed 
by an inde pendent medical monitor who will determine, in consultation with the DMC, whether 
to resume administration of study intervention and/or enrollment.

in optional procedures. Participant s who decline to participate will not provide a separate 
signature.  
Participant s must be re- consented to the most current version of the ICF(s) (or to a significant 
new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and IRB/IEC policy) 
during their participation in the study. The medical record should document the re -conse nt 
process and that written informed consent was obtained using the updated/revised ICF for 
continued participation in the study. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  88 A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to the participant  or the participant ’s legally authorized 
representative. All signed and dated ICFs must remain in the participant ’s study file or in the site 
study file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time. 
The final revised IRB/IEC -approved ICFs must be provided to the Sponsor for the purpose of 
health authority submission. 
A participant who is rescreened is not required to sign another ICF if the rescreening occurs 
within 30 days from the previous ICF signature date.  
A participant who receives  placebo in Groups 2 or  3 and has  radiographic evidence of 
progression of disease while on study and  agrees  to receive active SER -401 and nivolumab 
treatment as part of  a cross -over to Group 5 will be requ ired to sign another IC F prior to entering 
Grou p 5. 
The ICF will contain a separate s ection that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples 
for optional exploratory research. The Investigator or authorized designee will explain to each 
participant  the objectives of the exploratory research. Participant s will be told that they are fre e 
to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the 
storage period. A separate signature will be required to document a participant 's agreement to 
allow any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory rese arch. Participants who decline to 
participate in this optional research will not provide this separate signature.  
10.1.5  Data Protection  
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by assigning a unique participant  identification 
number to each participant enrolled in the study. This means that participant  names are not 
included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. 
Participant  medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed to 
third parties only as permitted by the ICF (or  separate authorization for use and disclosure of 
personal health information) signed by the participant  or as  permitted or required by law.  
Medical information may be given to a participant ’s personal physician or other appropriate 
medical personnel responsible for the participant ’s welfare, for treatment purposes.  
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of 
national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives  and collaborators , and  the 
IRB/IEC for each study site, as appropriate.  
10.1.6  Dissemination of Clinical Study Data  
The resu lts of this study may be reported to the public, in the form of a publication or 
presentation at scientific congresses, before completion of the study. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  89 10.1.7  Administrative Structure  
This trial will be sponsored and managed by the Parker Institute for Cancer Imm unotherapy. The 
Sponsor will provide clinical operations management, data management, medical monitoring, 
and safety oversight. 
Central facilities will be used for certain study assessments throughout the study (eg, specified 
laboratory tests and biomarker  analyses), as specified in Section 8.2.5 and Section 8.7, 
respectively. Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges will be collected.  
10.1.8  Data Quality Assurance  
All participant  data relating to the study will be collected via the electronic data collection (EDC) 
system  on an eCRF unless transmitted to the Sponsor or designee electronically (eg, central 
laboratory data, biomarker and other biological sample data). Sites will be r esponsible for data 
entry into the EDC system and will receive training for appropriate eCRF completion. The 
Investigator  is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by 
electronically signing and dating the eCRF.  
The Investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data, see Section  10.1.9) that 
supports the information entered in the eCRF. The I nvestigator must p ermit study -related 
monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access 
to source data documents. 
The Sponsor is responsible for the data management of this study, including quality checking of 
the data. Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data 
entered on the eCRF by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from 
source documents; that the safety and rights of participant s are being protected; and tha t the 
study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and all applicable regulatory requirements. 
At the end of the study, the Investigator will receive participant  data for his/her site in a readable 
format on a compact disc (or other readable digital format) that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.  
10.1.9  Source Documentation  
Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant  and substantiate the 
integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the Investigator’s site. Data entered 
on the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The Investigator may need to request 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  90 previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical 
records must be available.  
Source documents (paper  or electronic) are those in which participant  data are recorded and 
documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and 
office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, clinical outcome assessment (COA)/ patient  reported 
outcomes  (PRO), evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from 
automated instruments, copies  of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being 
accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfi lm or magnetic media, 
X-rays, participant  files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.  
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical record 
system (ie, in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source 
document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data 
collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, 
the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the per son making the change, and date of the change.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered on the 
eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained as described in Section  10.1.12
. 
10.1.10  Study and S ite Closure  
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
• The incidence or severity of AEs  in this or other studies indicate s the potential haz ard to 
participant s 
• Participant  enrollment is unsatisfactory  
 
The Sponsor will notify the Investigator if the S ponsor decides to discontinue the study. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the Sponsor or I nvestigator  may include but are 
not limited to:  
• Poor protocol adherence  
• Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  91 • Failure of the Investigator  to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC 
or local health authorities, the S ponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines  
• No study activity (ie, all participant s have completed the study and all obligations have 
been fulfilled)  
 
10.1.11  Site Inspections  
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or a n authorized representative for inspection of 
study data, participant s' medical records, and eCRFs. The Investigator  will permit national and 
local health authorities; Sponsor monitors, representatives and collaborators; and the IRBs/ IECs  
to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study. 
10.1.12  Retention of Records  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and distribution of the 
investigational medicinal product, including signed eCRFs, electronic or paper COA/PROs  data 
(if applicable), signed i nformed c onsent f orms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory 
records, must be retained by the I nvestigator  for the maximum period required by applicable 
regulations of relevant national or local health authorities . No records may be disposed of 
without the written approval of the Sponsor. The Sponsor will notify the I nvestigator  when the 
records are no longer needed. Following notification from the Sponsor, the documents may be 
destroyed, subject to local regulations.  
Written notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.  
10.1.13  Publication Policy and Protection of Trade Secrets  
Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedic ated to openly providing information on 
the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific congresses and in peer -
reviewed journals. The Sponsor will comply with all requirements for publication of study results.  
The Investigator m ust agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to 
submission for publication or presentation. This allows the Sponsor to protect proprietary 
information and to provide comments based on information from other studies that may not yet  
be available to the Investigator. 
The S ponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance 
with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally support publication of 
multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center data. In this case, a Coordinating I nvestigator  will be designated in accordance with the Parker Institute for Cancer

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  94 10.3 APPENDIX 3: RECIST CRITERIA (VERSION 1.1 ) 
Tumor response will be assessed ac cording to RECIST v1.1 ( Eisenhauer et al., 2009)  as 
described below.  
10.3.1  Measurability of Tumor at Baseline  
At baseline, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or nonmeasurable as 
follows:  
• Measurable  
Tumor lesions : Must be accurately measured in ≥ 1 dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
o 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)  
o 10 mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately measured with calipers should be recorded as nonmeasurable)  
o 20 mm by chest X -ray 
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). 
• Nonmeasurable  
o All other lesions (or disease sites), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes wi th ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis)  
o Lesions considered truly nonmeasurable include the following: leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdomina l 
organomegaly identified by physical examination that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques  
 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  95 10.3.2  Tumor Response Evaluation  
10.3.2.1  Baseline Documentation of Target and Nontarget Lesions  
• Target lesions  
o When > 1 measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 5 
lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesions  
o It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly s hould be selected  
• Nontarget lesions  
o All other lesions (or disease sites), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as nontarget lesions  
o It is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single 
item (eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’)  
10.3.2.2  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Target lesions will be evaluated and response recorded as defined in Appendix Table 1. 
Appendix Table 1:  Response Based on Evaluation of Target Lesions at Each Assessment  
Complete response  Disappearance of all target lesions; if a pathologic lymph node, 
reduction in the shortest axis to < 10 mma 
Partial responseb ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions relative to the baseline sum diameters
c 
Stable diseaseb,d Neither a sufficient reduction to qualify as a partial response nor a sufficient increase to qualify as progression
c 
Progressive diseaseb ≥ 20% increase in the sum diameters relative to the smallest sum 
diameters recorded (including the baseline sum diame ters) in 
conjunction with an increase of at least 5 mm in that smallest sum 
diameters, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesionsc,e 
a For each pathologic lymph node considered a target lesion, the node must have a short axis measuring < 10 mm to 
be consi dered as a complete response. In such cases, the sum diameters may not be zero (as a normal lymph node 
can have a short axis of < 10 mm).  
b For each pathologic lymph node considered a target lesion, the measurement of the short axis of the node is to be 
included in the sum diameters when determining partial response, stable disease, and progression.  
c In this study, the “baseline sum diameters” is calculated based on the lesion measurements obtained at screening.  
d Duration of stable disease is measured fro m the date of the first dose of s tudy intervention  until criteria for 
progressive disease are met based on the smallest sum diameters recorded (including the baseline sum diameters).  
e The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal and not possibly attr ibutable to a difference in imaging 
modality or scanning technique. Post -baseline, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) 
may be useful in assessing new lesions apparent on CT scan.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  96 10.3.2.3  Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions  
Nontarget lesions will be evaluated and response recorded as defined in Appendix Table 2.  
Appendix Table 2:  Response Based on Evaluation of Nontarget Lesions at Each 
Assessment  
Complete response  Disappearance of all non -target lesions; all lymph n odes must be 
nonpathologic in size (ie, < 10 mm on the short axis)  
Not complete response nor 
progressive disease  Persistence of 1 or more non- target lesions  
Progressive disease  Unequivocal progressiona of any existing non- target lesion or the 
appearance of 1 or more new lesionsb 
a The participant should stop study intervention, even in the presence of a partial response or stable disease, based 
on assessment of target lesions.  
b The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal and not possibly attributable to a difference in imaging 
modality or scanning technique. Post -baseline, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG -PET) 
may be useful in assessing new lesions apparent  on computerized tomography (CT) scan.  
 
10.3.2.4  New Lesions  
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important. There are no specific criteria for the 
identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the finding of a new lesion should be 
unequivocal, ie, not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (eg, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre -existing lesions). This is particularly important 
when the participant’s baseline lesions show PR or CR. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan as report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not. 
10.3.2.5  Evaluation of Overall Response  
Overall response based on the evaluation of target and nontarget lesions will be determined as shown in Appendix Table 3.

• Protocol -specific requirements for inclusion or exclusion of participants are detailed in 
Section 5 of the protocol and the protocol appendix for each respective combination. 
• Additional tests may be performed at any time during the study as determined necessary by 
the Investigator or requir ed by local regulations. 
• Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.  
 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  99 10.5 APPENDIX 5: ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND 
PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, 
FOLLOW- UP, AND REPORTING  
10.5.1  Definitions  
10.5.1.1  Definitio n of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant , temporally associated with the 
use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormality or deterioration in a laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, or are considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator. 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency an d/or intensity of the condition.  
• A new condition detected or dia gnosed after study intervention administration even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected over dose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication.  
• Serious e vents that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that 
occur prior to assignment of study procedures (eg, screening invasive procedures, such as biopsies , discontinuation of study intervention) . 
• Any new cancer (that is not a condition of the study)  including basal and squamous cell 
carcinoma.  
• Note: Progression of the cancer under study is not a reportable event. Refer to Section  8.3.6 for additional details.  
 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  100 Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or  
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 
• Surgery planned prior to informed consent to treat a pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened.  
 
10.5.1.2  Definition of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if  serious conditions 
are met.  
An SAE is defined as any AE  that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side 
effect, or untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death 
b. Is life -threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant  was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
In general, hospitalizat ion signifies that the participant  has been detained at the hospital or 
emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admissi on, 
regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation.  
Note: H ospitalization s for the following reasons are not considered SAEs in this study:  
• a visit to the emergency room or other hospital depa rtment for < 24 hours, that does not 
result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)  
• elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine healt h assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  101 • medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical signifi cance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and 
accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e. Is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
In offspring of a participant exposed to the study intervention regardless of  timing as 
determined for study intervention based on product half -life. Any  spontaneous  abortion should 
be reported in the same fashion (as the Sponsor considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significant).  
f. Other important medical events:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize t he 
participant  or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
 
10.5.1.3  Definition of Unexpected AE  
Unexpected AE Definition  
• Any AE, the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the current 
Investigator ’s Brochure. Expected means that the event has previously been observed with 
the study intervention and is identified and/or described in the current IB. It does not mean 
that the event is expected with the underlying disease(s), co- morbidities or concomitant 
medications.  
 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  102 10.5.1.4  Definition of Treatment -emergent AE  
Treatment -emergent AE Definition  
• Any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding that is considered to be clinically significant), syndrome or disease that  
either occurs during the study, having been absent at baseline, or , if present at b aseline, 
appears to have worsened in severity or frequency, whether or not the event is considered related to the study intervention. 
10.5.2  Additional Events Reported in the S ame Manner as an  SAE  
Additional Events Reported in the Same Manner as a SAE  
• In addition to the SAE criteria  in Section  10.5.1.2, AEs  meeting any  of the below criteria, 
although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, the se events are 
considered serious by the Sponsor for collection purposes.  
o A new  invasive or malignant  cancer (not the indicated condition of the study)  
o An overdose or is an associated event that meets safety criterion  with an 
overdose (as specified in Secti on 8.4)  
o Protocol -specified AE SIs (as defined  in Section  8.3.7)  
o Pregnancy (as specified in Section  8.3.5)  
 
10.5.3  Recording AE s and SAE s 
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an AE/ AESI/ SAE  occurs, it is the responsibility of the I nvestigator  to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event.  Only a single AE term should be  recorded for the event.  
• The Investigator  will record all relevant AE/AESI/ SAE information in the eCRF. 
• It is not  acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopies of the participant’s medical 
records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the Adverse Event  eCRF /SAE r eport f orm. 
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by the Sponsor. In this case, all participant  identifiers, with the exception of the participant  
number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to the Sponsor. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  103 • The Investigator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE /AESI/ SAE.   
Assessment of Severity  
• The terms ‘severe’ and ‘serious’ are not synonymous. An event is defined as ‘serious’ 
when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an 
SAE, NOT  when it is rated as severe.  Severit y (intensity) and seriousness need to be 
independently assessed for each AE recorded on the eCRF.  
• The Investigator  will assess the  intensity for each AE , including AESI, and SAE (and other 
reportable safety events ) according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), version 5.0, which can be found at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm. The following grading will be used for assessing intensity for AEs not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE:  
o Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
o Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate inst rumental activities of daily living.  
o Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.  
o Grade 4: Life threat ening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
o Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
• Any changes to CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode (ie, persistent AE ) will 
have each change of grade recorded on the A dverse Event  CRFs . 
Assessment of Causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each 
occurrence of each AE/ AESI/ SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relations hip, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. 
• The Investigator  will use their clinical judgment, knowledge of the participant, the 
circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine the relationsh ip. 
• The following guidance will be considered and investigated:  
o Temporal relationship of the event onset to study intervention administration

Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  104 o Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study intervention, or reintroduction of study intervention (as 
applicable)  
o Known association of the event with the study intervention or with similar treatments  
o Known association of the event with the disease under study 
o Presence of risk factors in the participant  or use of concomitant medications 
known to increase the occurrence of the event  
o Presence of non -treatment -related factors th at are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment. 
• For each AE/ AESI/ SAE, the Investigator  must document in the medical notes tha t he/she 
has reviewed the AE/ AESI/ SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor . However, it is very import ant 
that the I nvestigator  always make an assessment of causality for every event before the 
initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor . 
• The Investigator  may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information 
and send an  SAE foll ow-up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements.  
• For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, the Investi gator  may attribute each AE causality to the combination regimen or to a single 
agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen (ie, to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the Investigator’s  opinion, there are sufficient data to 
support full attribution of the AE  to the single agent . 
Causality of AEs , AESIs, and SAEs in this protocol will be assessed as follows:  
• Unrelated : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc.).  
Note: If an AE is assessed as unrelated to the study intervention(s), there must be an alternative etiology in the Investigator’s ass essment for that event documented in the 
participant’s medical records.  
• Unlikely Related : This category applies to those AEs that are judged to be unrelated to the 
study intervention(s), but for which no extraneous cause may be found. An AE may be consider ed unlikely to be related to study intervention(s) if or when it meets 2 of the 
following criteria:  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  105 o it does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study intervention(s);  
o it could readily have been produced by the participant’s  clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the 
participant; 
o it does not follow a known pattern of response to the study intervention(s); or  
o it does not reappear or worsen when the study intervention(s) is re-administered.  
• Possibly Related : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the 
study intervention administration appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when it meets 2 of the following criteria:  
o it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention(s);  
o it could not readily have been produced by the participant’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the participant; or  
o it follows a known pattern of response to the study intervention(s).  
• Probably Related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels with a 
high degree of certainty are related to the study intervention(s). A n AE may be considered 
probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following criteria:  
o it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study intervention(s);  
o it could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the 
participant’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the participant;  
o it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the study intervention, yet study intervention relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depression, fixed study intervention eruptions, or tardive dyskinesia); or  
o it follows a known pattern of response to the study intervention( s). 
• Definitely Related : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator believes are 
incontrovertibly related to study intervention(s). An AE may be assigned an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following criteria:  
o it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study 
intervention(s);  
o it could not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the participant’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the participant;  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  106 o it disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose and recurs with 
re-exposure to study intervention(s) (if rechallenge occurs); and  
o it follows a known pattern of response to the study intervention(s).  
 
Follow -up of AE s and SAE s 
• The Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the Sponsor to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as  fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• New or updated information will be recorded on the e CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated data related to SAE s or AESIs  to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 
 
10.5.4  Reporting of AEs, AESIs, SAEs, and Other Reportable Safety 
Events to the Sponsor  
Reporting of AE s, AESIs, SAE s, and Other Reportable Safety Events to the Sponsor  via 
an Electronic Data Collection Tool   
• The primary mechanism for reporting AEs to the Sponsor will be via  the electronic data 
collection (EDC) tool .  
• Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines (or equivalent).  
• If the electronic system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then the site will us e the 
paper AE reporting tool (see next section). 
• Reference S ection  8.3.1– Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE , AESI, SAE , and 
Other Reportable Safety Event Information for reporting time requirements  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the EDC tool will be taken off -line to prevent 
the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• The site will report all AESIs on the study -specific SAE report form to the Parker Institute 
for Cancer Immunotherapy study team within 24 hours of site awareness. The AESI should also be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
• The site will report all SAE data  on the study- specific  SAE report form to the Parker 
Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy study team within 24 hours of site awareness.  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  107 • Contacts for reporting SAE s, AESIs,  and other reportable safety event can be found in 
Section  8.3.8.2. 
 
SAE and Other Reportable Safety Event Reporting to the Sponsor  
• In the instance where an SAE or AESI occurs , a facsimile transmission of the SAE report 
form  and/or Pregnancy form is the pr eferred method to transmit this information to the 
Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy Pharmacovigilance Group.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone 
is acceptable with a copy of the SAE report form  sent via email . 
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator  to complete 
and sign the SAE report form wit hin the designated reporting time frames. 
• Contacts for SAE , AESI,  and other reportable safety event reporting can be found in 
Section  8.3.8.2. 
 
10.5.5  Additional Reporting Considerations  
AE and SAE Recording for Special Circumstances  
Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
• Symptoms reported on the diary cards should be assessed by the Investigator for clinical 
significance and should be added as an Adverse Event according to the Investigator’s judgement or CTCAE 5.0 criteria, if appropriate.  
• A diagnosis (if known)  or cause of death  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF 
page rather than individual signs and symptoms (eg, record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and eleva ted transaminases).  
• If a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF  page.  
• If a diagnosis  is subsequently established, all previously reported AEs  based on signs and 
symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one AE  report based on the single diagnosis, 
with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events  
• In general, AEs  that are secondary to other events (eg, cascade events or clinical sequelae) 
should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious 
secondary  events. A medically significant secondary AE that is separated in time from the 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  108 initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF  
page . For example:  
o If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy 
adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. 
o If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
o If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
o If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all 3 events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
o If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF.  
• All AEs  should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF page if it is unclear 
as to whether the events are associated.  
Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events  
• A persistent AE  is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between participant  
evaluation time  points . Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event 
eCRF  page . The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the 
time the event is first reported.  
• If a persistent AE becomes more severe, the most ext reme severity should also be recorded 
on the Adverse Event eCRF page, and details regarding any increases or decreases in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event eCRF. 
• If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor as an  SAE, and the 
Adverse Event eCRF  page should be updated by changing the event from "non- serious" to 
"serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to SAE s. 
• A recurrent AE  is one that resolves between par ticipant evaluation time points  and 
subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an AE  should be recorded as a separate event on 
the Adverse Event eCRF  page . 
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
• A clinical laboratory test value must be reported as an AE  if it meets any of the following 
criteria:  
o is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
o results in a change in study intervention (eg, dose modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
o results in a medical intervention or change in concomitant medication  
o is clinically significant in the I nvestigator’s  judgment  
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  109 Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
• Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital 
sign abnormality should be classified as an AE . 
• If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (eg, high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (ie, hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page . 
• Observations of  the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF  page  (see above for details on 
recording persistent AE ). 
Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
• The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3 x baseline value) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin (>2 x ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of seve re liver injury 
(as defined by Hy's Law). Therefore, Investigators  must report as an AE  the occurrence of 
either of the following:  
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with 
total bilirubin > 2 x ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bi lirubin)  
o Treatment -emergent ALT or AST > 3 x baseline value in combination with 
clinical jaundice  
• The most appropriate diagnosis or if a diagnosis cannot be established, the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page and r eported to the 
Sponsor immediately as an SAE  or an AESI  (see Section  8.3.7).  
Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Underlying Disease  
• Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should not be recorded as AEs. The se data will be captured as efficacy 
assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on RECIST  criteria. In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on 
symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an AE. 
Deaths  
• All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AE  reporting period, regardless of 
relationship to study intervention, must be recorded on the Death  eCRF page and 
immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 8.3.1) , unless the death is  attributed to 
progression of  disease.  
• Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  110 concept on the Adverse Event eCRF  page . Generally, only one such event should be  
reported.  
• If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, 
"unexplained death" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page  and reported as 
an SAE . 
• If the cause of death later becomes available ( eg, after autopsy), "unexplained death" 
should be replaced by the established cause of death. 
• The term "sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of 
death ( eg, "sudden cardiac death").  
• If the death is attributed to progression of underlying dis ease, “underlying disease" should 
be recorded on the appropriate  eCRF  page; no SAE for m is necessary . 
• Deaths that occur after the AE reporting period should be reported as described in 
Section  8.3.2. 
Pre-existing Medical Conditions  
• A pre -existing  medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. 
Such conditions should be recorded on the Medical History eCRF  page . 
• A pre -existing  medical condition should be recorded as an AE only if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF  page , it is important to convey the concept that the pr e-
existing  condition has changed by including applicable descriptors ( eg, "more frequent 
headaches").  
Adverse Events Associated with Overdose or Error in Drug Administration  
• An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied. An overdose or incorrect administration of study intervention is not itself an AE , but it may result in an AE . All AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect 
administration of study intervention should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF  page . 
• If the associated AE  fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the 
Sponsor as a separate SAE .

COLLECTION OF PREGNANCY INFORMATION  
10.6.1  Definitions  
10.6.1.1  Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post -menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the fol lowing categories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s: review of the participant ’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
o A postmenopausal state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 
age 45 years in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must have a serum follicle stimulating hormone level > 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non- estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they 
wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollm ent. 
 
10.6.2  Contraception Guidance:  
10.6.2.1  Male Participant s 
Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from 
penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration during the protocol -defined time frame and at least 7 months after the last dose of study intervention.  
• Inform any and all partner(s) of their participation in a clinical drug study and the need to 
comply with contraception instructions as directed by the investigator. 
• Male part icipants are required to use a condom for study duration and until end of 
relevant systemic exposure, defined as at least 7 months after the end of study 
intervention. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  112 • Female partners of males participating in the study to consider use of effective methods  
of contraception as described in Appendix Table 4  until the end of relevant systemic 
exposure, defined as at least 7 months after the end of study intervention in the male 
participant.  
• Male participants with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile penetration during the protocol -defined time fr ame and at least 7 months after the last 
dose of study intervention. 
• Refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the study and at least  7 months after the 
last dose of study intervention. 
 
10.6.2.2  Female Participant s 
Female participants of childbearing potential are eligible to participate if they agree to use a 
highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly as described in Appendix Table 4  during study duration and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as at least 
5 months after the end of study treatment . 
Appendix Table 4:  Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods  
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent

MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  113 • Bilateral tubal occlusion  
Vasectomized partner  
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner is 
the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used.  
Sexual abstinence   
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant . 
• It is not necessary  to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected.  
• WOCBP participants  who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in t he SOA  (Section 1.3) .  
• Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants  chooses to forego complete abstinence . 
NOTES:  
a) Typical use fai lure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use 
should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for 
participant s participating in clinical studies.  
b) Hormonal contraception may be suscepti ble to interaction with the study intervention, 
which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case,  2 highly effective 
methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 5 months  after the last dos e of study intervention 
 
10.6.3  Pregnancy Testing  
• WOCBP should only be included after a confirmed menstrual period and a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test  within 24 hours of first dose  of study 
intervention. 
• Additional pregnancy testing should be performed at every 4 weeks prior to nivolumab 
admin istration  during the treatment period, at the E nd of Treatment  visit ( ie, 30 days after 
the last dose of study intervention),  at the Follow -up visit  100 days after  the last dose of 
study interventions, and as required locally.  
• Pregnancy testing will be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or when pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  114 10.6.4  Collection of Pregnancy Information  
10.6.4.1  Male Participant s with P artners who Become Pregnant  
• The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male participant ’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male participant  is in this study. This 
applies only to male participant s who receive study intervention. 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator  will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the S ponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partne r’s pregnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
10.6.4.2  Female Participant s who Become Pregnant  
• The Investigator  will collect pregnancy info rmation on any female participant who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the S ponsor within 24 hours of learning of a 
participant 's pregnancy. The participant  will be fo llowed to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy. The I nvestigator  will collect follow -up information on the participant  and the 
neonate and the information will be forwarded to the S ponsor. Generally, follow -up will 
not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnan cy 
complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by the Investigator  will be reported to the S ponsor as described in 
Section  8.3.4. While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participant s, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant  who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention. 
 
MCGRAW  – Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy 
Protocol PICI0014 Amendment 2, 08JAN2020  115 10.7 APPENDIX 7: GENETICS  
Use/Analysis of DNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant ’s response to study intervention, susceptibility to, 
and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be due  
to genetic determinants that impact immune response, drug absorption, distribution, 
metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and  
IRB/IEC allow, a blood and tumor  sample will be collected for DNA analysis from 
consenting participant s. 
• Stool samples will be collected, and microbiome DNA extracted and analyzed to evaluate a participant’s response to study intervention, susceptibility to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be due to bacterial genetic determinants that impact immune response, drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug.  
• Germline, tumor and bacterial DNA samples will be used for research related to anti -PD-1 
therapy  or cancer and /or immune disorders and related diseases  or evaluation of new assay 
technologies . They may also be used to develop tests/assays including diagnos tic tests related 
to treatment, including anti -PD-1 therapy , and cancer . Genetic research may consist of the 
analysis of one or more candidate genes or the analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome or analysis of the entire genome (as appropriate).  
• DNA samples may  be analyzed for whole genome sequencing and bacterial DNA may be 
analyzed by 16s and/or whole metagenomic sequencing and relationship to clinical outcomes in response to study intervention. Additional analyses may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data.  
• The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved 
in the response to anti -PD-1 therapy  or study interventions  of this class to understand study 
disease or related conditions.  
• The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary. 
• The S ponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to 
protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained while research on anti -PD-1 therapy  or study intervention 
continues in accordance with applicable law .

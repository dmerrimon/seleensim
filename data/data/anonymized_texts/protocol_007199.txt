 1.0   Background and R ationale  
 
The acute leukemias in adults are characterized by resistance and poor outcomes.  Acute 
myeloid leukemia ( AML) and acute lymphoid leukemia ( ALL) are aggressive malignancies that 
lead to the accumulation of immature myeloid or lymphoid precursors, resulting in progressive 
marrow failure and death 1. They affect approximately 19,000 people per year in the United 
States; despite decades of research, the overall 5 -year survival rema ins a disappoin ting 30 -40% 
2-4. The current treatment is intensive induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation using 
chemotherapy or a stem cell transplant  2,5.   
 
Selecting patients for intensive therapy is a major c hallenge  in the acute leukemia s. 
There are multiple prognostic factors in the acute leukemias that are used to try and select the 
best candidates for intensive induction therapy. The most powerful single prognostic factor in 
the acute leukemias is cytogenetics. Using standard karyotyping techniques patients can be 
divided into 3 prognostic categories; good, intermediate and poor. They are characterized by 5 
year overall survival rates of 55%, 24% and 5% respectively 6. Age is also a powerful prognostic 
factor in the acute l eukemias. For patients over 60 with acute leukemia, the prognosis is grave  
(five-year survival of less than 10%)  7-9. These patients have many co -morbidities and increased 
resistant disease  2,5. Both acute leukemias in adulthood disproportionately affect the elderly 
(median age of onset of 72 and >60 for A ML and ALL, respectively) 4,10.  The presence of poor -
risk cytogenetic factors is increased in elderly patients as well as expression of multi -drug efflux 
pumps 11-12. Performance status is another important prognostic factor and the ability to tolerate 
induction therapy decreases as performance status worsens regardless of age  8. For older 
patients with poor performance status i t is currently acceptable clinical practice to offer only 
supportive care. In AML t his has led some authors to conclude that standard induction 
chemotherapy should not be offered to elderly patients13. In contrast other groups have found a 
positive clinical impact of standard therapy in older AML patients with increased survival and 
less time in hosp ital than those offered only supportive care14. In order to better help clinicians 
decide what patients should be offered intensive therapy a number of prognostic scoring 
systems have been developed15. The majority of these systems rely heavily on the cytogenetics 
of the leukemia and this information is generally not available at the time of diag nosis. An 
additional prognostic factor that could be easily obtained at the time of diagnosis would a major 
step forward. In addition to deciding on what initial therapy to give an AML patient there is 
another major clinical decision point. A nadir marrow is obtained on day 14 following standard 
induction therapy and if there is significant residual disease a second course of induction is 
usually attempted. In many cases patients have experienced significant complications by day 14 
making additional chemoth erapy difficult to safely administer. There are very few studies on 
what prognostic factors are important when considering a second course of induction therapy. 
This is further complicated by the lack of rigorously performed studies to establish the predic tive 
power of a positive nadir marrow. An additional prognostic factor that could be easily obtained 
on day 14 would be of significant help to clinicians.  
 
Bioimpedance phase angle is prognostic in multiple disease states.  Phase angle is 
measured by bioimpedance and reflects cell membrane integrity, nutritional status and muscle 
mass16. It has been found to be prognostic in a number of conditions such as end stage renal 
disease, HIV and COPD17-19. Additionally, it is pro gnostic in multiple tumor types including 
pancreatic, colorectal, breast and head and neck. In a recent report it was found to be strongly 
prognostic for patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic stem cell 
transplants20. Standardized phase angle measurements are made non -invasively, can be done 
quickly and reproducibly and with no patient discomfort. Measurements are taken by placing 2

 electrodes on the hand and 2 on the foot from the same side of the patient. A sma ll voltage is 
applied between the electrodes and the timing of induced the current is measured. The current 
is approximately 1000 times lower than the sensitivity of sensory neurons and thus cannot be 
felt by the patient and has no known biological effect.  This study seeks to establish the 
feasibility and prognostic power of standardized phase angle in acute leukemia patients 
undergoing intensive induction chemotherapy.   
 
2.0  Objectives  
 
2.1 To  determine the feasibility of obtaining standardized phase angle measurements on 
patients hospitalized for treatment of newly diagnosed acute leukemia.  
 
2.2 To evaluate the association between standardized phase angle  measured at the 
start of therapy and treatment -relate d outcomes including : 
Primary outcome : Treatment related mortality (defined as 60-day mortality )  
Secondary outcomes : Evaluate the association of the day 14 standardized phase angle 
and treatment related outcomes, 30-day mortality, length of hospitalization,  transfer to 
intensive care unit  during induction, treatment response (14 day bone marrow  response , 
complete remission),  receipt of post -remission therapy , overall survival . 
 
2.3 An exploratory analysis investigating associations with the p rimary and secondary 
outcomes using different ways to categorize the baseline standardized phase angle 
measurement (obtained on the first day of treatment) and, for AML patients, the 
standardized phase angle measure obtained  just prior to the nadir marrow.

second phase angle measurement taken within 2 days of  the nadir marrow . When ever 
possible , measurements will be taken prior to any invasive procedures (bone marrow 
biopsy, leukophoresis, PICC line placement, etc.) . In addition data on pertinent 
covariates including age, demographic data, tumor biology, white  blood cell count, LDH, 
need of total parental nutrition or placement of a feeding tube and comorbid conditions

 will be collected . There will be no intervention done as a result of the phase angle 
measurement . Patients will be followed at routine visits pe r standard of care for two 
years or until death.  
 
5.0 Data Management  
All data will be de -identified and stored  in a password protected REDCap  database in 
accordance with HIPAA. Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap ) software is a 
secure, web -based application designed to support survey creation, survey 
administration and data capture for research studies.  Records to be kept on each 
subject will include only the data specified in Appendi ces B, C, D, E and F. Only st udy 
personnel will have access to the data.  
 
6.0     Registration   
Eligible patients must be registered with the CCCWFU Registrar. Following registration, 
patients should have a baseline phase angle measurement taken. If a patient does not 
agree to have the measurement  following registration, the patient’s registration on the 
study may be canceled. The Registrar should be notified of cancellations as soon as 
possible.  
 
To register a patient, the following documents should be completed by the research 
nurse or data manager and faxed (336 -713-6772) to the Registrar:  
• Signed patient consent form/HIPAA authorization form  
• On-Study/Registration Form (Appendix A)  
 
The research nurse or data manager will then call (336 -713-6767) the Registrar between 
the hours of 0800 -1600 EST Monday -Friday to verify eligibility.  To complete the 
registration process, the Registrar will:  
• assign a patient study number  
• register the patient on the study  
 
7.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
Description of measures  
 
Standardized phase angle  
Standardized phase angle will be calculated as in 20 (standardized phase angle = 
(measured phase angle−phase angle  ref)/SD  ref). Reference values and standard 
deviation come from measurements of phase angle in over 200,000  healthy German 
adults21.  
 
Mortality  
30 day mortality rate is defined as the percent of patients no longer alive at 30 days after 
registration. In the rare case that a patient is lost to follow up before 30 days, the patient 
will be treated as missing.  
 
60 day mortality rate is defined as the percent of patients no longer alive at 60 days after 
registration. Patients that are discharged to hospice care before 60 days without a 
known date of death will be counted towards 60 day mortality.  In the rare case that a 
patient is lost to follow up before 60 days, the patient will be treated as missing.

Page 5 of 22 
 Treatment response  
14 day bone marrow response is defined as  hypoplastic marrow with less than 20% 
cellularity and 5% blasts.  
 
Complete  remission is defined as  less than 5% marrow blasts, absolute neutrophil count 
>1000, platelet count >100,000 and freedom from red cell transfusions.  
 
Feasibility Analysis  
If the study fails to accrue 20 patients during the first year of accrual it will be  deemed 
unlikely to meet its ultimate accrual goal and the study will be terminated.  
 
Primary analysis  
This study’s primary endpoint is the association between standardized phase angle and 
60 day mortality.  Standardized phase angle  will be treated as a continuous measure for 
the primary analysis.  Since we will be using a standardized measure of phase angle, for 
power calculations we will assume a standard deviation of one and investigate  the 
effects of a one unit  change . A sample si ze of 102 patients would give us 80% power to 
detect an odds ratio of 2.1, using a logistic regression model with a 0.05 significance 
level and a 60 day mortality rate of 20% . With an expected accrual rate of 50 patients 
per year, the study should complete  accrual in approximately two years and complete 
follow -up (two year follow -up) four years after the first patient is enrolled.   Descriptive 
statistics will be used for baseline characteristics .  Important baseline characteristics , 
such as age , will be add ed to the regression model as covariates for additional analysis.  
 
Secondary analysis  
We will use logistic regression to analyze the association between standardized phase 
angle and the secondary outcomes of 30 day mortality, transfer to the intensive care 
unit, 14 day marrow response, complete remission and receipt of post -remission 
therap y. The association with overall survival will be evaluated using a Cox proportional 
hazards model . We will use a linear model to look at the association with length of 
hospital stay. It is likely that the length of hospital stay will not be normally distri buted 
and will need a transformation to satisfy the normality assumption of the linear model.  
Feasibility will be analyzed qualitatively.  
 
Exploratory analysis  
We will explore other versions of the standardized phase angle measure and how they 
relate to th e primary and secondary outcomes. We will evaluate using categorical cut 
points of the baseline measure and the standardized phase angle measure captured just 
prior to the  nadir marrow (for AML patients).  
 
8.0 Protection of Human Subjects  
Prior to implementation of this study, the protocol will be approved by the WFU 
Institutional Review Board (IRB). All subjects will provide written informed consent prior 
to enrollment in the study.

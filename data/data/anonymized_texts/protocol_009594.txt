PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Objectives:  
The primary objective of the study is: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 in subjects with multiple system atrophy 
(MSA), Parkinson’s disease (PD), or pure autonomic failure (PAF) experiencing 
sympt omatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension ( symptomatic nOH ) compared 
with placebo at  Week  4, as measured by the change from baseline of the 
Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA)  Question 1 (OHSA#1) 
score.  
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 by symptom and activity assessments using 
OHSA and the Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activity Scale (OHDAS). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 using the Patient Global Impression of 
Change (PGI -C). 
• To evaluate the efficacy of TD -9855 in preventing incidence of falls. 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of TD -9855, including adverse events 
(AEs) and changes in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram 
(ECG), Columbia Suicide Severity Ra ting Scale (C -SSRS)  and laboratory tests. 
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
Study Design:   
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with primary 
autonomic failures (MSA, PD, or PAF) and symptomatic nOH  after 4 weeks of treatment.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Given the challenges  presented by the COVID -19 pandemic  the trial utilizes an operational 
design featuring the ability to conduct protocol required visits as either in  clinic or remote 
visits.  Investigators must conduct al l study visits for Study 0169 for a given  subject in a 
consistent manner to reduce the possibility of variability  in data collection and reporting. 
Therefore,  Investigators, in discussion with each individual subject at their site , will be 
required to elect to conduct all visits either in the clinic or remotely.  Regardless of which 
election an Investigator and subject make, the S creening visit  (V1) must be conducted in 
clinic  for all subjects . Tools and systems are available to sites and subjects to  support 
remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shipping of study medication and other study supplies, 
standardized HIPA A/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses ).  
 
Due to the potential for resurgence of COVID-19 and its impact on both sites and subject s, 
the Sponsor will allow Investigators  to request exceptions to the selected type of study visit 
modality due to COVID-19 or COVID- 19 related circumstances. Approved exceptions  will 
be recorded as COVID -19 related  protocol deviations.  
All sites are allowed at Investigator discretion to conduct either in clinic or remote unscheduled visit(s) for subject safety or unexpected subject medical needs outside of the 
regular visit schedule. In this case, unscheduled visits are not considered protocol 
deviations and the Investigator is not required to obtain pre-approval from the Sponsor. Data collected during these visits may include any protocol- specified assessments 
which will be captured in the clinical database.   
For subjects that have previ ously completed the Screening visit  at the time regulatory and 
ethics approval for  is received , sites must reconsent the subject using the 
most recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote study vi sits, if that visit modality is selected  by the Investigator and the subject. For 
those subjects who are already randomized  to study treatment and active in the study at the 
time regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and 
subject  should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the 
Randomization Visit.  
Symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is defined as: 
• A sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg  (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg  (diastolic) 
within 3 minutes of standing or tilted -up to ≥60
o elevation from a supine 
position.

Question #1 
The study consists of 3 periods: (i ) 4-week screening, (ii) 4 -week random ized treatment, 
and (iii) 2 -week follow up. The schematic representation is as shown below: 
  
After  signing the informed consent, the subject will enter a screening period of up to 
4 weeks  to confirm eligibility. At the  Screening visit,  which must be performed in the clinic 
for all subjects , the subject will provide a comprehensive medical history of their disease 
and treatments. The subject’s disease will be characterized and documented by the 
Investigator. 
The subject will receive an assessment of th eir physical condition, including safety and 
laboratory evaluations and related aspects of their disease states according to the Schedule 
of Study Procedures ( Table 1). The presence of symptomatic nOH  symptoms and reported 
sensation of dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out 
(OHSA#1 ) must be confirmed by the application of a tilt- table test. This tilt -table  test 
serves 2 purposes: (i) determination of the systolic/diastolic BP (DBP) changes, and 
(ii) training the subjects to recognize the sensations associated with OHSA#1. 
Eligible subjects will undergo training of accurate scoring of their sensation of dizziness, 
lightheade dness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out as outlined by the OHSA#1. 
Following the screening period, the subject will proceed to Visit 2  to further confirm the 
additional eligibility criteria prior to  randomization. This includes the completion of the 
Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire ( OHQ) in which a minimum score of 4 points in 
OHSA#1 is required. S ubject s meeting all applicable inclusion criteria and none of the 
applicable exclusion criteria , including confirm ation of relevant criteria by the independent 
Enrollment Steering Committee (ESC) , will be randomized to receive either TD -9855 or 
matching placebo  for the next 4 weeks.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 7 of 143 
 
PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (CONTINUED)  
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Following randomization and completion of study assessments , the subject  will receive a  
  dose of TD -9855 (or matching placebo) once daily (QD) for the remaining  
double- blind treatment period.  
Weekly assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Table 1).  Refer to  the f ootnotes in Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1 ) for a 
description of all assessments.  Refer to Appendix 9 and the Study Reference Manual for 
detailed instructions for conducting subject assessments in clinic and remotely . These 
instructions have been provided to ensure the method and conduct of each assessment is 
consistent across  sites  and subjects for both in clinic and remote visits.  
Discontinuation of subjects may occur at any time. Dose  stopping criteria inc lude meeting 
at least 1 of the following rules: 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
No dose reduction is permitted at any time.  
Safety assessments will include a physical examination, neurological examination, vital 
signs ( body temperature, HR and BP), body weight, ECGs , safety laboratory  tests 
(hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis), C- SSRS, and AEs . 
Safety will be periodically reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee , see 
separate charter.  
Subjects will be requested to refrain from making any significant dietary changes 
throughout the duration of the study. Subjects should be reminded to maintain an adequate 
fluid intake during their scheduled visits. 
Subjects completing the 4 -week double- blind treatment period will be eligible to enroll and 
continue receiving study medication  in Study 0170. The final study visit for those subjects 
who do not complete the 4-week double-blind treatment period or who choose not to 
continue into Study 0170 will be the follow- up visit (V7). This visit must be completed two 
weeks from the date of the last dose . 
Enrollment Steering Committee  (ESC)  
The Investigator must obtain approval from the ESC prior to randomizing the subject in the 
study.   The ESC is a committee of independent neurologists that will make a 
predetermination of the subject’s appropriateness for study inclusion by reviewing medical 
information provided by the site. The ESC will review both the medical history 
to support  the diagnosis (MSA, PD, or PAF), and confirm the presence of symptomatic

include confirmation that the subject maintains a sustained  fall in blood pressure to a 
level  that is consistent with cerebral hypoperfusion. The ESC will consult with the 
Investigator to address any outstanding questions. The ESC review is recommended to be 
completed within 48 hours and the Investigator  will be informed in writing (e.g., by e -mail) 
of the decision. Following ESC approval of the subject, the Investigator will determine 
eligibility based up on the protocol Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for randomization. In  
cases where the ESC determines subject ineligibility based on tilt- table  test findings that are 
not consistent with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, the decision will be 
accompanied by rationale. A dedicated charter has been implemented to address the mode 
of operations of the ESC to ensure the protection of the study integrity. The communication from the ESC, documenting review and approval of the subject, will serve as E SC 
documentation for inclusion into the study.

Analysis : 
Analyses conducted based on the FAS  will be based on the assigned randomized 
treatments.  
The safety analysis set will be defined as all randomized subjects who have received at least 
1 dose of study medication  and subjects will be analyzed according to the actual study 
treatments they receive.  
Unless specified otherwise, all data will be summarized by treatment group. Continuous variables will be presented using descriptive statistics. Categorical variables will be summarized using subject counts and percentage of subjects in corresponding categories. 
The primary efficacy evaluation is the change from baseline of OHSA#1 at Week  4. 
Baseline is defined as Day 1 pre-dose measurement. Mixed model for r epeated m easures 
(MMRM) will be used to compare treatment differences. The model will include fixed 
effect class terms of treatment, baseline disease type (MSA, PD, PAF), week, and 
continuous covariate of baseline OHSA#1 score, a random subject effect, with an unstructured covariance structure using the FAS . 
Least -square means and 95% confidence intervals on the differences between TD -9855 and 
placebo will be calculated and presented.  
Missing data in the MMRM analysis is assumed as missing at random (MAR) and will not be imputed for the analysis of the primary endpoint. Sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint will be conducted using multiple imputation. The primary analysis will be repeated on a set of pre-specified subgroups and presented in graphical format. 
If the  treatment effect of the primary efficacy endpoint has been demonstrated, t he 
following secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested via statistical testing procedure, to be 
described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), that will protect the family -wise Type I 
error rate at 2 -sided significance level of 5 % until a failure to reject the null hypothesis 
occurs.   No statistical significance will be claimed after a failure to reject the null 
hypothesis has occurred.

a.  in clinic for ALL subjects. Subject eligibility will be assessed by the Investigator  during Screening and primary diagnosis will be 
verified by the ESC prior to randomization; subjects meeting OHSA #1 criterion on Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) and who otherwise meet eligibility criteria may be randomized  via 
RTSM . 
b. A complete medical and medication history evaluation will be performed during screening.  
c. During the screening visit, subjects will receive thorough training on the OHQ disease instrument and will receive refresher training prior to completing th e OHQ during 
each study visit  (Visit 2 to 6) . Subjects should be rested prior to beginning the training.  
d. During Screening, the tilt -table test should be performed following at least 12 -hours of withdrawal from vasoactive medications. The tilt -table test s hould be performed 
at least 2 hours after meals and with an empty bladder.   
e.  
f. The vital sign measurements should be performed after the subject has rested sufficiently as determined by the appropriate si te staff . The BP and HR collected at  
10 minutes supine and seated from the orthostatic standing test can be used for safety vital signs assessment. V itals can be performed as part of the  mandated procedure s, 
if needed.  
g. ECGs are done in triplicate after the subject has been resting for at least 5 minutes in a seated or supine position before t he first reading, with each replicate separated by 
at least 1 minute.  
h. In women of childbearing potential only. First, urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) test will be performed and if positive, confirmation with serum bHCG test is required. The pregnancy test must be confirmed negative for a subject to be eligible for this study.

k. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment will be provided to the subject during the screening visit. Beginning approximately 72 to 24- hours before a subject 
conducts the  Day 1 (Visit 2), and before the Day 8 and Day 22 visits, subjects will put on the 24- hour blood pressure monitoring equipment and initiate the recording. 
Once the 24 -hour session is complete, subjects will remove and return the equipment to the research center during the next visit. During each 24 -hour session, the blood 
pressure monitoring device will be programmed to automatically measure blood pressure every 2 hours beginning at the top of t he hour. During each 24 -hour session, 
subjects should also maintain a log of their po sture at the time of each blood pressure measurement. Details regarding the ambulatory monitoring will be provided in a 
separate manual.  
l. Study medication will be ingested in the morning at approximately the same time of day with 8 ounces of water. The exa ct time and day of dosing will be recorded on 
the mornings of study visits. Subjects should be reminded to maintain an adequate fluid intake during their scheduled visits.  
m. The assessments or procedures will be performed within 24- hours prior to subject tak ing the study medication (pre -dose).  Following randomization and completion of 
study assessments, the subject will begin taking study medication on Day 2 in the morning.   
n. C-SSRS is to be completed following OHQ questionnaire from Visit 2 to Visit 6 . 
o. Follo w-up visit is only applicable for those subjects that do not proceed to Study 0170 and will be completed two weeks from the date of the last dose . 
p. The assessment should be performed at approximately (±2 hour) the same time of day on Day 1 (except Screening). Subjects shou ld abstain from eating for at least 
90mins prior to this assessment.   
q. Valsalva maneuver is to be performed for PAF subjects only i f no results are available within 24 months from the date of randomization.

While it is not known whether TD- 9855 will provide clinical efficacy, this study will provide 
a number of beneficial services to subjects. These include autonomic evaluations, 
neurohumoral evaluation, and information on new research developments in the field. Subjects will have access to routine autonomic follow up that may improve orthostatic 
symptoms. They will have symptom rating testing performed that may assist in educational 
planning.

To help ensure subject safety, subjects will be closely monitored during this study. Except for 
the Screening visit  (V1) which must be conducted in the clinic, s tudy visits can  be conducted 
in the Investigator ’s autonomic disorders clinic or appropriately qualified research facility , or 
remotely  using a telemedicine platform, under the supervision of qualified site personnel with 
help from a home health care provider .   
The schedule of procedures requires subjects to be closely monitored on a regular basis during the dosing and follow-up periods. If any subject should incur any unexpected and untoward event during the testing procedure, the Investigator is instructed to provide the 
subject immediate and appropriate  care as needed  including unscheduled in clinic or remote 
visits .  
A summary of known and potential risks to human subjects is provided in the IB in the 
Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigators.

3.1. Overview  
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, parallel -group, multicenter 
study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TD -9855 in subjects with primary 
autonomic failures (MSA, PD, or PAF) and symptomatic nOH after 4 weeks of treatment.  
Given the challenges presented by the COVID -19 pandemic the trial utilizes an operational 
design featuring the ability to conduct protocol required visits as either in clinic or remote 
visits.  Investigators must conduct all study visits for Study 0169 for a given subject  in a 
consistent manner for each subject to reduce the possibility of variability in data collection 
and reporting. Therefore, Investigators, in discussion with each individual subject at their site, will be required to elect to conduct all visits either in the clinic or remotely  for each 
individual subject at their site .  Regardless of which election an Investigator and subject 
make, the Screening visit (V1) must be conducted in clinic for all subjects. Tools and systems are available t o sites and subjects to support remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shipping of 
study medication and other study supplies, standardized HIPAA/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses).  
 
Due to the potential for resurgence of COVID-19 and its impact on both sites and subjects, the Sponsor will allow Investigators to request exceptions to the selected type of study visit 
modality due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 related circumstances. Approved exceptions will be recorded as COVID -19 related  protocol deviations.  
All sites are allowed at Investigator discretion to conduct either in clinic or remote unscheduled visit(s) for subject safety or unexpected subject medical needs outside of the 
regular visit schedule. In this case, unscheduled visits are not considered protocol deviations 
and the Investigator is not required to obtain pre-approval from the Sponsor. Data collected during these visits may include any protocol- specified assessments which will be captured in 
the clinical database.  
For subjects that have previously completed the Screening visit at the time regulatory and ethics approval for is received, sites must reconsent the subject using the most 
recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote study visits, if that visit modality is selected by the Investigator and the subject. For those subjects who are already randomized to study treatment and active in the study at the time 
regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and subject  
should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the Randomization 
Visit.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is defined as: 
• A sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg (diastolic) 
within 3 minutes of standing or tilted -up to ≥60o elevation from a supine position. 
• A score of at least a 4 on the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment Question #1 
The study consists of 3 periods: (i) 4- week screening, (ii) 4 -week randomized treatment, and 
(iii) 2 -week follow up. The schematic representation is as shown below: 
  
After signing the informed consent, the subject will enter a screening period of up to 4 weeks to confirm eligibility. At the screening visit, which must be performed in the clinic for all 
subjects, the subject will provide a comprehensive medical history of their disease and 
treatments. The subject’s disease will be characterized and documented by the Investigator. 
The subject will receive an assessment of their physical condition, including safety and 
laboratory evaluations and related aspects of their disease states according to the Schedule of 
Study Procedures ( Table 1). The presence of symptomatic nOH symptoms and reported 
sensation of dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out (OHSA#1) 
must be confirmed by the application of a tilt- table test. This tilt- table test serves 2 purposes: 
(i) determination of the systolic/diastolic BP (DBP) changes, and (ii) training the subjects to 
recognize the sensations associated with OHSA#1.  
Eligible subjects will undergo training of accurate scoring of their sensation of dizziness, lighthea dedness, feeling faint, or feeling like blacking out as outlined by the OHSA#1. 
Following the screening period, the subject will proceed to Visit 2 to further confirm the 
additional eligibility criteria prior to randomization. This includes the completion of the 
Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) in which a minimum score of 4 points in OHSA#1 is required. Subjects meeting all applicable inclusion criteria and none of the 
applicable exclusion criteria, including confirmation of relevant criteria by the independent 
Enrollment Steering Committee (ESC), will be randomized to receive either TD -9855 or 
matching placebo for the next 4 weeks.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Following randomization and completion of study assessments, the subject will receive a 
se of TD-9855 (or matching placebo) once daily (QD) for the remaining 
double - blind treatment period.  
Weekly assessments will be conducted as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures 
(Table 1). Refer to the footnotes in Schedule of Study Procedures for a description of all 
assessments.  Refer to Appendix 9 and the Study Reference Manual for detailed instructions for conducting subject assessments in clinic and remotely . These instructions have been 
provided to ensure the method and conduct of each assessment is consistent across sites and subjects for both in cl inic and remote visits.  
Discontinuation of subjects may occur at any time. Dose stopping criteria include meeting at least 1 of the following rules: 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
No dose reduction is permitted at any time.  
Safety assessments will include a physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs (body temperature, HR and BP), body weight, ECGs, safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), C-SSRS, and AEs. 
Safety will be periodically  reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee, see 
separate charter.  
Subjects will be requested to refrain from making any significant dietary changes throughout 
the duration of the study. Subjects should be reminded to maintain an adequate fluid i ntake 
during their scheduled visits. 
Subjects completing the 4 -week double- blind treatment period will be eligible to enroll and 
continue receiving study medication in Study 0170. The final study visit for those subjects 
who do not complete the 4-week double -blind treatment period or who choose not to continue 
into Study 0170 will be the follow-up visit (V7). This visit must be completed two weeks from the date of the last dose.

3.5. Minimization of Bias 
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Treatments will be assigned 
centrally using a randomization and t rial supply management (RTSM) system.  
All persons involved in this study, i.e. , physicians, nurses, participants, and site monitors, will 
remain blinded at all times, except in the event of a medical emergency as outlined in Section  3.5.1. 
3.5.1. Blinding  
TD-9855 and placebo tablets will be of the same shape, size, and color to ensure that the 
blind is maintained. Also, subjects who are randomized to receive placebo will receive the equivalent number of tablets as those randomized to receive TD-9855.  
A subject’s treatment assignment will only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is 
essential for the further clinical management o f the subject on this study. Unblinding at the 
study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. In case of an 
emergency, the Investigator  has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a 
subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first 
consideration in making such a determination. Any Investigator unblinding will be documented within the appropriate case report form ( CRF ) and will be captured in the RTSM 
system.  
Sponsor Drug Safety pe rsonnel may independently unblind cases for expedited reporting of 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). With these exceptions, sponsor 
personnel involved in the conduct of the study, data cleaning, or data analysis will remain 
blinded t o subject treatment assignments until the database has been locked for final analysis.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   3.5.2. Treatment Assignment  
Once the subject has been determined to be eligible to receive study treatment, the PI or their 
delegate will use the RTSM system to randomize the subject and dispense study medication  
accordingly . Except for cases of emergency unblinding as described above, investigational 
site staff will remain blinded to treatment assignments until all subjects have completed the study and the database has been locked.  
Further details regarding the randomization procedure and dose assignment will be outlined 
in the RTSM system manual.  
3.5.3. Enrollment Steering Committee  
The Investigator must obtain approval from the ESC prior to randomizing the subject in the 
study. The ESC is a committee of independent neurologists that will make a predetermination of the subject’s appropriateness for study inclusion by reviewing medical information  
provided by the site. The ESC will review  both the medical history to support the diagnosis 
(MSA, PD, or PAF), and confirm the presence of symptomatic nOH based on the results of the tilt- table  test. Review of the tilt- table  test results may include confirmation that the 
subject maintains a sustained drop in blood pressure to a level that is consistent with cerebral 
hypoperfusion. The ESC will consult with the Investigator to address any o utstanding 
questions. The ESC review is recommended to be completed within 48 hours and the 
Investigator will be informed in writing ( e.g., e-mail) of the decision. Following ESC 
approval of the subject, the Investigator will determine eligibility based up on the protocol 
Inclusion and Exclusion criteria for randomization.  
In cases where the ESC determines subject ineligibility based on tilt- table  test findings that 
are not consistent with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension, the decision will be 
accompanied by rationale. A dedicated charter has been implemented to address the mode of operations of the ESC to ensure the protection of the study integrity. The communication 
from the ESC, documenting review and approval of the subject, will serve as ESC 
documentation for inclusion into the study.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   4.3.2. Contraception for Mal e and Female Subjects  
All female subjects of childbearing potential and males who are able to father children must 
agree to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use a highly effective method of birth control 
during the study and for at least 30 days after the completion of study drug dosing.  A highly 
effective method of birth control is defined as one that results in a low failure rate (i.e., <1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  
Such methods include: 
• combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− oral 
− intravaginal 
− transdermal  
• progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation 
− oral 
− injectable  
− implantable  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)  
• bilateral tubal occlusion  
• vasectomized partner provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female 
trial participant of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success  
• sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated 
with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstin ence needs to be 
evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject.  
NOTE:  Birth control methods which may not be considered highly effective:
 
• progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action 
• male or female condom with or without spermicide

6.4. Description of Study Procedures  
Written informed consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol specific procedures. After providing full informed consent, subjects will undergo a medical screen to determine their eligibility for participation based on the criteria outlined in this protocol.  
The site should make every effort to perform procedures at the scheduled times, and 
information  should be recorded in the source documents and on the CRFs . All subject  
reported outcomes for subjects with PD should be completed in an ON state, and within 1-4 hours of taking the PD medications. 
Additional safety tests, such as vital signs (BP, HR , RR, and body temperature), physical 
exam ination s, ECGs, and laboratory safety assessments , may be obtained during the course 
of the study on the basis of newly available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring.  
6.4.1. Demographic and Baseline Assessments  
Demographic information to be collected will include: year of birth, sex, race, and ethnici ty. 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed at screening and on Day 1 prior to 
randomization. Subjects will only be eligible for enrollment into the study if they meet all the 
applicable inclusion and none of the applicable exclusion criteria.  
Each subject will be asked to provide relevant medical history (including medication history; 
see Section  6.4.10.3). 
6.4.2. Tilt-Table Test  
A tilt- table  test is used to evaluate the cause of unexplained fainting (syncope).  A tilt- table  
attempts to trigger signs and symptoms like  lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling faint, or 
feeling like blacking out while HR  and BP  are being monitored.  If the subject  has symptoms 
while in the upright position on the tilt- table , the part of the nervous system that controls BP  
and HR  suddenly lowers for a short time, less blood flows to the brain, and could possibly 

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   cause the subject to faint . The endpoint of tilt- table  testing is the reproduction of symptoms 
along with the characteristic circulatory pattern of  the indication mentioned above, namely 
the induction of reflex hypotension/bradycardia, orthostatic hypotension, postural orthostatic 
tachycardia syndrome, or psychogenic pseudosyncope. The tilt- table  test will be applied until 
a sustained reduction of BP of ≥20 mmHg  (systolic) or ≥10 mmHg  (diastolic) is observed in 
≤3 minutes of being tilted -up to ≥60o from a supine position, ideally between 60o to 65o. The 
tilt-table test should be performed following at least 12-hours of withdrawal from vasoactive medications. The tilt- table test  should be performed at least 2 hours after meals  and with an 
empty bladder . A single tilt- table  retest may be performed providing  the Investigator has 
concluded a technical problem or operational issue during the initial test impacted  the results . 
Under these circumstances, a follow-up tilt- table  test may be performed in order to 
appropriately evaluate the subject’s orthostasis.  The follow-up tilt- table  test should be 
performed at a minimum of one hour after the initial test, and at least 7  days prior to 
randomization. Assessments will be performed as specified in Schedule of Study Procedures (Table 1).   
6.4.3. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
The MoCA is a global cognitive screening test with favorable psychometric properties  that 
has been shown to be more sensitive to executive impa irment than the Mini- Mental State 
Examination. It screens 8 domains including: visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. Assessments will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Study Pr ocedures ( Table 1 ). An example of the 
instrument is provided in Appendix 2.  
6.4.4. Valsalva Maneuver 
The Valsalva maneuver is a breathing technique that can be used to help diagnose a problem with the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Changes in intrathoracic pressure produce 
autonomically modulated transient changes in HR and BP. The Valsalva maneuver will be 
performe d as specified in the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1 ) only for subjects with 
PAF to confirm diagnosis. 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
6.4.6. Efficacy Assessments  
6.4.6.1. Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire  
The Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) is a 2 -component scale made up of a 
6-item symptom assessment scale referred to as OHSA and a 4 -item daily activity scale 
referred to as the Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activities Scale (OHDAS ). The items are 
scored on an 11-point scale from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no symptoms/no interference and

6.4.6.2. Patient Global Impression of Change  
In the PGI -C scale, subject is asked to compare their current symptoms to their symptoms at 
study baseline (i.e., prior to randomization) on a 5- category  scale ranging from 1 ( much 
better ) to 5 (much worse).  Assessments will be performed as specified in the Schedule of 
Study Procedures ( Table 1).  An example of the instrument is provided in Appendix 2.

6.4.6.7. Incidence of Falls – Subject D iary 
Falls in subjects  with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are common and 
potentially catastrophic. They can lead to serious injuries including hip fractures or head 
trauma; furthermore, fear of falling can limit mobility and physical activ ity. Thus, incidence 
of subject- reported falls is  being captured in a diary. Assessments will be performed as 
specified in  the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1).  An example of the instrument is 
provided in Appendix 3.

6.4.10.1. Columbia -Suicide S everity Rating S cale  
The C -SSRS is a tool designed to systematically assess and track suicidal AEs  (suicidal 
behavior and suicidal ideation). The strength of this suicide classification system is in its 
ability to comprehensively identify suicidal events while limiting the over -identification of 
suicidal behavior. The C- SSRS Baseline /Screening  Version will be used at Visit 1 and the 
C-SSRS Since Last Visit Version will be used for subsequent visits. Assessments will be 
performed as specified in the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1 ). An example of the 
instrument is provided in Appendix 2. 
6.4.10.2. Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be reviewed and recorded from signing of the informed consent through 
the end of follow-up. Adverse events may be observed by the study personnel or 
spontaneously reported by the subject. 
All AEs  must be recorded in the subject’s CRF  and, if applicable, reported as described in 
Section  7. 
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of AEs . Any 
medications necessary for the treatment of an adverse event must be recorded in the subjects 
CRF.  Refer to Section  7. 
Except where described above, the Investigator may prescribe medications to provide 
adequate supportive care. However, the Investigator should use judgment to avoid medications that may conf ound the interpretation of this study. 
6.4.10.3. Medication and Medical History  
A complete medical history will be taken during the screening visit and will include evaluation visit for past and present cardiovascular, respiratory, GI , renal, hepatic, 
neurological, endocrine, lymphatic, hematologic, immunologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, genitourinary, substance abuse, surgical history, or any other diseases or disorders. Medical conditions will be recorded for two years prior to screening visit, along with the date of diagnosis, and any other relevant medical history that has an impact to the subject. 
Medical events or conditions that arise or worsen in severity or frequency after the signing of 
the informed consent will be recorded as an AE.  
All medications used d uring the 60 days prior to s creening will be recorded in the source 
records . The only exception is  drugs that were used to treat previous orthostatic hypotension; 
these will be recorded since the time of primary diagnosis.  
6.4.10.4. Physical Examination 
A full physical examination  at the screening visit will be performed by an appropriately 
qualified individual ( e.g., physician, nurse practitioner, physician’s assistant, or equivalent, 
under the supervision of a physician) and will include examination of the fol lowing: general 
appearance; skin; head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat; neck; cardiovascular system; respiratory 
system; abdomen/gastrointestinal (GI) system; extremities; lymphatic system [lymph nodes]; and nervous system).

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   Subsequent physical examinations, after the s creening visit on Visit 2  and Visit 6, per 
discretion of the Investigator, can be abbreviated and symptomatic, largely focused on 
evaluation of AEs, if any, and any abnormaliti es identified on the screening visit 
examination.  
6.4.10.5. Height  and Weight  
Height  (in cm) and weight (in kg) will be recorded as outlined in the Schedule of Study 
Procedures (Table 1 ). Reasonable efforts will be taken to ensure the measurements for weight 
occur at approximately the same time each visit using the same scale and with similar 
clothing. 
6.4.10.6. Vital Signs  
The HR, SBP and DBP , RR, and body temperature will be recorded according to the 
Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1).    
The vital sign measurements (BP and HR) should be performed after the subject has rested 
sufficiently as determined by the appropriate staff. Subject position, measurement device, and 
arm (left vs. right) should be kept consistent throughout the study. Blood pressure will be measured using a calibrated manual or automatic BP device.  
Heart rate will be recorded by palpation of the radial pulse over at least a 30 -second period or 
by the automated BP  device.  
The BP and HR collected at 10 minutes supine and seated from the  
can be used for safety vital sign assessment.  
Body temperature will be measured and reported in degrees Celsius. The method used to collect temperature can be either oral or tympanic but should be consistent throughout the subject’s participation.  
Any vit al sign outside the normal range may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Collection of additional vital sign measurements for routine safety monitoring at additional 
time points or study days may be performed at the discretion of the Investi gator, or upon 
request by the sponsor.  
6.4.10.7. Electrocardiogram s  
The 12- lead ECGs will be recorded in triplicate and separated by at least 1 minute for each 
replicate according to the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1) after the subject has been 
resting  at least 5 minutes in the seated or supine position  before the first reading. The total 
time to conduct ECGs ideally would not exceed 15 minutes. Actual time of the assessment 
must be recorded for each iteration.  The corrected QT interval using the Fridericia’s  formula  
(QTcF) will be used. The ECGs should be reviewed on the visit day at the site to allow for 
any appropriate action, if required.  
6.4.10.8. 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring 
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring equipment will be provided to the subject during the 
screening visit. Beginning approximately 72 to 24-hour s before a subject conducts Day 1 
(Visit 2), and before the Day 8 and Day 22 visits, subjects will put on the 24-hour blood 
pressure monitoring equipment and initiate the recording. Once the 24-hour session is 
complete , subjects will remove and return the equipment to the research center during the 
next visit.  During each 24-hour session, the BP  monitoring device will be programmed to

medication  dosing deta ils, will be provided to each subject. Subjects will be instructed to 
record daily  dosing through the end of the treatment period  (Appendix 5). Diary completion 
will be monitored for completeness  at each study visit after the diary is dispensed.  Subjects 
will be counseled on missed study medication  doses and missed diary entries. Compliance 
with the dosing regimen will be assessed by reconciliation of used and unused study 
medication.  
6.4.10.12. Unscheduled Visit  
All sites are allowed at Investigator discretion to conduct either in clinic or remote 
unscheduled visits for subject safety or unexpected subject medical needs outside of the 
regular visit schedule. In this case, unscheduled visits are not considered protocol deviations and the Investigator is not required to obtain pre-approval from the Sponsor. Data collected 
during these visits may include any protocol- specified assessments which will be captured in 
the clinical database.    
6.5. Concomitant Medications  
Subjects should not have changed dose, frequency or type of prescribed medication for 
orthostatic hypotension within 7 days prior to the randomization visit.  
 
  
 
  
 
Stable dosing regimen is defined as the same dosage and frequency on any given day. 
Subjects who are smokers will be recommended to either stop smoking (ciga rettes or 
cannabinoids in countries where cannabinoids are permissible ) at least 7 days before first 
dose or maintain a constant smoking habit during the entire course of the study.

6.8.1. Dose Stopping Rules  
Any subject meeting 1 or more of the following stopping criteria will be required to 
immediately discontinue dosing with study medication  and subsequently subject will be 
discontinued from participation in the study :  
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
6.8.2. Subject Discontinuation 
Any subject (or his or her legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to 
participate  in the study at any time without prejudice. The Investigator must withdraw from 
the study any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A subject’s participation in the study 
may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Investigator and in accordance with 
his or her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be completed . If a subject withdraws before completing the study, 
the reason for withdrawal is to be documented on the CRF. 
The sponsor will be notified of all subject withdrawals.  
Reasons for which the Investigator  may withdraw a subject from the study or a subject may 
choose to terminate participation before completion of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
• Adverse Event  
• Physician Decision  
• Pregnancy  
• Protocol Violation  
• Withdrawal by Subject  
• Other  
The subject may also discontinue from the study if the study is discontinued by the Sponsor. 
Subjects who discontinue study medication  early because of an adverse reaction should be 
encouraged to continue their participation in the follow- up safety assessments. If a subject 
fails to return for scheduled visits, a documented effort must be made to determine the 
reason.  
6.8.3. Subject Replacement  
Subjects will not be replaced.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   6.8.4. Study Discontinuation  
The sponsor reserves the right to discontinue this study at any time for any reason.   
Periodic review of unblinded safety data by an external independent data monitoring 
committee ( Section  8.8) may lead  to the board’s recommendation of pausing dosing or 
terminating the study.  In the event of premature study termination, best efforts to guarantee 
appropriate safety follow-up of subjects  who have already been enrolled will be made and 
institutional review boards ( IRBs ) and the regulatory authorities will be informed.  
6.9. Pregnancy  
TD-9855 has been shown to be non-genotoxic in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays 
(in vitro Ames and chromosomal aberration assays and in vivo micronucleus assay in rat). 
TD-9855 demonstrated effects on neonatal mortality and decreased rates of pup growth in the 
pre- and postnatal study in rats. Based on the NOAEL in reproductive-toxicology studies in 
preclinical species, there exists a greater than 100x margin between exposure in preclinical species at NOAEL vs. exposure in male and female subject s at 4 weeks post stopping 
administration of 10mg TD-9855 dose. Thus, application of pregnancy prevention measures for 1  month post last dose of TD-9855 is sufficient to address the risk of substantial drug 
exposure in semen or maternal circulation. 
To confirm the absence of pregnancy in female subjects of childbearing potential, urine beta 
human chorionic gonadotropin (bHCG) testing will be performed during specified visits, as listed in  the Schedule of Study Procedures ( Table 1). If the urine b HCG test is positive, a 
serum b HCG test must be performed.  The pregnancy test must be confirm ed negative for a 
subject to be eligible for this study unless the PI deems the test is falsely positive.   
If a subject becomes pregnant while taking TD-9855, or during the 1 month after the last dose 
of treatment,  the pregnancy must be report ed to the sponsor’s medical monitor (or designee) 
immediately (within 24-hours) by following the procedures for SAE reporting as outlined in 
Section  7.4.3. S tudy drug must be discontinued for any pregnant subject still on study drug 
treatment . Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal 
sequelae in the infant will be required.

7.1. Definitions 
The definitions below are based on International Council for Harmonization  (ICH) guideline 
E2A, “Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting.” 
7.1.1. Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject  or clinical trial subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product.  
• AEs may be new events . 
• AEs may be preexisting events that increase in frequency, severity, or  change in 
nature or seriousness during or as a consequence of participation in clinical studies. 
• AEs may be pre - or posttreatment complications that occur as a result of a 
protocol-mandated procedure (such as a biopsy). 
• AEs may be clinically significant c hanges from baseline in physical examination, 
laboratory tests, or other diagnostic investigation ( e.g., laboratory results, x- ray 
findings). 
• AEs may result from an overdose of the study medication .  
Whenever possible, the diagnosis (rather than a series of terms related to a diagnosis) should be recorded as the AE term.  
An AE does not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before signing an informed 
consent form that do not worsen 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (such as hospitalization for elective surgery or social and/or convenience admissions) 
• Overdose of either study medication  or concomitant medication without any signs 
or symptoms, unless the subject is hospitalized for observation 
Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date prior to the time the subject signed the informed consent form is considered to be preexisting and should be documented in the medical history CRF. 
Pregnancy is not an AE; however, if a female subject becomes pregnant during the conduct of 
the study, the sponsor will be notified according to the procedures for SAE reporting as outlined in Section  7.4.3. Follow-up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and 
any fetal or neonatal sequelae will be obtained and documented.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 70 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence occurring at 
any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening situation.  “Life  threatening” refers to a situation in which the 
subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existin g hospitalization  
Note: “Inpatient hospitalization” means the subject has been formally admitted to a hospital for medical reasons, for any length of time. This may or may not be overnight. It does not include presentation and care within an emergency 
department. A scheduled hospitalization for a preexisting condition that has not 
worsened during participation in the study does not meet this criterion. Preplanned hospitalizations for an elective medical/surgical procedure, 
scheduled treatments, or routine c heck -ups do not meet this criterion. 
Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization, it is an SAE. 
• Disability - A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received study 
medication  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life  
threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such events are as follows: 
− Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm 
− Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization 
− Development of drug dependency or drug abuse 
7.1.3. Additional Considerations for Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an AE  and not an AE in itself. Deaths of unknown cause 
for which the Investigator cannot identify a cause of death will be captured as death of unknown cause or death not otherwise specified. 
• All deaths, regardless of cause, must be reported for subjects if the death occurs while the subject is participating in the study.  
• “Occurring at any dose” does not imply that the subject is receiving study 
medication  at the time of the event; dosing may have been given as treatment 
cycles or interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE but may have 
contributed to the event.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.1.4. Adverse Event of Special Interest  
• At each study visit, the Investigator (or designee) will specifically query for any 
AESI s. The following events are considered AESIs for this study: 
− Supine hypertension 
− Cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, 
cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure)  
− Convulsion 
• All AESIs must be reported to Sponsor Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 24-hour s of awareness by the Investigator or his/h er designee.  
The AESI Report Form must be completed in accordance with the AESI Report Form 
Completion Guidelines. If all information on the AESI Report Form is not available at the time of the initial report, follow -up AESI reports will be completed and submitted.  
To report an AESI, complete and send the AESI Report Form to the following: 
Theravance Biopharma Clinical Safety  
 
  
For medical questions regarding an AESI, contact the medical monitor by telephone as follows:  
Medical Monitor Contact Information:  
   
  
  
7.2. Clinical Laboratory Abnormalities and Other Abnormal 
Assessments as Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events  
Abnormal laboratory findings (such as c hemistry , hematology, or urinalysis) or other 
abnormal assessments (such as ECGs, x- rays, or vital signs) that are associated with signs 
and/or symptoms or are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the Investigator 
must be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the definition of an AE  (or SAE ), as described 
in Section  7.1.1 (Adverse Event) and Section  7.1.2  (Serious Adverse Event). 
If there are any AE questions, the Investigator  is encouraged to contact the sponsor to 
discuss.  
7.3. Assessment of Adver se Events  
All AEs will be assessed by the Investigator and recorded in the CRF , including the dates of 
onset and resolution, severity, relationship to study medication , outcome, and action taken 
with study medication .

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 72 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   7.3.1. Severity  
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in 
mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe nausea).  This is not the same as 
“serious,” wh ich is based on subject /event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The severity of AEs will be 
assessed according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  The AE is noticeable to the s ubject  and/or the Investigator but does not 
interfere with routine activity.  
• Moderate:  The AE interferes with routine activity but responds to symptomatic 
therapy or rest.  
• Severe:  The AE significantly limits the subject’s  ability to perform routine 
activities despite symptomatic therapy.  
7.3.2. Causal Relationship to Study Medication  
The Investigator ’s assessment of causality is based on clinical judgment regarding the 
reasonable possibility that the study medication  caused the event and may include 
consideration of some or all of the following factors: 
• Possible alternative causes of the AE, including the disease under treatment, comorbid conditions, other medications , and environmental factors. 
• The temporal association between drug exposure and onset of the AE.  
• Whether the clinical or laboratory manifestations of the AE are consistent with 
known actions or toxicity of the study medication . 
• Whether the AE resolved or improved with decreasing the dose or stopping the study medication  (“de- challenge”) or recurred or worsened upon re-exposure to 
the study medication  (“re-challenge”).  
The causal relationship between the study medication  and the AE will be described using one 
of the following categories: 
• Not Related:  Evidence exists that the AE  has an etiology other than the study 
medication  (such as a preexisting condition, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant medication).  
• Related:  A temporal relationship exists between the event onset and 
administration of the study medication . It cannot be readily explained by the 
subject’s clinical state or concomitant therapies and appears with some degree of 
certainty to be related based on the known therapeutic and pharmacologic actions 
of the drug. In case of cessation or reduction of the dose, the event abates or resolves and reappears upon re- challenge. It should be emphasized that ineffective 
treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of AE  
reporting.

7.4.1. Adverse E vent Reporting  
Timely, accurate, an d complete reporting and analysis of safety information from clinical 
trials is crucial for the protection of subjects  and is mandated by regulatory agencies.  The 
sponsor has established standard operating procedures (SOPs) in compliance with regulatory 
requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safety information. All clinical 
trials sponsored by Theravance Biopharma will be conducted in accordance with these 
procedures. 
7.4.2. Adverse E vent and Serious A dverse E vent Recording  
All AEs, regardless o f seriousness, severity, or causal relationship to study medication, will 
be recorded from signing informed consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact 
in the case of a follow -up telephone call). The AEs will be recorded on the AE page of the 
CRF. The SAEs, regardless of relationship to study medication  will be recorded from signing 
informed consent through the last study visit (or last subject contact in the case of a follow-up telephone call).  Additionally, Investigator s may report SAEs assessed as related to study 
medication  through 30 days following the last study visit (or last subject contact in the case of 
a follow-up telephone call). All SAEs will be recorded on both the SAE /AESI  Report Form 
and the AE page of the CRF and should include the following:  
Description of event:  
• Signs and symptoms due to a common etiology should be reported as a single diagnosis; for example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion would be reported as “upper respiratory infection.”  
• A diagnosis or description must be as specific and as complete as possible (e.g., “lower extremity edema” instead of “edema”).  
• Hospitalization or surgical procedures should not be used as AE  terms ( e.g., if a 
subject was hospitalized for cholecystectomy due to cholecystitis, the AE  term 
should be recorded as cholecystitis, and not as the procedure, cholecystectomy).  
• “Death” should not be used as an AE  term unless the cause of death is unknown. 
For events with a fatal outcome, the cause of death should be the AE  term ( e.g., if 
a subject died of an acute myocardial infarction, the AE  term should be recorded 
as “Myocardial Infarction” and the event outcome as fatal).    
Relationship to study medication : The Investigator  will make an assessment of the causal 
relationship of the study medication  to the AE using the guidelines in Section  7.3.2.  
Severity: The severity of the AE will be assessed using the g uidelines in Section  7.3.1 . 
Outcome: The outcome of AEs will be recorded.  
Therapeutic measures: Measures taken for the treatment or management of the AEs will be 
recorded.

Timeline  
All SAEs and AESIs must be reported to Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance within 
24-hour s of the time the Investigator or his/her designee becomes aware that an SAE or AESI 
has occurred, whether or not the event is considered to be related to study medication . If the 
initial SAE  or AESI  is reported by telephone, a written report signed by the Investigator must 
be submitted within 24-hour s.  
The SAE /AESI Report Form must be completed in accordance with the SAE /AESI  Report 
Form Completion Guidelines. If all information on the SAE /AESI  Report Form is not 
available at the time of the initial report, follow -up SAE or AESI questionnaire s will be 
completed an d submitted.  
To report an SAE or AESI , complete and send the SAE/AESI  Report Form to the following: 
Theravance Biopharma Clinical Safety  
  
  
For medical questions regarding an SAE or AESI , contact the medical monitor by telephone 
as follows: 
Medical Monitor Contact Information:   
  
  
  
For fatal or life -threatening events, also fax copies of hospital case reports, autopsy reports, 
and other documents when requested. Additional information may be requested from the Investigator to ensure the timely completion of accurate safety reports.  
An SAE may qualify for reporting to regulatory authorities if the SAE is possibly attributable 
to the study medication  and is unexpected/unlisted based on the current TD -9855 IB. In this 
case, all Investigators will receive notification of the event. The Investigator  is responsible 
for notifying the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee and documenting the notification, as required by local regulatory authorities and in accordance with the local institutional policy.  
7.5. Adverse Event Follow -up 
A subject experiencing an AE , AESI , or SAE will be followed by the Investigator  or his/her 
trained delegate(s) through the follow-up visit or until the Investigator and/or the sponsor has determined that the AE , AESI , or SAE has resolved or a stable clinical  endpoint is reached, 
whichever is longer. The sponsor may request follow-up of certain AEs  until resolution and 
documentation of assessments made during this period. 
The Investigator must take all therapeutic measures necessary for resolution of an AE. An y 
medications necessary for treatment of the AE must be recorded in the concomitant 
medication section of the CRF .

8.1. General Considerations  
All data for each subject will be listed as collected. All statistical summaries and analys es 
will be performed using  
Continuous data will be summarized using an 8-point descriptive summary (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, interquartile range [25% quartile, 75% quartile], minimum, and 
maximum) unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) or table shell. Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages.  
For analysis, Day 1 is defined as the day of the first study medication  dose. The preceding 
day is Day –1. 
Baseline is the last assessment (scheduled or unscheduled) obtained before start of study 
medication  dosing, unless otherwise specified in the SAP. Baseline for endpoints that have 
more than one component is calculated from the individual component baselines, whether or 
not they were assessed during the same visit.  
Any changes to the data summaries and analyses outlined in this section will be described in the applicable SAP. Any changes to the definition of the endpoints will also be included in a protocol amendment. 
8.2. Sample Size and Power  
A total of approximately  will be randomized in a  
 
   
The primary  analysis will occur when all subjects  in the Full  analysis set  (FAS)  have 
completed the primary  endpoint assessment (OHSA#1 at Week  4) and the database has been 
cleaned and locked . A total sample size of  will have an overall power of 90% to 
detect a treatment difference of 1. 5 in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 
OHSA#1, assuming a common standard deviation of 3.0 for both treatment groups at a 
2-sided alpha level of 0.05. 
Assuming a 10% dropout rate by Week  4, it is anticipated that the study will randomize 
approximately   in order to achieve  in the FAS .

Predefined subgroups will include, stratification stratum (i.e. , disease type) , gender , and 
smoking status. Additional subgroups may be predefined in the SAP. 
8.3.2. Major Protocol Analysis Deviations 
The following protocol deviations are defined as major and would be considered to have an 
impact on the analysis of efficacy data: 
  
  
 
  
Additional criteria may be specified in the SAP.  
8.4. General Analyses  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will be documented in the SAP. Additional statistical analyses other tha n those described in 
this section may be performed if deemed appropriate.  
8.4.1. Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, body mass index, and other medical hist ory will be summarized.  
8.4.2. Medical History  
Summary of medical history will be provided. 
8.5. Analysis of Efficacy  
8.5.1. Efficacy E ndpoints  
The primary study endpoint is: 
• Change from baseline in OHSA#1  (dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or 
feeling like black ing out) at Week  4 
The secondary endpoints are: 
• Change from baseline in OHSA composite score in Week s 1 to 4 
• Change from baseline in OHDAS composite score in Week s 1 to 4 
• PGI-C at Week  4 
• Incidence of falls

8.5.1.1. Primary Efficacy Evaluation 
The primary efficacy evaluation is the change from baseline of OHSA #1 at Week  4. Baseline 
is defined as Day 1 pre- dose measurement. Mixed model for repeated measures ( MMRM) 
will be used to compa re treatment differences. The model will include fixed effect class terms 
of treatment, baseline disease type (MSA, PD, PAF), week, and continuous covariate of 
baseline OHSA #1 score, a random subject effect, with an unstructured covariance structure 
using the FAS. If the model doesn’t converge, compound symmetry or other covariance 
structures will be used as alternative covariance structure.  
Least -square means and 95% confidence intervals on the differences between TD -9855 and 
placebo will be calculated and presented.  
Missing data in the MM RM analysis is assumed as missing at random ( MAR ) and will not be 
imputed for the analysis of the primary endpoint. S ensitivity analys es of the primary endpoint 
will be conducted using multiple imputation.  
The primary analysis will be repeated on a set of prespecified  subgroups and presented in 
graphical format .

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   8.5.1.2. Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Evaluations 
The secondary efficacy endpoints involving assessment of change from baseline, such as 
OHSA composite score and OHDAS  composite score , will be analyzed in a similar fashion 
as the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in OHSA#1.   
The PGI -C will be  summarized as number and percentage for subjects with ‘no change or 
better’ and ‘worse than no change’ at Week  4. Incidence of falls will be summarized as 
number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 fall in Week  4. The PGI- C and incidence of 
falls w ill be tested using Cochran- Mantel Haenzel chi -square test  stratified by disease type at 
baseline. 
8.5.2. Multiplicity Adjustment  
If the treatment effect of the primary efficacy endpoint has been demonstrated  at a 2-sided 
statistical significance level of 5% , secondary efficacy endpoints ( Section  8.5.1) will be tested 
using the same statistical significance level.  The secondary endpoints will be tested 
sequentially via a prospectively defined order  to be described in the SAP, until a failure to 
reject the null hypothesis occurs.  No statistical significance will be claimed after a failure to 
reject the null hypothesis has occurred. 
For all supportive analyses including sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint 
and exploratory endpoints, nominal p-values and 95% confidence intervals with no adjustment for multiplicity  will be presented . 
8.5.3.  
 
  
8.5.4.  
 
8.6. Safety Analyses  
Safety data, including C- SSRS, will be summarized by treatment received. Summaries will 
be provided by nominal visit and time point or for the entire treatment period, as appropriate 
for the type of data. Quantitative data collected at unscheduled times will be listed but will 
not be included in summaries. Categorical data collected at unscheduled  times ( e.g., ECG 
finding categories) will not be included in summaries by time point but will be included in summaries of findings during the entire treatment period.  
Safety anal yses will be performed using the safety analysis set.   Unless specified otherwise 
there will be no imputation of missing data  in safety summaries . Subjects without post 
baseline measurement (e.g. ECG or vital signs ) for a given  time point will be excluded from 
the summary statistic  (e.g., denominator of the summary statistic)  for that time point.

This study will be conducted in compliance with all applicable regulations.  
9.1. Principal Investigator Responsibilities  
Before beginning the study, the PI at each site must provide to the sponsor or its designee 
either a f ully executed and signed Form FDA 1572 ( for US sites) or the equivalent 
information on the study- specific form . If applicable, a “ Disclosure: Financial Interests and 
Arrangements of Clinical Investigators” form  (Form FDA 3455; Financial Disclosure Form ) 
should also be provided. For applicable studies, F inancial D isclosure Forms must also be 
completed for all sub-investigators who will be directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects in this study. (A sub- investigator is defined in ICH E6 as any 
individual member of the clinical study team designated and supervised by the investigator at 
a study site to perform critical study -related procedures and/or to make important 
study- related decisions [ e.g., associates, residents, research fellows , resear ch staff designed as 
Clinical Outcome Assessment ( COA) raters ].) 
The PI will ensure the following: 
• He or she will conduct the study in accordance with the relevant, current protocol 
and will only make changes in a protocol after notifying the sponsor, except when necessary to protect the safety, rights, or welfare of subjects.  
• He or she will personally conduct or supervise the study, including oversight of the home health provider. 
• He or she will inform any potential subjects, or any persons used as controls, that the drugs are being used for investigational purposes and he or she will ensure that 
the applicable local and international regulatory requirements relating to obtaining 
informed consent at that site are met, for example in the US , compliance with 
Chapter  21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) Part  50 and IRB review and 
approval in 21 CFR  56 is  required and outside of the US, compliance with ICH E6 
and/or local regulatory requirements is required .  
• He or she will report to the sponsor adverse experiences that occur in the course of the investigation in accordance with applicable local and international harmonized 
regulatory requirements, for example in the US , 21 CFR  312.64 is required and 
outside of the US, compliance with ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements 
is required . 
• He or she has read and understands the information in the TD -9855 IB, including 
potential risks and side effects of the drug. 
• His or her staff and all persons who assist in the conduct of the study are informed 
about their obligations in meeting the above commitments . 
• He or she will ensure that adequate and accurate records in accordance with local 
and international regulatory requi rements, and to make those records available for 
inspection, for example in the US , in accordance with 21  CFR  312.62 and 
21 CFR  312.68 and outside of the US, compliance with ICH E6 and/or local 
regulatory requirements is required.

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   • He or she will ensure t hat the IRB/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC) complies 
with the local and international regulatory requirements (for example in the US,  
compliance with  21 CFR  56 is required and outside of the US, compliance with 
ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements is required ), and other applicable 
regulations, and conducts initial and ongoing reviews and approvals of the study. 
He or she will also ensure that any change in research activity and all problems involving risks to human subjects or others are reported to the IRB/IEC. 
Additionally, he or she will not make any changes in the research without 
IRB/IEC approval, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to human subjects. 
• He or she agrees to comply with all other local and internationa l regulatory 
requirements regarding the obligations of clinical Investigators and all other pertinent requirements, for example, in the US, 21 CFR  312, and outside of the 
US, ICH E6 and/or local regulatory requirements.  
9.2. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
Before beginning study- specific research, the Investigator will obtain written confirmation 
that the IRB, IEC, or Research Ethics Board (REB) is properly constituted and compliant with ICH and Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) requirements, applicable laws, and local 
regulations. A copy of the confirmation from the IRB/IEC/REB will be provided to the 
sponsor or its designee. The protocol, informed consent form (ICF), IB, and any other 
appropriate written information provided to the subjects that the IRB/IEC/REB may require to fulfill its responsibilities will be submitted to the IRB/IEC/REB in advance of the study. 
The sponsor or its designee must approve the ICF and all subject recruitment materials before 
they are submitted to  the IRB/IEC/REB. The study will not proceed until the Investigator has 
been notified by the sponsor that regulatory agency approval of the clinical trial 
(or acknowledgement of the notification if applicable) has been received and appropriate 
documents from the IRB/IEC/REB confirming unconditional approval of the protocol and the ICF are obtained by the Investigator and copies are received by the sponsor or its designee. 
If possible, the approval document should refer to the study by study protocol title and the 
sponsor study number, identify the documents reviewed, and include the date of the review and approval. The written approval of the IRB/IEC/REB will be retained as part of the study 
file. The study may proceed before approval of consent forms and other study documents 
translated to a language other than the native language of the clinical site, provided that written IRB/IEC/REB approval of the translated documents is obtained before they are used. Any amendments to the protocol should be reviewed promptly.  
The Investigator must provide the appropriate periodic reports on the progress of the study to 
the IRB/IEC/REB and the sponsor in accordance with local IRB/IEC/REB requirements and applicable governmental regulations, whichever is strictest.  
9.3. Informe d Consent  
A properly written and executed ICF, in compliance with ICH E6 (GCP Guideline, 
Section  4.8), 21 CFR  50, and other applicable local regulations, will be obtained for each 
subject before enrollment of the subject into the study. The Investigator wi ll prepare the ICF 
or revise the template ICF and provide the documents to the sponsor (or designee) for approval before submission to the IRB/IEC/REB. The sponsor and the IRB/IEC/REB must approve the documents before they are implemented.  

Protocol 0169,  Version 1.0, 05AUG2020 
TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 85 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   The Investigator will provide copies of the signed ICF to each subject (or the subject’s legally 
authorized representative) and will maintain the original in the subject’s record file.  
9.4. Data Recording and Quality Assurance  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used. 
A CRF (approved by the sponsor) is required and should be completed (in English) for each 
randomized subject. The Investigator has  ultimate responsibility for the accuracy, 
authenticity, completeness, and timely collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms. The Investigator must review and sign the CRFs to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are correct.  
Electronic data capture (EDC) technology will be used for this study. All clinical information requested in this protocol will be recorded on the electronic CRFs  approved by the sponsor, 
or via other data collection methods, e.g. , electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOA), 
electronic laboratory data transfer. Study site personnel will enter (in English) study data into the CRFs for each subject that is screened . Training on systems used by site personnel (e.g. 
EDC, eCOA) or study subjects (e.g. eCOA) will be completed and documented before access to the EDC system is given.  
In the event of a CRF data change ( e.g., correction of an error or addition of new 
information), corrections will be made to the CRF. Corrections to the CRFs, including the reason for change, will be automatically documented through the EDC system’s audit trail. 
The Investigator is responsible for reviewing all CRFs, verifying them for accuracy, and 
approving them via an electronic signature. The Investigator is designated as the signatory 
coordinating Investigator. An electronic copy of the CRF casebooks and eCOA s will be sent to the site for retention 
with other study documents after full completion of the study, i.e., after database lock.  
The Investigator is responsible for maintaining accurate, authentic, complete, and up- to-date 
records for each subject. The Investigator is also responsible for ensuring the availability of 
any original source documentation relat ed to the study (including any films, tracings, 
computer discs, tapes, and worksheets). In most cases the source is the subject’s medical record. Data collected on the CRFs must match the source documents.  
In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document 
should be available at the Investigator ’s site and clearly identify those data that will be 
recorded in the CRF and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 
9.5. Document Retention  
Until otherwise notified by the sponsor , an investigative site must retain in a controlled 
manner all study documents required by the sponsor and by the applicable regulations. The 
investigative site must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively permit evaluation of 
the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced, including paper copies of study 
records ( e.g., subject charts) and any original source documents that are electroni c, as 
required by applicable regulations.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 86 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   The Investigator must consult the sponsor representative before disposal of any study records 
and must notify the sponsor of any change in the location or disposition of the study files. 
If an Investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of 
keeping the study documents, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the 
responsibility. The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new 
custodian and must approve this transfer of responsibility. 
9.6. Confidentiality  
The Investigator or designee must explain to each subject, before enrollment into the study, 
that, for evaluation of study results, the subject’s confidential medical informatio n obtained 
during the study may be shared with the study sponsor, the study sponsor’s affiliated 
companies, the study sponsor’s designated service providers, regulatory agencies, and the IRB or IEC. The Investigator (or designee) is responsible for obtaining written permission to 
use confidential medical information in accordance with country- specific regulations (such as 
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the US ) from each subject or, if 
appropriate, the subject’s legally authorized representative. If permission to use confidential medical information is withdrawn, the Investigator  is responsible for documenting that no 
further data from the subject will be collected.  
Subject medical information obtained during this study is confidential, and disclosure to unauthorized third parties is prohibited. The pertinent sections of data protection laws will be 
complied with in full. Study records containing subject information will only be identified by 
the subject identification number, subject initials, date of birth, and study number, and not by the subject’s full name, except the subject consent form, which is archived at the study center only. The subject’s name will not be used in any public report of the study. 
During the course of the study, a confidential subject identification list will be maintained by 
the Investigator and archived at the investigative site.  
Before and during the conduct of the study, no study- related details may be disclosed, 
i.e., placed on the internet, published, or otherwise publicized, or provided to a third party 
without prior written permission from the sponsor. The policy for publication of data after completion of the study is described in Section  9.9 (Publication). 
9.7. Access to Data and Documents  
Upon receipt of the subject’s permission, medical information may be given to his or her personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for his or her welfare. 
Study data recorded on the CRFs must be verifiable to the source data. All original 
recordings, laboratory reports, and subject records generated by this study must be available to the sponsor , repres entatives of the sponsor, the IRB/IEC/REB, and applicable regulatory 
authorities, and they may be used for submission to regulatory authorities. In addition, all source data should be attributable (signed and dated), consistent with local medical practice. The Investigator must therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects 
(or their legally authorized representatives) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 87 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   9.8. Quality Control: Study Monitoring and Auditing  
Qualified individuals designated by the sponsor will monitor all aspects of the study 
according to GCP and SOPs for compliance with applicable government regulations. The Investi gator  agrees to allow these monitors direct access to the clinical data and supplies, 
dispensing, and storage areas and, if requested, agrees to assist the monitors. The Investigator and staff are responsible for being present or available for consultation during routinely scheduled site visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees. 
Members of the sponsor’s GCP Quality Assurance Department or designees may conduct an 
audit of a clinical site at any time during or after completion of the study. The Inves tigator  
will be informed if an audit is to take place and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Inspections and audits are typically carried out during the clinical and reporting phases of this 
study to ensure that the study is conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, written SOPs, and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. 
Representatives of the FDA or other regulatory agencies , including IRB/IEC representatives 
may also conduct an audit of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the Investigator 
should notify the sponsor immediately. The Investigator will ensure that the auditors have 
access to the clinical supplies, study site facilities, laboratory and all data (including original 
source documentation), and all study files are available, if requested.  
Noncompliance with the protocol, ICH, GCP, or local regulatory requirements by an Investigator, institution, institution staff, or representatives of the sponsor will lead to prompt 
action by the sponsor to secure compliance. Continued noncompliance may result in 
termination of the Investigator ’s involvement in the study. The IRB/IEC/REB and relevant 
regulatory authority will be informed. 
9.9. Publication  
The sponsor recognizes the importance of communicating medical study data and therefore encourages their publication in reputable scientific journals and presentation at seminars or 
conferences. The sponsor will retain the ownership of the data collected in this study. The Investigator will provide any proposed manuscript or abstract to the sponsor before submission for publication or presentation of any results or data obtained in this study. 
Additional details of the processes of producing and reviewing reports, manuscripts, and 
presentations ba sed on the data from this study will be described in the Clinical Study 
Agreement between the sponsor and the Investigator .

 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   APPENDIX 9. OVERVIEW OF DECENTRALIZATION PLAN  
This appendix provides information for those sites who choose to conduct remote study visits 
for at least one of their subjects .  Detailed instructions for the conduct of both in clinic and 
remote study visits can be found in the Study Procedures Manual, which must be used in conjunction with the protocol. 
The Principal Investigator retains accountability for all data collected and processed for each 
study subject either via in  clinic or remote visits.   Procedures to protect subject safety , subject 
privacy,  and data integrity will be followed by all personnel (clinic and home health personnel) involved in study conduct. 
 
Rationale for Decentralized Platform:   
Considering the frailty of the sy mptomatic  nOH subject  population, the risk of future 
exposure to COVID -19 via  in clinic  visits, the unpredictable duration of the pandemic, 
and the potential for additional waves of the COVID -19 pandemic, the study will utilize an 
operational design featuring the ability for sites to conduct protocol required visits as either in clinic or remote visits.    
 
Selection of Visit  Modality:   
The Screening visit for all subjects must be conducted in  clinic,  regardless of which visit 
modality selection an Investiga tor and subject make.     
All sites  must conduct all study visits for Study 0169 for a given subject in a consistent 
manner to reduce the possibility of variability in data collection and reporting. Therefore,  
Investigators, in discussion with each individual subject at their site,  will be  required  to elect  
to conduct all visits either in the clinic, or remotely.    
Tools and systems are available to sites and subjects to support remote visits (e.g., direct to subject shipping of study medication and other study supplies, standardized HIPAA/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform, in -home health nurses).   
For those sites who opt to use remote visits (the decentralized platform) for study conduct, all required regulatory and ethics committee or IRB approvals wi ll be obtained before utilization 
of remote study visits under the decentralized platform.    
Sites will use the most recent approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain 
subject consent for remote study visits.
 
Due to the potential for resurgenc e of COVID -19 and its impact on both sites and subjects, 
the Sponsor will allow Investigators to request exceptions to the selected typed of study visit modality due to COVID-19 or COVID-19 related circumstances.  Approved exceptions will be recorded as CO VID-19 related protocol deviations.

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 141 of 143

Before a change in visit type from  in clinic  to remote is made, the Investigator will submit an 
exemption  request  to the Sponsor via the established  process.  Theravance (or their designee) 
will review and respond to these exemption requests as per established processes and 
timelines.   Requests for and approval of exemptions in visit modality will be documented and 
retained in study records at the Investigator site.  
Once an Investigator  and subject have elected a visit type (in clinic  or remote) the expectation 
is for all post- Screening visits for that  subject  to be conducted via the same modality, except 
as described above.   
For subjects that have previously completed the Screening visit at the time regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, sites must reconsent the subject using the most 
recently approved version of the Informed Consent Form to obtain subject consent for remote 
study visits, if that visit modality is selected by the Investigator and the subject. For those 
subjects who are already randomized to study treatment and active in the study at the time 
regulatory and ethics approval for  is received, the Investigator  and subject  
should continue the remaining study visits in the same visit modality  as the Randomization 
Visit.  
Conduct of the Study and the Decentralized Platform:  
All sites will follow the protocol Schedule o f Procedures (see Table 1 of the protocol) for 
study visit scheduling and protocol required procedures (either in clinic or remote).   Refer to 
the Study Procedures Manual for detailed instructions for conducting subject assessments in clinic and remotely.  These instructions have been provided to ensure the method and conduct 
of each assessment is consistent across sites and subjects for both in  clinic and remote visits.  
 
Training and m echanisms will be available to sites and subjects to support remote visits.   
Sites will continue to follow their established processes and procedures for the conduct of in-clinic  study visits.   
Study operations support for  remote visits:  
 
Tools and systems are provided by the Sponsor and are available to sites and subjects to support remote visits:
 
• A courier service has been engaged to ship investigational study drug and other 
study supplies to the subject (or designee).

TD-9855 (ampreloxetine) Page 142 of 143 
 
 Confidential – Property of Theravance Biopharma, Inc.   • A standardized HIPA A/GDPR compliant telemedicine platform will be provided 
so that site personnel can participate in remote visits that are conducted in the 
subject’s home (or designated location), utilizing Home Health Providers.  
• A Home Health Provider (H HP) service has been employed.     
• Medically qualified and trained HHP staff  employed  will visit the subject’s home 
(or designated location) and will work with  Site Staff (SS) to conduct each remote 
study visit from the privacy of the subject’s home or designated location (such as a caregiver’s home).    
• During these remote visits, in coordination with Site Staff, the HHPs  will use the 
Rater Station to facilitate collection of  patient  reported outcomes, will collect 
blood samples for safety labs and PK testing, will collect ECGs, and will measure 
the subject’s vital signs.  
• All data collected during the remote visits will be transferred to the Investigator 
and the study site via established processes  (either electronically or on paper).  
Data signifying where t he visit was conducted (in clinic or remote), how the data were 
collected, and who collected data remotely will be recorded in subject source documents and 
in the clinical study database.  
A Home Health Provider Delegation Log will be used to record the nam es of HHP 
professionals who assist Site Staff with the conduct of the remote visits.  This separate 
delegation log will distinguish between those individuals who are part of the site staff 
(recorded on Site Delegation Log) and those who are employed by the HH Provider.   
Logistics Arrangements for Remote Visits:  
For remote study visits, the home health personnel conducting the visit will be notified by the 
clinic -based study staff of each upcoming scheduled visit for the study subject(s).  The clinic -
based staff will coordinate with the home health personnel to ensure access to all necessary 
subject source documents, required equipment, and procedural instructions to complete the 
remote assessment.  
Clinic -based staff will participate in the remote study visit(s) via the established telemedicine 
platform available for the study.    
Home health personnel will transfer the source documents completed during the remote visit to the Investigator’s site via established processes .  Home health personnel will transfer  via 
established secure means the data collected in electronic format to the appropriate data repository for inclusion in the clinical database. 
Data collected in paper format (subject diaries and any handwritten source notes) will be 
retrieved by HHP during the remote visit and will be returned to the Investigator’s site.   
Appropriate technical support and training will be provided to  facilitate  remote conduct of 
required study assessments.    
Laboratory samples collected by home health personnel during the remote visit will be 
prepared for shipment to designated laboratories following established collection and shipping procedures.

In closing, the tools, mechanisms, and processes put into place as part of the Decentralized 
Platform support site s and subjects who choose remote visits.  Further, they protect subject 
safety, privacy, and consistency in data collection and reporting.  In the event of future 
resurgences of the COVID -19 pandemic, these tools, mechanisms, and processes will be  
availabl e to sites and subjects who have selected the in clinic visit modality.

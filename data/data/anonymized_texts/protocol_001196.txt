1. SYNOPSIS  
 
Investigational Drug Product:  elamipretide (MTP -131) 
Active Ingredient:  elamipretide (MTP -131) 
Study Title:  An Open -Label, Phase 1 Clinical Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability 
of Subcutaneous Elamipretide in Subjects with Intermediate Age -Related 
Macular Degeneration  
Study Number:  SPIAM -101 
Study Phase:  Phase 1  
Study Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability  of subcutaneous (SC) injections of 
elamipretide in subjects with intermediate age -related macular 
degeneration  (AMD)  
The secondary objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the feasibility of administration of SC injections of 
elamipretide in subjects with intermediate  AMD  
• To evaluate the changes from baseline in physical/ophthalmic 
examinations  
Study Design:  This is an open -label, Phase 1 single -center study in approximately 40 
evaluable subjects who have 1 eye with intermediate AMD, including a high - 
risk drusen without geographic atrophy (GA) cohort and a noncentral GA 
cohort.  
Cohort 1: High -risk drusen is defined as the presence of at least 1 large  
(≥ 125 μm) druse or multiple medium -size (between 63 and 124 μm) drusen.  
Cohort 2: Noncentral GA is defined as evidence of GA with cumulative area  
≥1.27 mm2 (approximately 0.5 disc area [DA]) by fund us autofluorescence 
(FAF), which spares the fovea (defined as retinal pigment epithelium and 
outer retina intact by spectral domain -optical coherence tomography [SD - 
OCT]).  
The study eye of eligible subjects must fall into one of the two cohorts, as 
defined above, cannot have choroidal neovascular (CNV) AMD or advanced 
central GA, and may not have previously received antiangiogenic therapies (in 
addition to meeting other spec ified inclusion/exclusion criteria). The AMD 
disease status of the fellow eye is not restricted: the fellow eye may have 
intermediate AMD with high -risk drusen, advanced central GA, or CNV 
AMD, and the fellow eye is allowed to receive antiangiogenic therap ies. 
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before the 
Screening visit.  
The screening examination will be performed no more than 14 days before the 
Baseline visit. Data to be collected from the screening examination will 
include signif icant and/or ongoing medical and ocular history, vital sign 
measurements, physical examination, routine blood samples for hematology, 
chemistry, and urinalysis, ECG, manifest refraction, measurement of  
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the Early Tr eatment Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale completed twice, intraocular pressure 
measurement, slit -lamp examination, dilated fundus examination, fundus 
photography, spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD -OCT), FAF, 
fluorescein angiography*,  best-corrected low -luminance (LL) visual acuity 
completed twice, mesopic microperimetry, dark adaptometry, and Low - 
Luminance Questionnaire.  Women of childbearing potential will have a 
serum pregnancy test.  *Fluorescein angiography assessments done as

 standard of care and completed within 90 days prior to dosing are allowed to 
be used for screening purposes.  
After the screening examination, relevant data will be reviewed by the PI or 
designee to confirm study eligibility. Eligible subjects will return for the 
Baseline (Day 0) visit, at which time qualified subjects will be assigned to 
study treatment. Each sub ject will be assigned into 1 of the 2 study disease 
cohorts, after determination of the subject’s disease state in the Screening 
Period. Elamipretide will be supplied as 40 mg/1 mL of sterile solution for SC 
injection. The dose of elamipretide will be 40 m g administered as a once daily  
1.0 mL SC injection.  
At the time of initial study drug administration, training on the proper SC 
administration of the study drug solution (by the subject, regular caregiver, or 
his/her appropriate designee) will occur. Subjects will be trained using a 
standard script explaini ng the importance of proper administration of study 
drug on a daily basis for the 24 -week Study Treatment Period. The first dose 
may be given by a qualified member of the study team, by the subject, or 
caregiver at the PIs discretion. The option of a visit ing nurse to oversee the 
study drug administration will be discussed with the subject and provided, as 
needed.  
Safety and tolerability will be measured throughout the Study Treatment 
Period, while exploratory anatomical and physiologic endpoints will be 
measured at time points as specified in the Schedule of Events. Visits will 
occur at: Day 7 (± 3 days), Week 4 (± 7 days), Week 8 (± 7 days), Week 12 (±  
7 days), Week 16 (± 7 days), Week 20 (± 7 days), and Week 24 (± 7 days), 
with phone calls to collect safe ty information completed at Week 2 (± 4 days), 
Week 6 (± 4 days), Week 10 (± 4 days), Week 14 (± 4 days), Week 18 (± 4 
days), and Week 22 (± 4 days).  
Ocular imaging will be read by an independent reading center and findings 
uploaded to the electronic data capture (EDC) system on a regular basis 
throughout the study.  
After completion of the 24 -week Study Treatment Period, subjects will 
continue to be monitored for safety during the 4 -week Follow -Up Period. A 
post-study drug follow -up visit is scheduled at We ek 28 (± 7 days).  
Study procedures, their timing, and additional details are found in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 3 ). 
Investigational Product, Dose 
and Mode of Administration:  Elamipretide will be supplied as 40 mg/1 mL of sterile solution for SC 
injection. The dose of elamipretide will be 40 mg administered as a once daily  
1.0 mL SC injection. Study drug will be administ ered at approximately the 
same time each day by SC injection in the abdomen (rotating clockwise 
around the 4 abdominal quadrants), and may be administered by any of the 
following individuals: the clinical site staff, designated caregiver, or the 
subject. R efer to dosing instructions document for more details.  
Study Population:  Subjects who have intermediate AMD confirmed clinically and by the PI or 
designee’s interpretation of standard imaging procedures will be enrolled in 1 
of 2 disease cohorts:  
1. Intermediate age -related macular degeneration - high-risk drusen  without 
GA cohort  
or 
2. Intermediate age -related macular degeneration - noncentral GA  cohort . 
Inclusion Criteria:  For this study, only 1 eye of an eligible subject will be designated as the study

Sample Size and Statistical 
Methods:  For this Phase 1 study, the sample size of 40 evaluable subjects is reasonably 
sized for demonstrating clinical safety and tolerability. An equal enrollment 
(1:1) of approximately 20 subjects per cohort (cohort 1: 20 and cohort 2:  20) 
is targeted, but sub ject availability may dictate the actual enrollment ratio 
between the cohorts.  
General Methods:  
Continuous variables will be summarized by descriptive statistics (sample 
size, mean, standard deviation, median, and minimum and maximum).  
Discrete variables w ill be summarized by frequencies and percentages. All 
study data are to be displayed in the data listings. Importantly, tabulated data 
will be presented for each Cohort as well as the Total Sample (i.e., data from 
both cohorts pooled together).  
All data ar e to be displayed in the data listings, sorted by subject and visit, or 
where appropriate. Each listing will have indication of which cohort each 
subject was assigned to.  
Analysis Populations:  
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug will be included in the 
safety population. In general, subjects in the safety population are expected to 
have received active study drug and so will be identified as such.  
Baseline Characteristics and Disposition  
Baseline demographic and other non -eye specific characteristics will be 
presented by disease cohort. Subject disposition summaries will include the 
number of subjects treated (i.e., in the Safety population). The number and 
percentage of subjects who compl ete or discontinue from the study will be 
summarized by reason. Subject’s age, sex, weight, and other demographic 
characteristics will be recorded and summarized. Medical history will be 
listed.  
Safety Analyses:  
Adverse events will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term, 
presenting the number and percentage of subjects having adverse events.  
Adverse Events attributed to an individual eye or both eyes will be  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 9 of 88   
  
 characterized by specific study cohort. Severity and relationship to study drug 
will be listed as appropriate.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
Changes in endpoints will be presented by time point for each cohort as well 
as pooled. For continuous data of the by -cohort o utcomes, a mixed model for 
repeated measures (MMRM) will be used, with fixed effects for cohort, 
baseline covariate, study visit, the cohort -by-visit interaction, and random 
effects for subject. For continuous data for the pooled outcomes, an MMRM 
with fix ed effects for baseline covariate and study visit, and random effects  for 
subject will be used. Plots of the Least Square Mean (LSMean) values over 
time will be presented for each  endpoint.  
Interim Analysis  
This is an open -label study, and thus monitoring of data outcomes over the 
course of the study may be performed. In addition, an interim analysis may be 
performed on partial or all data when the first 20 subjects have completed 
through 24 weeks of treatment.  
The interim analysis may be performed by the S ponsor or their 
designee. Assessments of both safety and efficacy endpoints will be 
performed utilizing similar methods as are planned for the final analysis. 
Additional details of all statistical analyses will be included in a separate 
statistical analysi s plan.

4. INTRODUCTION  
This study will be conducted in strict accordance with the Council for International 
Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical Guidelines, International Conference on 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals  for Human Use 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guideline, and all applicable laws and regulations. For 
detailed information on the study drug and the nonclinical and clinical studies conducted to date, 
please refer to the most recent edition of the elam ipretide Investigator’s Brochure1. 
Mitochondria are organelles responsible for generating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by a series 
of redox reactions through the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP synthase. Mitochondria 
normally produce a small amount of reactive oxygen species including superoxide anions and 
hydrogen peroxide as physiological byproducts of electron transport and ATP production. Under 
conditions of metabolic or genetic stress, mitochondria can become a ma jor endogenous source 
of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide anions, peroxynitrite, and hydroxyl radicals.  
Increased oxidative damage to the inner membrane of the mitochondria leads to imbalances in 
the electron transport chain, resulting in further  increased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide 
production, which in turn can initiate a vicious cycle of further damage to membrane and 
mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial DNA. Excess production of oxidants can damage 
mitochondrial proteins and lipids to  a point that triggers mitochondria to activate signaling 
pathways that mediate nonlethal cellular injury. 2 The biology of nonlethal injury at the retinal 
pigment epithelium (RPE) includes cytosolic actin aggregate formation , cell membrane blebbing 
at the basal aspect of the RPE, vimentin upregulation, decreased matrix metalloproteinase 
(MMP) -2 activity, and other mediators of sub -RPE deposit formation that are relevant to the 
pathobiology of drusen formation, the hallmark fe ature of early age -related macular  degeneration 
(AMD). 3 Additionally, compromised mitochondrial function in the photoreceptors of the 
neurosensory retina can adversely affect photodetection and phototransduction by limiting the 
efficiency of photon capture at the photoreceptors. This can result in diminished visual acuity, 
particularly in low -luminance (LL) conditions, where efficiency of photon capture is necessary 
for optimal visual  function.  
 
4.1. Disease  Background  
4.1.1.  Age-related Macular  Degeneration  
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive degenerative disorder of the retina 
affecting 30% of people over age 65 and is the most common cause of blindness in the elderly in 
the developed world.4 Early and intermediate stages of dry AMD are characterized by formation 
of drusen -lipid-rich deposits under the RPE .5,6 No treatments are currently available to regress 
druse n or to prevent drusen progression into geographic atrophy (GA). Dry AMD/drusen 
pathogenesis is multifactorial, and requires aging7 plus interaction among genetic,8-11 systemic 
health,12 and environmental risk factors (dietary fats, smoking).13,14 Multiple paradigms have 
been proposed to explain how risk factors contri bute to deposits, including lipid accumulation in  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17

Bruch’s membrane, complement activation, and formation of toxic byproducts of the visual cycle 
function.  
 
4.1.2.  Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Mitochondrial  Abnormalities  
Emerging evidence suggests an association between mitochondrial dysfunction and dry AMD 
pathobiology. Patients with inherited mitochondrial diseases develop maculopathy similar in 
appearance to dry AMD. In histopathology specimens, mitochondria are located along the basal 
aspect of RPE, often near drusen, and specifically, mitochondria in RPE with drusen are reduced 
approximately 50% as compared to age -matched controls and exhibit pathologic m orphology, 
especially vacuolization. Moreover, RPE mitochondrial DNA in AMD eyes exhibit more 
oxidative damage as compared with aged control eyes without AMD. Taken together, these 
findings raise the possibility that mitochondrial dysfunction may play a pa thologic role in dry 
AMD.  
 
4.1.3.  Age-Related Macular Degeneration Trigger Factors Causing Mitochondrial 
Dysfunction  
Cigarette smoke and hydroquinone, a potent toxicant in cigarette smoke, have been 
epidemiologically associated with dry AMD, and in preclinical mo dels, both have been identified 
as biochemical triggers of RPE cellular injury related to dry AMD. Hydroquinone mediates RPE 
injury by disruption of the mitochondrial ETC, producing mitochondrial dysfunction.15 Emerging 
evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction may also be associated with other established 
triggers of dry AMD. Abnormal lipid metabolism can alter fatty acid and cholesterol content of 
the mitochondrial inner membrane, compromising ETC function.16,17 Disruption of 
phagolysosomes (i.e., by lipofuscin or inflammasome) can promote accumulation of damaged 
mitochondria since normal phagolysosomal function is required for clearance of dysfunctional 
mitochondria (mitophagy).18,19 Even complement dysregulation has been associated with 
decreased retinal ATP production.20  Taken together, these observations suggest that various 
AMD triggers may directly or indirectly i nduce mitochondrial dysfunction as a shared 
pathogenic  mechanism.  
 
4.1.4.  Mitrochondrial Dysfunction and Rationale for Mitochrondria -targeted  Drugs  
Although mitochondria have been suggested as a source of reactive oxidants in AMD ,21-25 
mitochondrial dysfunction is not oxidant overproduction alone; it also includes loss of ATP, 
calcium flux dysregulation, and other changes, which have been overlooked as pathogenic 
mechanisms in AMD. Preclinical studies  suggest that many AMD triggers induce mitochondrial 
dysfunction (decreased ATP, calcium flux dysregulation, loss of mitochondrial membrane 
potential [∆Ψ m], superoxide overproduction), leading to activation of specific signaling 
molecules (ASK1 → p38 MAPK → pHSP25, or pERK and pJNK), followed by activation of 
mediators of deposit formation (cytoskeleton disruption, actin aggregates, loss of ZO -1, 
blebbing, decreased MMP -14, decreased MMP -2, increased collagen IV, increased expression of 
vimentin), all of whi ch will precede and contribute to sub -RPE deposits (as degraded  blebs  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17

contributing phospholipids, cytosolic proteins and degraded organelles, collagen accumulation 
and vimentin accumulation). It is hypothesized that prevention or reversal of  mitochondrial 
dysfunction by specific mitochondria -targeting molecules may prevent and perhaps reverse 
pre-existing deposit biochemistry at the RPE, restoring physiologic function of the RPE and 
promoting clearance of drusen deposits in dry AMD. In turn, mitochondria -targeted therapies 
may facilitate improved visual function in affected eyes and may prevent progression to 
vision -threatening AMD disease, neovascular AMD and GA.  
 
4.1.5.  Visual Dysfunction and Deficit in Low -Luminance Activities of Daily  Living  
It is often assumed, incorrectly, that patients with early AMD, characterized by the presence of 
drusen, are not visually impaired because they retain good high -contrast (best -corrected) visual 
acuity and activities of daily living (ADLs) in photopic (bright -light) conditions. However, many 
drusen patients manifest severely reduced LL vision, defined both as loss of visual function 
under LL conditions and poor scores on inventories of LL ADLs.26-29 For example, 50% of 
patients with large drusen demonstrate loss of > 10 letters of visual acuity when measured under 
LL conditions (reading black letters on dark gray background)30. Studies have also shown that 
drusen patie nts experience decreased foveal sensitivity to dim light and delayed dark 
adaptation.31,32 These deficits translate into impaired LL ADLs: loss of reading in imperfect 
lighting, reduced mobili ty in dimly lit areas, impaired night driving, increased sensitivity to 
glare, and reduced night -time socialization. Because parafoveal rods in AMD eyes with drusen 
can die,33 dark adaption defects may reflect either loss or reversible dysfunction of  rods.  
However, since drusen eyes usually have normal cone density,33 LL deficits most likely 
represent physiologic cone dysfunction rather than anatomic cone loss.  
 
4.1.6.  Low -Luminance Deficit – Photoreceptor Mitochondrial Dysfunction and 
Rationale for Mitochondria -targeted  Drugs  
Photoreceptor mitochondria may become susceptible to dysfunction in the setting of RPE injury 
and subRPE deposit formation, as a result of compromised RPE metabolism. ATP is crucial for 
outer segment membrane biogenesis and for transport of structural prote ins.34,35 Mitochondria 
also regulate local calcium flux. Accordingly, the ellipsoid has high mitochondria density. The 
presynaptic terminal also has high mitochondria density. This is not surprising: ATP is required 
for glutamate endocytosis  and vesicle localization, which is crucially related to the graded 
glutamate release for vision .36 Also, ATP is required to maintain calcium balance by  
ATP -dependent ion pumps. Thus, photoreceptor mitochondrial dysfunction,  induced by  exposure 
to AMD trigger factors in the setting of RPE injury and deposit formation, may contribute to LL 
acuity deficit because of deficient ATP and abnormal calcium flux regulation required for (a) 
outer segment function and (b) presynaptic ne urotransmitter vesicle dynamics. Therefore, 
mitochondria -targeted drugs that reverse mitochondrial dysfunction in retinal photoreceptors 
may improve visual function by restoring ATP production and in turn boosting efficiency of 
retinal photon capture, impr oving LL acuity  deficit.

4.1.7.  Elamipretide – a Novel Mitochondria -targeted  Drug  
Elamipretide is a novel tetrapeptide drug that accumulates within mitochondria and facilitates 
restoration of normal mitochondrial function.37-39 Cardiolipin is a specialized phospholipid found 
in mitochondria that is a vital component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, maintaining the 
structural integrity of the ETC .40 In doing so, cardiolipin maintains the efficiency of the redox 
reactions essential for generating the transmembrane potential and proton -motive force for 
production of ATP. In the setting of excess oxidant generation, cardiolipin is susceptible to 
peroxidati on; peroxidized cardiolipin is ineffective at maintaining the structural integrity of the 
ETC. As a result, the ETC is much less efficient, accumulation of free electrons leads to a 
vicious cycle of oxidant generation, transmembrane potential is decreased,  ATP production 
diminishes, and calcium flux is perturbed. Elamipretide binds to peroxidized CL,41 optimizing its 
function, and restoring transmembrane potential, ATP production, and normal calcium flux, 
while reducing super oxide generation. Elamipretide has been found to be effective in cell culture 
systems of oxidant and toxic injury and in animal models of ischemia -reperfusion, heart failure, 
and renal disease42-45 to reverse mitochondrial dysfunction and to ameliorate mediated pathology. 
Elamipretide is bioavailable after systemic injection and readily penetrates tissues and  cells.  
Thus far, in human clinical trials, elamipretide has been studied for the treatment of acute 
coronary syndrome, chronic heart failure, ischemic kidney disease, and mitochondrial myopathy, 
and has been found to have an acceptable safety profile; sufficient data has been accumulated to 
support subcutaneous (SC) administration of up to 40 mg dosage of elamipretide.  
 
4.1.8.  Elamipretide in Preclinical Models of Dry Age -related Mitochondrial 
Degeneration  
In in vitro studies of RPE cell culture, elamipretide has been found to reverse mitochondrial 
dysfunction, and prevent activation of signaling cascades that activate biochemical mediators of 
deposit formation. Elamipretide has also been recently studied in 2 relevant mouse models of dry 
AMD: an acute model of subRPE deposit formation after repetitive exposure to periocular 
hydroquinone in young C57BL6J wild -type mice and a chronic model of subRPE deposit 
formation in aged (> 16 months) apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 transge nic mice fed a high fat plus 
cholate diet. Both models are characterized by RPE mitochondrial dysfunction, evidence of 
photoreceptor mitochondrial dysfunction, RPE cellular injury evident by cytosolic actin 
aggregate formation, loss of ZO -1 junctions, incr eased vimentin expression, basal cell  membrane 
blebbing, and decreased MMP -2 activity, all of which mediate formation of subRPE deposits 
Presence of deposits is also associated with RPE mitochondrial dysmorphology (i.e., 
vacuolization). The APOE4 mouse mod el is also characterized by dysfunction of the 
neurosensory retina, which is evident by a diminished a -wave (photoreceptor activation) as well 
as diminished b -wave (photoreceptor – bipolar cell synapse) by electroretinogram (ERG). In 
both models, systemic (i.e., SC) daily treatment of mice with elamipretide reversed 
mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulated biochemical mediators, and promoted regression of 
subRPE deposits (unpublished preclinical data). Moreover, elamipretide treatment  reversed  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 20 of 88   
  
neurosensory retinal dysfunction, restoring normal a -wave and b -wave amplitudes on ERG. This 
striking effect on retinal and visual function represents the first observed reversal of established 
retinal dysfunction in the APOE4 transgenic mouse model.  
Taken together, the profound unmet need to identify a treatment for dry AMD, a disease without 
any known effective therapy, the strong rationale for mitochondrial -targeted drugs in dry AMD, 
the well -established mechanism of action and clinical safety profile for the novel tetrapetide drug 
elamipretide, and notably the profound beneficial effects of elamipretide treatment to reverse 
subRPE deposit formation and restore retinal function in mouse models of dry AMD, 
collectively provide compelling evidence to supp ort the clinical development of elamipretide for 
the treatment of patients with intermediate (early dry)  AMD.  
 
4.2. Elamipretide Risk/Benefit  Assessment  
4.2.1.  Potential Risks and  Benefits  
Major metabolites of elamipretide, M1 and M2, have been qualified in toxicology  studies in both 
rat and dog. M1 and M2 have been demonstrated to be pharmacologically inactive in a model of 
mitochondrial dysfunction in reperfusion injury where elamipretide demonstrates statistically 
significant reduction in damage.  
In previous clinica l studies of elamipretide, the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) reported are injection site reactions, headache, nausea, and eosinophilia, as reported in 
both placebo and elamipretide -treated groups. All TEAEs should be treated by th e Principal 
Investigator (PI) per standard of care. Monthly lab collections will be used to monitor for signs 
of eosinophilia. Specifically, collection of blood for hematology, chemistry, Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE), and Interleukin 5 (IL5) testing and urine fo r urinalysis.  
In a preclinical fertility study, elamipretide, administered by daily SC injection before 
cohabitation, through mating and implantation at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg, had no adverse 
effects on fertility in male and female rats. In a preclini cal gestational study, daily intravenous  
(IV) infusion of elamipretide to mated female rats and rabbits was associated with maternal 
toxicity characterized by reduced food consumption and body weight gain at high doses but  no 
developmental toxicity. In rat s, the maternal no -observed -adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) was 
3 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was 10 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, the  maternal  
NOAEL was 5 mg/kg/day, and the developmental NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day. As a precaution 
against any potential reproductive risks, this study mandates pregnancy testing for women of 
childbearing potential and the use of effective contraception for all particip ants of childbearing 
potential or having partners with childbearing potential during trial participation. Subjects 
enrolled in the study will be required to follow the contraceptive restrictions described in  
Section 9.8.44.  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded from study participation. 
It is possible that this drug may cause harm to a fetus or embryo. Furthermore, the safety of 
receiving elamipretide during breastfeeding is not  known.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17

Elamipreti de was not associated with any end organ toxicity and all clinical findings were 
reversible. No significant toxicity was observed at 3 mg/kg/hour in rats and dogs, infused 
continuously for 12 hours with elamipretide or after 90 days dosing of elamipretide by SC 
injection (6mg/day in rat; 20 mg/day in dog).  
In animal studies, evidence of drug -induced histamine release syndrome was seen with 
cutaneous vasodilation, redness of the face, and pinna and muscle twitching noted in association 
with variable increase s in plasma histamine. Mild and moderate histaminergic -like reactions 
occurred at elamipretide time to maximum plasma concentration (T max), where maximum plasma 
concentration (C max) was > 16,500 ng/mL in rat [30 mg/kg/day] and > 3500  ng/mL  
[10 mg/kg/day] i n dog and resolved spontaneously after approximately 4 hours post dose. This 
phenomenon was best characterized in the cardiovascular dog study where minimal decreases in 
blood pressure and a reflex increase in heart rate and peripheral vasodilation were cl early 
associated with increases in plasma histamine at doses of elamipretide > 10 mg/kg/day. At SC 
doses > 300 mg/kg/day in the rat or > 40 mg/kg in the dog, convulsions were observed when 
Cmax plasma concentrations of elamipretide were approximately 200,0 00 ng/mL and 
approximately 60,000 ng/mL in the rat and dog, respectively.  
In human volunteers, 2 clinical studies have assessed the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
elamipretide. At doses of up to 80 mg/day administered as a SC injection for up to 7 day s, no 
subject experienced symptoms of histamine release. Plasma concentrations reached time to T max 
at approximately 0.75 hours postdose and mean C max at 80 mg/day on Day 7 was 1643 ng/mL. 
The daily dosage level for this study (40 mg) is below the dosage range utilized in these prior 
safety studies. Nonetheless, close monitoring of study subjects receiving elamipretide for clinical 
signs related to a histaminergic response, including local i njection site reactions, is warranted.  
Antihistamines should be considered if clinically significant histaminergic -like reactions occur.  
In rats, dose levels above 100 mg/kg/day were associated with metabolic acidosis, electrolyte 
loss, hypocalcaemia, and hypophosphatemia. In human subjects, early clinical data suggested a 
treatment -related lowering in serum sodium levels. Expansion of the clinical study population 
has not demonstrated hyponatremia; however, close monitoring of study subjects receiving 
elam ipretide for clinical and laboratory signs of hyponatremia will be conducted. Treatment for 
the condition is fluid restriction.  
Elamipretide and its 2 metabolites, M1 and M2, are excreted primarily through the kidneys. 
Patients with renal dysfunction will have higher exposure to the drug and its metabolites. A 
clinical study conducted in subjects with varying degrees of renal function (normal renal 
function and mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment) assessed the safety and PK of 
elamipretide and metab olites after IV administration of elamipretide (0.25 mg/kg/hour for  
1 hour) for 7 days. As expected, PK variables were impacted by renal function in a proportional 
manner; exposure (as the area under the plasma concentration -time curve from 0 to 24 hours 
[AUC 0-24h]) to elamipretide in the severe renal impairment group was approximately 2.3 times 
higher than in the normal renal function group, while C max was 1.08 times higher. Elamipretide,

M1, and M2 had reached steady -state by 7 days of dosing. Anticipated C max and AUC 0-24h after 
daily exposure to elamipretide at 40 mg/day by SC injection are shown in Table 2.

concentration; GFR = glomerular filtration rate.  
Safety and tolerability of elamipretide was not affected by renal function. Subjects with 
glomerular filtration rates < 30 mL/minute will be excluded from the study and anticipated 
plasma PK of the active compound or inactive metabolites are expected to re main within 
mandated toxicity margins.  
Generally, injection of SC elamipretide resulted in mild or moderate injection site reactions 
(ISRs), frequently characterized by erythema, induration, bruising, pruritus, pain, and/or 
urticaria. Injection site reacti ons were reported intermittently across multiple studies with 
elamipretide, with most subjects experiencing ISRs beginning upon first administration of 
elamipretide and continuing throughout treatment, with resolution of the ISRs typically occurring 
the da y of last elamipretide administration. The resolution of ISRs, however, has occurred as late 
as 14 days after the end of elamipretide treatment in one subject. The site may be requested to 
acquire photographs of the injection site reaction and provide them  to the sponsor. The subject 
will be consented to allow these photographs to be collected and transferred to sponsor for 
analysis.  
Given the potential benefit of a first -in-any-class treatment for patients with dry AMD, the 
overall risk benefit balance is therefore considered to be acceptable.  
 
4.2.1.1.  Safety Studies - Non-clinical  Studies  
Toxicology studies in rats and dogs showed that elamipretide has an acceptable profile that 
permits clinical investigations in humans for the proposed duration of the study.

In non -clinical safety studies in rats and dogs, no safety issues r elevant to either IV infusion or 
SC administration at therapeutic doses were identified during the non -clinical evaluation of 
elamipretide. Elamipretide did not cause end -organ toxicity at any dosage tested in either rats or 
dogs. Systemic toxicity at high  doses was manifested primarily by acute and transient clinical 
signs, which may have been mediated by histaminergic -like reactions. Effects were associated 
with maximum elamipretide C max and were rapidly reversible as the plasma concentrations of 
elamipre tide and histamine decreased. Dose administration was not associated with any adverse 
effects on cardiovascular, respiratory, or central nervous system function; off -target non -adverse 
effects were limited to a transient decrease of blood pressure and hear t rate, which is thought to 
be consistent with histaminergic -like reactions. In all studies, the severity of the effects was 
proportional to C max for elamipretide; thus, the safety margin is estimated based on C max, and not 
area under the plasma concentrat ion-time curve (AUC). The plasma elamipretide threshold 
concentration for clinically relevant adverse effects appears to be approximately 20,000 ng/mL 
in both rats and dogs, which is more than 10 -fold higher than the maximum anticipated human 
exposures in this trial.  
Elamipretide was negative for genotoxicity in the full battery of tests and caused no significant 
hemolysis or inhibition of receptor binding. Elamipretide was not associated with adverse effects 
on fertility or embryo -fetal development.  
No for mal immunotoxicity studies have been performed. As a tetrapeptide, the immunogenic 
potential of the drug is expected to be low.  
 
4.2.1.2.  Human  Safety  
To date, 17 clinical trials have been completed with parenteral elamipretide, including 14  clinical 
studies with the IV formulation and 3 studies with the SC formulation. In 11 clinical 
pharmacology trials completed, the primary objective was not to treat a disease state (9 trials 
with the IV formulation and 2 trials with the SC  formulation).  
Eight of the 11 clinical pharmacology trials evaluated single doses of IV or SC elamipretide, and 
three trials evaluated multiple doses of IV and SC elamipretide (SPIS C-101 and SPISC -102 
evaluated both single and multiple dose SC elamipretide). Parenteral administration of 
elamipretide was assessed following single and multiple IV and SC doses in approximately 200 
healthy subjects in 11 completed clinical pharmacology s tudies. Single IV doses ranged from  
0.005 mg/kg/hour to 0.25 mg/kg/hr, typically administered over 4 hours, while 0.25 mg/kg/hr 
administered over 1 hour daily for 7 days was the multiple -dose regimen studied. Single SC 
doses ranged from 2 mg to 80 mg admin ister as 0.5 or 1 mL injections, while multiple -dose 
regimen of 6 mg to 80 mg administered as 0.25, 0.5, or 1 mL injections daily for 7 days were 
studied.  
No safety concerns have been identified with administration of IV or SC elamipretide for up to 
seven days. In these studies, the only systemic adverse event reported in over 5% of subjects was 
headache (7.3%).  Nausea and hyponatraemia were each reported in 3.0% of the subjects. All  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 24 of 88   
  
other events were reported with incidence of <2.0%. The ma jority of TEAEs were assessed by 
the investigator to be of mild severity, resolved without sequelae and did not require 
intervention. There were no significant findings for group mean clinical laboratory, vital sign, 
ECG, or physical examination parameters  within or across trials.  
The SC formulation of elamipretide has been studied in both single - and multiple -dose trials in 
healthy volunteers and patient populations. Generally, injection of SC elamipretide resulted in 
mild or moderate injection site reacti ons, frequently characterized by erythema, induration, 
bruising, pruritus, pain, and/or urticaria. Injection site reactions were reported intermittently 
across dosing with elamipretide, with most subjects experiencing ISRs beginning upon first 
administrati on of elamipretide and continuing throughout treatment, with resolution of the ISRs 
typically occurring the day of last elamipretide administration. The resolution of ISRs, however, 
has occurred as late as 14 days after the end of elamipretide treatment in  one subject.  
In subjects with renal impairment, exposure, as measured by AUC, to elamipretide and both of 
its metabolites (M1 and M2) increased proportionally to the degree of renal impairment.  
However, there was no evidence of increased toxicity as a con sequence of impaired renal 
function. Similarly, in the Drug -Drug Interaction (DDI) studies carried out to date, co - 
administration of elamipretide with aspirin, with clopidogrel, or with unfractionated heparin 
(UFH) did not indicate a change in the nature,  severity or frequency of AEs to the safety profile 
of either elamipretide or the comparator.  
Elamipretide, administered by parenteral routes, was also assessed in completed studies in 
multiple patient populations including subjects with stable congestive heart failure (CHF), acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS) subjects who were undergoing primary percut aneous coronary 
intervention (PCI) and stenting for ST -segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 
subjects with acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty 
(PTRA), subjects with genetically confirmed mitochondrial  disease with signs and symptoms of 
mitochondrial myopathy and/or exercise intolerance, and subjects over 60 years of age with 
evidence of skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction. Single and multiple IV and SC doses of 
elamipretide were assessed with gen erally no notable differences between the elamipretide and 
placebo arms in the frequency or severity of adverse events, except for ISRs with SC 
elamipretide administration. Additionally, eosinophilia was reported as an adverse event and 
laboratory data dem onstrated elevations (>0.45 cells x109/L) in eosinophils beginning at 
approximately 28 days after initiation of elamipretide treatment in numerous subjects. These 
laboratory findings have not been reported to be associated with any systemic clinical 
manife stations of eosinophilia. In general, these elevations were demonstrated to have returned 
to within normal range or to baseline levels at the follow -up visit. There were no other identified 
safety concerns in these trials with respect to other clinical lab oratory results, physical 
examinations, vital signs, ECG data between the elamipretide and placebo. In general, the safety 
profile of systemic elamipretide was consistent with the pre -existing, comorbid medical 
conditions.

Across all studies , both IV and SC formulations, there has been no reported pregnancies. There 
have been no exposures during lactation, no overdoses, and no abuses or misuses reported.  
 
4.2.2.  Conclusions  
In summary, based on the clinical and non -clinical study data, accept able safety risks are 
expected for the current study.  
 
5. OBJECTIVES  
5.1. Primary  Objective  
The primary objective of the study is:  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SC injections of elamipretide in subjects with 
intermediate  AMD  
 
5.2. Secondary  Objectives  
The secondary objectives of the study are:  
• To evaluate the feasibility of administration of SC injections of elamipretide in subjects 
with intermediate  AMD  
• To evaluate the changes from baseline in physical/ophthalmic  examinations  
 
6. INVESTIGATIONA L PLAN  
6.1. Summary of Study  Design  
This is an open -label, Phase 1, single -center study in a total of approximately 40 evaluable 
subjects who have either: 1 eye with intermediate AMD - high-risk drusen without GA or 1 eye 
with intermediate AMD with noncentral G A. The study will thus include two predefined study 
disease cohorts: high -risk drusen cohort and noncentral GA cohort.  
The disease cohort high -risk drusen, is defined as presence of either at least 1 large (≥ 125 μm)  
druse or multiple medium -size (between 63 and 124 μm) drusen.  
The disease cohort noncentral GA, is defined as evidence of GA with cumulative area  
≥ 1.27 mm2 (approximately 0.5 disc area [DA]) by fundus autofluorescence (FAF), which spares 
the fovea (defined as retinal pigment epithelium and out er retina intact by SD -OCT).  
Eligible subjects may have intermediate AMD with either high -risk drusen or noncentral GA in 
the study eye but without CNV AMD in the study eye. The fellow eye (not the study eye) is 
allowed to receive antiangiogenic therapies and may have advanced central  GA, advanced 
central GA, or CNV AMD, and the fellow eye is allowed to receive antiangiogenetic therapies. .

Eligible subjects identified during the screening process will return for the Baseline (Day 0) visit, 
at which time they will be enr olled into the study and will begin receiving the 40 mg dose of 
elamipretide administrated subcutaneously once daily.  
Written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects before the Screening visit.  
The screening examination will be performed no mor e than 14 days before the Baseline visit. 
Data to be collected from the screening examination will include significant and/or ongoing 
medical and ocular history, vital sign measurements, physical examination, routine blood 
samples for hematology, chemistry , and urinalysis, ECG, manifest refraction, measurement of 
best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study 
(ETDRS) scale completed twice, intraocular pressure measurement, slit -lamp examination, 
dilated fundus exami nation, fundus photography, SD -OCT, FAF, fluorescein angiography*,  
best-corrected low -luminance (LL) visual acuity completed twice, mesopic microperimetry, dark 
adaptometry, and Low -Luminance Questionnaire. Women of childbearing potential will have a 
serum  pregnancy test.  
*Fluorescein angiography assessments done as standard of care and completed within 90 days prior to dosing are 
allowed to be used for screening purposes.  
After the screening examination, relevant data will be reviewed by the PI or designee  to confirm 
study eligibility.  
Each subject will be assigned into 1 of the 2 predefined study disease cohorts. Elamipretide will 
be supplied as 40 mg/mL of sterile solution for SC injection. The dose of elamipretide will be 
40 mg administered as a once dai ly 1.0 mL SC injection.  
At the time of study drug administration, training on the proper administration of subcutaneous 
drug solution (by the subject, regular caregiver, or his/her appropriate designee) will occur.  
Subjects will be trained using a standard  script explaining the importance of proper 
administration of the drug on a daily basis for the 24 -week Study Treatment Period. The first 
dose may be given by a qualified member of the study team, by the subject, or caregiver at the 
PIs discretion. The opt ion of a visiting nurse to oversee the study drug administration will be 
discussed with the subject and provided, as needed.  
Safety and tolerability will be measured throughout the Study Treatment Period, while 
exploratory anatomical and physiologic endpoints will be measured at time points as specified in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 3 ). Visits w ill occur at: Baseline (Day 0), Day 7 (± 3 days), Week 
4 (± 7 days), Week 8 (± 7 days), Week 12 (± 7 days), Week 16 (± 7 days), Week 20 (± 7 days), 
and Week 24 (± 7 days), with phone calls to collect safety information completed at Week 2 (± 4 
days), Week 6 (± 4 days), Week 10 (± 4 days), Week 14 (± 4 days), Week 18 (± 4 days), and  
Week 22 (± 4 days).  
Ocular imaging will be read by an independent reading center and findings uploaded to the 
electronic data capture (EDC) system on a regular basis throughout the study.

6.2.1.  Screening  Period  
A signed and dated informed consent form (I CF) will be obtained from the subject as required by 
the protocol before any screening procedures are conducted. A signed copy of the ICF will be 
given to the subject.  
A complete medical history will be obtained during the Screening Period within 14 days b efore 
the first study drug administration on Day 0. The following will be collected:  
• All ocular  history  
• Significant medical  history  
• Any ongoing medical  history  
The subject’s medical history will be recorded on the Medical History section of the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). Any AEs reported from the time of signed ICF until the first dose of 
study drug should be recorded on the Medical History section of th e eCRF. Any SAEs during 
this time will be reported on the AE eCRF and SAE paperwork completed within 24 hours of the 
PI learning of the SAE.  
The subject’s ocular history should also be recorded in the eCRF, including date of diagnosis, 
involvement in one o r both eyes, and associated symptoms.  
 
6.2.2.  Study Treatment  Period  
Once the screening procedures are completed and the subject meets eligibility criteria, the 
subject will be assigned by the investigator into 1 of 2 study disease cohorts: intermediate AMD  
- high-risk drusen without GA cohort or intermediate AMD - noncentr al GA cohort.  
The dose of elamipretide will be 40 mg administered as a once daily 1.0 mL SC injection. Study 
site personnel will instruct the subject and/or the subject’s caregiver or his/her appropriate 
designee on the techniques for drawing up the soluti on into the syringe and administering the 
study drug subcutaneously into the abdomen. The subject and/or the subject’s caregiver or 
his/her appropriate designee will be instructed on rotating the SC injection site clockwise around 
the four abdominal quadra nts from previous injection sites. The first injection will be given at the 
study center by a qualified study staff member, the subject, or the subject’s caregiver under the 
supervision of the study site personnel. Study drug will be administered daily for  the 24 -week 
Study Treatment Period and should be administered at approximately the same time every  day. 
Assessments for safety and tolerability will be measured according to the Schedule of Events 
(Table 3 ). Visits will occu r at: Day 7 (± 3 days), Week 4 (± 7 days), Week 8 (± 7 days), Week  
12 (± 7 days), Week 16 (± 7 days), Week 20 (± 7 days), and Week 24 (± 7 days), with phone 
calls to collect safety information completed at Week 2 (± 4 days), Week 6 (± 4 days), Week 10 
(± 4 days), Week 14 (± 4 days), Week 18 (± 4 days), and Week 22 (± 4 days). Subjects will be 
instructed to return all used and unused vials of study drug at subsequent visits.

6.2.3.  Follow -up Period  
A follow -up visit will occur 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug administration. 
Assessments will b e collected according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 3 ). 
Subjects withdrawing from the study will be asked to complete the Early Discontinuation visit 
assessments ( Table 3 ). 
 
6.3. Study  Assessments  
6.3.1.  Physical  Examination  
A physical examination should occur within 14 days before Day 0, at the end of the Study 
Treatment Period (Week 24), and at the Early Termination visit (for subjects who withdraw early 
from the study). The physical examination will include an assessment of  general appearance, 
skin, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, and the nervous system.  
 
6.3.2.  Vital Sign  Measurements  
Vital sign measurements (temperature, respiratory rate, sitting blood pressure after resting for 
5 minutes, and pulse) and weight will be collec ted within 14 days before Day 0, at every visit 
during the Study Treatment Period, the Follow -up Period, and Early Termination (for subjects 
who withdraw early from the study). All vital sign measurements are to be obtained with the

Termination visit (for subjects who withdraw early from the  study).  
 
6.3.9.  Other Study  Assessments  
Subjects will undergo a number of examinations to establish the subject’s baseline disease and 
change i n disease over time.  
Best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity testing has become the gold standard for test for BCVA. 
The test should be conducted under standardized lighting conditions. The BCVA testing using 
the ETDRS chart will be conducted within 14 days bef ore Day 0 (repeated twice) and at every 
visit. Subjects will also undergo testing for LL visual acuity testing within 14 days before Day 0 
(repeated twice) and at every visit. IOP will be measured by Goldmann tonometry and recorded 
within 14 days before Da y 0 and at every visit except Day 7. Refraction testing will be 
performed within 14 days of Day 0, Week 4, Week 16, and Week 24. It will also be complete at 
Early Termination (for subjects that withdraw early from the study).  
The anterior segment of the ey e by slit lamp biomicroscopy and regions of the vitreous, retina, 
choroid, optic nerve, and blood vessels will be examined by dilated ophthalmoscopy which will 
occur within 14 days before Day 0 and at every visit. The subject will have eye drops placed to 
dilate the pupils. Fundus photography of the posterior segment will be obtained within 14 days 
before Day 0, at Week 12, at Week 24, and at Early Termination (for subjects that withdraw

Termination (for subjects that withdraw early from the study). Fundus autofluorescence imaging 
of the retinal pigment epithelium and neurosensory retina will be performed within 14 days of 
Day 0 and at every visit with the exception of Day 7, and at Early Termination (for subjects who 
withdraw early from the study).  
Fluorescein angiography (FA) will be used to examine the circulation of the retina and choroid 
using fluorescein dye and a specialized camera to trace the dye. Subjects will receive an IV 
inject ion of fluorescein dye in order to highlight the blood vessels in the back of the eye. During 
the procedure, subjects should be observed for any adverse reactions to the dye. FA will be 
obtained within 14 days before Day 0. Fluorescein angiography complete d for standard of care 
within 90 days prior to first dose can be used as the screening assessment.  
Mesopic microperimetry will be used to measure retinal sensitivity, and dark adaptometry will be 
used to measure the absolute thresholds of rod sensitivity f or the evaluation of night blindness.  
Both mesopic microperimetry and dark adaptometry and will be performed within 14 days 
before Day 0 and at all visits except for Day 7.  
To assess the subject’s reading difficulty and reading performance, a reading speed  test will be 
administered under standard lighting conditions and under low luminance conditions at Day 0, 
Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, Week 20, Week 24, Week 28, and at the Early 
Termination visit (for subjects who withdraw early from the study).

8. STUDY  DRUG  
8.1. Study Drug  Administration  
Approximately 40 evaluable subjects will receive study drug administered as a single daily SC 
injection containing 40 mg elamipretide for 24 weeks. Study drug will be administered daily in 
the subject’s abdomen (rotating clockwise around the four abdominal  quadrants) by a caregiver 
or the subject.  
Study drug injection will occur at the study site on Day 0. Subjects will be trained on the 
procedure for administration of study drug. The first dose may be given by a qualified member 
of the study team, by the s ubject, or caregiver at the PIs discretion, a designated, trained 
caregiver is also able to administer the study drug. The subject will be instructed to administer 
study drug on a daily basis at approximately the same time each day. The option of a visitin g 
nurse to oversee the study drug administration will be discussed with the subject and provided, as 
needed.  
 
8.2. Materials and  Supplies  
Study drug elamipretide will be dispensed, stored, and administered according to the Manual of 
Procedures. Subjects will be  provided with syringes and any other supplies necessary for 
injection.  
 
8.2.1.  Elamipretide  
Elamipretide drug product will be provided as a sterile solution for administration by SC 
injection. Each single -use vial is filled with 1 mL of drug product containing t he equivalent of 
40 mg elamipretide (added as MTP -131 acetate) in an isotonic, unpreserved, clear, colorless 
solution.  
Elamipretide should be store in the refrigerator at a temperature of 2 to 8°C or 35.6 to 46.6°F.  
A Manual of Procedures will be provided to the study center sites detailing dispensing directions, 
training materials for subjects, and Subject Diary. IP accountability will be documented in the 
study EDC system.

Confidential and Proprietary  Page 43 of 88   
  
8.3. Study Drug Logistics and  Accountability  
All drug accountability records must be kept current, and the Investigator must be able to 
account for all used and unused vials of study drug. These records should contain the dates, 
quantity, and study drug:  
• Received at  site 
• Dispensed to each  subject,  
• Returned from each subject,  and 
• Disposed of at the site or returned to the Sponsor or  designee  
The clinical monitor responsible for the study site will provide written approval for the 
destruction or return of used and unused study drug vials fol lowing reconciliation of all clinical 
supplies.  
 
8.4. Study Drug  Compliance  
During the Study Treatment Period, study drug will be administered by the subject or caregiver. 
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused vials of study drug to the clinic at each 
visit.  
 
8.5. Method of Assigning Study  Drug  
At Day 0, after eligibility criteria have been confirmed, a treatment cohort will be assigned to 
each subject. This is an open label non -comparative study and not randomized.  
Subjects will be dispensed study drug at each study site visit. Each kit will be labeled with 
information including the following:  
• Protocol  number  
• Sponsor  name  
• Storage  conditions  
• Directions for  use 
• Investigational caution  statement  
 
8.6. Rationale for Dose  Selection  
The dose and route of administration (i.e., 40 mg in 1.0 mL by SC injection ) for the current study 
has previously been tested in a clinical trial involving healthy subjects. The dose for the current 
study was chosen based on the systemic exposure profile, as well as the safety observed in 
previous clinical trials.  
The plasma elam ipretide threshold concentration for clinically relevant adverse effects appears to 
be approximately 20,000 ng/mL in both rats and dogs, which is more than 10 -fold higher than  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 44 of 88   
  
the maximum anticipated human exposures for the selected dosage in this study. In healthy 
human adults, systemic exposure (in terms of mean AUC 0-24 on Day 7) to elamipretide after 
repeat SC injection at 40 mg in 1 mL was 3810 ng.hour/mL, while mean C max on Day 7 was 
1320 ng/mL. No accumulation of elamipretide was seen after repeat dosing for 7 consecutive 
days. Neither metabolite of elamipretide (M1 and M2) is active or implicated in toxicology.  
In a completed Phase 1 trial (SPISC -101), elamipretide given s ubcutaneously to healthy subjects 
at doses up to 40 mg in 1 mL once daily for 7 consecutive days was well tolerated, with no 
systemic safety issues. Local injection site reactions were limited to transient, local erythema, 
and occasional pruritus or swelli ng, which resolved quickly without sequelae and without 
intervention.  
 
8.7. Continued Access to Investigational Medicinal  Product  
Elamipretide will not be made available to subjects at the conclusion of their participation in the 
study.  
 
9. EFFICACY, SAFETY EVALUA TIONS, SAMPLE COLLECTION 
AND TESTING, AND APPROPRIATENESS OF  MEASURES

Investigators are responsible for monitoring the safety of subjects who have entered this study 
and for alerting Sponsor or its designee t o any event that seems unusual, even if this event may 
be considered an unanticipated benefit to the subject.  
The Investigator is responsible for facilitating the appropriate medical care of subjects during the 
study, in the event of adverse event (AE).  
The Investigator remains responsible for following, through an appropriate health care option, of 
AEs that are serious, considered related to the study drug or the study, or that caused the subject 
to discontinue before completing the study. The subject shou ld be followed until the event is 
resolved or explained.  
Comprehensive assessment of any apparent toxicity experienced by study subjects will be 
performed throughout the course of the study, from the date of the subject’s signature of 
informed consent. Stu dy site personnel will report any AE, whether observed by the Investigator 
or reported by the subject. The reporting period for AEs is described in Section 9.8.2 .

9.3.1.  Adverse  Events  
An AE is defined as any untoward  medical occurrence in the form of signs, symptoms, abnormal 
laboratory findings, or diseases that emerge or worsen relative to baseline during administration 
of an investigational medicinal product (IMP), regardless of causal relationship.  
Adverse Events may include the following:  
• Suspected adverse drug reactions: side effects known or suspected to be caused by the 
study  drug.  
• Other medical experiences, regardless of their relationship with the study drug, such as 
injury, surgery, accidents, extensions of symptoms or apparently unrelated illnesses, and 
significant abnormalities in clinical laboratory values, psychological testin g, or physical 
examination  findings.  
• Events occurring as a result of protocol interventions (pre - or post -IMP administration)  
• Reactions from study drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity. The 
Sponsor has standards for reporting AEs that are to be followed regardless of  applicable 
regulatory requirements that may be less  stringent.  
 
9.4. Pre-study Drug  Events  
Untoward events and/or incidental diagnoses that occur prior to study drug administration are by 
definition, unrelated to the study drug.  Pre-study drug events or incidental diagnoses will be 
recorded on the past medical history eCRF. However, if a pre -study drug event is assessed by the 
Investigator as related to a study procedure and/or meets seriousness criteria, it will be recorded 
as an AE on the AE eCRF and followed as per protocol guidelines noted in Section 9.7  and 9.8. 
 
9.5. Baseline Medical  Conditions  
Those medical conditions related to the disease under study whose changes d uring the study are 
consistent with natural disease progression, or which are attributable to a lack of clinical efficacy 
of the study drug, are NOT considered as AEs and should not be recorded as such in the eCRF. 
These are handled in the efficacy assessm ents and should be documented on the medical history 
page of the eCRF.  
Baseline medical conditions, not in the therapeutic area of interest/investigation, that worsen in 
severity or frequency during the study will be recorded and reported as AEs.  
 
9.6. Abnormal Laboratory and Other Abnormal Investigational  Findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other objective measurements should NOT be routinely 
captured and reported as AEs. However, abnormal laboratory findings or other objective 
measurements should be reported on the AE pages of the eCRF that:  
• Meet the criteria for a  SAE  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 47 of 88   
  
• Result in discontinuation of the  IMP 
• Require medical intervention  or 
• Are judged by the Investigator to be clinically significant changes from baseline 
When reporting a n abnormal laboratory finding on the AE pages of the eCRF, a  clinical  
diagnosis should be recorded rather than the abnormal value itself (for example, “anemia” rather 
than “decreased red blood cell count” or “hemoglobin = 10.5 g/dL”.)  
 
9.7. Serious Adverse  Events  
An SAE is any AE from this study that:  
• Results in death. In case of a death, the cause of death is used as the AE term, and the 
fatality is considered as the  OUTCOME.  
• Is life threatening. The term “life threatening” refers to a SAE in which the subject is  at 
risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer  to an event that hypothetically 
might cause death if it were more  severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing  hospitalization.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth  defec t 
• Is otherwise considered medically  important.  
Important medical events may be considered as SAEs when, based upon medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in th is definition.  
Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or dr ug abuse.  
For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IMP is 
also considered a SAE and all such cases should be reported in an expedited manner as described 
in Section 9.8.3.3 . 
 
9.7.1.  Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of a Serious Adverse  Event  
Elective hospitalizations are not considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned 
hospitalizations (not documented prior to ICF signing) or unplanned prolongation of an elec tive 
hospitalization (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered medication) must be documented 
and reported as SAEs.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 48 of 88   
  
9.8. Recording of Adverse  Events  
Complete, accurate, and consistent data on all AEs experienced for the duration of the repor ting 
period (defined in Section 9.8.2 ) will be recorded on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section 
of the eCRF. Among these AEs, all SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using 
the study specific SAE Report Fo rm. 
It is important that each AE report include a description of the event along with the duration 
(onset and resolution dates), severity, relationship to study drug, potential causal factors, 
treatment given or other action taken (including dose modificat ion or discontinuation of the 
IMP), and the outcome.  
As the quality and precision of acquired AE data are critical, Investigators should use the AE 
definitions provided and should observe the following guidelines when completing the AE pages 
of the eCRF:  
Whenever possible, recognized medical terms should be used to describe AEs rather than lay 
terms (for example, “influenza” rather than “flu”), and abbreviations should be avoided.  
Adverse events should be described using a specific clinical diagnosis, if a vailable, rather than a 
list of signs or symptoms (for example, “congestive heart failure” rather than “dyspnea, rales, 
and cyanosis”). However, signs and symptoms that are not associated with an identified disease 
or syndrome, or for which an overall diag nosis is not yet available, should be reported as 
individual AEs.  
Provisional diagnoses (e.g., “suspected myocardial infarction”) are acceptable, but should be 
followed up with a definitive diagnosis if later available. Similarly, a fatal event with an 
unknown cause should be recorded as “death of unknown cause.”  
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition or illness leading to the procedure is 
considered the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
Adverse events occurring secondary to other events (e.g., sequelae or complications) should be 
identifie d by the primary cause. A primary AE, if clearly identifiable, generally represents the 
most accurate clinical term to record in the eCRF.  
 
9.8.1.  Investigator  Assessments  
 
9.8.1.1.  Severity/Intensity  
Investigators must assess the severity/intensity of AEs according to th e following qualitative 
toxicity scale:  
 
Mild:  The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom  is easily 
tolerated.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 49 of 88   
  
Moderate:  The subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce  his or 
her usual l evel of  activity.  
Severe:  Significant impairment of functioning: the subject is unable to carry  out usual 
activities.  
 
9.8.1.2.  Relationship to the Investigational Medicinal Product  (IMP)  
Investigators must systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to the study drug using 
the following definitions (the decisive factor being the temporal relationship between the AE and 
administration of the study drug):  
Probable:  A causal relation ship is clinically/biologically highly plausible, there  is a 
plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study 
drug, and there is a reasonable response on  withdrawal.  
Possible:  A causal relationship is clinically/biologically plausible and there is  a plausible 
time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the study  drug.  
Unlikely:  A causal relationship is improbable and another documented cause of the  AE is 
most  plausible.  
Unrelated:  A causal relationship can be excluded and another documented cause of  the AE 
is most  plausible.  
 
9.8.2.  Adverse Event Reporting  Period  
The AE reporting period begins when the subject signs the ICF and continues through the 
clinical study’s post study drug follow -up period, defined as 28 (± 7 days) days after last 
administration of study drug.  
Note that AEs that occur between the time subj ect signs the ICF and the time the subject is  dosed 
with study drug will be summarized in the medical history eCRF and not as an AE unless the 
event meets the definition of a SAE. All AEs which occur following first administration of study 
drug either new events or events that were pre -existing but changed in frequency or severity will 
be recorded on the AE CRF page until the last subject visit required by the protocol. A last batch 
of queries will be sent after last study visit if remaining ongoing/unknown  outcomes of reported 
AEs are pending. After the last batch of queries has been resolved, the CRFs and database will 
no longer be updated and the data considered final. However, SAEs and ongoing/unknown 
outcome AEs will be followed -up until resolution or s tabilization by the Sponsors 
Pharmacovigilance department. Beyond this defined reporting period, any new SAE considered 
causally related to study drug should be immediately reported to the sponsor using the SAE 
report form provided.  Additional SAE informa tion obtained after database lock will reside 
solely in the safety  database.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 50 of 88   
  
Within the study, all subjects who took at least 1 dose of IMP, whether they completed the study 
drug period or not, should enter the 28 -day period as defined above . 
If a subject is documented as lost -to follow -up, ongoing/unknown outcome AEs will not be 
followed -up. 
For screening failure subjects, new AEs and updates must be recorded in the CRFs until the date 
the subject was determined to be a screen failure. Beyon d that date, only SAEs and medically 
relevant AEs will be followed -up by the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance group and all data will be 
housed within the safety database.  
 
9.8.3.  Serious Adverse Event Expedited  Reporting  
In the event a SAE occurs during the reporting  period, the Investigator must immediately  (within 
a maximum of 24 hours after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor as detailed in the 
Clinical Trial Pharmacovigilance Procedural  Manual.  
For any SAE, the following minimum information is required  as initial notification:  
• Investigator/Reporter with full contact  information  
• Subject identification details (study number, site number, subject  number)  
• Study drug administration details (dose and  dates)  
• Event verbatim terms, a brief description of signs/symptoms/diagnosis and the date  of 
onset  
• Seriousness criteria(ion)  met 
• Relationship of the event to the study drug (e.g., the causality according to the 
Investigator)  
Reporting procedures and timelines are the same for any new follow -up information on a 
previously reported SAE.  
All SAE reports must be completed as described i n the eCRF completion guidelines and 
submitted through the electronic data capture system of the clinical database. Other relevant 
information from the clinical database (including demographic data, medical history, 
concomitant drug and study drug dosing i nformation) will automatically be sent via the 
electronic data capture system when the SAE form is submitted.  
The names, addresses, telephone and fax numbers for SAE back -up reporting (paper), are 
included in the Safety Reporting Plan.  
The Investigator/Rep orter must respond to any request for follow -up information (e.g., additional 
information, outcome and final evaluation, specific records where needed) or to any question the 
Sponsor may have on the AE within the same timelines as described for initial rep orts. This is 
necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by the Sponsor and (as applicable) to allow  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 51 of 88   
  
the Sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting 
obligations.  
 
9.8.4.  Pregnancy and  Contraception  
Any pregnancies occurring during the study and within the three months after the last dose of 
study drug must be reported t o the Investigator. In addition, women of childbearing potential 
must agree to use 1 of the following methods of birth control from the date they sign the ICF 
until 3 months after the last dose of study drug:  
• Abstinence, when it is in line with the preferr ed and usual lifestyle of the subject. Subject 
agrees to use an acceptable method of contraception should they become sexually  active.  
• Maintenance of a monogamous relationship with a male partner who has been surgically 
sterilized by vasectomy (the vasecto my procedure must have been conducted at  least 
60 days before the Screening visit or confirmed via sperm analysis).  
• Barrier method (e.g., condom or occlusive cap) with spermicidal  foam/gel/film/cream 
AND either hormonal contraception (oral, implanted, or i njectable) or an intrauterine 
device or  system.  
Non-childbearing potential is defined as surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral oophorectomy, 
hysterectomy, or tubal ligation) or postmenopausal (defined as permanent cessation of 
menstruation for at least 1 2 consecutive months prior to the Screening visit).  
For male subjects with female partners of child -bearing potential, highly effective methods of 
contraception must be adhered to from the date of informed consent and for at least 3 months 
(i.e. 90 days) a fter last dose of study drug. Highly effective methods of contraception are defined 
as the usage by the female partner of any form of hormonal contraception or intra -uterine device 
(which should be established prior to the start of the study) plus usage by  one of the partners of 
an additional spermicide -containing barrier method of contraception. Male subjects with 
pregnant partners must use a condom with spermicide from the start of study drug until at least 3 
months after the last dose of study drug. Sper m or egg donation by subjects is not permitted from 
the start of study drug until 3 months after the study drug was  administered.  
Only pregnancies considered by the Investigator as related to study drug (e.g., resulting from an 
interaction between study drug and a contraceptive drug) are considered AEs unto themselves. 
However, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date that o ccurred during the AE 
reporting period, as defined in Section 9.8.2 , must be recorded in the AE section of the eCRF. 
For this study, this applies to pregnancies in female subjects and in female partners of male 
subjects.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the 
Pregnancy Form and the back -up reporting procedure as described in the Clinical Trial 
Pharmacovigilance Procedural Manual. Investigators must actively follow up, documen t, and 
report on the outcome of all pregnancies.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 52 of 88   
  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of these outcomes using Section II of the Pregnancy 
Form and submit the information using the back -up reporting procedure. Any abnormal outcome 
must be  reported in an expedited manner as described in Section 9.8.3.3 , while normal outcomes 
must be reported within 45 days from delivery.  
In the case of an abnormal outcome, whereby the mother sustains an event, the SAE Report 
Form is required and will be submitted as described above.  
 
9.8.5.  Responsibilities to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators, and  Institutional 
Review  Board  
The Sponsor will send appropriate safety notifications to regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable laws and regulations.  
The Investigator must comply with any applicable site -specific requirements related to the 
reporting of SAEs involving subj ects to the IRB that approved the study.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of findings 
that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the study, or alter the 
IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the study. In particular, and in line with respective 
regulations, the Sponsor will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and  unexpected 
and are considered to be related to the administered product (suspected unexpected s erious 
adverse reaction [SUSARs]). The Investigator should place copies of the safety reports in the 
Investigator site  file. 
When specifically required by regulations and guidelines, the Sponsor will provide appropriate 
safety reports to the CRO for distri bution to the site and will maintain records of these 
notifications. The Investigator will be responsible for promptly notifying the concerned 
independent IRB of any safety reports provided by the Sponsor and or filing copies of all related 
correspondence in the site file.  
 
9.9. Appropriateness of  Measurements  
The measures used to assess safety in this study are consistent with those widely used and 
generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 53 of 88   
  
10. DATA QUALITY  ASSURANCE  
To ensure accurate, complete, and reliable data, the Sponsor or its r epresentatives will do the 
following:  
• Provide instructional material to the study sites, as  appropriate.  
• Sponsor start -up training to instruct the Investigators and study coordinators. This 
training will give instruction on the protocol, the completion of the eCRFs, and study 
procedures.  
• Make periodic visits to the study  site. 
• Be available for consultation and stay in contact with the study site personnel by  mail, 
email, telephone, and/or  fax. 
• Review and evaluate eCRF data and use standard computer edits to  detect errors in  data 
collection.  
• Conduct a quality review of the  database  
In addition, the Sponsor or its representatives will periodically check a sample of the subject data 
recorded against source documents at the study site. The study may be audited by the Sponsor or 
its representatives, and/or regulatory agencies at any time . Investigators will be given notice 
before an audit occurs.  
To ensure the safety of participants in the study, and to ensure accurate, complete, and reliable 
data, the Investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and subject medical  
records in the subject files as original source documents for the study. If requested, the 
Investigator will provide the Sponsor, applicable regulatory agencies, and applicable IRBs with 
direct access to original source documents.  
 
10.1.  Data Capture  System 
An electronic data capture system will be used in this study. The site will maintain a separate 
source for the data entered by the site into the Sponsor -provided electronic data capture system.  
Electronic case report form data will be encoded and stored in a clinical study database. Data 
managed by a central vendor, such as laboratory test data or ECG data, will be stored 
electronically in the central vendor’s database system.  
Any data for which paper documentation provided by the subject will serve as a source 
document will be identified and documented by each site in that site’s study file. Paper 
documentation provided by the subject may include, for example, a paper diary to collect  subject 
reported outcome measures (e.g., a rating scale), a daily dosing schedule, or an event  diary.

11. SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL  METHODS  
11.1. Determination of Sample  Size 
For this Phase 1, open label study, a sample size of 40 evaluable subjects is considered sufficient. 
The sample size of the study is based on precedent set by prior Phase 1 studies of similar nature 
and design. It is considered sufficient to provide for pr eliminary assessment of safety and 
tolerability.  
 
11.2. Statistical and Analytical  Plans  
11.2.1.  General  Considerations  
In general, categorical variables will be summarized by the count (N) and percentage of subjects 
(%). Continuous variables will be summarized by the n umber of non -missing observations (N), 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values.  
All study data are to be displayed in the data listings.  
Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of the Sponsor or its designee. Sub ject 
disposition summaries will include the number of subjects entered and the numbers treated 
(included in the Safety population) by disease cohort for all subjects. The number and percentage 
of subjects who complete or discontinue from the study will be summarized by reason for 
discontinuation for each disease cohort.  
Subject’s age, sex, weight, history of smoking, eye color, and other demographic characteristics 
will be recorded and summarized by disease cohort. Medical history will be listed.  
 
11.2.2.  Subject  Disposition  
All subjects who discontinue from the study will be identified, and the extent of their 
participation in the study will be reported. If known, a reason for their discontinuation will be 
given.  
 
11.2.3.  Subject  Characteristics  
Baseline characteristics will include standard demography (e.g., ethnicity, race, eye color, and 
history of smoking), disease characteristics including medical history, and medication history for 
each subject.  
 
11.2.4.  Concomitant  Therapy  
Current use of or likely need for systemic medications known to be toxic to the lens, retina, or 
optic nerve (e.g., deferoxamine, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine [Plaquenil®], tamoxifen, 
phenothiazines, and ethambutol) are prohibited from the Screening visit until completion of the  
study (completion of the Follow -Up visit).  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 55 of 88   
  
All other medications, including any over -the-counter treatments, vitamins, or supplements, must 
have been unchanged and constant for at least one month prior to the Baseline visit and must 
remain stable through the completion of the study (completion of the Follow -up visit).  
 
11.2.5.  Study Drug  Compliance  
All drug compliance records must be kept current and must be made available for inspection by 
the sponsor and regulatory agency inspectors.  
 
11.2.6.  Endpoints an d Methodology  
 
11.2.6.1.  General  Considerations  
Data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minima, and maxima) for continuous variables and using frequencies and percentages 
for discrete variables. Data will be presented by disease cohort.  
 
11.2.6.2.  Analysis  Populations  
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug 40 mg (40 mg/1 mL of sterile solution for 
subcutaneous injection) will be included in the safety population.  
Efficacy data will be summarized by disease group.  
All presentations and analysis will be provided for the safety population. 
The details of all analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
11.2.7.  Efficacy  Analyses  
For primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, the change from baseline in all continuous 
endpoints wi ll be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, maximum) by disease cohort. Categorical variables will be described using 
frequencies and percentages.  
 
11.2.8.  Interim  Analysis  
This is an open -label study, and thus monitor ing of data outcomes over the course of the study 
may be performed. In addition, an interim analysis may be performed when 20 subjects have 
completed through 24 weeks of treatment. All data from all subjects up to these interim analyses 
may be included in the assessments.  
These interim analysis will be performed by the Sponsor or their designee. Assessments of both 
safety and efficacy endpoints will be performed utilizing similar methods as are planned for the 
final analyses.  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 56 of 88   
  
11.2.9.  Safety  Analyses  
AEs will be summarized by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT), presenting the 
number and percentage of subjects having AEs and dose level. Severity and relationship to study 
drug will be listed as appropriate.  
 
11.2.9.1.  Adverse  Events  
The numb er and percentage of subjects experiencing 1 or more AEs will be summarized by 
disease group, relationship to study drug, and severity. Adverse events will be coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology. Adverse events wil l be 
summarized by SOC, PT, and disease cohort.  
All reported AEs will be listed, but only TEAEs will be summarized.  
The incidence of all TEAEs, drug relationship with TEAEs, and severity of TEAEs will be 
summarized. In the summary tables, subjects may be c ounted under multiple SOCs and PTs, but 
for each SOC and PT, subjects are only counted once. If a subject has the same AE on multiple 
occasions, the highest severity (severe > moderate > mild) or drug relationship  
(probable > possibly related > unlikely re lated > unrelated) recorded for the event will be 
presented. If severity is missing, subjects will be included as missing (for severity). If drug 
relationship is missing, subjects will be included in related tables (e.g., considered related).  
 
11.2.9.2.  Deaths and O ther Serious Adverse  Events  
Listings will be provided for the following:  
• Deaths  
• SAEs  
• SUSARs  
• AEs leading to discontinuation of study  drug 
 
11.2.9.3.  Clinical Laboratory  Evaluations  
Summary tables for laboratory parameters (including hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will 
include descriptive statistics of change relative to baseline where appropriate, and data listings of 
clinically significant abnormalities.  
Subjects with labora tory data outside the normal range will be listed with abnormal values 
flagged.  
Shift tables (e.g., tables that show the number of subjects who are low, normal, or high at 
baseline versus each post -baseline scheduled assessment) will be produced.  
The number and percentage of subjects with urinalysis results outside the normal range will be 
presented by endpoint and visit for each cohort. Shift tables for urinalysis will show the number 
of subjects who are normal/abnormal at baseline and normal/abno rmal at the end of study.

11.2.9.4.  Vital  Signs  
Vital signs data will be summarized by changes from baseline values for each disease cohort 
using descriptive statistics.  
Shift tables for heart rate and blood pressure (e.g., tables that show the number of subjects who 
are low, normal, or high at baseline  versus each post -baseline scheduled assessment) will be 
produced.  
 
11.2.9.5.  Other Safety  Parameters  
Any other safety data captured on the eCRF will be listed.  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT, INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW  BOARD, 
AND REGULATORY  CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1. Informed  Consent  
The Investi gator is responsible for ensuring that the subject understands the potential risks and 
benefits of participating in the study, including answering any questions the subject may have 
throughout the study and sharing in a timely manner any new information th at may be relevant to 
the subject willingness to continue his or her participation in the study.  
The ICF will be used to explain the potential risks and benefits of study participation to the 
subject in simple terms before the subject is entered into the s tudy, and to document that the 
subject is satisfied with his or her understanding of the risks and benefits of participating in the 
study and desires to participate in the study. The ICF will also request approval for ISR 
photographs to be taken and provid ed to the sponsor for surveillance use.  
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is given by each subject. This 
includes obtaining the appropriate signatures and dates on the ICF before the performance of any 
protocol procedures a nd before the administration of investigational product.  
As used in this protocol, the term “informed consent” includes all consent and assent given by 
subject or their legal representatives.  
 
12.2. Institutional Review  Board  
The Sponsor or its representatives must approve all ICFs before they are used at investigativ e 
sites. All ICFs must be compliant with the ICH guideline on GCP.  
Documentation of IRB approval of the protocol and the ICF must be provided to the Sponsor 
before the study may begin at the investigative site. The IRB will review the protocol as 
required.  
The study site’s IRB should be provided with the following:  
• The current Investigator’s Brochure and updates during the course of the  study  
Elamipretide (MTP -131) SPIAM -101 Clinical Protocol Version 7.0, 20 Jun17  
Confidential and Proprietary  Page 58 of 88   
  
• ICF 
• Relevant curricula  vitae  
 
12.3. Regulatory  Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance wi th: 
• Consensus ethics principles derived from international ethics guidelines, including  the 
Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences International Ethical 
Guidelines

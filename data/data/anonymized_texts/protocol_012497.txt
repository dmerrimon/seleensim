 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Overview  
Perioperative anxiety in Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) is associated with  increased post -
operative pain and decreased patient satisfaction. Optimum delivery of patient education has been 
suggested as a potential modality to decrease perioperative anxiety, but has not been conclusively  
demonstrated. A pilot study completed in July 2017 at University Hospital’s Westlake Campus  
demonstrated that patient education completed with a 3D printed model and standardized script increased patients subjective understanding and decreased patient anxiety during the perioperative period. Despite  these findings, the pilot study had notable li mitations that included a small sample 
size and lacked an adequate control group. Our aim is to complete a comprehensive randomized 
control trial, with a larger cohort of patients and  an adequate control group, to compare  of our 
innovative counseling protocol to the current standard of care , verbal counseling . This work may 
help to provide an optimized educational delivery system  for MMS at University Hospitals.  
 
1.2 Background  and Rationale  
Non-melanoma skin cancer is frequently treated with MMS in the clinical setting. This procedure 
is completed under local anesthesia and the goals of treatment include complete removal of the 
cancer, perseveration of normal skin function and to provide patients an optimal cosmetic result. Cure rates of MMS have been ci ted above 95% for BCC & SCC.
1-3, 6 
  In previous studies, increased perioperative anxiety was  associated with increased postoperative 
pain and decreased patient satisfaction.
3-7 Prior literature has demonstrated  efficacy of 
personalized intraoperative musi c and midazolam treatment to reduce perioperative patient anxiety 
in MMS .3-11 It has been suggested that optimized delivery of patient education may be effective in 
decreasing patient anxiety, however, it has not been demonstrated.   The use of physical mo dels, often created with 3D printing technology, have been  effective in the 
delivery of medical education for patients, medical students and medical resident s. In fact, most 
studies demonstrate that physical models outperform static (2D) or dynamic (3D), animated  or 
digitized,  representations for the delivery of medical education.
12-18 In addition, the use of physical 
models for the delivery of medical education has been shown to decrease learner anxiety.12,19 
 In July 2017, a pilot study was completed in the University Hospitals Westlake MMS Clinic to 
determine if a 3D printed MMS model and standardized script protocol could enhance patient understanding of MMS and decrease perioperative patient anxiety.
19 This pilot study included 25 
patients and demonstrated that explanation with a 3D printed MMS model and standardized script patient s had a statistically significant increase in understanding  of MMS  by 1.5 points and decrease 
in anxiety by 1.5 points using  a Visual Analog Scale.
19 Limitations of our initial study included 
lack of an adequate control group and small initial sample size.  
 Our aim is to complete a comprehensive randomized control trial, with a larger cohort of patients 
and adequate control group to investigate the effectiveness of our innovative counseling protocol featuring a standardized script and 3D printed MMS model.  
  
CASE PRMC 6617  2 3/2/2018 
 2.0 OBJECTIVES  
1. To investigate if patient education  with a 3DP MMS model and  standardized script 
protocol increases patient understanding of MMS more than current standard of care 
(control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.   
2. To investigate if patient educa tion with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script 
protocol decreases perioperative patient anxiety during MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.  
 
3. To evaluate if patient satisfaction with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script 
protocol increases patient satisfaction during MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.  
 
3.0 RESEARCH  SUBJECT SELECTION  AND ELIGIBILITY  
A total of 100 subjects between the ages of 18 -90 years old, who are undergoing Mohs 
Micrographic Surgery at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Chagrin Highlands and 
Westlake Campus will be considered for the study. Patients will not be provided compensation for participation.  Eligible participants must be capable of reading and completing all subjective questionnaires including the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Post-
Intervention Knowledge Survey and Satisfaction Survey. Pa tients will be ineligible for the study 
if they choose not to participate, or cannot complete the subjective or objective questionnaires described above.  
 4.0 RESEARCH SUBJECT ENTRY  
Subjects will be recruited voluntarily from the University Hospitals Department of Dermatology Mohs Microsurgery Clinics. All patients who meet inclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. 
Patients will be randomized  into experimental or control groups prior to onset of study protocol. All 
patients will undergo  verbal  consent in private patient rooms  prior to the onset of the study protocol  
and will have the option to withdraw from the study at any time throughout the study.  Verbal consent 
is preferred to written consent to prevent the collection of information classified as protected health information (PHI).  
 5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
A total of 100  patients will be recruited from University Hospitals Department of Dermatology 
Mohs Micrographic Surgery Clinics at the Cleveland Medical Center, Chagrin Highlands  and 
Westlake Locations. These patients will be randomly assigned to a control (50%) or experimental 
group (50%) prior to the onset of the study protocol . Patients in the control group will be educated 
on MMS according to the current standard of care, verbal counselling, with a standardized script  
(Appendix A). The experimental group will be educated on MMS with a standardized script in addition to a 3D MMS model  (Appendix B) . 
 Patients will initially undergo  verbal  consent in private patient rooms located within the Mohs 
Microsurgery Clinics prior to study initiation. As previously stated, verbal consent will prevent the 
CASE PRMC 6617  3 3/2/2018 
 collection of any PHI during this study. Upon verbal consent, patients will fill out baseline testing 
including a State -Trait Anxiety Inve ntory (STAI) and Visual Analog S cale (VAS)  to quantify 
their anxiety and understanding of the Mohs procedure (Appendices C, D, E). Following baseline testing, patients will undergo preoperative education. In the control group patients will be educated with  a standardized script alone, and experimental group patients with a standardized 
script, in addition to a 3DP physical model demonstrating the M MS procedure. The total length 
of time to educate patients will be recorded.  
 After completion, patients will undergo standard of care procedures with the MMS team, 
including surgeon, and undergo the first stage of the MMS  procedure. Patients will undergo post-
testing following the first layer of MMS. This layout was chosen to ensure all patients to prevent study personnel from impeding the workflow of the MMS clinic, and is similar to a workflow 
used in previous studies.
4,5  
 Once complete, patients in both groups will fill out a post-intervention STAI , a VAS  for anxiety 
and level of understanding of the Mohs Procedure. In addition, patients will receive an objective 
Mohs Quiz and subjective Satisfaction Survey (Appendices F, G). All of the data collected for the study will be de -identified, HIPPA-compliant and encrypted on a password protected 
Department of Dermat ology server folder.  These secure file folders are restricted and only 
research personnel have access to the files.  In addition to de-identification, encryption and 
password protection, these data are also protected by University Hospitals firewall as wel l. 
 
5.1 Design/Study Type   
We propose a randomized control group format with 50% of patients randomized to the control 
limb and 50% of patients randomized to the experimental group.  
5.2 Selection of Instruments  
Pre-intervention and Post -intervention instruments  
1) State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 
a. The STAI is a well -known, frequently used measure of patient anxiety within the 
clinical setting.
5,8 This form consists of two forms to assess state anxiety and a 
patient’s baseline trait anxiety. Each form consists of 20 Likert-type questions that 
can be easily answered by a patient with an average reading level. Estimated  time 
for completion of these questions is approximately 2 minutes per form. This form 
has been used in 2 studies to date that assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs.5,8 
b. We plan to use the anxiety State F orm Y1, appendix A, at baseline and following 
completion of Stage 1 of MMS.  
c. We plan to use the anxiety Trait F orm Y2, appendix B, at baseline only to compare 
the baseline level of anxiety bet ween the control and experimental groups.  
d. Found in Appendices C, D  
 
2) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
a. The VAS is a frequently employed Likert -type scale that is used to measure 
anxiety.5,8 This 0 -10 scale documents the patients current state of anxiety and can 
be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used in 2 studies to date and 
CASE PRMC 6617  4 3/2/2018 
 previously by experimental team to assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs. 5,8,19 
b. In addition, because of the ease of use this tool has been converted to assess other 
objective measures including understanding. This was previously used by our experimental team to quantify patient’s und erstanding of MMS.
19 
c. We propose to use the VAS for anxiety and understanding at baseline  and following 
completion of the first stage of MMS.   
d. Found in Appendix E  
3) Objective Questionnaire & Patient Satisfaction Survey  
a. We have designed a short,  questionnaire with 6  objective questions related to the 
patient’s understanding of Mohs. This objective portion is to help to delineate objective differences in understanding between the control and experimental groups. This testing was created under the guidance of Dr . Margaret Mann (Mohs 
Surgeon) and similar objective surveys have been used to assess understanding following educational intervention.
12-18 Our estimate  is that this short quiz w ill take 
approximately 3 minutes for patients to complete.  
b. Following the objective questions, patients will be provided 3 subjective questions related to their satisfaction with the explanation of MMS that they received. These subjective questions will be used to help delineate subjective differences between the control and experimental groups. Similar objective surveys have been used to assess satisfaction following educational intervention.
12-18 
c. We propose to hand out this questionnaire following completion of the first stage of MMS.  
d. See Appendix F & G 
 5.3 Description of Interve ntion  
A standardized script including the counselling that patients would receive in both the control and experimental groups is included in the attached study documents. See Appendix A, B . This will 
allow for patients to receive the same information throughout the study, similarly to our  recently 
completed pilot study.
19 Patients in the experimental group will be educated with our 3D printed 
MMS model, in addition to the standardized script.   
5.4 Data Collection   
The same data will be collected from both groups of patients. This information will not include any 
data regarded as protected health information.

5.5 Description of Study Process  
5.51 Instrument  Administration   
The instruments provided are self -administered questionnaires. Patients will be handed these 
questionnaires in private rooms during the study and will be  supervised by the research team . 
Patients will be told about the instruments prior to administration of ea ch questionnaire. Patients 
will be given adequate time to complete each questionnaire provided. 
 5.52 Intervention Administration 
The educational intervention will be completed following baseline testing by the research assistant 
in a private patient room according to the standardized script. If patients have additional questions 
regarding the study at the time of intervention they will be answered by the research assistant. If these questions pertain to the patients ’ medical record, protected health information, or specific 
medical questions related to their MMS procedure the research assistant will defer to the medical team. Patients will receive educational intervention following baseline testing.  
 
5.53 Special Concerns  
If patients would not like to complete the study they can inform the research team at any time and there will be a discontinuation of all study procedures.   
5.54 Compensation  
Patients will not be compensated for participating in this study.  
 
5.55 Adverse  Reactions and Their Management  
 5.56 Reporting Adverse Events  
No adverse events are expected.  
 
5.57 Anticipated  Reactions  
No reactions are anticipated.  
 
5.58 Reaction  Management  
If patients experience additional stress, discomfort, anxiety or other reactions to questionnaires the study can be ended at any time if the patient informs the research personnel . 
 
6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
6.1  
All patients will complete the study protocol on the day of their Mohs procedure. Patients will 
conclude the study protocol following administration of post- stage testing. Following conclusion, 
patients will undergo the remainder of their Mohs procedure according to standard of care. 
 6.2  Several instruments will be used during the study to detect differences between the control and 
experimental group. Our power analysis was designed to determine the number of patients per group required to determine a difference between the control and exper imental group’s results of 
the STAI Form Y1 (Appendix A). This form detects the differences in patient’s current state of 
CASE PRMC 6617  6 3/2/2018 
 anxiety at the time of completion. This form consists of 20 questions, with each question worth 
between 1 -4 points, with patients at m inimum scoring 20 to indicate a minimum level of anxiety 
and 80 to indicate a maximum state of anxiety. Our aim is to detect a minimum difference in the STAI Form Y1 of 5 points between the control and experimental groups.   Based on data from prior studie s
5, we anticipate that the mean STAI score will be approximately 
38.7 +/ - 10. We anticipate that a 6 point difference between the experimental and control groups 
would represent statistical significance. Considering these constrains sample size analysis wa s 
done to determine the number of patients needed to detect a 6 point difference, with a standard deviation of approximately 10, significance set to .05 and power of 80%. Within these constraints we estimate approximately 45 patients would be needed per gr oup using 2- sided T -test (nQuery 
Advisor). Assuming a rate of 10% attrition per every 100 patients, we estimate we will need approximately 50 patients per group during the study.  In a prior pilot study, approximately 7 patients were enrolled per MMS clini c. Based on estimates 
from this study, we anticipate that it will take approximately 12 -20 MMS clinics to recruit patients 
for this intended study. Clinics are held on average 2 days per week, and thus we anticipate completion from 3-5 months from the beginning of the study.  6.3  
In subgroup analysis patients will be stratified based on age, gender, and prior experience with MMS or not. We anticipate that patients who have previously undergone MMS will have lower anxiety scores across all measures and incr eased understanding of the procedure, based on the results of our 
pilot study.  This is anticipated based on the results of the previous pilot study and other literature.
5  
 Patients will be randomly selected according to day of the study, every other day randomization.  We 
anticipate that there will be no significant differences between groups based on age, gender and prior experience with MMS based on randomization protocol. All patients from a given clinic will be 
allocated to the control or experimental group prior to onset of the day.  
 6.5  
If patients are unable to be complete the experimental protocol, their data will be discarded prior to final analysis. Patients may drop out from the study at any time, according to the guidelines of the protocol. Thi s will not impact outcome of their procedure.  
 6.6  
Ineligible patients for the study fall under one or more of the below criteria:  
• Under 18 years of age  
• Over 90 years of age 
• Cannot complete the survey measures independently for any reason  
 6.7  
Statistical analyses for this randomized control trial will be completed under the supervision Dr. Pingfu Fu, Dr. Margaret Mann and Dr. Daniel Popkin. This analysis will use basic statistical measurements in order to determine differences between the contr ol and experimental groups. 
Demographic information including age (but excluding birth date), gender and response to prior 
CASE PRMC 6617  7 3/2/2018 
 MMS treatment will be compared between control and experimental groups. STAI, VAS, 
Objective Questionnaire and Patient Satisfaction Q uestionnaire responses will be recorded and 
results including median and mean data will be determined. Pre - and post -surgery measurements 
will be compared using paired T-test. To compare experimental and control groups, T- test will be 
used after checking n ormality assumption. In addition, to compare subgroups of the experimental 
and control groups (> 2 groups) ANOVA followed by Tukey pairwise procedure will be used. If normality assumption is violated, Wilcoxon rank signed test and Kruskal -Wallis test will be used.  
  6.8 
In patients who did not complete the experimental protocol, data would be discarded as stated previously. If a complete dataset were to be lost for a patient whom completed the entire protocol, data would be handled according to the digression of the study team. In patients missing only one value, median data point would be applied. If patients were missing one or more values, data would need to be discarded.

What is Skin Cancer?  
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer and over one million people in the United States develop skin cancer per year. The majority of these skin cancers are either called either basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), based on the cell type the cancer originates from.  
 Patients will either then be counseled using ¶1 – for BCC    ¶2 – for SCC  
¶1 - for BCC: This is the most common skin cancer and almost never spreads, therefo re it is 
very rarely life threatening. This type of tumor can be very locally destructive and can become problematic when it involves structures on the face and neck. As they increase in size, they become more complex to remove and have the potential to invade into bone and other tissues.  ¶2 - for SCC:  This is the second most common form of skin cancer and has the potential to be 
aggressive, but usually only once they reached a size over 2 cm in diameter.  With this tumor type there is concern for invasion into the surrounding tissue, which is why prompt removal of this type of skin cancer is recommended.   These tumors are commonly described by patients as the “pimple that does not go away” or “scab that just won’t heal” prior to seeking care from a dermat ologist. Often times the tumor has 
been growing for several months to years, prior to recognition by patients and treatment. Although a skin cancer may appear small from the surface, in many cases the cancer undergoes extensive growth below the skin, former, deeper root-like branching patterns and thus the visible tumor maybe only represent the “tip of the iceberg.”  
Why people get skin cancer?  
Long -term exposure to sunlight, especially during the teenage years and early adult decades, is 
the single most important factor in the formation of skin cancer. After years of ultraviolet light 
damage to sun-exposed areas, normal skin cells may transform into cancer cells. As a collective group, these cells will divide more rapidly than the surrounding skin cells, until they become readily visible to patients and dermatologists as a skin cancer.  
 
What are the treatment options for skin cancer?  
Depending on the specific characteristics of your skin cancer, a number of different treatments 
can be used. These treatments include excision of the tumor, curettage and electrodessication, 
and Mohs Surgery.   
What is Mohs Micrographic Surgery?  
Mohs micrographic surgery is the gold treatment of choice in basal and squamous cell 
carcinoma, when they become large in size and/or effect important functional areas like the head and neck. The goals of this procedure are to completely remove the cancer, preserve normal skin function and are to provide an optimal cosmetic result. Overall, this treatment has a 97- 99% cure 
rate for skin cancer.  
  
The Mohs Procedure  
CASE PRMC 6617  12 3/2/2018 
 The Mohs procedure entails a series of repeated “stages” to ensure complete cancer removal. 
During each stage, a layer of tissue is removed, processed and examined under the microscope to determine if any residual cancer remain s.  
 Before the Mohs procedure, an area surrounding the skin cancer will be numbed with local anesthetic. Once numbed, a thin, “saucer-shaped” layer of tissue is removed. A small portion of healthy tissue around the skin cancer is taken, in attempt to clear the tumor during the first stage of the procedure. This takes approximately 5 minutes, after which time your wound will be bandaged. 
 
Figure 1: Left: Demonstrates the irregular appearance of skin cancer compared to healthy tissue.  Middle: Demonstr ates an example of the first 
layer of tissue take during MMS with residual tumor tissue. Right: Demonstrates the residual tumor embedded in the surrounding tissue.  
*Figures included for IRB review board only, demonstrate how models will be used. For more information see supplemental document  
 The tissue specimen is then taken to the lab, marked and processed. Using a map of the cancer cells in relation to the healthy tissue, the surgeon can determine during microscopic examination if there are remaining can cer cells. The entire stage takes about 1 hour. Approximately half of 
patients will need additional stages during the procedure. These stages are completed in a similar manner, which will increase the time needed to complete the procedure.  
 Following complete removal of the cancer, your surgeon will determine the best method to treat your wound. Options include allowing the wound to heal naturally, using stiches to sew the wound closed, using a skin grafting to cover the surgical wound, or by using a flap procedure to close the wound. This will be discussed more extensively with your surgeon during the procedure, based on the size and location of your skin cancer.   
What are the advantages of Mohs? 
The major advantages to Mohs Surgery are that this procedure has the highest cure rate for skin 
cancer, removes a minimal amount of healthy tissue, provides the opportunity to achieve an optimal cosmetic outcome with minimal scarring, and eliminates the need for general anesthesia or hospitalization.   
What are th e risks of Mohs?  
The risks of surgery, as with any trauma to the skin, risks include bleeding, bruising around the 
surgical area, a risk of infection below 1% and local numbness. In addition, there is often a need to extend surgical incisions approximately  3 times the length of the initial incision to facilitate 
optimal closure of the surgical wound. Again, these risks are shared by excisional procedures, whether MMS or non- MMS.

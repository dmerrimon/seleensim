Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   STUDY  SUMMARY    
 
Methodology  Cluster  randomized  crossover  design.  
Coordinating  Center  This study  will be centrally  coordinated  by the Methods  Center  at the 
Center  for Evidence -Based  Orthopaedics  (CEO),  McMa ster 
University,  Hamilton,  Ontario  and by the Administrative  Center  
within  the Department  of Orthopaedics  at the University  of 
Maryland,  R Adams  Cowley  Shock  Trauma  Center,  Baltimore,  
Maryland .  
Clinical  Sites At least 12 clinical  sites. Additional  clinical  sites will be included  or 
removed  as needed.  
Background  The prevention  of infection  is the single  most  important  goal 
influencing  peri-operative  care of patients  with open  fractures.   
Standard  practice  in the management  of open  fractures  includes  
sterile  technique  and pre-operative  skin preparation  with an antiseptic  
solution.  The available  solutions  kill bacteria  and decrease  the 
quantity  of native  skin flora,  thereby  decreasing  surgical  site infection  
(SSI).1–4  While  there  is extensive  guidance  on specific  procedures  
for prophylactic  antibiotic  use and standards  for sterile  technique,  the 
evidence  regarding  the choice  of antiseptic  skin preparation  solution  
is very limited  for open  fracture  surgery.   
Objective s The overall  objective  is to compare  the effect iveness  of aqueous  pre-
operative  antiseptic  skin preparation  with 10% povidone -iodine  
versus  4% chlorhexidine  gluconate  (CHG)  for the management  of 
open  fractures.  A ranked  order  for assessing  effectiveness  will be 
used with surgical  site infection  (SSI)  as the primary  comparison  and 
unplanned  fracture -related  reoperation s as the secondary  
comparison . 
Subgroup  Objectives  We will explore  if the pre-operative  antiseptic  skin solutions  have  
different  magnitudes  of effect  on SSI within  three  clinically  
important  open  fracture  subgroups : severity  of open  fracture,  location  
of fracture,  and severity  of wound  contamination . 
Diagnosis  and Main  
Inclusion  Criteria  All patients 1 8 years of age or older who present to a recruiting 
hospital for treatment of an open fracture (s) of the appendicular 
skeleton will be screened for participation  within 3 weeks of their 
fracture . Eligible patients must receive surgical debridement of their 
open fracture wound (s) within 72 hours of their injury  and the open 
fracture (s) must be managed definitively with a surgical implant ( e.g., 
internal  fixation,  external  fixation,  joint prosthesis,  etc.).

Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019    
  Treatment  Groups   The Aqueous -PREP  trial will compare  two common  iodophor  and 
chlorhexidine  based  pre-operative  antiseptic  skin solutions  used 
during  open  fracture  surgery:  1) Povidone -iodine:  10% povidone -
iodine  (1% free iodine)  in purified  water  and 2) CHG : 4% 
chlorhexidi ne gluconate  in purified  water.  
Randomization  Treatment  allocation  will be determined  using  a cluster -randomized  
crossover  trial design.  The order  of treatment  allocation  for each 
orthopaedic  practice will be randomly  assigned  using  a computer -
generated  randomization  table.  Each  site will start with the initially  
allocated  study  solution  and eventually  crossover  to the other  solution  
for their second  recruitment  period.  This process  of alternating  
treatments  will repeat  approximately  every  2 months  as dictated  by 
the initial  randomization.   
Study  Outcomes  The primary  outcome  is SSI, guided  by the Centers  for Disease  
Control  and Prevention’s  (CDC ) National  Healthcare  Safety  Network  
reporting  criteria,5 which  includes  superficial  incisional  SSI within  
30 days and deep  incisional  or organ/space  SSI within  90 days of 
definitive  fracture  management  surgery . The second ary outcome  is 
the occurrence  of an unplanned  fracture -related  reoperation  within  12 
months  of the fracture .  Alternative  definitions  of SSI, including  the 
confirmatory  criteria  for Fracture -Related  Infection  (FRI)  and the 
CDC  criteria  within  1 year of injury  will be used for sensitivity  
analyses  of the primary  comparison.  All study  outcomes  will be 
adjudicated  by a blinded  committee  using  clinical  notes  and 
radiographs .  
Follow -Up  Study  participants  will be followed  at 6 weeks,  3 months,  6 months,  
9 months,  and 12 months  from  their fracture .  
Sample  Size A minimum  of 1,540  participants  with open  fractures.   
Significance  SSIs are often devastating complications for open fracture patients 
because of the resultant reoperations , adverse events from antibiotic 
courses,  and fracture healing difficulties.  Given the severity of open 
fractures, maximizing the effectiveness of current prophylactic 
procedure s is essential. The Aqueous -PREP trial will provide 
necessary evidence to guide the prevention of SSIs in open fractures , 
and the trial is poised to have a significant impact on the care and 
outcomes of open extremity fracture patients .

Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Open  Fractures  
Open  fractures  represent  some  of the most  severe  musculoskeletal  injuries .6 Due to their high-
energy mechanisms,  these  extremity  fractures  are accompanied  by soft-tissue  injuries  that 
contribute  to unacceptably  poor outcomes.  The Fluid  Lavage  of Open  Wounds  (FLOW)  trial of 
2,447  open  fracture  patients  reported  a 13.2% incidence  of open  fracture -related reoperations ; 7 
however,  these  study  events  were  even  more  common  in open  wounds  with severe  contamination  
(29.8%, 95% confidence  interval  (CI): 22.6–38.1% ) and in patients  with higher  grades  of injury  
(Gustilo -Anderson  Type  III: 18.0%, 95% CI: 15.6–20.7% ).  Ultimately,  complications  from  open  
fractures  lead to prolonged  morbidity,  loss of function,  and potential  limb loss.8  
 
1.2 Prevention  of Infection  
The preventio n of infection  is the single  most  important  goal influencing  peri-operative  care of 
patients  with open  fractures . Standard  practice  in the management  of open  fractures  includes  sterile  
technique  and pre-operative  skin cleaning  with an antiseptic  solution . The available  solutions  kill 
bacteria  and decrease  the quantity  of native  skin flora,  thereby  decreas ing surgical  site infection  
(SSI).1–4  While  there  is extensive  guidance on specific  procedures  for prophylactic  antibiotic  use 
and standards  for sterile  technique,  the evidence  regarding  the choice  of antiseptic  skin preparation  
solution  is very limited  for open  fracture  surgery.   
 
1.3 Rationale  for Pre-Operative  Antisept ic Skin Solution  Prophylaxis  
The most common skin preparation  solutions include either an iodophor or chlorhexidine -based 
active ingredient, and are delivered in an alcohol or aqueous -based solution. Iodophors  achieve  
effective  antisepsis  by penetrating  the cell wall of microorganisms  and disrupting  critical  protein  
and nucleic  acid structures.9 Iodophors  are effective  against  most  bacteria,  but also may have  
broad er-spectrum  coverage  of mycobacteria,  viruses,  and some  spores  compared  to chlorhexidine  
gluconate  (CHG).9 CHG  similarly  achieves  antimicrobial  effects  by penetrating  the cell wall of 
microorganisms.  This antimicrobial  action  allows  CHG  to be effective  against  most  bacteria .9 
 
The evidence guiding pre -operative antiseptic skin solution  choice in fracture surgery is largely 
extrapolated from other surgical disciplines. In a randomized control led trial involving 849 patients 
undergoing clean -contaminated abdominal, gynecologic, or urologic surgery, the use of 2% CHG 
in 70% isoprop yl alcohol was compared to aqueous 10% povidone -iodine . The overall rate of 30 -
day SSI was significantly lower in the CHG -alcohol group  than the povidone -iodine group (9.5% 
vs. 16.1%; P=0.004; relative risk, 0.59; 95% CI: 0.41–0.85). While this study demon strated 
superior efficacy of CHG -alcohol compared to povidone -iodine, comparing an alcohol based 
solution to an aqueous solution  creates uncertainty  about whether the result observed occurred 
from the superiority of CHG over  iodine, isopropyl alcohol over water, or a synergistic 
combination  of CHG with alcohol.1  In an effort to  overcome the controversies associated with 
comparing CHG and iodine in different solutions, a  more recent randomized controlled trial  of 
1,147 caesarean section patients  allocated patients to 2% CHG with 70% isopropyl alcohol versus 
8.3% povidone -iodine w ith 72.5% isopropyl alcohol. Similar to the previous randomized 
controlled trial , CHG proved more efficacious for reducing 30 -day SSI (4.0% in the CHG -alcohol 
group and 7.3% in the iodine -alcohol group; relative risk, 0.55; 95% CI: 0.34–0.90; P=0.02).2   
 
Page  8 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   While the evidence from  the above two randomized controlled trials  demonstrate decreased SSI 
from CHG solutions in  clean -contaminated abdominal and genito -urinary surgery , a larger n on-
randomized trial reported opposite effectiveness results. Swenson et al., completed a larger 3,209 
patient pragmatic sequential implementation study, in which the use of the preoperative skin 
antiseptic solution was changed after six -month periods.4 In this study, there were three treatment 
periods, each wit h approximately 1,000 general surgery patients  undergoing elective and emergent 
cases . In the first period, patients received 7.5% povidone -iodine  scrub, 70% isopropyl alcohol 
scrub, and 10% povidone -iodine skin paint. The second group received 2% CHG with  70% 
isopropyl alcohol (CHG group), and the third group received  0.7%  iodine povacrylex in 74% 
isopropyl alcohol.  Adjusted comparisons were performed using the intention to treat principle and 
an as -treated analysis. Lower SSI rates were seen in the povido ne-iodine skin paint group (4.8%) 
and the iodine povacrylex in isopropyl alcohol group (4.8%), compared with the SSI rates in the 
2% chlorhexidine and 70% isopropyl alcohol group (8.2%) ( P< 0.05 ; povidone -iodine skin paint 
odds ratio: 0.56, 95% CI : 0.40–0.79).4 While the results of the Swenson study contradict those of 
the smaller randomized controlled trials , this large pragmatic study further highlights that the 
choice of antiseptic skin solution affects SSIs, and data to select the be st solution remains 
conflicting.  
 
Considering  the conflicting data, t he most recent Cochrane systematic review comparing the 
efficacy of pre -operative antiseptic skin soluti ons for clean surgery concluded , “investment in at 
least one large trial (in terms of participants) is warranted to add definitive and hopefully 
conclusive data to the current evidence base. Ideally any future trial would evaluate the iodine -
containing and chlorhexidine -containing solutions relevant to current practice…”10 The Cochrane 
recommendation is a direct response to the limitations of the current available literature comparing 
antiseptic skin solutions . For orthopaedic fracture surgery, the impact of the treatment uncertainty 
is furt her magnified when considering  the higher rates of SSIs among open fracture patients.  
 
1.4 Extrapolating  Evidence  from  Other  Surgical  Disciplines  to Fracture  Surgery  is Problematic  
With regard s to orthop aedic patients, the inconsistent results leave the optimal antiseptic solution 
in doubt ; in addition, results may differ across surgical settings . The risk of SSI is substantially 
greater in open fracture patients due to both the nature of the injury and the required surgery to fix 
broken bones. Furthermore, t he emergent nature of fracture s urgery means that patients are unable 
to undergo other prophylactic skin care , such as CHG bathing, which  is rendered to elective cases 
to reduce SSI.  
 
Most important, the contaminat ion from the injury  is a critical difference from elective abdominal 
or gynecologic surgery. Other  differences include substantial soft tissue damage during the injury, 
the use of a tourniquet that decreases the blood flow to the limb (potentially increasing the risk of 
infec tion), and the additional risk of implanting metal fixation that can harbor bacteria. Swenson 
et al., directly acknowledged that the studies performed in general surgery patients may not apply 
to other specialties, particularly orthopaedic surgery.4 Even if one wanted to directly apply the 
conflicting results outlined above to the care of open fractures , there are critical limitations in the 
sparse general surgery and obstetrical literature available.  
 
The most significant limitation in  the existing literature is the use of a 30 -day endpoint for SSI in 
all three studies described above.1,2,4 While this may be acceptable for identifying most SSIs that 
Page  9 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   involve only the skin (superficial SSI), infections that occur deep to the muscle and around the 
bone (deep SSI  and organ/space SSI ) often present beyond 30 -days post -injury  and have 
significantly more morbidity and mortality than superficial SSI . This is a major limitation to the 
external validity of the previous studies’ ability to guide fracture fixation practice. In the FLOW 
open fracture  trial, nearly half the infection -related complications were identified between 30  and 
90 days from injury .7 Not only does the existing literature not extend follow -up during this period, 
it is plausible that the treatment effects of the antiseptic solutions behave differently for preventing 
deep or organ/space infections that often present between 30 and 90 days post-surgery. The  need 
for longer follow -up is supported by a mandatory 90 -day surveillance period for deep and 
organ/space SSIs according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) .5 Therefore, 
the lack of directly applicable evidence, an overall paucity of good clinical evidence, and the 
inadequate duration of outcome follow -up mandate the need for a large, rigorous clinical trial in 
surgical preparation solutions in open fracture care.  
 
1.5 Why  Iodophor  Skin Preparations  May Reduce  Open  Fracture  SSI 
The only surgical skin prep aration  effectiveness data available for open fractu re management come 
from the  FLOW trial.7 Secondar y multivariable  analyses  of 2,447  patients  with open  fractures  
found  that when compared  to chlorhexidine  solutions,  iodophor -based  skin antiseptic  preparation  
solutions  could  be protective  against  complications  (Adjusted  Hazard  Ratio  0.88,  95% CI: 0.69–
1.12).7 However,  the wide  CI suggests  iodophor  solutions  may reduce  the odds  of infection  by as 
much  as 31% or increase  it by as much  as 12%,  leaving  its superiority  as a fracture  care surgical  
preparation  solution  unresolved.7 
 
There are several chemical properties to suggest povidone -iodine may  be more effective than CHG  
at prevent ing open fracture SSI.9 Firstly , povidone -iodine has a broader spectrum of antimicrobial 
activity .9 Secondly, m any open fracture patients require repeat surgical deb ridement and therefore , 
these patients will receive multiple exposures to the pre -operative antiseptic solution . Extended 
use of povidone -iodine has not been associated with the selection of resistant bacterial strains , 
whereas bacterial resistance to chlo rhexidine has been documented.9,11,12 While the methods for 
detecting CHG resistance are  challenging and its clinical significance remains uncertain, these 
early observations heighten interest in establishing the comparative effectiveness of iodophors 
versus CHG. 
 
1.6 Why  Iodophor  Skin Preparations  May Reduce  Open  Fracture  Reoperations  
While the primary rationale for using antiseptic skin preparation solutions is to reduce the risk of 
SSI, many  fracture healing complications are associated with indolent infections.  These low -grade 
infections typically do not exhibit clinical  signs consistent with SSI. Instead, they present several 
months post -fracture fixation and are only detected from deep tissue samples collected during 
secondary surgeries to treat fracture s that  fail to heal (nonunion).  Previous fracture non -union 
studies  have identified an infectious etiology in 31–38% of cases.13,14 Similarly, results from the 
FLOW trial suggest that 58% of the reoperation events were caused by fracture nonunion or a 
hardware failure related to infection, w ound -healing problem, or bone -healing problem (n= 
188/323). In addition , among a series of 211 patients requiring reoperation for deep post -operative 
fracture infections, 40% of open fracture infections occurred beyond the 90 -day surveillance 
period for SSI.15 Therefore, give n the rat ionale that povidone -iodine may  be more effective in 
Page  10 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   preventing SSI, it is clinically plausible that its use may also reduce unplanned open fracture 
reoperations.  
 
1.7 Lack  of Surgeon  Consensus  
The FLOW trial demonstrated a clear divide among orth opaedic surgeons regarding their choice 
to use the two most common antiseptic solutions during open fracture fixation surgery.7 Iodophor 
solutions  were used in 54% of the surgeries performed , while 41% were performed using 
chlorhexidine solutions . The remaining surgeons either used both iodophor and chlorhexidine 
(4%), or alcoho l with no iodophor or chlorhexidine (1%).7 Building upon the lack of consensus 
among orthopaedic surgeons participating in the FLOW trial, our research team conducted an 
internet -based survey and several interviews with orthopaedic surgeons to understand the reasons 
for the lack of consensus in th e use of surgical preparation solutions . Similar to the observations 
of the FLOW trial, there was nearly an equal split between the use of iodophor and chlorhexidine 
solutions. More insight was gained in interviews with the surgeons . Three main drivers for  surgeon 
decision -making  were identified : 1) they continued to use the antiseptic solution shown to them 
during their surgical training, 2) they used the solution recommended by their hospital, or 3) they 
felt the tissue toxicity was less with their chosen  solution . No surgeon could cite a clinical study 
that helped guide their decision, despite all surgeons indicating they believed the antiseptic 
solution was important for reducing their patient’s risk of SSI. Limited consensus among surgeons 
reflects a la ck of compelling evidence on the optimal approaches to surgical skin preparation, 
further vindicating the need for a large definitive trial.  
 
The Aqueous -PREP  trial,  A Pragmatic  Randomized  trial Evaluating  Pre-operative  aqueous  
antiseptic  skin solutions  in open  fracture s, will address  these  gaps in the literature.  
 
2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVE S AND  HYPOTHES ES 
 
2.1 Study  Objective s and Hypothes es 
The overarching  objective  of this trial is to compare  the effectiveness  of an aqueous  pre-operative  
antiseptic  skin preparation  with 10% povidone -iodine  versus  4% CHG  for the management  of open  
fractures.  A ranked  order  for assessing  effectiveness  will be used,  with surgical  site infection  (SSI)  
as the primary  comparison  (primary  objective)  and unplanned  fracture -related  reoperations  as the 
secondary  comparison  (secondary  objective).  While  previous  randomized  controlled  trials  in 
general  surgery  and gynecology  demonstrated  superior  efficacy  of chlorhexidine -alcohol  solutions  
to reduce  SSIs,1,2 results  from  larger  populations  of general  surgery  patients  and the recently  
completed  FLOW  trial7 suggest  iodophor -based  solutions  could  be more  effective  than 
chlorhexidine  in open  fracture  patients.  Therefore,  we hypothesize  that aqueous  solutions  of 10% 
povidone -iodine will be more  effective  than aqueous  4% CHG  to reduce  90-day SSIs or unplanned  
fracture -related  reoperations  within  one year of injury . 
 
2.2 Subgroup  Objectives  
The Aqueous -PREP  trial will also explore  the possibility  of differential  treatment  effects  of the 
pre-operative  antiseptic  skin solutions  among  clinically  important  open  fracture  subgroups.  
Subgroups  will be defined  by: i) the severity  of open  fracture  (Gustilo -Anderson  type I or II versus  
III);8 ii) upper  extremity  versus  lower  extremity  open  fractures;  and iii) severity  of wound  
contamination . High -grade  soft tissue  injury  (Gustilo -Anderson  type III), lower  extremity  open  
Page  11 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   fractures,  and moderate/severe  wound  contamination  are established  predictors  of SSI and 
reoperations  from  the FLOW  trial.16 In addition,  there  are known  differences  in patients ’ skin flora  
based  on anatomic  region  of injury.  As a result,  it is likely  that the study  interventions  may be 
more  effective  in certain  subgroups . Due to its broader  spect rum of antimicrobial  activity , the 
increased  effectiveness  observed  by Swenson  et al., and the possible  benefits  observed  in the 
FLOW  trial, we hypothesize  that 10% povidone -iodine  antiseptic  skin solution  will be associated  
with a larger  reduction  in odds  for SSI and reoperation  in open  fracture  patients  with worse  fracture  
severity , lower  extremity  fractures,  and more  sever ely contaminated  wounds . 
 
3.0 TRIAL  DESIGN  
 
3.1 Summary  
This study is a multi -center pragmatic cluster randomized crossover trial of a minimum of 1,540 
participants with open extremity fractures requiring surgical management . The unit of 
randomization is the orthopaedic practices  within clinical sites  (clusters), with individual patients 
being the unit of analysis.  Recruitment for each treatment group will be performed in multiple 
iterations of approximately two -month periods. Each orthopaedic practice  will initially be 
randomized to use one of  two pre-operative  aqueous  surgical skin preparation  solutions (10% 
povidone -iodine or 4% CHG ) for open fracture surgeries at their institution  (Figure 1 ). Upon 
completion of the two -month period, each orthopaedic practice will crossover to the alternative  
treatment allocation and complete another two -month recruitment period. This process of 
alternating treatment periods (crossovers) will continue until the minimum sample size is achieved 
and the study’s budgeted recruitmen t duration is completed. Upon completion of recruitment, it is 
expected that each orthopaedic practice  will enroll a minimum of 77 patients  per treatment, and 
that m ost clinical sites  will exceed this minimum recruitment goal . Clinical site personnel will 
screen potential p atients  for eligibility , and if eligible, they will be invited to participate in the trial. 
Study participants will be assessed at regular intervals in the one year following their fracture . The 
primary outcome will include any SSI event  from the time of open fracture to  the end of the 30- 
and 90 -day post -operative periods from their definitive fracture management surgery . The 
second ary outcome will include unplanned fracture -related reoperati ons that occur within one -year 
of their fracture. A blinded Adjudication Committee will review SSIs and unplanned fracture -
related reoperations to confirm that they meet the criteria for being a study event.

3.2 Pragmatic -Explanatory  Continuum  
In accordance with recommended methodology standards, we have used the PRagmatic -
Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary (PRECIS -2) toolkit to evaluate the Aqueous -PREP  
trial design decisions to determine whether these decisions will lead to a study that a nswers, “Does 
this intervention work under usual conditions?” (pragmatic) versus “Can this intervention work 

Page  12 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   under ideal conditions?” (explanatory). The PRECIS -2 tool uses a 5 -point Likert scale in 9 
domains to evaluate the continuum of design choices. A d omain score of 5 indicates “very 
pragmatic,” while a score of 1 suggests “very explanatory.” Table 1  outlines the investigators’ 
assessment of the trial design and the rationale for each assessed score  and Figure 2  displays the 
PRECIS -2 wheel . 
 
Table 1: PR ECIS -2 Score  
Domain  Score  Rationale  
Eligibility  5 Eligibility criteria are very broad and include all fracture patients that would be 
treated in all hospital environments.  
Recruitment  5 Recruitment of all consenting fracture patients treated at each participating 
hospital will be performed.  
Setting  4 Recruitment is occurring at multiple sites across the US  and Canada ; however, 
since most of the recruiting hospitals are regional referral centers the setting is 
“mostly pragmatic .” 
Organization  5 The interventions do not need an increase in providers or care delivery 
compared to the usual antiseptic care provided. For each antiseptic solution, a 
brief in-service training session will be provided to the clinical sites , as per any 
new product/procedure that is being introduced into an operating room.  
Flexibility (delivery)  5 The interventions will be delivered in the usual care manner with no advice on 
allowed co -interventions or strict protocols to ensure compliance.  
Flexibility (adh erence)  - This section is left blank according to PRECIS -2 guidance because the 
intervention is provided prior to patient consent and individual patient 
compliance is not an issue. If provider adherence is considered, the study design 
is rather pragmatic ( 4) because there will be limited encouragement to follow 
the manufacturer’s directions for use, other than periodic newsletters, 
investigator meetings, and possible provider survey during the recruitment 
period.  
Follow -up 5 All study follow -up is consistent with usual care.  
Primary outcome  5 The outcome has been validated by patients as being very relevant to the study 
participants and it does not require specialized expertise beyond the treating 
physician for diagnosis.  
Primary analysis  5 All available study data will be used for analysis following the intention to treat 
principle.

4.0 METHODS  
 
4.1 Study  Setting , Cluster  Eligibility,  and Selection  of Clusters  
This study  will be coordinated  by the Methods  Center  at the Center  for Evidence -Based  
Orthopaedics  (CEO),  McMaster  University,  Hamilton,  Ontario  and by the Administrative  Cent er 
within  the Department  of Orthopaedics  at the University  of Maryland  School  of Medicine , R 
Adams  Cowley  Shock  Trauma  Center,  Baltimore,  Maryland . Patients  will be enrolled  from  at least 
12 clinical  sites.  Clusters  (orthopaedic  practices  within  clinical  sites)  will be carefully  screened  
prior  to participation  in the Aqueous -PREP  study.  Clinical  site inclusion  criteria  are: 1) adequate  
research  personnel  infrastructure  to manage  the study ; 2) adequate  open  fracture  volume  to 
complete  enrol lment  within the study  timeline  (i.e., a minimum  of 77 open  fractures  per year) ; 3) 
commitment  from  all or most  orthopaedic  surgeons  to participate  in the trial;  and 4) ability  to use 
the two aqueous -based  preparation  solutions . The exclusion  criteria  are: 1) lack of interest  in the 
trial;  2) anticipated  challenges  with complying  with the protocol;  3) conflicting  studies,  in the 
judgment  of the Principal  Investigators,  that would  inhibit  patient  participation;  and 4) budgeting  
or contract  constraints.   
 
The screening  process  will begin  with potential  clinical  sites completing  a feasibility  questionnaire  
that asks about  research  experience  and infrastructure,  open  fracture  volume,  current  practice  
patterns,  and interest  in particip ating  in the trial. Clinical  sites that meet  the eligibility  criteria  at 
this stage  will be invited  to participate  in a series  of teleconferences  to review  study  and clinical  
logistics  in detail  with members  of the study  team.  The Principal  Investigators  and study  personnel  

Page  14 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   will further  vet the clinical  sites during  these  calls and will ask about  hospital  and patient  
demographics  to ensure  that a variety  of fracture  patient  populations  and referral  patterns,  ranging  
from  large  urban  trauma  centers  to rural  community  hospitals,  are included  in the Aqueous -PREP  
study.  Study  personnel  will document  reasons  for clinical  site ineligibility.  Upon  selection,  clinical  
sites will be asked  to complete  a questionnaire  that will detail  current  surgeon  preferences  and 
practices  for pre-operative  surgical  preparation  techniques  and co-interventions  known  to 
influence  the incidence  of SSIs (see Section  4.7). 
 
4.2 Eligibility  Criteria  
Broad  eligibility criteria will be used to increase the generalizability of the trial.   
  
The inclusion criteria are:  
1. Patients  18 years  of age or older.  
2. Open  fracture  of the appendicular  skeleton . 
3. Received  or will receive  definitive  fracture  treatment  with a surgical  implant(s)  (e.g.,  
internal  fixation , external  fixation , joint prosthesis , etc.). 
4. Open  fracture  wound  management  that includes  formal  surgical  debridement  within  72 
hours  of their injury.  
5. Will have  all planned  fracture  care surgeries  performed  by a participating  surgeon  or 
delegate . 
6. Informed  consent  obtained . 
7. Patient  enrolled  within  3 weeks  of their fracture.  
 
The exclusion criteria are:  
1. Patients  that did not or will not receive  the allocated  pre-operative  surgical  preparation  
solution  due to a medical  contraindication.  
2. Received  previous  surgical  debridement  or management  of their open  fracture  at a non-
participating  hospital  or clinic.  
3. Open  fracture  managed  outside  of the participating  orthopaedic  service  (e.g.,  hand  fracture  
managed  by plastic  surgeon).   
4. Chronic  or acute  infection  at or near the fracture  site at the time of initial  fracture  surgery . 
5. Burns  at the fracture  site. 
6. Incarceration.  
7. Expected  injury  survival  of less than 90 days. 
8. Terminal  illness  with expected  survival  less than 90 days. 
9. Previous  enrollment  in a PREP -IT trial. 
10. Currently  enrolled  in a study  that does not permit  co-enrol lment.  
11. Unable  to obtain  informed  consent  due to language  barriers.  
12. Likely  problems,  in the judgment  of study  personnel,  with maintaining  follow -up with the 
patient.  
13. Excluded  due to sampling  strategy.  
 
Additional  eligibility  considerations:  
1. Patients  with multiple  open  fractures  will be eligible  for inclusion . Study personnel  will 
collect  data on up to three  open  fracture  regions .  In patients  with more  than three  open  
fracture  regions,  the treating  surgeon  will determine  the three  most  sever e open  fractures . 
Page  15 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   For each open  fracture,  the entire  injured  anatomic  region will be included .17 Therefore,  if 
there  are two open  fractures  that anatomically  communicate,  they will be considered  within  
the same  region  (e.g. within  the shoulder  region,  forearm,  etc.).  Similarly,  adjacent  closed  
fractures  that anatomically  communicate  with the open  fracture  or are treated  within  the 
same  surgical  incision  will be included . Common  examples  of these  include  forearm  
fractures,  tibia/fibula  fractures,  and peri-articular  fractures.  The anatomic  joint region,  
adjacent  fractures,  and contiguous  wounds  will be defined  at the time of patient  enrollment  
on the case report  forms  (CRFs) .  
2. All open  fractures  should  be treated  as per cluster  randomization.     
3. At the time of screening,  patients  who are in another  study  who meet  eligibility  criteria  are 
to be included  in the Aqueous -PREP  trial unless  the other  trial does not permit  co-
enrollment . 
 
4.3 Recruitment  Strategy   
4.3.1  Patient  Screening  and Consent  
Patients  18 years  of age or older  who present  to a recruiting  hospital  for treatment  of an open  
fracture will be screened  for participation  within  3 weeks  of their fracture . To screen  patients  
presenting  with an open  fracture (s) for eligibility,  designated  study  personnel  at each clinical  site will 
develop  a patient  enrol lment  plan.  This plan will typically  consist  of daily  participation  in orthopaedic  
patient  rounds  and a review  of daily  listings  of hospital  admissions  for patients with open  fractures.  
Upon  identification,  the study  personnel  will screen  the patient  for eligibility  and if eligible,  approach  
them  for informed  consent.  Study  participants  must  be enrolled  within  3 weeks  of their fracture (s) 
and enrol lment  may take place at any time within  this window.   If the patient  is unable  to provide  
informed  consent  (e.g.,  due to their injury)  at the time they were  initially  identified,  informed  consent  
may be delayed  until they are able to provide  informed  consent.  Alternativel y, if the patient  is unable  
to provide  informed  consent,  informed  consent  may be obtained  from  their proxy , with consent  
obtained  from  the patient  when/if  the patient  is able to provide  consent.  Allowing  informed  consent  
from  a patient’s  proxy  healthcare  decision  maker  will reduce  the risk of recruitment  bias against  the 
most  severely  injured  patients.  In addition , potentially  eligible  patients  will be approached  to 
participate  in the trial, even  if they did not receive  the correct  pre-operative  antiseptic  skin solution.  
This is consistent  with the intention -to-treat principle  (ITT)  and is necessary  to maintain  the 
prognostic  balance  achieved  during  the cluster  randomization.  All screened  patients  will be 
classified  as included,  excluded , or missed . See Table  2 below  for the Schedule  of Events.

Informed consent and enrollment  must occur  within the 3 weeks  (21 days)  from the patient’s fracture  (Day 0 is the 
date of the fracture) .  
Visits  are to be completed at routine clinic visits . When necessary, v isits may also be completed by telephone , text, 
email , standard mail,  and/or a review of the participant’s medical record.  
Follow -up visit windows touch so that participants will always fall into a specific window.  The windows  are: 4 to 8 
weeks  (i.e., 28 to 56 days) , 2 to 4 .5 months  (i.e., 57 to 137 days) , 4.5 to 7.5 months  (i.e., 138 to 228 days) , 7.5 to 12 
months  (i.e., 229 to 36 5 days) , and greater than 12 months  (i.e., 366 to 730 days ), respectively, from the participant’s 
fracture . 
 
4.3.2  Enrollment  Sampling  Plan 
When the volume of eligible patients exceeds a participating site’s ability to effectively enroll and 
follow all eligible patients , a sampling strategy may be implemented.  A sampling strategy is 
available within the REDCap Cloud electronic data capture (E DC) system which will randomly 
determine whether an eligible patient should be approached for consent and inclusion in the study . 
The randomization software will use randomly selected block sizes consistent with the sampling 
ratio being used during the rec ruitment periods. Examples of potential random sampling strategies 
a site may use include:   
 
1. For every three eligible patients, there will be one excluded eligible patient (3:1 ratio).  
2. For every two eligible patients, there will be one excluded eligible patient (2:1 ratio).  
3. For each eligible patient, there will be one excluded eligible patient (1:1 ratio).  
4. For each eligible patient, there will be two excluded eligible patients (1:2 ratio).  
5. For each eligible patient, there will be three excluded eligible patients (1:3 ratio).  
 
The number of eligible patients approached for consent and inclusion in the study , and the number 
of eligible patients that  are excluded due to a sampling  strategy will be documented in the EDC 
system.  
 
4.4 Randomization  Methods   
Treatment allocation will be determined using a cluster -randomized crossover trial design . The 
order of treatment allocation for each orthopaedic practice (cluster)  will be randomly assigned 
using a computer -generated  randomization table . Each site will start with the initially allocated 
study solution and  crossover to the other solution for their second recruitment period.  This process 
of alternating treatments will repe at approximately every 2 month s as dictated by the in itial 
randomizat ion.  For sites that enroll for more than 1 year , the order of treatment allocation may be 
reverse d after 12 months to ensure equal distribution of each treatment across each calendar month 
Page  17 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   in the study’s duration  (Figure 1 ). Randomization will be completed by personnel at the  CEO 
Methods Center  at the onset of the trial. Personnel from the Methods Center  will notify  personnel  
at each participating clinical site of their treatment allocation order.  This will allow each 
participating clinical site to begin preparing for the first run -in period.  
 
4.5 Blinding  
The orthopaedic  team  (including  the study  coordinators)  cannot  be blinded  to the treatment  
allocation  as the antiseptic  solutions  are visually  distinguishable  and these  individuals  need  to lead 
the implementation  of the cluster -crossover  protocol  at their clinical  site. The Adjudication  
Committee  Members  and data analysts  will be blinded  to the study  treatment.  All interpretation  of 
study  results  will initially  be done  in a blinded  manner  by developing  two interpretations  of the 
results.  One interpretation  will assume  treatment  A is povidone -iodine,  the other  interpretation  will 
assume  it is CHG.  Once  the data interpretations  for each assumption  are finalized,  the data will be 
unblinded  and the correct  interpretation  will be accepted.18  
 
4.6 Description  of the Interventions   
4.6.1  Initial  Run-In Phase  
Prior to initiating patient recruitment, each clinical site will begin using their assigned pre -
operative antiseptic skin solution for  eligible open fracture surgeries (run-in period)  to ensure that 
acceptable compliance is met before initiating participant enrol lment . Acceptable compliance 
during the run -in phase will be defined as at least 1 5 eligible open fracture patients with >90% of 
eligible patients receiving the allocated antis eptic solution  or a minimum of one month in duration . 
The run -in phase may be extended up to 3 months, as deemed necessary by the CEO  Methods 
Center. Study personnel  at each clinical site  will document compliance with administering the 
allocated treatment  during the run -in phase and submit this weekly to the CEO Methods Center . 
Specifically , the weekly reports will include the total number of eligible open fracture patients 
operated on, the proportion who received the assigned pre -operative antiseptic skin solution, and 
the proportion who did not receive the assigned pre -operative antiseptic skin solution along with 
details about the deviations (e.g. , name of attending surgeon, solution used, rationale for not using 
the assigned pre -operative  antiseptic skin solution).  This portion of the study protocol is for quality 
assurance during the initial implementation of the trial procedures.  Open fracture surgeries 
reviewed during the run-in phase will not be included in the trial.  Similarly, thes e patients will not 
be approached for informed consent and n o individual patient -level data will be submitted.  CEO 
Methods Center  personnel will review the weekly reports with each of the clinical sites and 
develop strategies, as needed, to ensure acceptab le compliance during the run -in phase . This 
weekly communication will prevent any delays in transitioning to the participant enrol lment phase.  
 
4.6.2  First Intervention  Phase  
Once the initial  run-in phase is completed, participant recruitment will begin with the clinical sites 
continuing to use the same pre-operative antiseptic skin solution for all eligible open fracture 
surgeries  for a two -month period.  Patients will receive the initially allocate d treatment solution for 
all of their open fracture management surgeries, including repeat planned surgeries , even if a 
planned subsequent surgery  occurs during a recruitment period using the non -allocated solution. 
Participating clusters will ideally  be ab le to enroll a minimum of 77 open fracture patients per 
treatment over the total study recruitment duration , and it is anticipated that most  recruiting centers 
will exce ed this minimum goal. Methods Center  personnel will continue to monitor compliance 
Page  18 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   with the assigned pre -operative antiseptic skin solution  over the enrol lment phase  and work 
collaboratively with the clinical sites to minimize cases in which a patient receives the incorrect 
solution . These monitoring activities will coincide with site -specif ic procedures to maintain 
compliance for all patients, even those requiring multiple surgical procedures. If an open fracture 
requires multiple surgeries and the correct solution is not applied at each procedure, the patient 
will remain in the study and be  analyzed using the  allocated solution  (ITT principle ). 
 
4.6.3 Second  Intervention  Phase   
Once the first intervention phase is completed, each site will crossover to the opposite study 
solution. There will be no run -in phase for the second solution  and each site will need to develop 
local procedures to ensure a successful crossover. Example procedures to minimize carry -forward 
of first solution  into the second solution  phase include: 1) removing the bottles of the first solution  
from the orthopaedic operating rooms; 2) changing study posters and notifications within the 
operating rooms; and 3) performing the crossover during the middle of the week to provide a few 
days’ notice to the operating room staff and to avoid contamination of recent open fracture patients  
returning for repeat procedures  (e.g., weekend admissions) . The enrollment goals and procedures 
will mirror the first intervention phase . Methods Center  personnel will continue to monitor 
compliance with the assigned pre -operative antiseptic skin solution over the enrol lment phase and 
work collaboratively with the clinical sites to reduce the risk of contamination .  
 
4.6.4  Special  Considera tions for Ongoing  Treatment  Crossovers  
Treatment allocation will continue to alternate between the study solutions, as outlined above, for 
the remainder of study duration. Each intervention phase will be approxim ately 2 months in 
duration, as agreed upon by th e local site and CEO Methods Center personnel. The duration may 
be modified to avoid crossovers on holidays, weekends, and other circumstances that could 
threaten a successful crossover. The expected recruitment duration for the trial is  approximately  
24 m onths; however, some sites may have a shorter  total recruitment duration  (e.g., a participating 
site who joins the trial later , high volume  clinical sites , etc. ). The two -month enrol lment periods 
will help account for seasonal variability in SSI incidence  and their associated infectious 
organisms,19 as each crossover period will cover a season . In addition,  for those clinical sites 
enrolling beyond 12 months, the distribution of recruitment periods for each solution may be 
seasonally matched  by reversing the  order of the  alternating allocation after 12 months of 
recruitment.   
 
4.6.5  Evaluation  of Site Performance  and Removal  of Clinical  Sites  
After every two recruitment periods (approximately every four month s), each site will be evaluated 
for continued participation in the trial. Sites with < 90% of eligible patients receiving the allocated 
solution, differential adherence between study solutions, < 95% follow -up of the primary outcome,  
<90% follow -up of the se condary outcome,  incomplete data submission, or other threats to data 
quality or the validity of the study may be withdrawn from the trial. In the event a site is withdrawn, 
data collection will be completed for all enrolled pa rticipants  and these data will be included in the 
final study analysis.  
 
4.6.6 Application  of Pre-Operative  Antiseptic  Skin Solutions  
Each solution wil l be applied to the injured area  in accordance with the Food and Drug 
Administration  (FDA) and Health Canada approved manufacturer’s direction s for use. While the 
Page  19 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   application and minimum drying time for both study solutions are very similar,  local study 
personnel will provide standardized in -service (training) for orthopaedic surgeons, operating room 
technicians, and nurses at each participating hospital prior to the run -in phases for each of the  two 
randomized interventions. This training should include review ing the manufacturers’ directions 
for use to help minimize incorrect application at clinical sites that may not routinely use both 
solutions. In addition , the manufacture rs may also provide demonstration videos and posters for 
continued refresher training for each solution.  
 
The study protocol will mandate the antiseptic skin solution to be used in each intervention phase 
(Sections 4.4, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.6.3, and 4.6.4); however, the p rotocol will remain pragmatic to 
variability in other co -intervention steps performed during the entire pre-operative skin preparation 
process  performed in the operating room . Based on individual surgeon preference, t his often 
includes mechanically removin g visible dirt or debris with a scrub brush, and/or cleaning the limb 
with isopropyl alcohol or antiseptic scrub solution. These additional skin preparation steps will be 
permitted provided that: 1) the final skin preparation step prior to surgical incisio n is the 
application of the allocated antiseptic solution;  and, 2) participating surgeons continue to use the 
same  skin preparation co-interventions in both intervention phases .  Co-interventions that contain 
the opposite active ingredient from the current  intervention phase (e.g. , using a chlorhexidine scrub 
brush during the povidone -iodine intervention phase, or conversely, using a povidone -iodine scrub 
during the chlorhexidine intervention phase)  should be avoided; however, deviations from this 
recommend ation will be permitted in order to maintain pragmatic flexibility of delivery  and reflect 
real-world clinical practice.  The details of all operating room  antiseptic co -interventions will be 
documented.  
 
The pragmatic nature of the cluster -randomized design will reduce the risk of crossovers between 
treatment groups because all consecutive patients during each recruitment period will receive the 
same treatment. Similarly, open fracture patients that requir e multiple planned surgeries for their 
injury will receive the same antiseptic skin solution during each  subsequent  procedure. Methods 
Center personnel will work with each of the clinical sites to develop strategies for minimizing 
crossovers. For example, for patients enrolled within 14 days of the anticipated end of a 
recruitment period  or patients requiring multiple surgeries , study personnel will develop local 
procedures to identify these patients as study participants, and indicate the patient’s allocat ed 
antiseptic solution in the medical chart and CRFs .  
 
4.6.7 Povidone -Iodine  Treatment  
The povidone -iodine  solution will  contain 10% povidone -iodine (1% free iodine) in purified water  
as the only active ingredient . Products that list other inactive ingredients, including alcohol, will 
be permitted. The brand of the solution will be left to the discretion of the clinical site, although 
Methods Center  personnel will confirm that the chosen solution is acceptable. Acceptable brands 
includ e, but are not limited to, Betadine® [Purdue Products, L.P. Stamford, CT] and Scrub Care® 
[Cardinal Health, Dublin, OH]. Clinical site personnel will store and handle the povidone -iodine 
solution as per the manufacturers’ recommendations . Operating room pe rsonnel will apply the 
solution to  the operative site as  the final preoperative skin antisepsis preparation immediately prior 
to commencing surgical fixation . They will apply the solution as per manufacturer’s directions  for 
use (e.g., technique of applica tion, duration of application, drying time, drying techniques, 
replacement of draping, etc.).

The CHG  solution will  contain 4% CHG  in purified water  as the only active ingredient . Products 
that list other inactive ingredients, including alcohol, will be permitted. The brand of the solution 
will be left to the discretion of the clinical site, although Methods Center  personnel will confirm  
that the chosen solution is acceptable. Accep table brands include, but are not limited to, Betasept® 
[Purdue Products, L.P. Stamford, CT] or Hibiclens® [Mölnlycke Health Care US LLC. Norcross, 
GA].  Clinical site personnel will store and handle the CHG  solution as per the manufacturers’ 
recommendations . Operating room personnel will apply the solution to  the operative site  as the 
final preoperative skin antisepsis preparation immediately prior to commencing surgical fixation . 
They will apply the solutio n as per manufacturer’s directions (e.g. , technique of application, 
duration of application, drying time, replacement of draping, etc.).  
 
4.7 Perioperative  Co-Interventions  
To optimize  the internal  validity  of the trial findings,  key details  of co-interventions  known  to 
influence  the incidence  of SSIs will be documented . Hospitals  typically  implement  standard  
procedures  to achieve  quality  process  benchmarks  designed  to minimize  SSIs.  These  benchmarks  
are outlined  in several  similar  guidelines  such as the Joint  Commission’s  Surgical  Care  
Improvement  Project  10 Core  Measures  to prevent  SSI, the Society  for Healthcare  Epidemiology  
of America  compendium  to prevent  SSI, and prevention  guides  from  the Institute  for Healthcare  
Improvement  and the Associa tion of periOperative  Registered  Nurses.  While  these  guidelines  
mandate  core benchmark  processes  to minimize  SSI, it is not practical  or generalizable  for the trial 
protocol  to standardize  the steps  taken  or co-interventions  performed  to achieve  these  core 
measures,  since  each participating  hospital  will already  have  their own implemented  procedures.  
This is the primary  rationale  for the cluster -crossover  design,  in which  each participating  hospital  
will act as its own control  for the effect  of co-intervent ions.  Therefore,  four key approaches  to 
account  for and limit  the potential  differential  application  of co-interventions  during  the study  
periods  will be performed : 1) study  periods  for each intervention  are kept relatively  short  to 
improve  the likelihood  that newly  implemented  co-interventions  will be equally  distributed  across  
both treatment  solutions;  2) encourage  participating  hospitals  not to make  changes  to their existing  
infection  prevention  interventions  during  the study  periods ; 3) document  the co-interventions  
being  used in the hospitals  throughout  the study  periods ; and 4) record  any changes  in co-
interventions  that do occur  if mandated  by a participating  hospital’s  administration.  To this end, a 
monitoring  tool containing  a list of commonly  appli ed prophylactic  co-interventions  being  used at 
the participating  clinical  sites will be completed  every  four months  to document  any changes  to 
their infection  prevention  strategies  during  the study  period.  
 
4.8 Outcome  Measures  
4.8.1 Prim ary Outcome   
The primary  outcome  is SSI, guided  by the CDC ’s National  Healthcare  Safety  Network  reporting  
criteria  (2017) ,5 which  includes  superficial  incisional  SSI within  30 days and deep incisional  or 
organ/space  SSI within  90 days of fracture  surgery  (Table  3). Since  the management  of some  open  
fractures  may have  more  than one operative  procedure  as part of an intentionally  staged  surgical  
plan (e.g.,  multiple  irrigation  and debridement s, wound  closures,  temporary  stabilization  surgeries,  
definitive  fixation  surgery),  the primary  outcome  will include  any SSI event  from  the date of open  
fracture  to the end of the 30- and 90-day post-operative  surveillance  periods  from  their definitive  
Page  21 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   fracture  management  surgery . For participants  with multiple  open  fracture  regions,  the date of the 
definitive  fracture  management  surgery  will be matched  to the open  fracture  region  with the SSI. 
 
Table  3: CDC  Surgical  Site Infection  Criteria  
Outcome  Description  
Superficial 
Incisional 
SSI Date of event for infection occurs from the date of fracture to 30 days after the definitive fracture 
management surgery  (where day 1 = the procedure date)  
AND  
involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision  
AND  
patient has at least one of the following:  
a. purulent  drainage  from  the superficial  incision.  
b. organisms  identified  from  an aseptically -obtained  specimen  from  the superficial  
incision  or subcutaneous  tissue  by a culture  or non-culture  based  microbiologic  
testing method  which  is performed  for purposes  of clinical  diagnosis  or 
treatment  (e.g.,  not Active  Surveillance  Culture/Testing  [ASC/AST ]). 
c. superficial  incision  that is deliberately  opened  by a surgeon,  attending  physician  
or other  designee  and culture  or non-culture  based  testing  is not performed.  
              AND 
patient  has at least one of the following  signs  or symptoms:  pain or tendernes s; 
localized  swelling;  erythema;  or heat.  
d. diagnosis  of a superficial  incisional  SSI by the surgeon  or attending  physician  
or other  designee.   
The following do not qualify as criteria for meeting the definition of superficial SSI:  
• Diagnosis/treatment  of cellulitis  (redness/warmth/swelling),  by itself,  does not meet  
criterion  “d” for superficial  incisional  SSI. Conversely,  an incision  that is draining  or that 
has organisms  identified  by culture  or non-culture  based  testing  is not considered  a 
cellulitis.  
• A stitch  abscess  alone  (minimal  inflammation  and discharge  confined  to the points  of 
suture  penetration).  
• A localized  stab wound  or pin site infection - Such  an infection  might  be considered  either  
a skin (SKIN)  or soft tissue  (ST) infection,  depending  on its depth,  but not an SSI  
Note:  A laparoscopic  trocar  site for an operative  procedure  is not considered a stab wound.  
• An infected burn wound is classified as BURN and is not an SSI.  
Deep 
Incisional 
SSI The date of event for infection occurs from the date of fracture to 90 days after the definitive 
fracture management surgery  (where day 1 = the procedure date)  
AND  
involves deep soft tissues of the incision (e.g., fascial and muscle layers)  
AND  
patient has at least one of the following:  
a. purulent  drainage  from  the deep  incision.  
b. a deep incision that spontaneously dehisces, or is  deliberately opened or aspirated by a 
surgeon, attending physician  or other designee , and organism is identified by a culture or 
non-culture based microbiologic testing method which is performed for purposes of 
clinical diagnosis or treatment (e.g., not Active Surveillance Culture/Testing 
[ASC/AST ]) or culture or non -culture based microbio logic testing method is not 
performed  
            AND  
patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38°C); localized 
pain or tenderness. A culture or non -culture based test that has a negative finding does 
not meet this criterion.  
c. an abscess  or other  evidence  of infection  involving  the deep  incision  that is detected  on 
gross  anatomical  or histopathologic  exam,  or imaging  test 
Organ/Space 
SSI Date of event for infection occurs from the date of fracture to 90 days after the definitive fracture 
management surgery  (where day 1 = the procedure date)  
Page  22 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   Outcome  Description  
AND  
infection involves any part of the body deeper than the fascial/muscle layers, that is opened or 
manipulated during the operative procedure  
AND  
patient has at least one of the following:  
a. purulent  drainage  from  a drain  that is placed  into the organ/space  (e.g.,  closed  
suction  drainage  system,  open  drain,  T-tube drain,  CT guided  drainage)  
b. organisms  are identified  from  an aseptically -obtained  fluid  or tissue  in the 
organ/space  by a culture  or non-culture  based  microbiologic  testing  method  
which  is performed  for purposes  of clinical  diagnosis  or treatment  (e.g.,  not 
Active  Surveillance  Culture/Testing  [ASC/AST ]). 
c. an abscess  or other  evidence  of infection  involving  the organ/space  that is 
detected  on gross  anatomical  or histopathologic  exam,  or imaging  test evidence  
suggestive  of infection.  
AND  
meets at least one criterion for a specific organ/space infection site listed in Table 3  of the CDC 
Procedure -associated Module  (summarized in Table 4 below ).5 These criteria are found in the 
Surveillance Definitions for Specific Types of Infections chapter.19 
*The CDC  criteria  has been  modified  to include  all definitive  fracture  management  surgeries,  as opposed  to including  
only National  Healthcare  Safety  Network  procedures  that require  infection  reporting.   
 
The CDC criteria for classifying SSIs will be followed. If m ultiple tissue levels are involved in the 
infection , the type of SSI (superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ/space) reported will 
reflect the deepest tissue layer involved in the infection during the surveill ance period. The date of 
event will  be the date that the patient met criteria for the deepe st level of infection:  1) Report 
infection that involves the organ/space as an organ/space SSI, whether or not it also involves the 
superficial or deep incision sites  and 2) Report infection that involves the superficial and deep 
incisional sites as a deep  incisional SSI.  The most relevant National Healthcare Safety Network 
Organ/Space SSI classifications  are summarized in Table 4.  
 
Table  4: Relevant  Organ/Space  SSI Sites  
Organ/Space SSI  BONE  Osteomyelitis  
JNT Joint or bursa infection  
PJI Prosthetic joint infection  
 
 
All reported SSIs will be reviewed  independently  by an infection preventionist  nurse and an 
orthopaedic surgeon who are members of the Adjudication Committee . Briefly, they will complete 
the review  by examining all relevant information to determine if the SSI meets the CDC criteria 
of a superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, or organ/space SSI. The Committee will reach 
consensus on all reviewed SSIs. A hospital epidemiologist and infectiou s disease physician who 
are members of the Adjudication Committee will be  available to provide guidance as needed.  All 
members of the Adjudication Committee will be blinded to the treatment allocation.  
 
4.8.2 Secondary  Outcome  
The second ary outcome is unplanned fracture -related reoperation within 12 months  of the open 
fracture . This outcome has been used in previous open fracture trials and is  defined as any 
unplanned surgery that occurred from  the time of injury to 12 months post-injury  that is associated 
with an infection at the operative site or contiguous to it, a wound -healing problem, or a fracture 
delayed union or nonunion . Common examples  include any unplanned: 1) irrigation and 
Page  23 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   debridement of surgical incisions or open fracture wounds  due to infections or wound healing 
problems ; 2) revision wound closure  for dehiscence; 3) soft tissue coverage procedure for infected 
or necrotic wound; 4)  fracture  delayed union or  nonunion surgery (such as bone grafting or implant 
exchange); and 5) reop eration for hardware  or prosthesis  failure due to infection or bone -healing 
problem s. Removal of hardw are for soft tissue prominence or periprosthetic fracture are common 
examples of reoperations that will not be considered outcome events.  Two orthopaedic surgeons 
who are  members of the Adjudication Committee will independently review all reported 
unplanned fracture -related reoperations to  determine if they meet the criteria for being a study 
event . The Committee will reach consensus on all reviewed unplanned fracture -related 
reoperations . 
 
4.8.3  Exploratory  Outcomes  
Two exploratory definitions of infection will be used for sensitivity anal yses of the primary 
comparison. The first exploratory outcome is fracture -related infection ( FRI) within 12 months of 
the open fracture , defined by the confirmatory criteria for FRI outlined in a 2018 consensus 
definition .20  The FRI criteria has been selected as an exploratory outcome because the CDC 
criteria has been criticized for failing to  adequately account for the complexities  of infections in 
traumatic fractures.20,21 The FRI criteria  attempts to improve upon the ability to detect infections 
specifically in fracture patients;  however, this definition of FRI has not been fully validated or 
widely adopted.     
 
The confirmatory criteria  include  the presence of one or more of the following signs/symptoms :  
1) Fistula,  sinus  or wound  breakdown  (with  communication  to the bone  or the implant).  
2) Purulent  drainage  from  the wound  or presence  of pus during  surgery.  
3) Phenotypically  indistinguishable  pathogens  identified  by culture  from  at least two separate  
deep  tissue/implant  (including  sonication -fluid)  specimens  taken  during  an operative  
intervention.  In case of tissue,  multiple  specimens  (3) should  be taken,  each with clean  
instruments  (not superficial  or sinus  tract swabs).  In cases  of joint effusion,  arising  in a 
joint adjacent  to a fractured  bone,  fluid  samples  obtained  by sterile  puncture  may be 
included  as a single  sample.  
4) Presence  of microorganisms  in deep  tissue  taken  during  an operative  intervention , as 
confirmed  by histopathological  examination  using  specific  staining  techniques  for bacteria  
or fungi.   
 
The second exploratory  outcome is SSI using the CDC criteria within 12 months of the open 
fracture .  This secondary outcome will use the same diagnostic CDC reporting criteria for the 
primary outcome ( Tables 3 and 4 ); however, the timeframe for this outcome will be expanded to 
include all SSIs that occur within 12 months  of open fracture .   Similar to the rationale for using 
the FRI outcome, and  the recommendations for a minimum of 12 months follow -up for orthopaedic 
fracture outcomes22, this expanded timeframe will detect infections that occur beyond the standard 
CDC surveillance reporting periods.  This modification of the CDC reporting periods has been 
used in previous orthopaedic fracture trials.7,23  
 
An infection preventionist nurse and an orthopaedic surgeon member  of the Adjudication 
Committee will review all reported SSIs to determine if they meet the FRI confirmatory criteria 
and / or the CDC  criteria following the processes described above (see Section 4.8.1).

Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019    
4.8.4 Data  Collection  and Participant  Follow -up 
After obtaining informed consent, study personnel will record the baseline data on the st udy CRFs. 
They will obtain this information directly from the participant or proxy, from the participant’s 
medical chart, and the participant’s treating orthopaedic surgeon and other health care providers . 
Data collection points include patient characteristics and i njury details such as age, gender, 
comorbidities, mechanism of injury, socioecono mic status, and other injuries. Study personnel will 
also record  the characteristics of up to three open fracture  regions  including the location, fracture 
severity, size of th e wound, and degree of soft tissue injury using the Gustilo classification .8,17,24   
 
Surgical data and in -hospital data will be collected throughout the participant’s hospital stay. 
Detailed information will be collected regarding the surgical management of the open fracture (s), 
including the time to irrigation and debridement . For each open fracture region , study personnel 
will record the use of staged debridements, the presence or lack of skin closure between 
debridements, and the use of local  antibiotics at the wound. The method (s) of initial and final 
fracture management  will also be captured. Lastly , study personnel w ill record the use of negative 
pressure wound therapy for open wounds or in the presence of open wounds surgically closed. 
These treatment decisions are hypothesized to be associated markers of injury severity and 
potential confounders of  the study interventions.  
 
Study participants will be followed at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months from 
their fracture .  SSIs and unplanned fracture -related reoperations  will be identified at the time of 
diagnosis /occurrence  and/or during  each participant ’s clinical assessment and medical record 
review that will occur during their routine outpatient clinic visits  (Table 2). Detailed  information 
on the SSI  including the date of diagnosis, patient signs and symptoms, culture test results, method 
of treatment(s), and date of resolution will be collected. Study personnel will also record details 
about the participants’ reoperations on the CRFs (e.g. , date of re operation, type of procedure, 
reason for procedure, etc.). In cases where the participant does not return to the clinic, study 
personnel will contact the participant by telephone, text, email , standard mail,  and/or will review 
their medical record for any SSIs, and unplanned fracture -related reoperations . If the patient 
reports being treated at another hospital, study personnel will obtain the medical records from the 
other hospital . We have used this approach in our other multi -center trials (e.g. , SPRINT,  TRUST, 
FLOW, FAITH, HEALTH, etc.).7,23,25 –27  
 
To ensure research participant safety, serious adverse events (SAEs) will be documented at each 
follow -up visit and promptly submitted to the  Methods Center and the  local  or central  Institutional 
Review Board  (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) as per the  required reporting processes.  
 
Several strategies may be used to maximize follow -up including: 1) at the time of enrol lment , each 
participant will provide their own telephone number, as well as  the name and address of a primary 
care physician, and t he names and phone numbers of three people at different addresses with whom 
the participant does not live with and who are likely to be aware of the participant’s whereabouts; 
2) participants will receive a reminder card upon discharge for their next follo w up visit by the 
clinical site study personnel; 3) participants will receive text message  reminders ; 4) follow -up will 
coincide with normal surgical fracture clinic visits; and 5) if a participant refuses or is unable to 
return for the follow -up assessmen t, study personnel will determine his/her status with regard to 
Page  25 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   major study outcomes  by telephone , text, or email  contact with the participant or the provided 
alternate contacts. Given  these are standard of care visits and the participants will be receivin g 
ongoing orthopaedic care for their acute fractures, minimal loss to follow -up is expected . Using 
these techniques, we expect greater than 95% follow -up at 3 months and 90% follow -up at 12 
months post -fracture . 
 
Participants  will not be deemed  lost to follow -up until the 12-month  visit is overdue  and all 
attempts  to contact  the participant  have  been  exhausted.  Participants  will not be withdrawn  from  
the study  if the study  protocol  was not adhered  to (e.g., allocate d treatment  not received,  missed  
follow -up visits,  etc.).  The reasons  for participants  being  withdrawn  from  the study  will be 
document ed (e.g., withdrawal  of consent  or lost to follow  up). 
 
5.0 STATISTICAL  PLAN   
 
5.1 Sample  Size Determination  
The overall objective of the trial is to determine the most effective aqueous pre -operative antiseptic 
skin solution for use during open fracture management. This will be achieved by comparing the 
effectiveness of 10% povidone -iodine versus 4% CHG surgical  skin preparations. The primary 
outcome is the occurrence of SSI, as per the adapted CDC criteria (Table 3 ).5 The secondary 
outcome is the occurrence of unplanned fracture -related reoperations within 12 months of injury. 
The sample size was calculated for the primary comparison between proportions of patients with 
SSI in each treatment group;  however, it is expected that this estimate will also provide adequate 
power for the secondary outcome (unplanned fracture -related reoperation) because the baseline 
incidence (13%) and effect size for the reoperation outcome are expected to be similar to t he SSI 
estimates.7  
 
Assuming an ITT principle for the analysis, the sample size was calculated based on a cluster 
crossover design with the cluster as the unit of randomization and the patient as the unit of analysis. 
For complex study designs, such as a cluster -randomized crossover trial, simple formulas to 
calculate samp le size or power may not capture the expected variability from the observed data.28 
Simulation methods were used to obtain empirical power calculations based on a feasible number 
of recruiting cluster s and the expected number of open fr acture patients.28 The simulation estimates 
are designed to detect  a difference between the treatment groups, accounting for between hospital 
variability inherent to a cluster -crossover trial design. We have assumed that the povidone -iodine 
solution will achieve a 0.65 risk ratio for SSI with a 12.5% SSI baseline incidence.1,3,7 This 
represents approximately a 4% absolute risk reduction in SSI and reoperation.  This effect was 
deemed more conservative than data reported by Swenson et al. and was consistent with feasible 
recruitment g oals.4   
 
Recent simulati on data suggest that increasing the number of period crossovers can increase the 
statistical power of a given sample size.29 To ensure the most conserv ative sample size estimate, 
we have based our sample size assumptions using a single crossover, 2 period design. The initial 
power estimate assumed 10 recruiting cluster s, a 10% loss to follow -up rate ,7 and applying the 
between -cluster variance of 0.095 observed in the FLOW trial .  Based on en rollment of  a minimum 
of 1,540 open fracture patients , greater than 80% power would be achieved. Subsequent to the 
initial power calculations, the early trial experience demonstrated a need to increase the number 
Page  26 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   of clusters to obtain a feasible recruitmen t pace. As a result, a minimum of 12 clusters will enroll 
participants  into Aqueous -PREP . The increase in clusters results in a marginal increase in power 
(~2%).   
 
Table 5 below outlines the summary of the initial sample size assumptions that yield 80% p ower 
to detect difference between the treatments.  These  sample size estimates are rounded up to the 
nearest multiple of 20 to ensure balance among the clinical sites and two interventions.

5.2 Statistical  Methods  
5.2.1  Analysis  Plan Overview  
A detailed statistical analysis plan will be published prior to the completion of the trial.  The 
analysis and reporting of the results will follow the CONSORT guidelines for reporting of both 
pragmatic trials30 and cl uster -randomization trials.31 The process of patient enrollment and flow 
throughout the study will be summarized usi ng a flow -diagram. Patient demographics and baseline 
outcome variables will be summarized using descriptive summary measures expressed as mean 
(standard deviation) or median (interquartile range) for continuous variables depending on the 
distribution, and number (percent) for categorical variables.32 An ITT principle will be adopted to 
analyze all outcomes  and the unit of analysis will be the individual patients . Missing data  will be 
assumed to be missing at random and will be handled with multiple imputation.33,34 
 
The primary analysis will compare the treatment groups on the SSI outcome and the secondary 
analysis will compare the unplanned fracture -related reoperatio n outcome. The secondary 
comparison will be conducted  in accordance with best practice guidelines for secondary analyses. 
For all models, the results will be expressed as relative measure of effect (odds , risk, or hazard  
ratios)  and corresponding two -sided  95% confidence intervals.  
   
5.2.2  Analysis  of the Study  Outcomes  
Adopting an ITT principle, multilevel regression models will be used. Correlation structures will 
be fit based on the observed between cluster and between period effects. A robust sandwich  
estimator will be used to analyze the primary and secondary outcomes.  
Page  27 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019    
For the primary outcome, SSI will be the dependent variable and the antiseptic solution (treatment 
group) will be the independent variable. For the secondary outcome, unplanned fractur e-related 
reoperation will be the dependent variable and the antiseptic solution (treatment group) will be the 
independent variable. For both analyses, multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data.34  
 
As the optimal methods for analyzing cluster crossover trials continue to evolve, the final statistical 
modeling technique to be used will be determined in accordance with contemporary best practices 
prior to the completion of participant follow -up. A sepa rate Statistical Analysis Plan will be 
developed prior to study closeout. Table 6 below  shows  a summary of the study outcomes, 
corresponding hypotheses, and currently proposed method s of analys is.

5.2.3  Subgroup  Analyses  
Three subgroup analyses will be performed. The primary subgroup will be defined by the severity 
of open fracture (Gustilo -Anderson type I or II versus III).8 Secondary subgroups will include: i) 
upper extremity versus lower extremity open fractures; and ii) none, minimal, or surface 
contamination versus contam ination embedded in bone or deep soft tissues.17 These analy ses will 
be performed by comparing the effect estimates in both groups (interaction effect). We hypothesize 
that effect will differ by subgroup. These analyses will be approached and reported in accordance 
with best practices and guidelines for subgroup an alyses.35–38 Table 7 below shows  a summary of 
the subgroup analysis objectives, corresponding outcomes, hypotheses, and methods of analysis.

5.2.4  Sensitivity  Analyses  
Assessment of the sensitivity or robustness of the findings to the key assumptions is essential in 
trials. The following sensitivity analyses  may be conducted to explore the effects of alternative 
analysis models, alternative missing data approaches, balan cing prognostic imbalance, as -treated 
analyses, variability in co -interventions, and alternative definitions of SSI.    
 
1) Using different analysis models:  There are several methods for analyzing cluster randomized 
crossover trials.34,39 Therefore,  our sensitivity analyses  will explore alternative multi -level models 
with different correlation structures for the error .35,39 ,38  
 
2) Different methods of handling missing data:  There are several methods of handling missing data 
in trials.39 Multiple imputation assumes that the data are missing at random —an assumption that 
is not verifiable in practice. Other imputation methods will be used such as worst case scenario to 
impute missing data and assess the robustness of the results.40 For the worst case scenario analysis, 
we will assume that a random proportion of participants lost to follow -up experienced a study 
event. For this sensitivity analysis, the proportion assumed to experience a study event will be 
equivalent to the upper co nfidence interval of the observed pooled event rate for each study 
outcome.  
 
3) Adjusted analyses for prognostic imbalance : We will also perform sensitivity analyses that 
assume prognostic imbalance between the two treatment groups based on the following key 
variables known to be risk factors for SSI or reoperation after open fracture: Gustilo fracture type, 
lower extremity fracture, wound contamination, time from injury to first debridement, antiseptic 
wound dressing in the emergency department, method of  fixation, wound closure at initial 
debridement, age, work -related injury, and employment status.16 Adjusted analyses including the 
above risk factors and treatment group as independent variables will be perf ormed for the SSI and 
reoperation outcomes.  
 
4) As-treated analyse s: The proportion of surgical procedures receiving the incorrect, non -
allocated antiseptic solution will be reported. “As-treated” sensitivity analys es will be performed 
using the solution received as the independent variable .  For participants that were treated in a 
single open fracture surgery, they will be analyzed using the antiseptic solution received.  F or 
participants who receive d multiple open fracture surgeries,  two analyses will be performed.  First,  
the antiseptic solution used in their last surgery prior to a study outcome event will define their 
study  treatment .  For the second analysis,  the antiseptic solution received in the majority of their 
Page  29 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   fracture surge ries will define their study treatment.   Participants who were treated with multiple 
open fracture management surgeries , but received equal exposure to both treatment solutions  (e.g. 
one surgery with CHG and one surgery with iodine) , will be analyzed  within the ir originally 
allocated  treatment group.    
 
5) Co-intervention variability : Selective censoring of one or more clusters and / or treatment 
periods will be performed to further explore between -cluster and between -period variability 
identified in the primary and secondary outcome comparisons. These analyses will be used to 
explore t he robustness of the study conclusions in the context of measured practice variations in 
co-interventions that differ between participating sites and / or evolve over the duration of the 
study recruitment. Results that are sensitive to the removal of a clu ster(s) and / or period(s) will be 
reported, along with potential clinical hypotheses that are supported by the measured clinical 
practice variation.   
 
6) Exploratory SSI definitions : The above analyses (See Section 5.2.2) will be repeated for the 
primary  comparison using the FRI outcome and the CDC definition within 1 year of injury to 
determine if the study conclusions are sensitive to alternative definitions of SSI.  
 
Table  8 below shows  a summary of the objectives, corresponding outcomes, hypotheses, and 
methods for each potential sensitivity analysis.

5.2.5  Interim  Analysis  
No formal  interim  analyses  are planned  and the trial will not be stopped  early  for benefit.  The Data  
and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (see Section  7.5.5)  will review  frequent  safety  reports  and will 
collectively  make  judgments  on the strength  of evidence  and the absolute  magnitude  and 
seriousness  of any safety  signals.41  The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  may make  
recommendations  regarding  the trial. 
 
6.0 DATA  MANAGEMENT  
 
6.1 Case  Report  Forms  and Data  Transmission  
Clinical  sites will be provided  with the trial CRFs  prior  to initiation  of enrol lment.  Research  
personnel  at each clinical  site will submit  the required  data,  as detailed  on the CRFs,  to the Methods  
Center  using  the REDCap  Cloud  elect ronic  data capture  system.  Clinical  site personnel  will 
receive  a unique  login  and password  for the REDCap  Cloud  system  and will be able to view  and 
modify  data for participants  recruited  at their clinical  site.  
 
6.2 Data  Integrity  
The REDCap  Cloud  system  uses a variety  of mechanisms  for checking  data at the time of entry  
including  skip logic,  range  checks , and data type checks.  Upon  receipt  of new data,  the personnel  
at the Methods  Center  will query  all missing , implausible , or inconsistent  data. Clinical  site 
personnel  will be able to review  of open  queries  in the system  and will be required  to respond  
promptly.    
 
7.0 ETHICS  AND  DISSEMINATION  
 
7.1 Research  Ethics  Approval  
The McMaster  University  Meth ods Center  and all participating  clinical  sites will receive  REB or 
IRB approval  prior  to commencing  participant  enrollment . A central  IRB and local  IRBs/REBs  
will be used based  on clinical  site logistics.  Prior  to local  commencement  of the study , each clinical  
site will provide  the Methods  Center  with a copy  of their ethics  approval.  
 
7.2 Consent  
In many  cluster  randomized  comparativ e effectiveness  trials , a waiver  of consent  is obtained  from  
the IRB of Record.   The rationale  for the waiver  of consent  is that all patients  will receive  
treatments  that are effective  and within  standard s of care, they will receive  one of the study  
treatments  as part of their routine  care regardless  of study  participation , the data collection  is 
minimal  and obtained  from  the patient’s  medical  records , the trial involves  no more  than minimal  
risk to the patient,  and that the waiver  of consent  will not adversely  affect  the rights  and welfare  
of the patient . Most  of these  concepts  apply  to the current  trial, as the Aqueous -PREP  trial is 
comparative  effectiveness  research  where  patients  will receive  one of the preoperative  antiseptic  
skin solutions  regardless  of their participation  in the study.  Additionally,  patients  are not included  
in the decision -making  process  for the choice  of antiseptic  preparation  solution , and, in most  
situations,  they are not even  aware  of which  solution  is used.   However,  in contrast  to many  cluster  
random ized crossover  trials,  Aqueous -PREP  study  personnel  will need  to contact  participants  
directly  to collect  baseline  and outcome  data,  as this information  cannot  be reliably  obtained  from  
Page  31 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   the patients’  medical  records.   Therefore,  study  personnel  will obtain  informed  consent  from  
patients  prior  to data collection.   This consent  process  will allow  study  participants  to be informed  
about  the study  rationale  and provide  consent  for ongoing  surveillance  and data collection .   
 
To increase  enrollment  and to avoid  missing  potential  study  participants,  the consent  process  may 
take place  up to 3 weeks  post-fracture.   Consultation  during  the study  design  phase  with IRB 
members  and patient  advisors  confirmed  the acceptability  of this flexible  approach,  where  consent  
may be obtained  after the intervention . The primary  rationale  for allowing  consent  after the 
intervention  is consistent  with the waiver  of consent  principles  outlined  above,  but in addition,  the 
patient  and IRB stakeholders  recognized  that obtaining  consent  prior to the patient’s  first surgery  
could  add undue  decision  making  stress  to a patient  who is awaiting  surgical  management  of a 
serious  extremity  injury;  allowing  consent  after their surgery  would  likely  facilitate  an improved  
consent  process.   
 
The conse nt process  will typically  take place  in the patient ’s hospital  room  or in the outpatient  
fracture  clinic,  either  before  or after the patient  has had surgery(ies)  to manage  their open  fracture.  
If the patient  is unable  to provide  informed  consent  (e.g.,  due to their injury,  language  restrictions)  
within  3 weeks  of their fracture,  informed  consent  will be obtained  from  their proxy.  In addition,  
if a patient  has been  discharged  from  hospital  prior  to being  invited  to participate  in the study,  a 
delegated  membe r of the clinical  care team  may obtain  their consent  by telephone,  as approved  by 
the IRB of Record.    
 
To obtain  informed  consent,  delegated  study  personnel  should  follow  the below  procedures:  
• Present  study  information  in a manner  that is understandable  to the potential  
participant/proxy.  
• Discuss  the study  with the potential  participant/proxy  and answer  any questions  he or 
she asks.  
• Allow  the potential  participant/proxy  an opportunity  to discuss  participation  with their 
family,  friends,  or family  physician,  if desired.   
• Confirm  that the participant/proxy  understands  the risks  and benefits  of participating  
in the study  and that their participation  is voluntary.  
• Complete  and obtain  signatures  for informed  consent  form  and obtain  contact  
information  from  the participant/proxy.  
• Provide  /send  the participant/proxy  with a paper/electronic  copy  of the signed  consent  
form.  
Consent  may be obtained  electronically  or using  pen and paper  consent  forms,  as approved  by the 
IRB of Record.    
The proces s of obtaining  and documenting  informed  consent  will be completed  in accordance  with 
local  Good  Clinical  Practice  recommendations.  Consent  procedures  and forms,  and the 
communication,  transmission  and storage  of patient  data will comply  with the IRB of Record and 
Department  of Defense  requirements  for compliance  with The Health  Insurance  Portability  and 
Accountability  Act.  
 
Upon  providing  informed  consent,  study  participants  will be followed  for 12 months  from  their 
fracture.  Given  the short  follow -up time, the need  for a regular  reassessment  of consent  will not 
apply;  however,  participants  may withdraw  their consent  at any time.   
Page  32 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019    
7.3 Confidentiality  
Information  about  study  participants  will be kept confidential  and will be managed  in accordance  
with the below  rules:  
• All study -related  information  will be stored  securely.  
• All study  participant  information  will be stored  in locked  file cabinets  and accessible  
only to study  personnel.  
• All paper  and electronic  CRFs  will be identified  only by a coded  participant  number  
and initials.  
• All databases  will be password  protected.  
 
In the event  that a participant  revokes  authorization  to collect  or use personal  health  information,  
the clinical  site retains  the ability  to use all information  collected  prior  to the revocation  of 
participant  authorization.  For participants  who have  revoked authorization  to collect  or use 
personal  health  information , attempts  should  be made  to obtain  permission  to collect  at least vital 
status  (i.e., primary  outcome  data)  at the end of their scheduled  study  period.  
 
7.4 Protocol  Amendments  
Any amendments  to the study  protocol  which  may affect  the conduct  of the study  or the potential  
safety  of or benefits  to participants  (e.g., changes  to the study  objectives,  study  design,  sample  
size, or study  procedures)  will require  a formal  amendment  to the protocol.  Any protocol  
amendments  will be approved  by the Principal  Investigator s and will require  approval  by the 
McMaster  University  REB , the Central  IRB, local  IRBs /REBs , as well as the funders  (as needed ). 
Clinical  sites will also be required  to submit  amendment  requests  to their IRB of Record  to obtain  
approval  for the amendment  and to provide  the Methods  Center  with a copy  of this approval.  
Administrative  changes  (e.g., minor  corrections  or clarifications  that have  no effect  on the way the 
study  is conducted)  will not need  to undergo  a formal  amendment  process.  
 
7.5 Adverse  Event  Reporting  and Definitions  
7.5.1 Serious  Adverse  Event (SAE)  
A SAE  is any adverse  event  that is any of the following:  
• Fatal  
• Life threatening  
• Requires  or prolongs  hospital  stay 
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity  
• A congenital  anomaly  or birth  defect  
• An important  medical  event   
 
7.5.2 Unanticipated  Problems  Resulting  in Risk to Participant  or Others  
Any incident,  experience,  or outcome  that meets  the following  criteria:  
• Unexpected  in nature,  severity,  or frequency  (e.g., not described  in study -related  
documents  such as the ethics -approved  protocol  or consent  form,  etc.).  
• Related  or possibly  related  to participation  in the research  (i.e., possibly  related  means  
there  is reasonable  possibility  that the incident  experience  or outcome  may have  been  
caused  by the procedures  involved  in the research).  
Page  33 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   • Suggests  that the research  places  participants  or others  at greater  risk of harm  (including  
physical,  psychological,  economic,  or social  harm).   
 
7.5.3 Clinical  Site Reporting:  Notifying  the Methods  Center  
Clinical  sites are responsible  for reporting  SAEs  to the Methods  Center  via the REDCap  Cloud  
system.  Significant  new information  on ongoing  SAEs  should  also be provided  promptly  to the 
Methods  Cent er via the REDCap  Cloud  system.  Unanticipated  problems  resulting  in risk to 
participants  or others  are also to be reported  promptly  to the Methods  Center . 
 
7.5.4 Clinical  Site Reporting  – IRB and REB  
Clinical  sites are responsible  for reporting  SAEs  and unanticipated  problems  resulting  in risk to 
participants  or others  to their local  REB /IRB or the Central  IRB in accordance  with local  reporting  
requirements.  Copies  of each report  and documentation  of ethic  board  notification  and receipt  will 
be kept in the clinical  site’s  study  file. 
 
7.5.5  Safety  Monitoring  
As per the FDA  guidance  document  the Establishment  and Operation  of Clinical  Trial  Data  
Monitoring  Committees  for Clinical  Trial  Sponsors , a Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  will 
oversee  the safety  of the trial participants  and the overall  conduct  of the trial. The members  of the 
Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  will include  two orthopaedic  surgeons,  an infectious  
disease  expert,  and a biostatistician.  One orthopaedic  surgeon  will act as the Chair of the 
Committee.  The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  will be responsible  for safeguarding  the 
interests  of study  participants,  assessing  the safety  and efficacy  of study  procedures,  and for 
monitoring  the overall  conduct  of the study.  The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  will 
frequently  review  enrollment  and demographic  summaries,  listings  of protocol  deviations,  and 
summaries  and listings  of SAEs . They  will advise  the Principal  Investigators  and study  team  on 
any concerns  related  to participant  safety  and trial conduct,  and will make  recommendations  for 
the study  to continue  as designed,  for study  termination,  for study  continuation  with major  or minor  
modifications,  or temporary  suspension  of enrollment  until some  uncertainty  is resolved.  We will 
develop  a Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  charter  to guide  the process.  
 
7.6 Dissemination  Policy  
Results  from  the study  will be submitted  for publication  regardless  of whether  there  are significant  
findings.  Every  attempt  will be made  to ensure  that the amount  of time between  completion  of data 
collection  and release  of study  findings  are minimized.

9.0 SUB -STUDY:  PATIENT  EXPERIENCES  IN THE  AQUEOUS -PREP  AND  PREPARE  
TRIALS   
 
9.1 Introduction  
Patient and stakeholder involvement in the des ign of randomized controlled trials is increasingly 
becoming recognized as an essential component of a trial’s succe ss.42,43  Patient and st akeholder 
involvement (PSI) has been seen as the paradigm shift from research being done “to” or “for” 
patients, to research being performed “wi th” or “by” patients themselves .44  PSI allows for 
democratization of the research process and empowering patients throughout the entire research 
process – from design throu gh to knowledge dissemination .45  Research has found that patients 
and stakeholders are motivated to be involved in research for a wide  variety of reasons, including 
a desire to contribute to res earch for the benefit of others .46  
 
Prior research has argued that PSI enhance s the focus of clinical trials on outcomes that are relevant 
to patients themselves, thus increasing the u tility of any research findings .47  Furthermore, PSI has 
been argued to improve recruitment and retention rates, while ra ising the quality of research 
findings and ultimately helping with the dis semination of research findings .48  Lastly, PSI may be 
able to improve patient safety when patients are inv olved in safety  reporting in hospital settings .49  
Page  35 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019    
Despite these findings, a recent systematic review estimates that far less than 1% o f clinical trials 
engage patients in any meaningful or active way .50  From the onset of the PREP -IT trials (i.e. the 
Aqueous -PREP and PREPARE trials), the PREP -IT investigators have engaged multiple patient -
partners and stakeholders in the d esign, conduct, and implementation of the PREP -IT trials.  One 
of our engagement goals is to identify ways in which we can better engage with P REP-IT study 
participants.  To support this goal, we seek to learn about PREP -IT participants’ experiences within  
the PREP -IT trials.  This knowledge will be used to improve the study team’s ability to engage 
study participants and provide study information in a meaningful and accessible manner.  
Additionally, the unique design of the PREP -IT trials (e.g., consent af ter the intervention, minimal 
follow -up, minimal requirements for participants) provides a novel trial to investigate this 
question.  This led to the current sub -study.  
 
9.2 Rationale  and Objectives  
One of the mandates of the PREP -IT program is to improve orthopaedic fracture research through 
meaningful engagement with our patient -partners and stakeholders.  The objective of this sub -
study is to learn about PREP -IT participants’ experiences with participating in the Aqueous -PREP 
or PREPARE trial.  The resul ts of this sub -study will be used to develop strategies to better engage 
research participants both in the PREP -IT trials as well as in future clinical trials.  
 
9.3 Sub-Study  Design  
This sub -study will consist of an exit survey that will be given to a sub set of participants in the 
PREP -IT trials.  Select clinical sites participating in the Aqueous -PREP and / or PREPARE trial 
will be invited to participate in the sub -study.   
 
The exit survey is comprised of 14 questions that includes multiple choice and bri ef open -ended 
questions.  All of the questions use clear and simple language written at or below a grade eight 
reading level to enhance the validity of results.  The survey length has been kept to a minimum to 
maximize response rate and limit barriers that  would affect its proper completion.   
 
The survey was created after reviewing the current literature and with input from the PREP -IT 
investigators, research coordinators, patient -partners, and stakeholders.  Engaging the larger study 
team follows the PREP -IT philosophy of meaningful engagement, as well as helps to ensure that 
no vital questions were missed and that the survey wording is clear and easily understandable to 
the target audience.  The questionnaire was pre -tested on a sample of convenience.  
 
9.4 Survey  Participants  and Distribution  
All potential substudy participants , or their proxies,  will be required to provide informed consent 
specifically for the substudy prior to completing the survey.  Informed consent for the substudy 
may be obtained at the time of enrollment in the Aqueous -PREP or PREPARE trial  using consent 
procedures described in sections 4.3.1 and 7.2 , or in-person at a subsequent follow -up visit  or time 
of survey administration  using a pen and paper consent form .  The patient or proxy must be 
provided with a copy of the signed informed consent form. All sites within the United States of 
America must conduct their consenting process in accordance with HIPAA (Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act) regulations as approved by their institutions, and sites in 
Page  36 of 40 
Version  2.1 04-Nov-2019   Canada must comply with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act 
(PIPEDA).  
 
Clinical sites participating in the sub -study will offer the survey to all eligible participants at the 
time they complete their one -year follow up visit. The survey will be sent to participants either 
through mail, email or RedCap Cloud, given to them on paper at a follow -up visit, or administered 
over the phone , depending on each individual participant’s preference.  The Research Coordinator 
may also telephone or text the participant to remind them to complete the exit survey.  We will 
document the number  of participants invited to participate in the survey as well as the number of 
participants who decline participation.  
 
9.5 Data  Entry  
The exit survey responses will be entered into the Aqueous -PREP / PREPARE trial’s electronic 
data capture (EDC) system.  
 
9.6 Sample  Size 
Sample size was calculated using a 5% margin of error, with 95% confidence intervals, a potential 
population of all patients who have completed one year follow up (approximately 1600 patients) 
and an expected response rate of 50%.  With thi s in mind, a sample size of approximately 310 
patients who complete every s urvey question will be required .51  As such, the survey will be 
distributed to all participants at participating clinical sites until our sample size of at least 310 
participants  is achieved .     
 
9.7 Data  Analysis  
We will summarize all variables with fr equencies and percentages.  The short form questions will 
be coded appropriately based on themes.   
 
9.8 Anticipated  Implications  of Results  
This research serves as an important step towards understanding patients’ perspectives as 
participants in a clinica l trial.  Additionally, the research may influence how future clinical trials 
are designed and conducted, with the overall goal of a greater focus on the patient experience and 
increasing patient involvement in research.  Lastly, the results of this sub -study could help the 
study team to develop aids (e.g., posters, pamphlets, etc.) to improve patients ’ understanding of 
clinical research and overall experience with the PREP -IT trials.

TITLE Randomized Study of Topical  Dilute Hypochlorite for the 
Prevention of Radiation Dermatitis in Head and Neck Cancer  
STUDY PHASE  Phase III 
STUDY REAGENT  1:1000 dilute hypochlorite  solution (0.005%) administered to the 
skin prior to daily radiation therapy  
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE(S)  The primary objective is to determine whether prophylactic 
topical dilute HOCl reduces the proportion of patients who  
develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis as scored on the Stanford 
Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS)   
SECONDARY 
OBJECTIVE(S)  Secondary objectives are: 
- To determine whether this agent delays th e time to 
development of Grade E radiation dermatitis  
- To determine whether this agent improves quality -of-life 
and pain scores associated with radiation dermatitis  
TREATMENT SUMMARY  Eligible patients will be randomized to daily application of 
topical dilute hypochlorite versus placebo for 10 minutes within 3  
hours prior to daily radiation treatment. When patien ts in either 
arm develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis during the radiotherapy 
course, they will be switched to topical dilute hypochlo rite 
treatment  daily per standard of care.  Patients will complete the 
Modified Brief Pain In ventory at study entry, at 40-50 Gy 
through the radiation treatment course,  at the end of  radiation 
treatment, and  at the follow-up visit 3-12 weeks after radiation 
treatment.  
SAMPLE SIZE  170 Patients (85 patients per arm)  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  Sample Size Calculation: From prior clinical experience, we 
anticipate that 8 0% of patients will experience Grade E  radiation 
dermatitis  with standard skin care. In order to d etect a 20 % 
reduction in patients with Grade E  dermatitis (80% vs 60 % in 
those treated with dilute hypochlorite solution)  with a two -sided 
alpha of 0.05 a nd beta of 80% , 170 patients  will be enrol led.  
 
Primary endpoint: The proportion of patients in each arm  who 
develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (as defined by the Stanford 
Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) during a course of 
radiation therapy will be assessed using a multiple logistic 
regression mode l adjusting for type of chemotherapy (c isplatin, 
cetuximab, non e). 
 
Secondary endpoints : Time to development of Grade E  radiation 
dermatitis in each arm will be assessed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model a djusting for type of chemotherapy . 
QOL/Pain scores will be analyzed using a repeated measures 
model adjusting for type of chemotherapy .

1.1. Primary Objective   
The primary objective is to determine the proportion of  patients who develop Grade E radiation 
dermatitis (as defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System, See APPENDIX B) as an 
adverse effect of radiation therapy or chemo radiation therapy for a head and neck cancer when 
initiating the use  of prophylactic  HOCl at the start of therapy  (experimental arm)  compared to placebo 
(control arm).  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives include the time to development of Grade E radiation dermatitis and the 
quality-of-life and pain levels (as assessed by the Modified Brief Pain Inventory) in the control arm 
versus the experimental arm.  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Disease  
 Radiotherapy is often used in combination with surgery and systemic therap y for the treatment of 
various malignancies . [1]. Although t echnological advances have allowed  for more precision and 
accuracy in targeting malignant tissues, normal tissues unavoidably  receive some radiation dose. For 
example, the skin overlying the target area receives incidental radiation , and up to 95% of patients can 
develop an acute reaction called radiation dermatitis  [2, 3].  Radiation dermatitis develops when the 
skin is unable to repair itself in a timely manner upon repeated exposures to radiation [3-5]. Topical 
agents such as moisturizers, aloe vera, or corticosteroids can offer some relief of pain and irritation , 
however several randomized trials have demonstrated that they unfortunately do not prevent the onset 
of radiation dermatitis [1, 6-12]. For moderate -to-severe cases of radiation dermatitis, a break in the 
radiation treatment regimen is often required to allow time for the skin to heal. In addition to skin 
irritation and breakdown, patients can also experience significant pain and discomf ort during this time . 
The only agent that  has been shown in a randomized trial to significantly reduce the severity of skin 
reactions is a silicone dressing ( Mepitel Film ) [8]. While this was shown to reduce the incidence of 
moist desquamation in women undergoing radiotherapy treatments for breast cancer, it can cost up to 
$85 for a package of 10 dress ings, making this type of treatment unaffordable for many patients  [13]. 
Thus, significant improvements in the treatment  of radiation dermatitis , a common sid e effect of 
radiation treatment,  are needed . 
 
 For patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer, chemoradiation has become standard of 
care [14-19]. Cisplatin is the standard agent for concurrent  therapy; however, cetuximab, a molecular 
inhibitor of EGFR , is used as an alternative [20]. The addition of concurrent chemotherapy to radiation 
treatment has resu lted in increased rates of Grade 3-4 radiation dermatitis  ranging from 2-35% 
compared to 4-21% with radiation alone [14-20]. In addition, cetuximab is notorious for  its significant 
skin toxicity and may potentiate radiation derma titis as well with Grade 3 -4 toxicity affecting 16 -60% 
of patients undergoing concurrent  treatment with radiation [21-23].  
 
 Radiation dermatitis is typically scored using the CTCAE Scoring System. A severity of Gra de 2 
indicates moist desquamation that is patchy or found in skin creases while Grade 3 indicates confluent 
moist desquamation away from skin creases. Moist desquamation in the head and neck region causes 
significant morbidity for patients: pain at the nec k leading patients to alter their clothing at the neck 
line, inability to shower, lack of restful sleep, discomfort while eating, and feeling self -conscious when 
Protocol Version 6 9  being seen in public.  There are multiple treatments for this complication, but practice varies  by 
institution, and there is no established standard of care.  
 
 
2.2 Study Agent  and Rationale  
 A standard treatment for radiation-induced moist desquamation (regardless of Grade 2 or Grade 3 
scoring by CTCAE) is dilute hypochlorite applied topically once or twice daily to the affected area. In 
this context, this treatment is given primarily for its antimicrobial properties.  
  
 Recently, Leung et al discovered a nother potential mechanism of action for dilute hypochlorite 
baths [9]. HOCl functions as an oxidant and can disrupt cellular signaling processes by oxidizing 
certain mediators [24]. Nuclear f actor-κB (NF-κB) is a protein complex that plays a central role in 
many different processes, including inflammation, aging, skin development, and radiation response 
[24]. Radiation injury activa tes NF-κB, which drives the cellular responses that can ultimately lead to 
radiation dermatitis [25, 26]. NF-κB plays a role in normal skin homeostasis as well [12 -17]. NF-κB is 
also influenced b y intracellular reduction -oxidation (redox) conditions [27]. NF-κB’s role in skin 
homeostasis and radiation injury suggests that it will be an attractive target for the treat ment of 
radiation dermatitis. Because NF -κB is a master regulator of inflammation, we hypothesize that dilute 
hypochlorite baths may function as an anti -inflammatory agent by modulating NF -κB signaling and 
inflammatory responses in the skin [24]. 
   
 Leung et al found that HOCl inhibits intracellular NF -κB signaling by oxidizing an upstream 
regulator without impairing global gene transcription and protein signaling .  In the skin of mice, a 
single brief exposure to topical HOCl significantly blocked NF-κB signaling . An established mouse 
model of radiation dermatitis was then used to assess whether hypochlorite could ameliorate acute 
radiation dermatitis.  Radiation de rmatitis was reproducibly induced on the backs of 4 -week-old 
C57BL/6 female mice with 6 Gy irradiation for 10 days. Mice were randomized to receive a 30 -minute 
bath in water (control) or dilute HOCl prior to each exposure to ionizing irradiation.  Skin was  
examined daily and assessed using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria, which grades 
skin ulceration as the highest score (grade 4). Skin ulceration is defined as round excavations that 
result in the complete loss of epidermis and some portion  of the dermis.  Compared to the control 
group, HOCl treated animals had a significantly lower RTOG score with scores of 1.8 ± 0.24 and 4.0 ± 
0 with and without HOCl treatment, respectively, by day 30.  While all control animals developed skin 
ulceration  by day 20, none of the HOCl -treated animals developed skin ulceration even by day 30.  
Histological analysis of skin biopsies taken on day 14 revealed that the skin of irradiated control 
animals exhibited classical signs of radiation dermatitis, including a lichenoid infiltrate, loss of skin 
appendages, and epidermal/dermal swelling. In contrast, the skin of HOCl -treated animals was largely 
normal, with retention of skin appendages and a mild increase in dermal cellularity . Finally, irradiation 
of mice skin induced the expression of five well -established NF -κB–dependent genes, and HOCl 
exposure significantly diminished this response .  From clinical, histological, and molecular 
perspectives, it appeared  that dilute bleach baths attenuated acute radiation derma titis in mice.  
 
 HOCl is a safe, well -characterized, inexpensive, and widely available topical agent.  The rationale 
for the starting regimen  of this study  is based on the methods from the prior mouse work  and prior 
published human studies . At dilute concen trations, hypochlorite is safe for human skin contact as 
demonstrated in a prior clinical trial using the same concentration [ 18].  Hypochlorite is  stable under 
normal use and storage conditions  [28]. It is a strong oxidizing agent and does react with household 
chemicals such as toilet bowl cleaners, rust removers, vinegar, acids, and ammonia containing products 
Protocol Version 6 10  to produce hazardous gases, such as chlorine and other chlorinated species  [28]. Encounters with such 
products is not planned nor anticipated  for this study.  
 
2.3 Study Design  
This is a single -institution, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial  to 
investigate the role  of topical HOCl in preventing radiation dermatitis in patients undergoing radiation 
therapy for head and ne ck cancer.  
 
Patients will be screened at the time of radiation oncology consultation. If eligible, patients will be 
offered participation and consented for enrollment. Per standard of care, simulation for radiation 
treatment and the treatment planning process will be performed over two weeks. Patients can be 
consented prior to or within 3 days following the start of radiation treatment. After consent, a baseline 
clinical skin assessment will be performed, and patients will be  stratified by type of chemotherapy 
(cisplatin, cetuximab, or none)  randomized to the control arm or the experimental arm. Randomization 
will be performed by the study coordinator and will not be disclosed to the patient or the treating 
physician. The experimental  arm will apply daily topical dilut e HOCl for 10 minutes within 3 hours 
prior to radia tion treatment. The control  arm will apply daily topical placebo ( water) for 10 minutes 
within 3 hours prior to radiation treatment. Clinical skin assessments will be pe rformed by the treating 
physician  once weekly during the  radiation treatment course per standard of care, and radiation 
dermatitis will be graded according to both the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System and the 
CTCAE v4.03 Scoring System. On both study arms, when the patient dev elops Grade E radiation 
dermatitis  per the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System , defined as moist desquamation 
within the radiation treatment field,  requiring treatment (not prophylaxis) with topical dilute HOCl, the 
patient will have met the endpo int of the study, and the patient will be switched to standard -of-care 
treatment for radiation dermatitis consisting of topic al dilute HOCl applied  daily. For pat ients who do 
not develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis during the radiation treatment course, a  final skin assessment 
will be performed +/- 10 days after the last day of radiation treatment. Photos of skin within the 
radiation treatment field will be taken at the time of each clinical assessment. In addition, enrolled 
patients will complete the Modi fied Brief Pain Inventory question naire at the  time of randomization, at 
40-50 Gy of radiation treatment,  on the last day of the radiation treatment course  +/- 10 days, and at 
the follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after the completion of the radiation treatment c ourse. 
 
There is currently no external sponsorship or funding for this protocol.  
 
2.3.1 Modified Brief Pain Inventory  
Patients with moderate -severe radiation dermatitis often experience significant pain and discomfort 
until the skin heals, which can sometimes take up to 2 -3 weeks. In order to assess patient reported 
levels of pain, patients will be asked to complete the Modified Brief Pain Inventory ( MBPI) at the time 
of randomization , at 40-50 Gy of treatment, on the last day of radiation treatment  +/- 10 days, and at 
the first follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after completion of the radiation treatment course . The MBPI 
allows patients to rate the severity of their pain as well as the degree to which their pain interferes with 
normal activities. There are seven pain severity items and seven pain interference items rated on a 0 -10 
Likert scale. It will take approximately 5 minute s to complete (ref; Appendix  D).

3.3 Informed Consent Process  
All participants will be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information for 
participants to make an infor med decision regarding their participation. Participants  will be required to 
sign the IRB approved informed consent prior to participation in any study specific procedure. The 
participant will receive a copy of the signed and dated consent document.  The o riginal signed copy of 
the consent document will be retained in the medical record or research file.  
  
4. TREATMENT PLAN  
4.1 Description of Treatment Plan  
 
Patients will be screened for study eligibility by the research team when they arrive for their initial 
consultation for radiotherapy.  If eligible and willing to participate, patients will sign informed consent 
and be enrolled in the study.   
 
Baseline 
 
 Patients will undergo a clinical skin assessment by the treating physician. Patients will also 
complete the MBPI , and photograph s will be taken of the neck to represent their baseline  skin. Patients 
will be stratified by type of chemotherapy and  randomized .   
 
During Radiation Therapy  
 
Prior to each radiation treatment, the study agent or placebo  (depending on randomization arm) will be 
applied to the  area of the skin to be irradiated  for 10 minutes  within 3 hours of the patient’s daily 
scheduled radiotherapy treatment . A nurse or qualified research member will instruct the patient on its 
application on the day of trial consent . After this initial instruction , the patient will self -apply the 
solution t o their skin prior to treatment when he/she arrives  to the radiation treatment area. There  are 
clinic rooms  that the patient can utilize to self -apply the solution prior to their daily radiation 
treatment. A nurse or qualified research member will check in with the p atient once per week and 
Protocol Version 6 12  answer any questions if applicable.  Patients will be instructed to use Vaseline as a moisturizer during 
the radiation treatment course  per standard of care .  
 
A clinical skin assessment by the treating physician will be performed once weekly  during the 
radiation treatment course  and at the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days. At each clinical skin 
assessment, skin toxicity will be graded using the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System and 
the CTCAE Scoring System. Photographs  will also be taken  at 40-50 Gy of radiation treatment and at 
the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days. 
 
Patients will also complete the Modified Brief Pain Inventory at the time of randomization, at 40 -50 
Gy of radiation treatment, at the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days, and at the follow -up visit 3-12 
weeks after the completion of the radiation treatment course.  
 
Follow Up  
 
During the patient’s follow up appointment  3-12 weeks after completion of the radiation treatment 
course, the patient will complete the MBPI , a clinical skin assessment will be performed, and  
photograph s will be taken of their treatment area .  
 
4.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
There are no concerns for concomitant medications or additional treatments. Patients will undergo 
standard of care  radiation therapy and the risks and guidelines will be appropriately discussed and 
outlined in person with the treating physician, in addition to the informed consent.  Patients will 
continue standard skin care as recommended by their treating physician.  
 
4.3 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from the study if the patient experiences a severe allergic reaction in the 
treatment area  and/or there is a significant worsening of dermatitis according to clinical assessment at 
the patient’s current radiotherapy dose . If the patient is removed from the study, they will no lo nger 
receive the study  agent concurrently with their radiotherapy, however, they may continue to undergo 
radiotherapy per standard of care and clinical assessment . 
 
4.4 Alternatives  
This study is optional. The alternative is to not participate in the study and receive standar d radiation 
therapy without the study  treatment .  
 
5. STUDY AGENT INFORMATION  
 
5.1  Study Agent  
The study  agent is hypochlorite (HOCl) at a concentration of 0.0 051%, otherwise known as modified 
Dakin’s solution . Clorox bleach will be diluted to attain this concentration.  
 
5.2 Availability  
The dilute HOCl  solution will be provided to the patient.  
 
5.3 Agent Ac countability  
The dilute HOCl  solution will be stored in a locked cabinet in the Cancer Center.  
Protocol Version 6 13   
6. DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
There will be no d ose modifications during this study.  Patients will be removed from the study  if they 
experience  a significant worsening of dermatitis according to clinical assessment at the patie nt’s 
current radiotherapy dose.  The study  agent will be discontinued and they will continue with 
radiotherapy alone  and standard of care management for radiation dermatitis . 
  
7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND  REPORTING PROCEDURES  
7.1 Potential Adverse Events  
Potential risk s associated with dilute HOCl are skin itching and skin irritation.  Prior human clinical 
trials demonstrated no significant risk of dilute 0.0 05% hypochlorite.  One patient had itching and m ild 
skin irritation.  Because we are diluting the hypochlorite, we do not have significant concern for using 
concentrations that are too high.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Adverse events will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0 3 and Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring 
System.  Both Serious and Non -Serious Adverse Events will be clearly noted in source documentation 
and listed on study specific Case Report Forms (CRFs).  The Protocol Director (PD) or designee will 
assess each Adverse Event (AE) to dete rmine whether it is unexpected according to the Informed 
Consent, Protocol Document, or Investigator’s Brochure, and related to the investigation. All Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs) will be tracked until resolution, or until 30 after the last dose of the st udy 
treatment.  
 
Skin-related SAEs CTCAE Grade 4  and above, and all subsequent follow -up reports will be reported 
to the Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) using the study 
specific CRF regardless of the event’s relatedness to the investigation. Following review by the 
DSMC, events meeting the IRB definition of ‘Unanticipated Problem’ will be reported to the IRB 
using eProtocol within 10 working days of DSMC review, or within 5 working days for deaths or life -
threatening experiences.  
 
 
8.  CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
There will  be no correlative studies involved in this investigation.

10.1 Assessment of Outcome  
Patients will be assessed on a weekly basis during radiation treatment as per standard of care. At each 
weekly on-treatment visit, a clinical skin assessment (physical exam) will be performed and 
documented per standard of care.  
 
In addition to standard management, all patients enrolled on this study will be required to have photos 
of the neck taken at four time po ints: at the time of randomization, at 40 -50 Gy of radiation treatment, 
at the end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days, and at the follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after completion of 
radiation treatment. To ensure consistency, photos will be taken with standardi zed equipment.  
 
10.2 Inter -Rater Reliability  
 
Patients enrolled on this study will be treated by experienced radiation oncologists. Inter -rater 
reliability will be established by a run -in training session. Prior to opening the study for accrual, these 
physicians will undergo a training session for the grading of radiation dermatitis. The training session 
will involve the physicians’ review of 10 photos of the neck of patients undergoing treatment for head 
and neck cancer at various time points during treatm ent. Physicians will be blinded to the time point of 
the photo but will have access to the documented skin exam at the time the photo was taken. Each 
physician will assign a grade of radiation dermatitis for each photo, and the results will be assessed for  
reliability between the physicians with kappa statistics. A target kappa statistic of 0.8 will define good 
inter-rater reliability. If the target kappa statistic after the first set of photos is not met, the physicians 
will discuss and come to a consensus  for each photo. A second set of 10 photos will then be assessed 
individually, and the kappa statistic will be again calculated. This process will be repeated for three 
iterations or until the target kappa score of 0.8 is met, whichever comes first.  
 
If the kappa statistic of 0.8 is not met, a jurisdiction will be held every three months during the accrual 
of the trial. The jurisdiction will involve both physicians reviewing every photo of every patient 
enrolled since the previous jurisdiction (or start of the trial in case of the first jurisdiction). For the 
photos on which there is disagreement, the physicians will meet to discuss and come to a consensus 
grade for each photo. The consensus grade will be recorded as the final grade for that photo.  
 
If the target kappa statistic of 0.8 is met and good inter -rater reliability is established, then spot -checks 
will be performed every three months during the accrual of the trial. A spot -check will involve the 
physicians assessing a set of the same 5 randomly -selected photos.  
 
10.3  Primary Outcome  
The primary outcome is the proportion  of patients who experience Grade E  radiation dermatitis as 
defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis S coring System in each arm of the study . 
 
10.3.1 Measurement Methods  
 
The primary outcome will be assessed and graded by the treating physician, a radiation oncologist , 
who will give an individual score of the irradiated area at baseline, once weekly during radiation 
treatment course, at the end of the radiation treatment co urse +/- 10 days, and at the patient’s follow up 
visit 3-12 weeks after completion of the radiation treatment course.  The final grading of radiation 
dermatitis for each time point will be subject to the inter -rater reliability processes described in Sectio n 
10.2. 
 
Protocol Version 6 16  10.4  Secondary Outcome s 
The secondary outcome s are to assess the time to development of Grade E  radiation dermatitis and the 
quality of life and  level of pain  before, during, and after radiotherapy.  
 
10.4.1 Measurement Methods  
 
Patients will be seen once weekly during radiation therapy by the treating physician, who will perform 
the weekly clinical skin assessments. At the time Grade E  radiation dermatitis develops, the study 
coordinator will be notified, and the patient will be switched to standard management for radiation 
dermatitis . 
 
The MBPI will be administered at the  time of randomization, at 40 -50 Gy of radiation treatment, at the 
end of radiation treatment +/ - 10 days, and at the follow -up visit 3-12 weeks after completion  of 
radiation treatment.  
 
11. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Institutional Review of Protocol  
The protocol, the proposed informed consent and all forms of participant information related to the 
study (e.g. advertisements used to recruit participants) will be reviewed and approved by the Stanford 
IRB and Stanford Cancer Institute Scientific Review Committee (SRC).  Any changes made to the 
protocol will be submitted as a modification and will be approved by the IRB prior to implementation.  
The Protocol Direc tor will disseminate the protocol amendment information to all participating 
investigators.  
 
11.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
The Stanford Cancer Institute Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will be the monitoring 
entity for this study. The DS MC will audit study -related activities to determine whether the study has 
been conducted in accordance with the protocol, local standard operating procedures, FDA regulations, 
and Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  This may include review of the following type s of documents 
participating in the study: regulatory binders, case report forms, eligibility checklists, and source 
documents.  In addition, the DSMC will regularly review serious adverse events and protocol 
deviations associated with the research to ensu re the protection of human subjects.  Results of the 
DSMC audit will be communicated to the IRB and the appropriate regulatory authorities at the time of 
continuing review, or in an expedited fashion, as needed.  
 
 
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Randomization Method  
Block randomization will be used to stratify by  type of chemotherapy: cisplatin, cetuximab, no 
chemotherapy . 
 
12.2 Sample Size J ustification  
The primary endpoint is the proportion  of patients who develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (a s 
defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) in each arm during a course of radiation 
therapy. From prior clinical e xperience, we anticipate that 80 % of patients will experience Grade E  
radiation dermatitis with standard sk in care. In ord er to detect a 20 % reduction in patients with Grade 
E radiation dermatitis (80% vs 60 % in those treated with dilute hypochlorite solution) with Type I 
error of 0.05 and Type II error of 20% (power of 80%) , 170 patients will be enrolled.  
Protocol Version 6 17   
12.3 Primary A nalysis 
The primary endpoint is the proportion  of patients who develop Grade E  radiation dermatitis (as 
defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) in each arm during a course of radiation 
therapy. A multiple logistic regression model w ill be used controlling for type of chemothera py 
(cisplatin, cetuximab, none).  
 
12.4 Secondary Analys es 
Secondary endpoints include th e time to development of Grade E  radiation dermatitis and the quality -
of-life and pain scores in each arm.  Time to develop ment of radiation dermatitis will be defined as time 
from Day 1 of radiation treatment to the f irst appearance of Grade E  radiation dermatitis. This data will 
be summarized with Kaplan -Meier curves. A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to compare 
the treatment groups. The model will adjust for type of chemotherapy and other patient characteristics 
should they prove to be significant. A repeated measures model will be used to analyze the quality -of-
life and pain scores. The model will adjust for type of chemotherapy and other patient characteristics 
should they prove to be significant.  
 
12.5  Accrual E stimates   
We estimate that approximately 2  patients with head and neck cancer start radiation therapy in a given 
week in our department. Assuming that 2/3 of these patients would be eligible for this study and would 
provide consent  with a 10% attrition rate , we estimate that this study will comple te accrual of 170 
patients in 142 weeks (or 36  months). 
 
12.6 Inter -Rater Reliability Testing  
 
Inter-rater reliability will be evaluated using the kappa statistic. A kappa statistic of 0.8 will define 
good inter -rater reliability . For details of how this method will be implemented, see Section 10.2.  
 
12.7 Criteria for Future S tudies  
If our hypothesis is correct and the hypochlorite solution reduc es the incidence of Grade E  radiation 
dermatitis, we plan to initiate a multi-institution, phase III randomized clinical trial with the intention 
of establishing the  prophylactic use of topical dilute hypochlorite solution  as standard of care to 
prevent radiation dermatitis in  patients undergoing radiation therapy for  head and neck cancer .

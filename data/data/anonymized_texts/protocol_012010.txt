Protocol Title 
Youth Ending the HIV Epidemic - Automated Directly Observed Therapy Pilot: Improving HIV  
Care Among Youth  
Background  
Health disparities among young adults living with HIV (YLWH) . Despite improvements in  life 
expectancy among people living with HIV (PLWH) and reductions in HIV transmission with 
increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), a sustained effect of ART depends on high  
levels of adherence. In the US in 2018, for every 100 youth diagnosed with HIV, 79 received  
some HIV care, 58 were retained in care, and 60 were virally suppressed.1 These figures are  
dramatically lower than those for older adults.2-5 In addition to increased onward HIV  
transmission, poor adherence can increase drug resistance, leading to less effective treatment  
options and worse clinical outcomes.6 Consequently, YLWH represent a priority population to  
address with efforts to increase re -engagement in care and improved ART adherence. The  
overarching goal of this Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Supplement application is to pilot test  
an innovative intervention, Youth Ending the HIV Epidemic (YEHE), to improve ART adherence  
and HIV virologic suppression in 18 –29-year -old YLWH .  
 
Use of an innovative intervention to improve HIV health outcomes among YLWH . There  is 
growing interest in the use of novel technologies to provide objective measures to efficiently  
monitor and support medication adherence with reduced cost and burden to patients and  
providers. These tools are well suited for young people who are proportionately high users of  
mobile technologies.7-9 Digital directly observed therapy (DOT) has been shown to be 
acceptable,  feasible, and effective at increasing medication adherence in different populations 
and for a range  of health outcomes, including adherence to HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis 
(PrEP).10-14 Automated  DOT (aDOT) is an innovative technology that uses artificial intelligence 
(AI) with computer vision  and deep learning algorithms to track and support adherence through 
a smartphone.10,15 -17 However, to our knowledge, aDOT has not been used to help enhance ART 
adherence among  YLWH who may need adherence support. Additionally, aDOT provides a 
seamless and convenient  platform for providing Conditional Economic Incentives (CEIs) because 
it monitors real- time  adherence to automatically determine who can receive incentives. CEIs 
use operant conditioning  to reinforce behavior through financial incentives or prizes18 that have 
been shown to be  sustainable in some settings.19 CEI has been used successfully to increase ART 
adherence and  promote behavior change, and studies using in- person DOT for tuberculosis 
have found that the  benefits of DOT were even further increased with the addition of financial 
incentives.20-25 Consequently, a combined aDOT -CEI platform where medication -taking is 
monitored and incentivized in  real time is a promising approach to increase ART adherence in 
YLWH. We aim to pilot test an aDOT -CEI intervention, YEHE, to improve ART adherence among 
YLWH (18 –29 years -old) in California and Florida who have an unsuppressed HIV viral load . 
 
Our study is significant  because it has the potential to be cost -effective while improving ART  
adherence and virologic suppression among a key population experiencing health disparities. 
This research builds on our prior work using technology -based interventions to improve HIV 
clinical outcomes among YLWH.26-29 Our intervention is innovative  because we will use a novel 
aDOT -CEI intervention among YLWH who are not virologically suppressed. This EHE application 
will document the feasibility and acceptability of aDOT -CEI and will provide preliminary data to 
inform  an R01 to test the efficacy of aDOT -CEI in addressing disproportionately low viral 
suppression  among YLWH.  
 
Objectives  
 
Young adults have a disproportionately high rate of HIV infection, high rates of attrition at all stages of the HIV care continuum, an increased risk of antiretroviral therapy (ART)  
nonadherence  and virologic failure, and a high probability of disease progression and 
transmission. Tracking and  monitoring objective measures of ART adherence in real time is 
critical to strategies to support  adherence and improve clinical outcomes. However, adherence 
monitoring often relies on self -reported  and retrospective d ata or requires extra effort from 
providers to understand adherence  patterns,
30 making it difficult for providers to accurately 
determine how to support their patients  in real time. In the proposed study, we will monitor 
medication -taking using a real- time objective  measure of adherence that does not rely on 
healthcare providers for assessment.   
 
Prior research shows high feasibility and acceptability of technology -based directly observed 
therapy (DOT) to improve medication adherence with reduced provider and patient burden versus  in-person DOT.
10-14 Additionally, financial barriers, side effects, and struggles with 
waning  motivation to continue ART are commonly cited barriers to adherence among young 
adults living  with HIV (YLWH).31,32 Conditional Economic Incentives (CEIs) have been used 
successfully to  promote a range of positive behaviors and have specifically  been coupled with 
in-person DOT t o improve ART adherence.18,20,21 In the current proposal, we build on the 
existing evidence and interventions and address underlying gaps in research by aiming to pilot 
test the Youth Ending  the HIV Epidemic (YEHE) intervention to improve ART adherence in 18 –
29-year -old YLWH in  California and Florida.  
 In Aim 1, we will enroll YLWH aged 18 to 29 to participate in a 3 -month pilot study to assess the  
feasibility and acceptability of a novel automated directly observed therapy -conditional 
economic  incentive (aDOT -CEI) intervention. In Aim 2, some of the pilot participants and 
staff/providers  from participating AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) clinics will participate in 
individual in -depth  qualitative interviews to explore intervention and implementation 
facilitators and barriers. These  Aims will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence on 
feasibly and acceptability to determine  whether a future trial is merited based on set criteria.  
 
Preliminary Studies  
 Prior research shows high feasibility and acceptability of technology -based DOT to improve  
medication adherence with reduced provider and patient burden versus in -person DOT.
10-14 
Additionally, financial barriers, side effects, and struggles with waning motivation to continue 
ART are commonly cited barriers to adherence among YLWH.31,32 CEIs have been used 
successfully  to promote a range of positive behaviors and have specifically been coupled with 
in-person DOT to  improve ART adherence.18,20,21 In the current proposal, we build on the 
existing evidence and interventions and address underlying gaps in research by aiming to pilot 
test a novel mHealth app  that combines aDOT  with CEI to improve ART adherence in 18 –29-
year -old YLWH.  
Sample Size and Eligibility  
 
Total Enrollment – 30 participants and 5 providers/staff from the AHF clinics  
- Aim 1: 30 YLWH  
- Aim 2: 15 YLWH from Aim 1 + 5 providers/staff from the AHF clinics  
 
Inclusion Criteria – Participants will be included if they meet the following  
criteria:  
- 18 to 29 years of age  
- Have access to a smartphone  
- Can speak and read English or Spanish  
- Client is at an AHF clinic in California or Florida  
- Client has an unsuppressed HIV viral load at least 3 months post HIV diagnosis  
- Client is on once daily oral antiretroviral therapy  
- Consent to participate in the proposed study  
 
Exclusion Criteria - Participants will be excluded if they meet the following  
criteria:  
- YLWH who are newly HIV diagnosed in the past 3 months  
- Smartphone is a Samsung galaxy s21 or iPhone 5SE (app is not supported by these  
phones)  
Recruitment  
 
We will recruit YLWH from AHF clinics in CA (San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, and San  
Diego) and FL. AHF will generate a list of clients from their database of YLWH aged 18 –29 who  
have an unsuppressed viral load. From this list, clients will be randomly selected and contacted by AHF for interest in the study (refer to attached recruitment script). To recruit YLWH who are 
out of care, clients will be contacted by AHF providers or staff through the Back in Care 
program.  Clients out of care are called regu larly and will be offered the intervention to assess 
interest and  eligibility. Interested clients will be encouraged to contact the study team for 
further information,  screening, and enrollment; or they may be asked for permission to share 
their contact information with the study team to reach out to them (refer to attached screening 
script).   
 Clients may also reach out to the study team directly if they see a flyer in the clinic.  
 
For Aim 2, a sample of the YLWH participants and staff/providers from participating AHF clinics  
will be purposively selected and invited to participate in an interview. Research staff will reach 
out by phone/text/email to assess for interest and schedule a time for the interview.  
 
Procedures  
 
In Aim 1, we will enroll YLWH aged 18 to 29 to participate in a 3 -month pilot study to assess the  
feasibility and acceptability of a novel automated directly observed therapy -conditional 
economi c incentive (aDOT -CEI) intervention. In Aim 2, some of the pilot participants and 
staff/providers  from participating AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) clinics will participate in 
individual in -depth  qualitative interviews to explore intervention and implementation 
facilitators and barriers. These  Aims will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence on 
feasibly and acceptability to determine  whether a future trial is merited based on set criteria.  
In the first year of the study, we will hire and train study staff. We will invite YLWH from AHF  
sites in CA to form the study Youth Advisory Panel (YAP) and seek their input throughout the  
study on the AiCure app used for the intervention, financial incentive structure, recruitment 
and retention strategies, and dissemination of the study findings. The YAP will provide feedback 
on (1)  the schedule used to deliver incentives, (2) the size of the incentive, and (3) the type of 
incentive. YAP members also will  provide input on the information that should be provided  
through the app and other study materials (e.g., communication about how to use the app to  
receive incentives, and reminder messages). YAP members will review study materials (surveys,  
instructions, videos) before study launch and will provide input on recruitment, engagement, and retention strategies, next steps, and contextualization and dissemination of the findings.  
We will  work with AiCure to implement any required changes to the app that have e merged 
from formative research. The app will then be piloted with YLWH who will use the platform for 
a period  of 3 months (Aim 1).   
For the pilot, we will recruit YLWH from AHF clinics in CA and FL. During enrollment, participants  will be informed about the study. Following consent, participants will be given 
instructions to  download the app to their mobile phone, and study staff will demonstrate how 
to use the app via  a remote conferencing platform. They will complete a tutorial and 
demonstrate taking ART using  the app. The app will record video of the participant taking their 
HIV medication in order to  monitor the participant's medica tion adherence. Participants will 
complete online surveys at  baseline and 3 months. We will have monthly check -ins with 
participants which we will assess app  use and help increase study engagement. We will 
measure feasibility and acceptability through  app paradata (i.e., app use information) and self -
report in surveys (baseline, 3 months). At consent, we will also have the participants sign a 
HIPAA form so that we may request adherence  related  medical record data from their AHF 
clinic. We will use this data to compare against  adherence monitored by the AiCure app.  
Following completion of the pilot, we will conduct in -depth interviews (IDIs) with YLWH and 
staff/providers purposively selected from participating AHF clinics. Interviews will explore intervention  experiences, potential influences on current and long -term ART adherence, 
unaddressed adherence barriers and the potential benefit of features (e.g., reminders), 
individual- level and  clinic -level barriers and facilitator to intervention implementation, assess 
ease of use of aDOT -CEI, likes and dislikes, and sugge sted modifications for a future efficacy 
trial. Interviews will be  conducted remotely using a HIPAA -compliant, licensed Zoom account 
and audio -recorded. The  interviews will be semi- structured to explore key questions, with 
allowance for iteration and  probing on emergent themes raised by participants. We will explore 
the benefit of individual  (aDOT, CEI) and combined components (aDOT+CEI).  
During the study, we will continue to meet with the YAP to discuss challenges and potential  
solutions. After completion of the study, we will discuss the study findings with the YAP and other  groups, such as the Center for AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS), the CAPS Community 
Advisory  Board (CAPS CAB), Departments of Public Health in major cities of California, California 
State  Office of AIDS, Medi- Cal managed care plans, private insurers (such as Kaiser 
Permanente), Ryan  White planning councils, and other groups with a strong working knowledge 
of HIV service  delivery and funding in California. The purpose of these meetings will be to 
determine next steps  and developing sustainable models for implementation of this service 
should it be found to be  effective. For example, if the study is efficacious, we will explore 
mechanisms for its  implementation.  
Consent Process  
 
Aim 1: Interested clients will be encouraged to contact the study team, or will be asked for  
permission to share their contact information with the study team. The study team will screen  
them to determine eligibility, and if eligible, will offer to enroll them in the study. Consent and  
enrollment will occur online through Qualtrics by a study team member. Interested individuals will be given adequate time to read the consent form and the study team member will be 
available to  answer any questions via phone. The consent form will include information about 
potential risks  and benefits, that participation is completely voluntary and will not affect the 
care that  participants receive, and that they may withdraw from the study at any time. The 
individual must  read and sign the informed consent before participating. As part of the consent 
form, participants  will be notified that we will collect extensive contact information to facilitate 
tracking, including (1) names and information of 1 to 3 contacts who may know the participant’s whereabouts; (2)  collection of additional information, including addresses of sites 
that the participant frequents,  such as free food distribution centers, shelters, bars, 
probation/parole offices, etc.; and (3)  attaining at least 3 methods of contact (e.g., mobile 
telephone number, email address, mailing  address, or social media username).  
 
Aim 2: Study staff will obtain verbal informed consent either by phone or Zoom, and consent  
documents will be emailed to participants. Any and all participant questions and concerns will 
be addressed prior to beginning the interview.  
 
Data Collection and Analysis  
 
In Aim 1, we will conduct a pilot study to assess feasibility and acceptability of the use of aDOT -
CEI among 30 YLWH and collect survey data at baseline and after 3 months of app use ( Table 1). 
We will measure feasibility and acceptability through app paradata (i.e., app use information) and self -report in surveys (baseline, 3 months).

In Aim 2, we will explore intervention and implementation facilitators/barriers by conducting 
in-depth qualitative interviews with 1 5 YLWH and 5 staff/providers from participating AHF 
clinics. We will examine their intervention experiences, potential influences on current and long -term ART adherence, unaddressed adherence barriers and potential benefit of features 
(e.g., reminders), individual- level and clinic -level barriers and facilitators to intervention 
implementation, assess ease of use of aDOT -CEI, and suggested modifications for a future 
efficacy trial.  
 The proposed project aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a novel aDOT -CEI 
intervention and is not designed or powered to determine the overall intervention effect nor the effects of individual components.
33-37 It will provide quantitative and qualitative evidence 
on feasibly and acceptability to determine whether a future trial is merited based on set 
criteria.  
 Quantitative analysis . The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability of the aDOT -CEI 
intervention. To assess these outcomes, we will describe feasibility and acceptability measures at each time point within the intervention arm. One -way frequency tables will be generated for 
all feasibility and acceptability measures and measures of central tendency and variability will 
be computed for continuous measures. To examine feasibility of intervention procedures, we 
will examine demographic characteristics of those who participated in the study as compared 
with  those who did not, and who were retained as compared with those who were not, using 
two-way tables. Demographic characteristics will include age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, sexual 
identity,  education, income, work, school, living situation, city of residence, and ever homeless 
or incarcerated. To determine if there is evidence to support a future trial, we will describe the  
percentage who meet each threshold for feasibility and acceptability at the end of the study  
period. We selected these thresholds based on our prior pilot studies among Y LWH.
27,29 
Mechanisms of action will be assessed in formative research and through qualitative and  
quantitative data to inform any needed modifications to implementation for a future trial.  
 Qualitative analysis . The research coordinator will transcribe and de -identify all interviews by  
removing names and identifying details, and assist with analysis using Dedoose qualitative  
analysis software. Dedoose software allows for excerpts of transcribed interviews to be coded to be identified and associated with different themes from the interviews. This will allow the 
analysis  to organize content into higher -order themes while also allowing easy access to 
personal narratives of the respondents. We will develop a codebook and organize themes on 
the basis of the interview excerpts and discuss and utilize analytic memos.
38 During analysis, we 
will draw  on our knowledge of the intervention and the Key Principles in Contingency 
Management  Implementation23 to determine how participant feedback may shape future 
iterations of the  aDOT -CEI. 
Risks to Subjects  
Protection against loss of privacy:   
Loss of confidentiality is the main potential risk associated with participation in this study. We 
will take appropriate precautions to minimize loss of confidentiality. Identifying information will 
be stored separately from health and behavioral information. Health and behavioral data will 
be identified only with a participant ID. Individuals will not be identified in any reports or 
publications  of the research. All participant identifying data maintained for the study will be 
accessible only to  the projec t staff via the aDOT mobile health app or Qualtrics, which are 
HIPAA -compliant, and via a HIPAA- compliant server that is only accessible to selected project 
staff.  
Security and privacy are our top priority. Consequently, for the design and development of the  
mobile health app, we have partnered with AiCure to use an existing HIPAA -compliant mobile  
health app that maximizes security. Participants are automatically logged off each time they 
exit the app. The patient portal seen by the Research Coordinator is secure and de -identified. 
The app  icon is study and treatment agnostic and does not contain any symbol or name that 
would identify someone as being HIV -positive or as a member of the study, so that anyone who 
may  inadvertently see the icon on a participant’s mobile phone cannot trace it to this study.  
Founded in 2010 and funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and leading institutional  
investors, AiCure has more than 65 issued patents and works with global clients in over 40  
countries. The AiCure aDOT mobile health app has been used in numerous populations to  
improve  adherence to medication and validated with individuals of different races/ethnicities. 
AiCure will continue to update and improve the app within the known best practices for HIPAA -
compliant  apps and will maintain the highest level of security.  
Any participant who does not feel comfortable answering any survey questions at baseline and 
3 months will be reminded that study participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw at 
any time. Participants will be reminded that they may withdraw from the study at any point and 
not have their clinical information transferred from AHF and incorporated in the study 
database.  
In Aim 2, to protect against loss of privacy and confidentiality, prior to initiating the audio  
recording  of the qualitative interviews, participants will be asked to not use any names and all  
names stated inadvertently will be replaced with aliases in transcripts. All these interviews will 
be conducted and audio -recorded via a HIPAA- compliant web conference platform (e.g., Zoom) 
and audio -recordings will be stored on a HIPAA- compliant server with access available only to 
select  study staff who are not employed at AHF (to protect employee participant anonymity). 
All audio  recorded  files will be deleted on completion of the study. All data will be collected for 
the purpose  of this proposed research only and will be password protected.  
Dr. Saberi will consult with Drs. Stoner and Sukhija -Cohen on a weekly basis for specific 
problems  and questions as they may arise. Drs. Saberi, Stoner, Neilands, and Sukhija- Cohen 
have been  involved in prior large -scale intervention and assessment trials that included 
vulnerable  participants and confidential personal information. Dr. Saberi will consult with the 
UCSF  Institutional Review Board (IRB) for guidance throughout the course of the study. . 
Risk to Benefit Ratio  
 
Participants may potentially benefit through an improved ability to engage in HIV care 
(including increased retention, enhanced ART adherence, and achievement of viral 
suppression), CEIs, and study -participation incentives. Improving engagement in care could lead 
to improved quality of life and reduced HIV transmission to others. If the study finds that the intervention is feasible and  acceptable, the intervention could be expanded further to a large 
multisite randomized clinical trial to improve engagement  in HIV care among YLWH, other age 
groups living with HIV, and other conditions where medication adherence is critical (e.g., hepatitis C treatment).  
 
The proposed study will provide important information about the feasibility and acceptability of 
an aDOT -CEI intervention to increase viral suppression among YLWH. This information is 
important for research among YLWH who may have greater difficulty adhering to their medications and experience health disparities at a higher rate than older individuals living with HIV. The  information gained could influence and improve care for other YLWH. Consequently, 
the minor potential risks to participants are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge to be gained.  
Data Management  
 All data collected during the study will be used for research purposes only. The sources of data  
will be mainly paradata from the AiCure app, self -report from participants on online surveys,  
qualitative interviews, and clinical data provided by AHF. No blood specimens or other body fluid  will be obtained for this study, and no hazardous conditions are imposed in the conduct of 
this study. The sources of research materials for this proposed study are data from the 
following:  
 
- The AiCure platform and app usage data (paradata). We have received approval to use this app from the IT security assessment team.  
- Online survey data from youth participating in our research (collected at baseline and 3  
months), which include demographic data, healthcare accessibility, technology use,  
perceived engagement in HIV care, engagement with provider, and subsistence needs.  
- AHF clinical data (collected as part of health care), including HIV viral load, appointment  
attendance and antiretroviral therapy adherence.  
- Qualitative interviews where YLWH and staff/providers from participating AHF clinics  
discuss their experience with and their perspectives on their HIV care and on participating  in this study. Qualitative interviews will include questions around 
intervention experiences,  potential influences on current and long -term ART adherence, 
unaddressed adherence  barriers and the potential benefit of features (e.g., reminders), 
individual- level and clinic  level  barriers and facilitator to intervention implementation, 
assess ease of use of aDOTCEI,  likes and dislikes, and suggested modifications for a 
future efficacy trial.  
 The research team will have access to participant identities. Data will be collected solely for this  
study. An electronic database system (stored on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability  Act of 1996 [HIPAA] -compliant server) will be used to track participants, and 
participants also will  be tracked via the aDOT mobile health app, which is also HIPAA- compliant. 
All files will be  password restricted and user ID protected so that only certain identified 
research staff will have  access to the files. All data will be electronically collected and stored on 
HIPAA -compliant servers  and will be limited to study staff only.

 1  INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
 
1.1  Purpose  
The pur pose of this r andomized controlled trial  is to assess  and compare  
radiographic and clinical outcomes in patients who are to undergo combined 
interbody/posterolateral lumbar fusion procedures , supplemented with pedicle 
screw instrumentation,  using one of the following interbody cages;  the Nexxt  Spine 
Nexxt  MatrixxTM 3D-printed titanium cage or  the HonourTM poly-ether -ether -ketone 
cage.   
 2  INTRODUCTION 
 
2.1  Background  
 
In 2012, over 727,000 spinal fusion and non- fusion procedures were performed in 
the US  (Millennium Research Group (MRG), 2013) . This included treatment for 
various conditions such as DDD, spinal stenosis, spondylosis, spondylolisthesis, 
spinal deformities, tumors, and traumatic spinal injuries. Over time, intervertebral discs wear down and lose water and then disc height. The degeneration of these discs can impact the spine in several ways, including spinal canal stenosis, 
spondylolisthesis, and osteophyte and bony growth formation. These changes can 
impinge on the spinal cord and nerve roots, causing chronic pain. Consequently, as the older population in the US expands, demand for treatments that address back and extremity pain will rise accordingly. The correlation between age and the 
incidence of DDD has been well -documented; for example, one study concluded 
that there was a direct relationship between age and the macroscopic grade of degeneration caused by DDD  (Quint and Wilke, 2008) .
  Increasing rates of obesity 
in the US will also likely contribute to growth in spinal fusion and non- fusion 
volumes because obesity represents a risk factor for DDD  (Hangai M, et al. , 2008 ).  
 
The premise behind fusion surgery for lower back pain ( LBP) and leg pain is that 
a degenerated and mobile lumbar s egment acts as a pain generator. 
Consequently, if motion is prohibited through a fusion, it is expected that the patient 
will experience improvement in both pain and disability , which will increase their 
ability to function. Currently, there is no way to be certain which structure or structures actually are causing the pain, but the main interest has been focused 
on the facet joints, disc s, or a combination of both  (Fritzell P  et al., 2002) . 
 
Lumbar spine fusion rates can vary according to the surgical technique.   Although 
many studies on spinal fusion have been con ducted and reported, the 
heterogeneity of the study designs and data handling make it difficult to identify 
 
Page 5 of 17 
 which approach yields the highest fusion rate. Traditional posterolateral inter  
transverse process fusion (PLF) still remains a good procedure with acceptable 
fusion rates for most degenerative conditions. For solid fusion, PLF can be 
combined with i nterbody fusion (IF) to circumferentially stabilize the relevant 
segment, even though it is unclear whether this improves the rate of fusion (Lee et 
al, 2011).  
 A bone graft or bone graft substitute is required to produce the fusion and can be implanted on its own, in the posterolateral gutters, or contained with an interbody device using either a posterior or anterior approach. Spinal fusion procedures ar e 
the largest source  of bone graft product use. The current gold standard is autograft 
bone, wherein tissue is harvested from the patient, usually from the iliac crest or 
locally, and is then placed over the fusion surfaces . Autograft is the gold standard 
because it possesses all of the characteristics necessary for new bone growth—
namely, osteoconductivity, osteogenicity, and osteoinductivity. Osteoconductivity 
refers to the situation in which the graft supports the attachment of new osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells, providing an interconnected structure through which new cells can migrate and new vessels can form.  Osteogenicity refers to the situation when the osteoblasts that are at the site of new bone formation are able 
to produce minerals to calc ify the collagen matrix that forms the substrate for new 
bone. Osteoinductivity refers to the ability of a graft to induce nondifferentiated 
stem cells or osteoprogenitor cells to differentiate into osteoblasts  (Laurencin C . et 
al., 2006).  
 The mechanical and structural properties of an interbody device are used to support osteogenesis across the interbody space and contribute to the success of a spinal fusion procedure. One of the most popular synthetic implant materials is 
poly-ether -ether -ketone (PEEK).  PEEK is used as a spacer between vertebrae 
while providing surfaces allowing for  bone formati on. While macroscale properties 
such as implant shape contribute to the growth of a fusion mass, microscale 
properties such as implant topography likely play a much larger role through 
facilitating osteoblastic differentiation, osteoid synthesis, and mineralization.  
 
Recent studies have shown that PEEK does not integrate well with the surrounding 
bone and instead may form a fibrous connective interface  (Kurtz and Devine, 2007;  
Anjarwalla et al., 2006) . Recently, the relative failure of osseo- integration observed 
with PEEK implants has been demonstrated to be associated with the reduced ability of cells on the implant surface to generate an environment ri ch in angiogenic 
factors. In contrast, implants fabricated from titanium result in good bone- to‐
implant contact and are osseo- integ rated into the surrounding bone.  Osteoblasts 
 
Page 6 of 17 
 on rough titanium substrates have been shown to produce angiogenic factors 
including significantly higher VEGF -A and FGF ‐2 levels on smooth and rough 
titanium alloys than on PEEK, an effect significantly more robust on rough titanium alloy ( Olivares‐Navarrete et al., 2013).   
 
 
2.2  Device Description  
 
Subjects enrolled in this study will have either  the Nexxt Spine Nexxt  Matrixx
TM 3D-
printed titanium cage or the HonourTM PEEK cage  impla nted at each level of 1 or 
2-level lumbar arthrodesis procedures . All constructs will be supplemented with a 
pedicle screw system (Depuy  Synthes Expedium) cleared for lumbar spinal fusion.  
 
Nexxt  MatrixxTM interbody fusion cages are manufactured with detailed 
specifications utilizing modern 3 -D printing technology to replicate the cellular 
structure of cancellous bone. 3- D printing technology allows for the creation of a 
complex lattice geometry  that cannot be created by traditional orthope dic 
manufacturing processes. First, a uniform 3- D architecture with a consistent 70% 
porosity provides an optimal biomechanical and biological environme nt for 
promotion of osseous tissue regeneration throughout implant walls. Second, an interconnected array of 300- 700μm  pores creates ideal an environment for natural 
influx of proteins, hormones, growth factors and mesenchymal stem cells to promote osteoinduction.  
 
In a review article by Karageorgiou and colleagues  (2005) , a noted minimum pore 
size of 100 μm was reported to be  more conducive to bone ingrowth than pore 
sizes less than 75 μm. However, the authors recommended  pore sizes greater 
than 300 μm as other  studies have shown a better osteogenic response. In a 
transcortical rabbit study, titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) implants  with 100, 200, and 300  
μm pores were compared;  the larger pore size s result ed in a higher percentage of 
bone within the pores and a higher percentage of that bone to be lamellar  (Götz 
HE et al., 2004) . Another study  used a 3D -printed Ti6Al4V  scaffold i mplanted over 
the transverse process of goats to study the effects of pore size and porosity on 
osseointegration  (Li JP et al., 2007) . Five groups of implants having a pore size 
and porosity ranging from 160μm/39% to 680μm/ 68% were evaluated. While t he 
small sample size prevented an evaluation of statistical significance , data trends 
led to the conclusion that the larger pores and porosity  allow for  greater amount s 
of newly formed bone. T aken together, t hese studies support the varied porosity 
selection of 300-700μm pore size of the Nexxt  Matrixx™ System implants.  
 
 
Page 7 of 17 
 An additional paramete r evaluated is  the surface finish (Götz HE et al., 2004) . One 
set of the 200μm implants were surface- blasted using an aluminum oxide such 
that a roughness average (Ra) of 7.25μm resulted. The effect of this roughness 
was an increase in t he bone -implant contact overall  on the surface and within the 
pores. However, a later study (Nakada H. et al, 2007)  compared os seointegration 
when alumina and a multiphase calcium phosphate (MCD) were used as the blast 
media. B lasted Ti6Al4V  cylinders were implanted into rabbit tibiae  and were then 
evaluated two and four weeks after implantation. The histologic results showed the 
MCD to illicit a greater volume of new bone formation. The MCD used in this study 
is the same as the calcium phosphate blast media used in the manufacture of the 
Nexxt Matrixx™ System implants.   
 
The Nexxt Matrixx™ System implants have a rou ghened surface with a Ra  
measurement ranging from 5.0 to 11.8 that is attained via a calcium phosphate 
surface -blasting process. As stated above, this surface was selected specifically 
due to its capacity for osseointegration.  
 
3  TRIAL DESIGN 
 3.1  Design  
 
The randomize d controlled trial  will prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of the Nexxt Matrixx
TM System titanium implan t supplemented with a pedicle screw 
system  as compared to a representative PEEK cage currently used in routine 
fashion for lumbar interbody fusion  procedures. This study will capture clinical and 
radiographic outcomes on patients  up to 2 years  post operatively . Both cage s will 
be used in conjunction with milled local autograft bone generated as part of the 
spinal fusion procedure (no iliac crest autograft will be utilized).  
This single centered study will enroll up to 70  subjects  (n = 35  per group) , with 
subjects followed for a minimum of 12 months post -surgery.  All subjects enrolled 
in the study will be recruited from a  pool of subjects eligible for combined  
interbody/ posterolateral  lumbar  fusion surgery. The inclusion/exclusion criteria are 
listed below.

 4  STUDY PROCEDURE  
 
4.1  Screening Assessments 
4.1.1  Informed Consent  
Subjects will be provided with an informed consent and will be given ample 
opportunity to review the consent and ask questions. The signed informed consent will be obtained before any study specific procedures , that are not part of the 
investigator’s standard of care  begin. A copy of the informed consent will be given 
to the subject. All subjects who meet all of the entry criteria will be considered for inclusion in this trial. Any subject meeting any of the exclusion criteria will be excluded from the trial.  
All subjects who have agreed to participate in this study, have signed the informed consent and who meet the inclusion/ exclusion criteria will be considered enrolled 
and assigned a subject ID number. Once a Subject ID number has been issued, it cannot b e reassigned or used for another subject.  
4.1.2  Medical History and Demographic Data   
Within 60 days prior to the surgery date, the following information will be collected:  
• Demographic data  
• Medical history, including a complete history of spinal disorder( s) (non -
operative or operative treatments performed)  
• Physical examination (including height, weight)  
• X-Rays  
• Current pain medications and other drug therapies.  
• Neurological status -  All subjects’ neurological status will be assessed and 
recorded as intact or not intact, based upon the investigator’s motor, sensory and reflex evaluations.  
 
4.1.3  Pregnancy Screening  
A pregnancy test will be performed and negative results shall be kept on file for all 
female subjects unless infertile  or post -menopausal to ensure subjects are not 
enrolled into the study who are pregnant.  
 
Page 10 of 17 
 4.1.4  Clinical Assessments 
Subject study data will be collected preoperatively, intra- operatively and 
postoperatively at 3, 6, 12, and  when available 24 months.  The following data will 
be recorded on the Case Report Forms (CRFs) and in addition, electronic data 
entry will be employed via an Internet connection when possible using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) program.  
 
Oswestry Disability Index  version 2.1a (ODI  v2.1a):  Pre -operatively the subject 
will complete the  Oswestry  Disability Index for a baseline low back pain and 
function assessment .  The questionnaire is a combi ned pain and function index 
which will be used to assess the subject’s back pain and how that pain affects the 
subject’s ability to manage in everyday life.   The questionnaire is divided into ten 
sections designed to assess limitati ons of various activities of daily living. Each 
section contains six statements and each statement describes a greater degree of 
difficulty in that activity than the preceding statement. The subject marks the one statement in each section, which describes his/her limitations most accurately. 
Each section is scored on a 0- 5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. The 
scores for all sections are added together, giving a possible score of 50.  The total is doubled and expressed as a percentage. If a subject marks two statements, the highest scoring statement is recorded as a true indication of his disability. If a 
section is not completed because it is inapplicable, the final score is adjusted to 
obtain a percentage.  
 Back and Radicular Leg Pain :  Preoperatively all subjects will assess their back 
and/or radicular leg pain in one or both legs using a visual analog scale (VAS) from 0 - 10 with 10 being considered most painful.  
 4.2 Randomization 
 
All subjects will be randomized in the trial to receive ei ther the Nexxt Spine Nexxt  
Matrixx
TM 3D-printed titanium cage or the HonourTM PEEK cage  supplemented 
with a pedicle screw system  and milled local autograft bone. Subject randomization 
will be stratified according to smoking status. Subjects will be blinded to their group status for the duration of the study assessments and procedures ( 12 months post -
operatively).  
 
4.3 Perioperative and Postoperative Management  
 
Surgeons  will perform  combined interbody and posterolateral lumbar fusion 
utilizing either Nexxt  Matrixx
TM or PEEK cages supplemented with a pedicle screw 
system cleared for fusion and milled local autograft bone (per customary protocol ).  
 
Page 11 of 17 
 Data will be collected during and immediately after the surgery according to the 
parameters described by the Nexxt  MatrixxTM IF/PLF  CRFs.  This includes: 
diagnosis, duration of surgery, blood loss, OR time, length of hospital stay, 
instrumentation used, ty pe of procedure, and surgical level (s).  In addition, all intra -
operative complications (e.g. excessive blood loss, hematoma, vascular injury, etc.) will be reported and recorded as a complication on the CRF.  
Intra-operative (after hardware installation is completed) or immediate post -
operative x -rays will be obtained. Postoperative care will follow the standard of 
care at each institution for subjects who undergo f usion procedures.  
 
Postoperative care is extremely important.  The subject should be warned t hat 
noncompliance  with postoperative instructions could lead to breakage of the 
pedicle screw system and/or possible migration requiring revision surgery to 
remove the pedicle screw system .

4.5  Follow -Up Assessments 
 
Subjects will be asked to return postoperatively at 3 months (± 1 week), 6 months  
(± 2 weeks), and 12 months (± 1 month) for a clinical and radiographic exam. An 
additional visit at 24 months may be scheduled at the request of either the physician or the subject.  The following data will be recorded on the Case Report 
 
Page 12 of 17 
 Forms (CRFs) and in addition, electronic data entry will be employed via an 
Internet  connection when possible using REDCap.  
 
Clinical assessment : The investigator will carry out a clinical examination at the 3, 
6, 12, and when available, 24-month  visits to assess:  
• subject compliance with postoperativ e care instructions,  
• ability to return to work and normal activity, and  
• any procedure related or device related adverse events since discharge from the hospital  
• review of medication usage  
• progress towards fusion consolidation  
• Neurological status -  All subjects’ neurological status will be assessed 
and recorded as intact or not intact, based upon the investigator’s motor, 
sensory and reflex evaluations.  
Subject self -assessment  (Patient completed forms) :    
• Each subject will be asked to complete a follow -up Oswestry Disability 
Index (ODI) form  and a Back and Leg Pain VAS form at each follow -up 
visit. 
Radiographic assessment:  Each subject will undergo AP, lateral and 
flexion/extension radiographs  at the 3, 6, 12, and  when available,  24-month visit s 
as well as a CT s can at 6  month s to assess:  
• integrity of the device and graft, with observation for events such as rod, 
hook, screw and/or spacer (if applicable) migration or subsidence, 
hardware fracture, and progress towards fusion consolidation  
Findin gs from any additional imaging studies deemed necessary by the 
investigator will be recorded and reported with study results.  
 
4.6 Independent Radiographic Assessment  
 An independent radiographic analysis will be performed to evaluate all images and assess subjects’ radiographic status.  The independent radiographer will receive 
deidentified disks and will not have access to any personally identifiable 
information.  The following quantitative and qualitative assessments will be 
performed.  
 
Fusion Determination  
 
Page 13 of 17 
  
Fusion will be assessed by an independent radiographer when dat a collection is 
complete. X-rays at each visit and a lumbar CT at 6 months will be evaluated for 
fusion determination.  Interbody fusion will be  graded by the method of  Brantigan 
and Steffee as modified to describe the Fraser  definition of locked pseud oarthrosis 
(BSF scale)  (Santos et al., 2003) . The grading system is as follows :   
• BSF-1: Radiographical pseudarthrosis  
• BSF-2: Radiogaphical locked pseudarthrosis  
• BSF-3: Radiographical fusion  
Radiographic Success: Radiographic success is defined by  radiographical fusion 
(BSF -3) presenting bone bridges within at least half of the fusion area with at least 
the density originally achieved at surgery.  
Radiographic Failure: Radiographic failure is defined by radiographical 
pseudarthrosis (BSF -1 or - 2) 
X-rays will be uploaded into the REDCap as a JPEG image at each subject visit.  
 4.7  Success Criteria  
4.7.1  Primary Measure of Effectiveness  
A subject will be considered a success if fusion is a Grade BSF -3 at 6 months. 
The primary outcome measure of effectiveness  will be determined by the fusion 
rate at 6 months post -operatively in subject s implanted with  either  titanium cage 
as compared to th e PEEK cage.  
4.7.2  Secondary Measure of Effectiveness  
Secondary measures of effectiveness will be determined by evidence and timing 
of fusion observed in X -rays post -operatively (3, 6, 12, and when available,  24 
months).  
 4.8  Subject Withdrawal  
 It is recognized that the subject’s participation in this trial is entirely voluntary, and that she/he may refuse to participate and may withdraw from participation at any time without jeopardy to any future medical care.  It is also recognized that the 
investig ator, at his/her discretion, may withdraw a subject from this study based 
upon his/her professional judgment.  
 
Other Conditions for Withdrawal : 
 
Page 14 of 17 
  
Any subject who develops a severe concurrent medical illness during the trial 
should be withdrawn.  This type of illness is defined as any illness that would hinder 
the subject’s ability to return for scheduled follow -up appointments.  Such a 
withdrawal will not be counted for the purposes of determining success or failure.  
 
5  COMPLICATIONS  
 
In addition to the sta ndard operating procedures for reporting complications per 
hospital/physician protocol, all clinical events, including both observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, symptoms, physical signs or disease which 
either occur during the study, having been absent at baseline, or, if present at baseline, appear to worsen during the clinical outcomes collection study are to be recorded as complications in the subject’s medical record and on the appropriate 
case report form.  
 
Complications  reported in the literature as most  commonly associated with 
interbody and posterolateral lumbar fusion procedures include, but are not limited 
to, infection, nerve damage, blood clots, blood loss , and bowel and bladder 
problems, along with complications associated with anesthesia.  A potential risk 
inherent to spinal fusion is failure of the vertebral bone and graft to properly fuse, a condition that may require additional surgery . 
  
 
5.1  Definitio ns 
 
A complication is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, performance, or any indic ation of the failure of a medical product  to 
meet a us er or customer’s expectations. The complication may be the possible 
failure of a  device or tissue product , labeling, or packaging to meet any of its 
specifications after it is released for distribution.  
 
6  STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed as deemed appropriate to evaluate fusion outcomes across the groups . 
 An interim analysis may be performed once, at minimum, half of the subject accrual is met. In the case early findings show a statistical difference between the two 
studied cages, enrollment will cease  as investigators are unlikely to maintain 
clinical equipoise to continue to randomize patients. Similarly, if the interim 
 
Page 15 of 17 
 analysis suggests it is unlikely the study will achieve statistical significance , the 
investigators may choose to close the trial early for futility. Currently enrolled 
subjects will be followed throughout the remainder of the study, up to 12 months 
post-surgery.

Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 7 of 48  1 BACKGROUND  
  
1.1 Spinal Metastases  
 
Despite advances in cancer therapy, metastatic disease is an eventual reality for 
innumerable oncology patients. With advances in systemic therapies, the life expectancy of cancer patients increases, concomitantly increasing the global burden of metastatic disease (1) . As patients live longer with metastases, the role of local therapy to ablate 
individually symptomatic and threatening tumor foci is increasingly important.  Spinal 
metastases, in particular, are considered critical disease foci for local treatment due to the substantial morbidity and mortality of disease progression in sites proximal to the spinal cord and nerve roots (2).
 
 
1.2 Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Metastatic Disease 
 
Within radiation oncology, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a favored modality for local ablation of metastatic disease. SBRT, defined as delivery of high -dose 
radiation in five or fewer fractions, offers sharp dose gradients that allow physicians to ablate such disease while sparing immediately adjacent critical structures. In -field control 
rates of metastases treated with SBRT are roughly 80% up to four years after therapy, even in series examining heterogeneous histologies, sites, and dose  (3-5). SBRT is particularly 
favored for oligometastatic disease, a phase in oncogenic progression where malignant 
clones have not yet achieved widespread malignant potential, often defined as three or fewer progressive sites of disease. Ablation of  metastases, particularly oligometastases, 
may improve not only patient functional status through local control but has also  recently 
been shown to improve overall survival  in solid tumor histologies (6 -8). Although a 
majority of patients who undergo SBRT for oligometastatic disease will experience relapse with distant metastases, approximately 20% of patients with in -field control remain 
disease -free at 2 -4 years of follow -up (3, 4, 6) . In a randomized prospective study by P alma  
et al., delivery of SBRT for oligometastases of broad histologic types  (five or fewer sites) 
improved median overall survival from 28 to 41 months compared to palliative  standard of 
care treatments such as chemotherapy (7). Of  patients treated with SBRT or other 
metastectomy who experience recurrence, as many as 60% have very limited metastatic 
progression that could be amenable to further intervention such as repeated SBRT  (8). 
Epidemiologic data suggests that patients undergoing such repetitive metastectomy have a 
survival benefit that is comparable to those undergoing their first procedure (9).
 
 Regarding spine metastases in particular, spine SBRT is a proven treatment modality and is often preferred  over conventionally fractionated radiation for patients who have good 
performance status, potentially long projected life spans, and/or radioresistant tumors
 (10). 
However, given the proximity of the spinal cord, the clinical standard of c are requires 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelography imaging in the process of radiation planning, in order to visualize the spinal cord itself as an organ-at-risk (OAR).  
 
 Typically, the spine SBRT treatment -planning paradigm is initiated through a simulation 
(planning) CT and a simulation MRI (or fusion of previously obtained diagnostic MR 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 8 of 48  image sets). Simulation typically takes place within several business days of the clinical 
consult appointment, and an additional 1- 2 weeks are needed from the time of simulation 
before a treatment plan is prepared and verified for delivery. Therefore, a patient may not start treatment until two weeks after their consult appointment. This workflow prolongs patient discomfort from painful osseous and nerve pain and increases the opportunity for further threatening of neurologic functions like ambulation and continence as tumors progress. Ideally, this workflow could be substantially compressed through advances in technology and treatment pl anning processes.  
 
1.3 Magnetic Resonance Image- guided Radiotherapy  
 
One such advance within radiation oncology is the emergence of magnetic resonance image -guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) over the past five years. MRgRT, which involves RT 
delivery using an integrated MRI, radiotherapy device, and dedicated treatment planning system, has become a staple at our institution since we became the first to clinically implement it in 2014 (11). Currently, two MRgRT devices are widely used: the original 
0.35 Tesla imaging unit integrate d with a tri- Cobalt -60 radiotherapy device and the newer 
device comprising a 0.35T MRI combined with a linear accelerator (MR -linac) (11, 12) . 
Although analyses have demonstrated that complex radiation  plans created for the tri -
Cobalt- 60 source are acceptable (13) , plans for small target volumes such as for SBRT are 
less conformal using a tri -Co-60 device compared to a traditional linear accelerator (14). 
Until now, this has limited some u ses of MRgRT for SBRT, such as for the spine where 
rapid dose fall -off and conformality adjacent to the spinal cord  is critical. However, we 
have recently completed commissioning of the newer MR -linac device and our institutional 
analyses indicate that pla n quality with the MR -linac is equivalent to CT -based linac plans , 
like those widely used for spine SBRT (unpublished internal data) . 
 Importantly, these MRgRT devices offer both daily imaging that is sufficient for treatment 
planning and plan modification “online” (while the patient lies on the treatment table)  (15, 
16). These daily plans,  typically created in response to changes in daily anatomy, are 
termed “adaptive radiotherapy” (ART). Stereotactic, MRI -guided ART (SMART) has 
become common at our institution and we have delivered 1060 adaptive treatment fractions in 190 unique treatment courses since 2014 (17, 18). Our primary use of SMART is for 
abdominal malignancies, for which daily planning while the patient lies on the treatment machine is a useful way to respond to inter -fraction bowel motion (17) . However, the 
SMART treatmen t planning process could theoretically also be used to generate the 
original plan, rather than to simply adapt existing plans. For sites like the spine, where treatment is urgent and the anatomy is more predictable, the SMART paradigm might allow creation of spine SBRT plans on the day of treatment, bypassing the need for simulation. 
Indeed, the SMART treatment planning process already comprises nearly all components of traditional treatment planning, including volumetric imaging, target volume and organ -
at-risk delineation by the physician, treatment plan generation, and quality assurance with 
an independent, Monte Carlo- based dose verification (15, 18).   
 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 9 of 48  1.4 Same -Day Radiotherapy Treatment Planning  
 
However, the current treatment planning workflow for SMART has two key characteristics 
that have precluded same- day original plan generation until this point. One is that SMART 
is still based on the use of a pre- treatment simulation session, allowing time (1 -2 weeks) 
for careful selection of optimal beam angles and robust planning to target a pa rticular 
disease site (18, 19) . Additionally , the simulation process also includes a CT image that is 
used to provide geometric information and tissue relative electron densities (and therefore 
dose) information (13) . Ideally, to expedite treatment for spine SBRT, treatment planning 
could rely on same -day MR imaging alone to create a same -session MR -only simulation 
and treatment SMART  plan-of- the-day.  
 The first of these obstacles can be sufficiently overcome for same -session MR -only 
simulation and treatment  spine SBRT through simple pre -planning. Spinal anatomy and 
target volumes are fairly predictable in comparison to other disease sites and follow a  pre-
determined set of consensus volumes  (20) . Use of physics pre -planning based upon typical 
spinal anatomy  to create a standard initial set of beam angles could mitigate some of the  
same- session simulation and  on-table  planning time requirements. Additionally, spine 
tumor patients almost uniformly have volumetric diagnostic spine imaging prior to radiation consult, typically with MRI. These image sets can be used in the time between treatment consult and the first treatment day to adjust th e standard set of beam angles to 
individually optimize the tentative pre -plan before the patient is on the treatment table for 
clinical treatment planning. This use of pre -planning will improve the feasibility of creating 
the clinical plan in a time frame that is acceptable and tolerable for the patient to be on the 
treatment table.  
 Regarding CT -free treatment planning  for MRgRT , some progress has been made towards 
this goal at other institutions, but in a limited setting of very simple radiation treatments that lack the complexity of SBRT. Investigators at the University of Wisconsin have used their MRgRT device for same- session simulation and treatment  planning and delivery of 
the first fraction of 2D and 3D -conformal palliative spine radiation treatments (21) . 
However, following the first treatment fraction, patients then underwent traditional CT simulation and treatment planning; ART was used only to expedite the first fraction. In their treatment planning, bulk density overrides were used to assign electron densities 
based on typical values for basic tissue types (bone, fat, lung, soft tissue)  (21). Bulk density 
overrides are the only current  FDA- approved mechanism for dose extrapolation in MR gRT 
radiation planning, and can overcome the absence of CT density inf ormation  (22). Such 
overrides carry an anticipated do se uncertainty of <3%, which is considered acceptable  
(23). For reference, the International Commission of Radiation Units and Measurements 
(ICRU) mandates t hat dosimetry systems be capable of delivering dose to an accuracy of 
5% (24). Other techniques using MR image processing to infer more precise (voxel by 
voxel) density information are emerging within the field and  may be useful in the future 
for improving the precision of dosimetry in MRI -only planning. However, t hese techniques 
are not yet FDA -approved (25) . Prospective evaluation of such techniques would be useful 
to inform further MRI-only treatment planning. 
 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 10 of 48  1.4.1 Preliminary Studies  
 
Given that bulk- density override planning is the only FDA -approved method 
available to use for this study, it is important to preliminarily establish the 
dosimetric safety of bulk density override MR -only planning for spine SBRT. To 
this end, we  recently completed an in silico evaluation of dosimetric accuracy of 
this method specifically for spine SBRT. Five patients previously treated with MRgRT were identified and their 0.35- T MRI and CT datasets were used to create 
spine SBRT plans on the MR -linac treatment planning system (TPS). Patients were 
selected on the basis of availability of spinal imaging and with intent to represent anatomy of both sexes and varying body habitus. Patient demographics and characteristics are listed in Table 1 below . Six clinical target volume (CTV) and 
planning target volume (PTV) contours were created on each patient’s MRI dataset , 
to represent the six possible contour target volumes endorsed by the International 
Spine Radiosurgery Consortium guidelines , described in the next section. Three 
sets of unique treatment plans were then created for each of the six target volumes on all five patients and  were subjected to the planning constra ints identified for use 
in this protocol.   Table 1. Planning analysis patient demographics 
Patient #  Gender  Age Habitus  
1 Male  62 Normal  
2 Male  67 Obese  
3 Female  66 Underweight  
4 Female  60 Obese  
5 Female  70 Overweight  
 The first set of treatment plans (6 plans per each of 5 patients, 30 total plans)  were 
made using bulk density override  MR-only planning. Specifically, the bony 
anatomy, as contoured by study physician s (vertebral body and adjacent ribs), as 
well as adjacent soft tissues and lung, w ere assigned standard bulk relative electron 
density values by tissue type: bone (1.12 g/cc), soft tissue (1.01 g/cc), lung (0.25 g/cc).    After creating the bulk- density override  plans, a second set of 30 corresponding 
plans were created by reassigning the relative electron density values based on the 
co-registered CT dataset, and a comparison of plan dosimetric characteristics was 
made , detailed in Supplementary Table 1. For comparison of PTV coverage, two 
metrics were used: coverage by 100% of the prescribed dose (35 Gy) and coverage by 95% of the prescribed dose (33.25 Gy). As the dose fall -off for PTV can be 
steep, these two metrics were used to adequately describe the differences when a  
small difference in coverage appears as a large difference in dose.  The maximum dose to the spinal cord, as well as doses to circumferential volumes expanded  1, 3, 
5, 7, and 10 mm outward from  the cord, were compared to ensure the geometric 
robustness of  plans calculated with bulk density overrides . Last, when appropriate, 
the dose received by a small portion of the esophagus (when it was adjacent to the 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 11 of 48  vertebral body) was compared, as well.  The dosimetric differences observed 
between the plans with bulk density overrides and those recalculated using CT -
based relative electron densities, as delineated in Table 1 in the Supplementary Data 
Section below , are clinically  acceptable and were on average within the 5% dose 
uncertainty recommended by the ICRU.  
 More specifically, bulk density override MR -only planning is also projected to be 
safe in terms of dose to the spinal cord, which is  the key safety consideration for 
spine SBRT . The average dose discrepancy for the maximum point  was well  within 
the 5% threshold recommended by the ICRU, ranging between 0.2 and 1.8%  
(Suppl. Table 1). Importantly, these dose discrepancies did not result  in spinal cord 
constraint dose violation in any of the 30 plan comparisons . The projected dose 
discrepancy identified  also met more stringent national guidelines set by the  
American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) . Per AAPM  Task Group 
(TG) 71, monitor unit (dose) calculations for external photon beam radiation should display 2- 3% agreement between  an initial calculation method and a second 
redundant check (26). Similarly, per AAPM TG -142’s  specific recommendations 
for stereotactic radiation delivery, the prescribed versus delivered monitor units (dose) discrepancy should be within a 2% threshold (27) . Therefore,  bulk density 
override MR -only planning results in a dose projection that not only meets ICRU 
requirements but also meets more stringent national consensus guidelines in terms 
of projected dose to the spinal cord. This  indicat es that bulk density override 
MR-only planning is safe for spine SBRT.  
 Use of MRI -simulation alone has also been limited by concern over geometric 
distortions of MR and the complexities of determining of electron density information without CT. These historical obstacles have been all but eliminated by modern advancements. Nyholm et al. found that after standard corrections, uncertainty from MR geometric distortions translated to a maximum error of only 1mm. In fact, by eliminating the need for CT and MRI registration, treatment planning directly on MR images actually reduced spatial uncertainty when compared to CT -based radiotherapy (28). Indeed, based upon our preliminary in 
silico  planning analysis above, the any geometric uncertainties present did not 
meaningfully impact dose projected to serial volumetric expansions of the spinal 
cord, which is the principle planning concern for s afety in SBRT.  
 
1.5 Rationale 
 
In light of our increasing experience with MRgRT and adaptive planning and advances in 
MR-only planning, we propose here to evaluate the feasibility and safety of same -session 
MR-only simulation and treatment with  SMART for spinal  metastases. Although spine 
SBRT is a standard -of-care treatment modality, this expedited same- session MR -only 
simulation and treatment with  SMART workflow is novel. Previously, delivery of spine 
SBRT has typically required several days fr om time of consultation to simulation and then 
1-2 weeks from simulation to the initiation of treatment. On this proposed study, patients 
will not undergo CT simulation and will instead have same- session MR -only simulation 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 12 of 48  and treatment planning, on- table,  using SMART. In this manner, patients would initiate 
treatment within just several days from the consult. Feasibility of the workflow will be 
defined as successful delivery of the first fraction of same -session MRI -only simulation 
and treatment with  SMART  on the first on -table attempt for at least 70% of patients.  
Patients will be treated in either a two or five fraction  course over 1 -2 weeks. Although our 
long- term goal will be to achieve a significantly shortened time from consult to treatment 
as compared to traditional SBRT using simulation, the present study will be driven by short-term goals of workflow feasibility  and safety .

4.5 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
 
Patients will be accrued on basis of presentation to the radiation oncology clinic with spinal 
metastasis amenable to SBRT. Potential participants will be identified in the inpatient and outpatient radiation oncology clinic setting, as well as from the multidisciplinary spine tumor board. Patients will be approached regarding participation at or around the time of 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 15 of 48  their radiation oncology consultation visit. Patients will be treated at a single facility, at the 
Siteman Cancer Center ’s Center for Advanced Medicine clinic, as the technology required 
for this study is confined to this center. We anticipate an accrual rate of approximately 15 patients per year, or an estimated study accrual period of 8 -12 months. There will be no 
compensation or incentives offered for study participation.  
  
5 TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Study Intervention Description and Administration  
 
Radiotherapy will consist of stereotactic body therapy  to the spine , to be given over two or 
five fractions, delivered once daily or once every other day for a period of one to two 
weeks, for a total of two or five treatments.  
 
5.1.1 Dose, Fractionation 
 
Radiotherapy will consist of stereotactic body therapy, to be given over either a two or five fraction  course , delivered once daily or once every other day for a period of 
one to two weeks, for a total of  two or  five treatments (depending on whether a 2 
or 5 fraction course is selected) . Patients will be planned for an initial prescription 
dose at the discretion of the treating physician, delivered in two or  five total 
fractions to the PTV, with dose adaptation based on safety constraints that are already approved of to prevent OAR injury. Suggested dose prescriptions are 24  
Gy in 2 fractions or 35 Gy in 5 fractions. 
  
5.1.2 Patient Positioning  
 
All patients will undergo volumetric MR imaging on treatment days in positioning appropriate for the specific treatment site.  
 
5.1.3 Clinical Target Volume (CTV) and Planning Target Volume (PTV) Definitions  
 
The treatment target will be defined based on the clinical target volume (CTV) only, based on International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium (ISRC) consensus guidelines. The PTV will be generated at the discretion of the treating physician but will generally range between 3 mm and 7 mm.  Vertebral bodies are divided into 6 sectors as illustrated below from the ISRC consensus guidelines:  
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 16 of 48   
 
CTV definitions are listed below and use the previously defined sectors to delineate 
volumes:

5.1.4 Same -session MR -only Simulation and Fraction 1 Adaptive 
Treatment Planning  
 
All patients will be planned for a two or  five fraction treatment course. Prescription 
dose will be at the discretion of the treating physician but  will be subject to hard 
constraints based on the treatment site. Dose volume histogram (DVH) information for the target volumes and surrounding critical structures is mandatory. This is to assist in interpreting outcome, including morbidity. Coverage goal  will be for 95% 
of the volume to be covered by 95% of the dose, although in situation where a critical structure is violated, reduction of dose will be allowed in areas of overlap. For specific hard constraints and optimization parameters, see Section 5.1.5 .  
 Prior to day of first fraction and creation of the clinical plan, each patient will be tentatively pre -planned based on their diagnostic MRI volumetric image set 
obtained prior to study enrollment.  A bulk density override method will be used to manu ally assign relative electron density values to the diagnostic dataset for the 
purpose of dose calculation and setting up initial plan parameters.  For example, voxels representing the patient’s bones will be assigned an average bone density, voxels representing fat will have a different density assignment, etc.   This “pre -
plan” will allow for efficient same- session simulation and  clinical planning on the 
day of treatment.  On treatment day one, another volumetric MRI image will be obtained on the treatment machine itself, and the plan will be adjusted based on anatomy and patient habitus of the day.  Previously assigned density values will be reviewed and adjusted if needed, after which the final clinical treatment plan will be created.    In tandem with the clinical planning process above, a novel exploratory non -clinical 
density override method will be used for comparative dosimetry. In this method, 
the density values are assigned on a voxel -by-voxel basis automatically , rather than 
as a manual bulk overr ide as clinically used, via a machine- learning 
algorithm.  This will not be used for clinical decision making or affect treatment 
planning.  The data gathered will be used to improve the MRI -only planning 
process in the future.  
 
5.1.5 SMART Dose C onstraints  
 
These shall function as hard constraints in treatment planning, and coverage will be 
sacrificed to meet these constraints. All listed constraints are for 2 fraction 
treatment (Table A) or 5 fraction treatment (Table B), which are both acceptable 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 18 of 48  course fracti onations for this study. Adaptive plans will be evaluated under the 
assumption that the delivered adaptive plan would meet all hard constraints for 2 
or 5 fractions with stable anatomy. For example, on a given day, in a 5- fraction 
course,  the maximum cord dose (to 0.5 cc) will be 5 Gy (extrapolate to maximum 
dose 25 Gy over 5 fractions).

5.1.6 Adaptive Treatment Planning at Subsequent Fractions  
 
After delivery of the first treatment fraction using a same -session MR -only 
simulation and treatment with SMART , the treating physician will evaluate the 
patient’s individual anatomy at subsequent treatment fractions to determine if 
further daily adaptive planning is indicated. Treatment plan re -optimization will be 
performed for dose adaptation if it is determined that the patient’s anatomy necessitates dose adaptation with the goal of sparing of normal structures (i.e., not 
violating the predetermined hard constraints based on safety constraints that are 
already approved of for routine, clinical use).    
 
5.1.7 Quality Assurance of the Adaptive Plan  
 
Patient specific QA will be performed at ea ch fraction prior to delivery of the 
adaptive treatment plan. Given that dose measurements will not be possible with the patient on the table, this will be achieved by performing our standard process of an independent Monte Carlo dose calculation on the image of the day, using the exported beam parameters, and mapped electron density. The independently calculated dose distribution will be compared to the dose distribution exported from the MRIgRT  system, looking at dose volume histograms and 3D gamma analys is 
of all voxels within the patient. In addition, in- house plan integrity verification 
software will be utilized to evaluate plan quality and integrity via plan parameters including contours, beam angles, segments, and monitor units. After completion of the automated checks, a final review by physics will be required prior to proceeding 
to treatment delivery.  
 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 20 of 48  5.2 Collection of AEs  
 
For all patients, neurologic toxicities of concern include (but are not limited to) treatment-
related spinal injury resulting in sensory alteration, muscle weakness, or neuropathic pain limiting self -care in activities of daily living. For patients receiving treatment to lower 
thoracic and lumbar spine sites, toxicities of concern also include (but are not limited to) gastrointestin al toxicities such as: severe pain, severe nausea or diarrhea, severe 
constipation, and/or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, stenosis, ulceration, fistula, perforation, etc. Patients undergoing treatment for thoracic metastases will additionally be assessed using the CTCAE v5.0 criteria for lung, esophageal (eg esophagitis), and cardiovascular 
toxicity. Regardless of treatment site, skin toxicity will be tabulated according to the CTCAE v5.0 criteria.

5.4 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding, and women who have had a tubal ligation) are required to have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first fraction of SBRT .   
 Female patients are required to use two forms of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during the course of study treatment.   If a patient is suspected to b e pregnant, SBRT should be immediately discontinued.  In 
addition a positive urine test must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test.  If it is confirmed that the patient is not pregnant, the patient may resume dosing. 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 21 of 48   
If a female patient becomes pregnant during therapy, the investigator must be notified in order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented in the case report forms.  
 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for  a total 
of 2 or 5 frac tions of SBRT or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
• Documented and confirmed disease progression 
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition render the patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the judgment of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non-compliance with the study protocol 
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will still be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar.  
 
5.6 Duration of Follow- up 
 
Patients will  have a single follow-up visit at 3 months post- end of treatment.   
 
5.7 Lost to Follow- Up 
 
A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she fails to return for the 
scheduled three-month follow up visit and is unable to be contacted by the study team. 
 The following actions must be taken if the participant fails to return to clinic for a required study visit: 
o The study team will attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit within 3 days  and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 22 of 48  o Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee wil l 
make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address).  These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record or study file.  
o Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow- up.

10 MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT  
 
10.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re- evaluated for response at the 3 -month 
follow-up visit. 
 Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new internationa l 
criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in th e case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 
 
10.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor 
measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 25 of 48  Malignant lymph nodes:  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed.  Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by definition, simple cysts.  
 ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
 Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short  
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 Non-target lesions:  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including an y measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up.  
 
10.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible  to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 26 of 48  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Ima ging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.  
 Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superfi cial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.   Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.   Conventional CT and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less.  If CT scans have 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement.  F urthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the  modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scan ners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably with conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 Ultrasound:   Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used 
as a method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their 
entirety for independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment  to the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 27 of 48  study, confirmation by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure 
at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected instances.  
 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:   The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor 
evaluation is not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following c omplete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.  
 Tumor markers:   Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published [JNCI 96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol 17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol 26:1148-1159, 2008].  
In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 progression criteria 
which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first -line trials in 
ovarian cancer [JNCI 92:1534-1535, 2000].  Cytology, Histology:   These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  The cytological conf irmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
 FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG- PET at basel ine and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or scarring.  Th e use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 28 of 48  approaches may lead to false positive CR due to lim itations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity. 
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image. 
 
10.4 Response Criteria  
 
10.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum  on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also consi dered progressions). 
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study. 
 
10.4.2 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalization of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opinion of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 29 of 48  progression status should be confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or 
Principal Investigator).  
 
10.4.3 Evaluation of Best Overall R esponse 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient 's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria.

** Only for non- randomized trials with response as primary endpoint. 
*** In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non- target lesions 
may be accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation 
of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.

*  ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease 
since SD is increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in 
some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is not 
advised  
  
10.4.4 Duration of Respon se 
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
 
11 DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING  
 
In compliance with the Washington University Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan, the 
Principal Investigator will provide a Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM) report to the Washington University Quality Assurance and Safety Monitoring Committee (QASMC) semi -annually 
beginning six months after accrual has opened (if at least five patients have been enrolled) or one year after accrual has opened (if fewer than five patients have been enrolled at the six -month mark). 
 The Principal Investigator will review all patient data at least every six months, and provide a 
semi -annual report to the QASMC. This report will include:  
• HRPO protocol number, protocol title, Principal Investigator name, data coordinator name, regulatory coordinator name, and statistician  
• Date of initial HRPO approval, date of most recent consent HRPO approval/revision, 
date of HRPO expiration, date of most recent QA audit, study status, and phase of study  
• History of study including summary of substantive amendments; summary of accrual 
suspensions including start/stop dates and reason; and summary of protocol exceptions, error, or breach of confidentiality including start/stop dates and reason 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 31 of 48  • Study- wide target accrual and study -wide actual accrual  
• Protocol activation date  
• Average rate of accrual observed in year 1, year 2, and subsequent years 
• Expected accrual end date 
• Objectives of protocol with supporting data and list the number of participants who 
have met each objective  
• Measures of efficacy  
• Early stopping rules with supporting data and list the number of participants who have 
met the early stopping rules 
• Summary of toxicities  
• Abstract submissions/publications  
• Summary of any recent literature that may affect the safety or ethics of the study  
 
The study principal inves tigator and Research Patient Coordinator will monitor for serious 
toxicities on an ongoing basis. Once the principal investigator or Research Patient Coordinator becomes aware of an adverse event, the AE will be reported to the HRPO and QASMC according to institutional guidelines.  
   12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
12.1 Stopping C riteria  
 
If at any point in trial enrollment, >2 out of the first 5 patients, or >4 out of the first 10 patients experience symptoms of G3 or greater toxicity that is probably or definitely  
attributable to and did not pre-date SBRT, the trial will be suspended. Symptoms that pre-dated SBRT will not be count towards stopping criteria (example: thoracic spine patients requiring oxygen prior to and after SBRT will not be scored as G3 toxicity, however a new O2 requirement after RT would count towards stopping criteria). If at any time a grade 5 toxicity (death) is observed that is probably or definitely attributable to treatment, accrual will be suspended and the event will be reviewed by the pr incipal investigator.  Since 
patients accruing to the trial have metastatic disease, it is anticipated that deaths unrelated to the trial may be observed. Death that is felt either due to disease progression or patient comorbidity will not be scored as grade 5 toxicity and will not result in trial suspension. 
 
12.2 Sample Size Calculation  
  
As a pilot study, the sample size is determined based on clinical considerations rather than statistical power. For our primary objective, our goal will be to report the descr iption of 
same- session MR -only simulation and treatment with  SMART treatment workflows, 
adaptation, and the time to delivery of first treatment fraction. Goal accrual will be 10 evaluable patients. For the secondary objectives, sample size is also based on  clinical 
considerations rather than statistical power.   
12.3 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 32 of 48  Regarding toxicity, we will report descriptive statistics for acute toxicity at a three -month 
time point. Toxicity rates are anticipated to be identical to those of other linear accelerator  
based SBRT treatments. Because spine SBRT is a standard -of-care treatment that is not in 
and of itself investigational, further prospective toxicity assessments are not indicated. 
Given that no prior data exists for same -session MR -only simulation and treatment with  
SMART for spinal metastases, we will report descriptive statistics . As a pilot study we will 
establish these baseline parameters.  
  The primary objective is to d emonstrate that same- session MRI -only simulation and 
treatment with stereotactic MRI -guided radiotherapy (SMART) for spinal oligometastases 
is feasible by confirming that the first fraction of same -session MRI -only simulation and 
treatment with  SMART can be delivered on the first on- table attempt for at least 70 % of 
patients.  
 Our principle objectives in this trial will be to determine the feasibility and safety of for same- session MR -only simulation and treatment with  stereotactic MR -guided online -
adaptive radiotherapy (SMART) for treatment of spinal oligometastatic disease. If we can successfully deliver the first treatment fraction  at time of  the first on -table treatment 
attempt in 70% of patients, while maintaining the safety and efficacy profile of standard 
spine SBRT, we will consider this study as having provided sufficient pilot data to support more widespread study of same -session  SMART  paradigm . The long- term goals will be to 
improve patient outcomes and care by reducing time to treatment, through an expedited radiotherapy delivery workflow for spinal SBRT.    All exploratory aims will be analyzed at the end of the study.

Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 43 of 48  APPENDIX C: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug- related.  
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by the Department of Health and Human Services’ 
Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html
 
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
A. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of the investigator, its occurren ce places the patient at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 B.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32: 
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event 
o Inpatient hospitaliza tion or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Protocol Version: 02/27/2023  Page 44 of 48  o A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
o Any other important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
 
C. Protocol Exceptions 
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant. 
 
D. Deviation 
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.  
 A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or o thers or the scientific validity of the study.

Protocol Objectives and Subject Evaluability  
Objective  # of patients 
evaluable for this 
endpoint to date  
Primary  
Demonstrate that same -session MRI -only simulation and treatment with 
stereotactic MRI -guided radiotherapy (SMART) for spinal 
oligometastases is feasible by confirming that the first fraction of same-session MRI -only simulation and treatment with SMART can be delivered 
on the first on -table attempt for at least 70% of patients.   
Exploratory  
Determine the average time (days) from patient consult appointment to 
successful delivery of the first treatment fraction .  
Determine the local, in -field tumor response and control rates at three 
months. Local in -field 
tumor response =  
Local in -field 
control rate =  
Demonstrate that same -session MR -only simulation and treatment with 
SMART for treatment of spinal metastases will lead to comparable 
toxicities compared with historically reported rates using standard, CT -
based SBRT assessed prospectively at three months post -treatment and 
retrospectively for later time -points .  
Determine the projected dosimetric differences between the study method 
of MRI -only planning using standard bulk density override dose 
calculations (which will be clinically used for all patients) and an 
exploratory alternative method of a novel voxel -by-voxel MRI -based dose 
calculation using an institutionally developed machine learning algorithm (which will be  simulated for comparison but not used in clinical treatment 
planning).   
Determine the on -table time required for same -session MR -only 
simulation and treatment with plan generation for the initial treatment 
fraction and for subsequent treatment fractions.

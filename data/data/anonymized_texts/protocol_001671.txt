PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
Background and Rationale:  
The results of both the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY- EXT trials show that apixaban is a safe 
and efficacious alternative to current standards of care without the need for parenteral 
administration  or monitoring. Currently  there are three main  classes  of anticoagulants used 
for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which are well established and approved in adults, but are not approved for use in children: Vitamin  K Antagonists (VKA) 
(eg, warfarin),  unfractionated heparin  (UFH), and  low molecular  weight heparin  (LMWH), 
with the exception of one LMWH, FRAGMIN
® (dalteparin sodium) injection.31 Through 
extrapolation of the adult data, physicians are using these anticoagulants in children. The 
recommended therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) ranges  for VKA in children 
are directly extrapolated from recommendations for adult patients because there are no clinical trials that have assessed the optimal INR range for children.  Thus, for most 
indications, the therapeutic target INR is 2.5 (range, 2.0-3.0). The unfractionated heparin (UFH) dose is selected based on activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) therapeutic ranges universally determined using plasma: aPTT by protamine titration of 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL  or an anti-Factor  Xa (FXa)  level  of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL.  Therapeutic ranges 
for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are extrapolated from adults and based on anti-factor Xa (anti -FXa) levels.  The guideline for therapeutic LMWHs being given 
subcutaneously twice  daily  is an anti-FXa level  of 0.50 to 1.0 units/mL  in a sample  taken  4 to 
6 hours following a subcutaneous injection. Using the same concept of extrapolation, this study will extrapolate efficacy  based  on achievement  of exposure in  children  ≥28 days of age 
similar to that with the AMPLIFY regimen of 10 mg twice daily  for the first 7 days and then 
5 mg twice daily thereafter in adults.  For the study’s pharmacokinetic (PK) neonate cohort, 
subjects ≤ 27 days of age, who will have been treated with standard of care therapies for 5 to 
14 days prior to randomization, the dose will be targeted to achieve an exposure similar to 5 mg twice daily in adults.  For the study’s post-PK neonate cohort (ie, those neonates 
recruited  after the PK sub- analysis  is completed),  which  may be treated  with standard  of care 
therapies for up to 14 days prior to randomization, the dose will be targeted to achieve an exposure similar to 10 mg twice daily in adults for the first week, and 5 mg twice daily thereafter.  
Study  Objectives:  
• Primary:  To assess the safety  and descriptive efficacy  of apixaban  in pediatric 
subjects requiring anticoagulation for the treatment of a VTE; 
• S econdary: To evaluate apixaban pharmacokinetic (PK) and anti-FXa activity  in 
pediatric subjects requiring anticoagulation for the treatment of a VTE.

 • Primary Efficacy:  A composite of: (i) all image -confirmed and adjudicated 
symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrent VTE defined as either contiguous 
progression or non-contiguous new thrombus and including, but not limited  to, DVT, 
PE and paradoxical embolism and (ii) VTE- related mortality.  
Study Design:  
Treatment  assignment will not be blinded. Up to 250 subjects  will be randomized  into the 
trial using a ratio of 2 to 1 to apixaban or standard of care (SOC), respectively. A goal of 30 or more  subjects  will be randomized into each of the following 3 age groups to be used for 
analysis: (1) 12 to <18 years; (2) 2 to <12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years; For age group 4, neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days), the sample size may be adjusted based on a PK sub- analysis  
that will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed dosing regimen for neonates as described in a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on 
apixaban will not exceed 20 subjects. 
Subjects 28 days of age or older may receive up to 14 days of standard anticoagulant 
treatment prior to randomization.  Subjects will be monitored for laboratory safety 
parameters.  Pre- and post-dose blood samples  for peak  and trough apixaban  concentrations 
(PK) and anti- FXa activity levels (Pharmacodynamic, PD) will be obtained.  
Radiologic imaging  will be performed,  and adjudicated,  to confirm  the index event  
(ie, primary  diagnosis of thromboembolic event  which  will be treated  with apixaban  or SOC 
in this study). For subjects 2 years of age or older, in addition to the radiologic images obtained to confirm the index event, new radiologic images of the clot will be obtained at approximately the mid -point and end of treatment (EOT) visits. For subjects 28 days to 
<2 years  of age and neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days of age) imaging  should be performed  at the 
EOT.  All of the aforementioned images will be adjudicated.  Additional imaging 
assessments can be performed at any time during the study, at the discretion of the investigator. In addition, when medically appropriate, new radiologic images will be obtained if recurrent VTE is suspected. 
The palatability  of the apixaban  0.5 mg tablet  and 0.1 mg sprinkle capsule will also be 
assessed.  
Study  Treatment:  
Subjects 2 years of age or older, randomized to the apixaban arm will receive open- label 
apixaban for 12 weeks. Subjects less than 2 years of age may receive open -label apixaban 
for 6 to 12 weeks as the Investigator deems is appropriate. For this population the duration 
of treatment is consistent with the recommendation of 2012 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) pediatric guidelines, 2018 American Society of Hematology (ASH) pediatric guidelines, and clinical experience and recommendation.
22,23 Enrollment will start 
with the oldest age group, and as pharmacokinetic (PK) data are obtained for the younger age 
groups in the single dose CV185118 PK study, the PK modeling and simulation results will be updated and used to support dosing recommendations for the younger age groups. An 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 approved amended  protocol  will be implemented  prior  to enrollment of each subsequent  age 
group and the dose rationale will be described in an appendix.  
The modeling and simulation results, described in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4, support the 
current dosing recommendation of fixed- dose body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric 
subjects aged 28 days to <18 years (Age Groups 1, 2, 3 in Table 1 ). As of May 2019, 
enrollment to Age Groups 1 and 2 was completed, and as of December 2020 enrollment to 
age group 3 was completed. This protocol amendment continues enrollment to the youngest 
age group, Group 4 (neonates, birth to ≤ 27 days).  The age groups used for analysis will 
remain  as Age Group 1: 12 to <18 years;  Age Group  2: 2 to <12 years;  Age Group 3: 28 days 
to <2 years; Age Group 4: neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days). Appendix 4 describes additional 
analyses performed to select doses in subjects 28 day to 3 months and complements Appendix 3. Appendix 3  supersedes Appendix 2 and Appendix 1. The fixed- dose, body 
weight -tiered regimen for all age groups is outlined in Table 1 . Appendix 5  describes 
additional analyses performed to select an initial dose for neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days).  
Appendix 5 complements  Appendix 3 and Appendix 4. 
The enrollment  of neonates  and the dosing of  neonates,  will proceed  as follows: 
After being treated with standard of care therapies for from 5 to 14 days, all neonates in the PK cohort  randomized  to apixaban  in Group 4 will receive  apixaban  0.1 mg twice  daily, prior 
to the completion of a PK sub- analysis described below. For these neonates, a series of  
blood samples will be collected after the first 0.1 mg dose of apixaban to predict each subject’s daily apixaban exposure (AUCs) at steady- state.  If the subject’s predicted AUCss 
is outside the interval of 1293 to 4807 ng*hr/mL (90% prediction interval from adults with 5 mg twice  daily), apixaban  dose will be adjusted  to remain  within  this interval.  Further 
details are included in Appendix 5. 
A PK sub -analysis will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed 
dosing regimen  for neonates  as described  in a separate analysis  plan. Neonates  who continue 
to be recruited,  while  this PK sub-analysis  is ongoing, will still require  PK measurements  and 
potential dose adjustments, until the results of the sub- analysis and final dose determination 
have been completed.  
If the PK sub-analysis  confirms  that the 0.1 mg twice  a day (BID)  apixaban  dose regimen  is 
suitable for the post -PK neonates the ongoing recruitment of neonates will continue, with a 
dose of 0.2 mg BID apixaban for Days 1 to 7, followed by 0.1 mg BID, thereafter. Should 
the PK sub-analysis  determine  that a different  dosing paradigm  is appropriate, a  subsequent 
protocol amendment will be required.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

a. Investigational  product  will be administered  in accordance with the instructions  provided.  
b. Subjects  enrolled  in Age Group  3, 28 days to <2 years  (a minimum  of 4 kg)  and <35 kg may be administered  
0.5 mg tablets  or 0.1 mg sprinkle  capsules  based  on the assigned  apixaban  dose.  
c. Neonates  are defined  as infants  from  birth  up to ≤27 days  of life. For pre-term  infants  born between  34 and 
<37 weeks  gestation,  investigators  have  the option to define  the 27 day neonatal  period starting  from  the actual  date of 
birth (post -natal age) or may choose to define the 27 day neonatal period starting when the postmenstrual age 
(gestational age plus the post -natal age) reaches 37 weeks and enroll the infant no more than 27 days thereafter into 
Cohort 4.  
d. Neonate dose may be modified during PK -sub-analysis period until a fixed dose is determined.  If a subject is 
randomized as part of the neonate cohort and subse quently reaches an age of 28 days or older and a weight of greater 
than or equal to 4 kg, the subject’s dose beyond Day 8 will be adjusted, to align with the <5 to 4 kg body weight 
group, as defined above, at a dose of 0.3 mg twice daily, unless the subject in the PK cohort had a dose decrease on 
the basis  of Day 1 PK measurements.  Subjects  who reach  an age of 28 days or older  and who have  a weight  less than 
4 kg,  should remain  on their initial neonate  dose,  or on the dose determined  by the day 1 PK measurement,  when  that 
information becomes available.  
e. Should  the PK sub-analysis  reveal  dosing  different  from  0.1 mg BID,  a subsequent  protocol  amendment  will be 
required.  
† An amended  protocol  will be implemented  prior  to enrollment  of each subsequent  age group and the dose rationale 
will be described in an appendix.  
Age Group to be used for analyses:  Age Group  1:12 to <18 years;  Age Group 2: 2 to <12 years;  Age Group 3:  28 days  to 
<2 years;  Age Group 4 = Neonates (birth  to ≤27 days).  
 
Subjects randomized to the SOC arm will receive a dose and dosing regimen of 
anticoagulation treatment  based  on usual  and customary  care per local  practices  and that will 
be aligned with the current, internationally recognized ACCP and ASH guidelines, or equivalent, for at least 12 weeks.

a. Perform physical examination including height/body length, weight, vital signs.  Weight should be rechecked at an 
unplanned visit when the subject reaches 28 days of age, for the purposes of determining whether the subject’s dose 
should be modified.  If there is a 20% change in weight  for subjects  less than 2 years  old, the investigator  may contact 
the study Sponsor to discuss a possible change in dosing regimen.  
b. For females  of childbearing  potential.  Pregnancy  tests may also be repeated  as per request  of IRB/IECs or if required 
by local regulations.  
c. Screening  activities may be combined with Day  1 activities.  
d. Visit can be conducted by telephone or on site.  
e. Includes  medication  administered  up to 30 days prior  to randomization.  Standard  of care to treat the index  event  may 
be given up to 14 days prior  to randomization into this study.  
f. Refer  to Section  7.4.1  Sampling  Time  Points  for detailed  instructions  and Section  7.2.2  for special  requirements  when  a 
dried blood spot blood collection method is used.  
g. If one or both samples  were not drawn  during the Day 14 visit,  then the Day 14 visit procedure  should be repeated  at 
the Day 42 visit to obtain the missing sample(s).  Otherwise, samples are not required at the Day 42 visit.  
h. Radiologic  reassessment  of the index  event  may occur  anytime between  Days  28 and 56. 
i. The following  laboratory  tests are required  to satisfy  the exclusion  criteria  for this study  and should be analyzed  by the 
local laboratory and reviewed prior to randomization: platelets, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), conjugated bilirubin, and pregnancy test when applicable.  Only the most 
recent laboratory results, obtained within 7 days prior to randomization, may be used to satisfy this requirement.  For 
subjects  <2 years  of age, labs may be evaluated  using  a local  laboratory  test and documented  on the Local  Lab CRF, in 
place of central laboratory tests for subsequent visits if all specified measures have been collected and reported.  
j. For neonates  and subjects  <2 years  of age receiving  6 weeks  of study  treatment,  Day 42 and Day 84 (EOT)  visits  will 
be combined.  
k. If contraception  use is required according to Section  4.3 Life Style  Guidelines.  
l. Radiologic images that require sedation and/or radiation at the Day 42 or Day 84 (EOT) visits (if applicable, also applied  to images  obtained  at Day 126 or Day 168 EOT  visit)  are not required  and may be omitted,  if not medically 
necessary.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 1. INTRODUCTION  
Venous  Thromboembolism  (VTE)  is rare in the pediatric  population in comparison to the 
adult population. In 1994, the Canadian Registry of VTE in children older than 1 month 
reported a VTE incidence of 0.07 per 10,000 children per year and 5.3 per  
10,000 hospitalizations per year, as compared with a range of 2.5 to 5 cases per 100 adults. 
However, in the past decade, increased survival of children with serious illnesses and improved diagnostic techniques have led to an increasing awareness of the occurrence and sequelae of VTE in the pediatric population. A recent multicenter study demonstrated a 
dramatic  increase in the diagnosis  of VTE  at children’s  hospitals  from  2001 to  2007. During 
that 7 -year period, 11,337 hospitalized patients were diagnosed with VTE where the annual 
rate of VTE  increased  by 70% from  34 to 58 cases  per 10,000 hospital  admissions  [Raffini  et 
al, 2009].
25 
Children and adults are thought to share a common basic pathophysiology of venous 
thrombosis  based  on Virchow’s  triad.  Venous  stasis,  vascular  injury, and hypercoagulability 
all predispose  to thrombosis. In adults, several  risk factors  are known to  invoke  one or more 
of the Virchow conditions. These include prolonged immobilization, the presence of a 
central venous line, surgery, trauma, malignancy, pregnancy and puerperium, treatment with 
oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, 
and inherited disorders of coagulation. The pathophysiology of VTE in children is similar, 
but the contribution of each factor differs among age groups [Albisetti et al, 2012].3 
Differences between adult and pediatric coagulation factor values are variable: some factors are present  at adult  levels  or higher  from  birth, while  others  are extremely  low, rising  to adult 
values only in adolescence.  The mean values for fibrinogen, factor (F) V, FVIII, von 
Willebrand  factor,  and FXIII  are >70%  of adult  values  at birth. However,  for both premature 
and healthy full -term infants, the mean values for the contact factors and vitamin  
K-dependent  factors  are <70%  of adult  values;  and while  increasing  throughout  childhood, 
they remain low, compared to adult levels, even into adolescence. The coagulation 
inhibitors, antithrombin  (AT),  heparin  cofactor  II (HCII),  protein C, and protein  S, are also 
decreased at birth.  AT and HCII reach adult levels around 6 months of age, whereas 
protein C and protein S plasma levels reach adult levels only in adolescence. Two other  
coagulation inhibitors, α2-macroglobulin and protein C1 inhibitor  are increased  at the time of 
birth, compared to adult levels, and remain elevated until adulthood.  
Several factors likely contribute to the lower incidence of VTE in children compared with that in adults. Certainly,  the unique  hemostatic  physiology of infancy  and childhood has an 
impact.  Also important is the integrity of the vessel wall and its influence on thrombosis. 
The vascular endothelium of children has not accumulated damage from hypertension, diabetes,  or hypercholesterolemia, and so maintains  anticoagulant  properties.  Similarly,  most 
children have not been exposed to acquired thrombotic risk factors such as oral contraceptives or smoking, and they are much less frequently exposed to antiphospholipid antibodies or malignancies. Nonetheless, thromboembolisms do occur in children. It must 
be understood that there are differences  in the causes  of VTE,  when  comparing older  children 
to younger children and neonates. As described in the 2018 American Society of 
Hematology 2018 Guidelines for management of VTE:

 commonest age groups for VTE are neonates and teenagers, and this reflects the pattern of 
associated  underlying  diseases  and interventions. The most  common precipitating  factor  is 
the presence of a central venous access device (CVAD), which is related to almost 90% of VTE in neonates and 60% in older children”.
4 
Thromboembolism is a well- recognized complication of cancer in children. There are 
several  factors  which  contribute, including the presence  of a central  venous  catheter  (CVC), 
the underlying malignancy, dehydration, and infection [Macartney et al, 2011].18 
Primary  and secondary  antiphospholipid syndrome  results  in an increased  risk of deep  vein 
thrombosis (DVT), acute coronary syndrome, and transient ischemic attack.  In children, 
there is a long -term risk of recurrence following thrombosis, without long- term 
anticoagulation [Macartney et al, 2011].18 
Though inherited thrombophilia can play a role in VTE events in children, it is not as well understood as in the adult  population, partly  due to lack of studies;  therefore,  the significance 
is not clear [Macartney et al, 2011].
18 
Once a VTE  occurs, the progression of the disease and the aim of antithrombotic  therapy  are 
the same for both adults and children. They are to: 1) reduce the risk of death due to 
thrombus extension or embolization; 2) reduce the incidence of recurrent thrombosis;  
3) reduce  the incidence  of post thrombotic  syndrome  by limiting  vascular  damage; and  
4) maintain  vessel patency  and vascular access [Chalmers et al, 2011].7 
Although much  is known about  the factors  underlying the risk for recurrence of VTE  in 
adults, little is known about these risks in children. In children that have an underlying 
acquired risk factor for VTE (a CVC or underlying medical condition), recurrence is uncommon if the underlying cause is removed. In a study involving 153 consecutive 
neonates and children with VTE, 91 percent had an underlying medical condition and 77 percent had a CVC [Revel -Vilk et al, 2003].
26 The risk of VTE recurrence in this study 
was 10.5 percent;  in all children, the same acquired  risk factor  was present  in the first and the 
recurrent episode of VTE.  In this population, the presence of a prothrombotic state or an 
elevated level of factor VIII was not associated with recurrence [Albisetti et al, 2012].3 
In children, particularly neonates, approximately two- thirds of VTEs are associated with the 
use of CVCs or access devices, which can impair vascular access and require intervention or lead to embolization [Andrew et al, 1994; van Ommen et al, 2001; Kuhle et al, 2004].
4,29,14 
CVCs  are extremely  important  for the long-  and short -term management  of pediatric  patients 
with a variety of severe diseases (eg, total parenteral nutrition; intensive fluid management; administration of blood products, antibiotics, and chemotherapy). Most CVC -associated 
VTEs occur in the upper venous system, in association with CVCs inserted percutaneously through a jugular  or subclavian  vein [Massicotte  et al, 1998].
19 Femoral  venous  catheters  are 
used less commonly but also can be associated with VTE [Worly et al, 2004].30 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Treatment  of VTE  
Anticoagulation in children may be administered prophylactically to prevent thrombosis in 
high- risk individuals or in therapeutic doses in those with confirmed thrombosis. The most 
comprehensive guidelines for the treatment of pediatric VTE published are those of the internationally recognized American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and American Society of Hematology(ASH).
22,23 The decision to anticoagulate will depend on each 
individual situation, weighing the benefits against the risk of bleeding. As in adults, 
anticoagulation therapy is administered to prevent clot extension or embolization, to reduce the risk of recurrence, to prevent long- term complications of vascular compromise such as 
post thrombotic  syndrome  (PTS),  and to maintain  blood vessel  patency  for long- term venous 
access [Macartney et al, 2011].
18 
Since there is no one standard of care (SOC) for all children for the treatment of VTE, the recommendation in the current ASH guidelines and ACCP guidelines (2012) includes use of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), and/or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA). For subjects 28 days to <2 years of age, this study will limit SOC to 
heparin  only (ie, UFH or LMWH).  For neonates  (birth  to 27 days), they  will be assigned  and 
treated with apixaban only. 
1.1. Indication  
Apixaban (PF -04652577, BMS -562247- 01, Eliquis) is an orally active factor Xa (FXa) 
inhibitor  that is being developed by Pfizer  and Bristol Myers  Squibb (BMS) for the treatment 
of venous thromboembolism in children. 1.2. Background  and Rationale  
Apixaban (BMS -562247) is an orally active, direct inhibitor of FXa that binds to the active 
site of FXa and inhibits its activity without requiring antithrombin.  A comprehensive 
summary  of the pharmacology, absorption, distribution, metabolism,  and excretion  (ADME), 
toxicology and clinical experience with apixaban are provided in the Investigator  
Brochure  (IB).  
Marketing authorization for apixaban has been granted for the prevention of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) in adults who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery  and for the treatment  of deep  vein thrombosis  (DVT)  and pulmonary embolism (PE) 
and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults in the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), Canada, and other countries, and for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non -valvular atrial fibrillation in the USA, EU, Canada, 
Japan, and other countries worldwide.  
Efficacy  and safety for the treatment of VTE have been demonstrated in 2 completed pivotal 
Phase 3 studies (CV185056, AMPLIFY and CV185057, AMPLIFY -EXT).  Apixaban was 
studied in a randomized, double -blind, triple dummy trial (AMPLIFY) that compared 
apixaban (10 mg twice daily for seven days followed by 5 mg twice daily) with conventional 
anticoagulation (warfarin  for six months  co-administered  with subcutaneous  (SC) enoxaparin 
for at least the first five days and until an INR of 2 was achieved) in 5395 adult subjects for  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 the treatment  of acute symptomatic  proximal  DVT  only or pulmonary embolism (PE) with or 
without a DVT.  The published results [Agnelli, G et al, 2013]2 are as follows:  
• The primary  efficacy  outcome  occurred  in 59 of 2609 patients  (2.3%)  in the apixaban 
group, as compared with 71 of 2635 (2.7%) in the conventional -therapy group 
(relative risk, 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.18; difference in risk 
[apixaban  minus  conventional  therapy], − 0.4 percentage  points;  95% CI, −1.3 to 0.4). 
Apixaban was noninferior to conventional therapy (P<0.001) for predefined upper 
limits of the 95% confidence intervals for both relative risk (<1.80) and difference in 
risk (<3.5 percentage points). Major bleeding occurred in 0.6% of patients who 
received apixaban and in 1.8% of those who received conventional therapy (relative 
risk, 0.31;  95% CI, 0.17 to 0.55;  P<0.001 for superiority). The composite  outcome  of 
major bleeding and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 4.3% of the patients in the apixaban group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the conventional - 
therapy group (relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.55; P<0.001). Rates of other 
adverse events (AE)s were similar in the two groups. 
In support of these results, apixaban was also studied in a randomized, double -blind trial 
(AMPLIFY -EXT) that compared the efficacy  and safety of two doses of apixaban (2.5 mg or 
5 mg twice  daily  for 12 months)  to placebo  in 2482 subjects  with a VTE  who  reached  clinical 
equipoise after completing 6 to 12 months of anticoagulation for their index event. The 
published results [Agnelli, G et al, 2013]
1 are as follows:  
• A total of 2486 patients underwent randomization, of whom 2482 were included in 
the intention -to-treat analyses.  Symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism or 
death from venous thromboembolism occurred in 73 of the 829 patients (8.8%) who were receiving placebo, as compared with 14 of the 840 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 2.5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.2 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 9.3) and 14 of the 813 patients (1.7%) who were receiving 5 mg of apixaban (a difference of 7.0 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.9 to 9.1) (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The rates of major bleeding were 0.5% in the placebo group, 
0.2%  in the 2.5-mg apixaban  group, and 0.1%  in the 5-mg apixaban  group.  The rates 
of clinically  relevant  nonmajor  bleeding were 2.3%  in the placebo  group, 3.0%  in the 
2.5-mg apixaban group, and 4.2% in the 5- mg apixaban group. The rate of death 
from  any cause was 1.7%  in the placebo  group, as compared  with 0.8%  in the 2.5-mg 
apixaban group and 0.5% in the 5- mg apixaban group. 
The results  of both the AMPLIFY  and AMPLIFY -EXT  trials  show  that apixaban  is a safe 
and efficacious alternative to current standards of care without the need for parenteral administration or monitoring.  
Currently  there are three  main  classes  of anticoagulants  used for the treatment of VTE,  which 
are well established and approved in adults, but are adapted yet not approved for use in children: VKA (eg, warfarin), UFH, and LMWH, with the exception of one LMWH, FRAGMIN
® (dalteparin sodium) injection.31 Through extrapolation of the adult data, 
physicians are using these anticoagulants in children. The recommended therapeutic INR  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 ranges for VKA in children are directly extrapolated from recommendations for adult 
patients because there are no clinical trials that have assessed the optimal INR range for children. Thus, for most indications, the therapeutic target INR is 2.5 (range, 2.0- 3.0) 
[Monagle  et al, 2012].
22 The UFH  dose  is selected  based  on activated  partial  thromboplastin 
time (aPTT) therapeutic ranges universally determined using plasma: aPTT by protamine 
titration of 0.2 to 0.4 units/mL or an anti -FXa level of 0.35 to 0.7 units/mL [Monagle et al, 
2012].22 Therapeutic ranges for LMWH are extrapolated from adults and based on anti -FXa 
levels.  The guideline  for therapeutic LMWHs  being  given subcutaneously twice daily  (BID) 
is an anti -FXa level of 0.50 to 1.0 units/mL in a sample taken 4 to 6 hours following a 
subcutaneous injection [Monagle et al, 2012].22 Using the same concept of extrapolation, 
this study will extrapolate efficacy based on achievement of exposure in children similar to 
that with the AMPLIFY regimen of 10 mg twice daily for the first 7 days and then 5 mg 
twice daily thereafter in adults.  
The safety and efficacy profile of apixaban (AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY -EXT trials) suggests 
a possible  benefit  of oral apixaban  in children  over standard  of care for the treatment  of VTE. 
This current pediatric VTE trial will enroll subjects who require anticoagulation for a newly 
diagnosed VTE. Subjects will be randomized to receive either apixaban or SOC.  The 
primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and descriptive efficacy of apixaban in pediatric subjects requiring anticoagulation for the treatment of a VTE with 12 weeks of therapy in subjects ≥  2 years of age or 6 to 12 weeks of therapy in subjects <2 years of age.  
1.2.1. Pharmacokinetics  of Apixaban  in Pediatric Subjects  
Study CV185079 evaluated the multiple -dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic 
(PD),  safety  and tolerability  of apixaban  in 8 pediatric  subjects  up to 18 years  of age with  an 
indwelling central venous catheter.  Though the study was terminated early due to poor 
enrollment.  Six subjects ranging from between the ages of 13 to 17 years of age were 
administered 0.66 mg/m
2 apixaban BID x 10 days and two subjects, ages  years of 
age were administered 0.60 mg/m2 apixaban BID x 10 days. 
Model -estimated steady state area under the curve over the dosing interval [AUC (TAU)] 
measured  234.6 ng/mL  in the six pediatric  subjects  from  the ages  of 13 years  to17 years  and 
223.5 ng/mL for the two subjects of ages  . Apixaban was generally safe and 
well-tolerated  by the 8 subjects  in this study. There were no deaths,  treatment -related 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE)s, or bleeding- related AEs reported.  
The most  frequently occurring  AE and laboratory marked  abnormality  was prolonged aPTT. 
Prolongation of aPTT is a known pharmacological effect of direct acting FXa inhibitors and 
as noted above, aPTT prolongation was not associated with any bleeding events. Apixaban 
administration had no apparent impact on vital signs or physical examination findings. 
Study CV185118 is a single -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics,  safety  and tolerability  of apixaban  in pediatric  subjects  from  birth  to 
<18 years  at risk for a venous  or arterial  thrombotic  disorder. As data were obtained from  the 
CV185118 study, the modeling and simulation results were updated and used to support 
dosing recommendations for each of the four pre -specified age groups of B0661037, in a  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

each subsequent age group and the dose selection rationales were described in appendices.  
To date, apixaban has  been well tolerated,  and there have been no significant  
apixaban -related  safety  findings  in CV185118. Four  interim analyses  of PK data have been 
completed for Study CV185118. 
• Interim analysis 1 used PK data from 16 subjects (5, 7, and 4 subjects within the  
12 to <18, 6 to <12, and 2 to <6 years of age groups, respectively). The results 
showed that mean single -dose AUC (INF)  in children across all age groups was 
generally  similar  to the median  steady -state AUC (TAU)  in adult  patients  treated  with 
apixaban 2.5 mg BID for the prevention of venous thromboembolism. A linear 
relationship between apixaban concentration and anti -FXa activity was observed,  
which  is consistent  with that observed in adult  subjects.  The results  of this analysis 
were used to support the dose selection rationale for Age Group 1, as described in 
Appendix 1, which is superseded by Appendix 3.  
• Interim Analysis  2 used  PK data from  28 subjects  (8, 8, 8, and  4 subjects  within  the 
12 to <18 years, 6 to <12 years, 2 to <6 years, and 9 months to <2 years of age 
groups, respectively). The results showed that the oral clearance increased with 
increasing  age and reached  values  similar  to those  of adults  in pediatric  subjects  older 
than 12 years. A linear relationship between apixaban concentration and anti -FXa 
activity was observed, which is consistent with that observed in adult subjects. The 
results of this analysis were used to support the updated dose selection rationale for Age Group 1 and the new dose selection rationale for Age Group 2, as described in Appendix 2, which is superseded by Appendix 3.  
• Interim Analysis  3 used  PK data from  34 subjects  (8, 8, 8, 6 and  4 subjects  within  the 
12 to <18 years,  6 to <12 years,  2 to <6 years,  9 months  to <2 years  and 28 days  to 
<9 months of age groups, respectively). The results showed that the oral clearance 
increased with increasing age and reached values similar to those of adults in pediatric subjects older than 12 years. In addition, that oral clearance, when 
normalized  to body weight,  was constant  across  the pediatric  age range of 3 months 
to 18 years. The results of this analysis were used to support the dose selection 
rationale for pediatric subjects with aged 3 months to <18 years, as described in Appendix 3. 
• Interim Analysis  3C used PK data from  54 subjects  (16, 11, 8, 9, and 1 subject  within  
the 12 to <18 years,  6 to <12 years,  2 to <6 years,  9 months  to <2 years,  28 days  to 
<9 months, and <28 days of age groups, respectively) in CV185079 and CV185118. The results showed that the oral clearance increased with increasing age and reached values  similar  to those  of adults  in pediatric  subjects  older  than 12 years.  In addition, 
that oral clearance, when normalized to body weight, was constant across the pediatric age range of 28 days to 18 years. The results of this analysis were used to 
support the dose selection rationale for pediatric subjects ages 28 days to <3 months  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 of age, as described  in Appendix 4, which  is the most  current  and complements 
Appendix 3 since doses in subjects ≥ 3 months of age remain the same.  
1.2.2. Pediatric Formulation  Development  
In April  2017, the Sponsor  suspended use of the apixaban oral solution in children  <5 years 
of age in pediatric studies, including B0661037, because the daily intake of  
one of the key solubilizing  agents  in the apixaban  oral solution formulation,  would exceed 
the threshold specified in a 2014 draft European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline for 
children <5 years of age.10 The official EMA guidance was published in October 2017.11 
In order to resume enrollment of pediatric subjects <5 years of age in ongoing studies, the Sponsor  developed a 0.5 mg strength tablet  of the currently  approved  adult  formulation  for 
use in subjects  ≥3 months  of age (and a  minimum of 6  kg weight). The tablet  is relatively  
with approximately   weight. The composition 
(drug excipient ratios) and manufacturing process (up to compression) for the 0.5- mg tablet 
is These 0.5- mg tablets also use  
the and final blend as the  . 
Therefore,  the 0.5-mg tablets  have  the same  pharmaceutical  characteristics  as the apixaban 
while being proportionally scaled to a lower strength for the  
pediatric  use. 
In addition to 0.5 mg strength tablets,  the 0.1 mg sprinkle  capsules  will be available  for use in 
pediatric subjects.  
1.2.3. Dose  Selection  Age Groups 1,  2, and 3 
With  the introduction of 0.5 mg tablets,  the dosing  paradigm  of apixaban  changed  from 
mg/kg dosing to fixed- dose, body weight -tiered regimen, as outlined in Table 2  and 
supported by Appendix 3  and Appendix 4.  
The modeling and simulation results, described in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4, support the 
current dosing recommendation of fixed- dose body weight -tiered regimen for pediatric 
subjects  aged  28 days  to <18 years  (Age  Groups  1, 2,3 in 
Table 2). The age groups  used for 
analysis will remain as Age Group 1: 12 to <18 years; Age Group 2: 2 to <12 years;  
Age Group 3: 28 days to <2 years;  Age  Group 4: neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days).  Appendix 4 
describes  additional  analyses  performed  to select  doses  in subjects  28 days to 3 months  and 
complements Appendix 3. Appendix 3 superseded Appendix 2 and Appendix 1. The 
fixed -dose, body weight -tiered regimen for all age groups is outlined in Table 2 . 
1.2.4. Dose  Selection  for Age Group  4 
After being treated with standard of care therapies for 5 to 14 days, all neonate subjects 
randomized to apixaban in the PK cohort of Group 4, will receive apixaban 0.1 mg twice 
daily, prior to the completion of a PK sub- analysis described below.  For these neonates, a 
series of blood samples will be collected after the first 0.1 mg dose of apixaban to predict each subject’s  daily  apixaban  exposure  (AUCss)  at steady -state with 0.1 mg  twice  daily. If 
the subject’s predicted AUCss is outside the interval of 1293 to 4807 ng*hr/mL  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 (90%  prediction interval  from  adults  with 5 mg twice  daily), apixaban  dose will be adjusted 
to remain within this interval.  If the predicted exposure of neonate subjects randomized to 
apixaban in the PK cohort is above the 95th percentile, apixaban dose will be reduced to  
0.1 mg daily. If the predicted exposure is below the 5th percentile, apixaban dose will be 
increased to 0.2 mg twice daily. If the 90% prediction interval cannot be achieved with 
either 0.1 mg daily or 0.2 mg twice daily, the subject will be discontinued from apixaban. 
Further  details  on dose selection  rationale  for initial 0.1 mg BID are included in Appendix 5. 
A PK sub -analysis will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed 
dosing regimen  for neonates  as described  in a separate analysis  plan. Neonates  who continue 
to be recruited,  while  this PK sub-analysis  is ongoing, will still require  PK measurements  and 
potential dose adjustments, until the results of the sub- analysis and final dose determination 
have been completed.  
If the PK sub-analysis  confirms  that the 0.1 mg BID apixaban  dose regimen  is suitable  for 
the post -PK neonates the ongoing recruitment of neonates will continue, with a dose of  
0.2 mg BID apixaban for Days 1 to 7, followed by 0.1 mg BID, thereafter. Should the PK 
sub-analysis  determine  that a different  dosing paradigm  is appropriate,  a subsequent  protocol 
amendment will be required.  
If after the first week of treatment a subject that is randomized as a neonate subsequently reaches an age of 28 days or older and a weight of greater  than or equal to 4 kg, the subject’s 
dose will be adjusted one time, as clinically appropriate, to align with the <5 to 4 kg body 
weight group’s Day  8 or thereafter dose, as defined in Table 2 , unless the subject had a prior 
dose decrease, based on Day 1 PK measurements.  Subjects who reach an age of 28 days or 
older  and who have  a weight  less than 4 kg, should remain  on their initial neonate  dose, or on 
the dose determined by the Day 1 PK measurement, when that information becomes 
available.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 1.3. Benefit  & Risks  of Apixaban  
The following section  reviews  the potential  benefits  and risks  of apixaban  for subjects 
enrolled in this study. 
1.3.1. Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
As demonstrated  in a number  of clinical  studies, apixaban has  potent, predictable and lasting 
anticoagulant activity and a predictable PK profile.  Distinct features of apixaban include 
direct binding to the active site of FXa without requiring antithrombin III, a pediatric oral 
dosing formulation with consistent absorption and no food effect, limited potential for clinically significant drug -drug interaction with other medications, no need for therapeutic 
monitoring, and a low risk of bleeding. These features may make it superior to currently 
available antithrombotic agents for thromboprophylaxis in children with a venous thromboembolism, thus addressing an unmet clinical need. All patients are expected to 
receive some benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when participating in study procedures, which  includes  multiple  clinic  visits,  physical  and laboratory examinations 
over the course of the study. 
1.3.2. Potential  Risks  to Subjects  
The primary safety risk for apixaban, as well as any anticoagulant, is undesired bleeding. 
Based on safety data obtained in the adult clinical program from over 70,000 subjects, approximately 40,000 of whom were treated with apixaban, and post -marketing experience 
from over 29 million adult patients worldwide, apixaban’s risk of bleeding is expected to be low, and comparable to that of subcutaneous LMWH. While apixaban’s risk of bleeding has 
been  demonstrated  to be lower  than warfarin  (ARISTOTLE),
20 it is interesting  to learn  that in 
patients undergoing invasive procedures while taking apixaban, the rates (treatment 
interrupted, treatment  not interrupted)  of post-procedural  major  bleeding (1.65%, 1.59%)  and 
death (1.0%, 1.4 %) were low  whether apixaban was interrupted or continued; whereas in 
patients taking warfarin, the rates of post -procedural major bleeding (1.26%, 3.04%) and 
death (0.5%, 2.0%) were at least 2- fold higher among those who continued warfarin versus 
those who interrupted treatment.2 
1.3.2.1. Protection  Against  Risks  
To minimize  the risk of bleeding, subjects  with active bleeding or high risk of bleeding 
(eg, central nervous system tumors) as well as intracranial bleed including recent  
intraventricular hemorrhage will be excluded from the study. Study subjects will be closely 
monitored for any bleeding and thromboembolic events and for overall safety. Study 
treatment will be held for clinically significant bleeding.  All bleeding events will be 
adjudicated  by an independent  Event  Adjudication Committee  (EAC),  and the conduct  of the 
trial will be supervised by an independent External Data Monitoring Committee (EDMC) 
which also review the data from the other pediatric apixaban studies for a complete safety signal. The EDMC will have the responsibility to review the incidence of bleeding and 
thromboembolic events and will be provided with reports of SAEs on a regular basis. The 
EDMC may recommend modification or suspension of the trial for safety reasons.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 In addition to EDMC supervision, the sponsor will conduct real- time monitoring and will 
review all safety information from all ongoing apixaban pediatric studies as they become 
available.  Frequent safety signal detection will be performed, which will include integration 
of clinical study data, post marketing surveillance AE reports, pre- clinical data, 
epidemiological studies and literature reports, to identify and characterize unrecognized safety risks or changes in those which are currently classified as expected Adverse Drug Reactions.  Any information that may affect the benefit-risk profile of apixaban will be 
immediately  communicated  to relevant  Health  Authorities, the EDMC,  and investigators, and 
appropriate actions will be taken regarding the study as needed. Investigators will also be 
provided guidance on appropriate management of serious bleeding related events.

This protocol will use an independent Endpoint Adjudication Committee (EAC) wherein 
adjudication of disease -related efficacy and safety endpoints will be performed. For those 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that are handled as disease- related efficacy endpoints, the 
Endpoint Adjudication Committee, in coordination with the External Data Monitoring Committee  (EDMC),  is responsible  for ongoing  analysis  of these  outcomes  and for informing 
the sponsor of recommendations made (eg, to continue the study or to stop the study). 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
Treatment assignment will not be blinded. Up to 250 subjects will be randomized into the 
trial using a ratio of 2 to 1 to apixaban  or SOC,  respectively.  A goal of 30 or more  subjects 
will be randomized into each of the following three age groups to be used for analysis:  
(1) 12 to <18 years; (2) 2 to <12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years; For age group 4, neonates 
(birth to ≤ 27 days), the sample size may be adjusted based on a PK sub -analysis that will be 
performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed dosing regimen for neonates as described in a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on apixaban will 
not exceed 20 subjects. Enrollment caps may be used to manage enrollment per age group. 
Randomization will be stratified by age group. Enrollment will begin with the oldest age 
group. As of May 2019, enrollment to Age Groups 1 and 2 was completed and as of 
December 2020, enrollment to Age Group 3 (28 days to <2 years of age) was completed. Enrollment is now focused on the youngest age group, Group 4 (neonates, birth to ≤ 27 days 
with a minimum weight of ≥ 2.6 kg). Enrollment may be capped in any age cohort once 
adequate numbers are reached to fulfill the objectives of this study. Subjects 28 days of age 
or older may receive up to 14 days of standard anticoagulant treatment prior to randomization. For the study’s neonate PK cohort, subjects ≤ 27 days of age, who will have 
been treated with standard of care therapies for 5 to 14 days prior to randomization, the dose will be targeted to achieve an exposure similar to 5 mg twice daily  in adults. For the study’s 
neonate  post-PK cohort, (ie, those  neonates  recruited  after the PK sub-analysis  is completed), 
which may be treated with standard of care therapies for up to 14 days prior to randomization, the dose will be targeted to achieve an exposure similar to 10 mg twice daily for the first week, and 5 mg twice daily thereafter in adults. 
Subjects  2 years  of age or older, randomized to the apixaban  arm will receive open- label 
apixaban for 12 weeks.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days)  and children  28 days to <2 years  of age may receive open- label 
apixaban for 6 to 12 weeks, a duration consistent with the ACCP and ASH guidelines and 
clinical recommendation.  Subjects randomized to the SOC arm will receive a dosing 
regimen of anticoagulation treatment based on usual and customary care per local practices and that will be aligned with the current, internationally recognized ACCP and ASH guidelines, or equivalent, for at least 12 weeks. Neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days) and children 
28 days to <2 years of age may receive SOC for 6 to 12 weeks. SOC will be limited to 
heparin in subjects <2 years old (UFH or LMWH). Monitoring of SOC will be based on 
usual and customary care per local practices and should be aligned with the current guidelines. The remaining neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days) will be assigned and treated with 
apixaban only.  
Subjects  will be monitored for laboratory safety  parameters.  Monitoring will take place at 
the Day 1 and Day 42 visits and whenever clinically indicated. 
The initial neonates treated with apixaban, and other neonates subsequently recruited prior to 
the completion of the neonate PK sub- analysis, will have three (3) PK measurements 
obtained during their first day of treatment. All apixaban treated subjects will have pre-  and 
post-dose blood samples for peak and trough apixaban concentrations (PK) and anti -FXa 
activity levels (PD) at the Day 14 visit.  If possible, PK samples for apixaban may be 
obtained within  24 hours  of a major  bleeding or a thrombotic  event  along with the time of the 
last dose prior to the event. Radiologic imaging will be performed, and adjudicated, to confirm the index event  
(ie, primary  diagnosis  of thromboembolic  event  which  will be treated  with apixaban  or SOC 
in this study). For subjects 2 years of age or older, in addition to the radiologic images 
obtained to confirm the index event, new radiologic images of the clot will be obtained at 
approximately the mid -point and end of treatment (EOT) visits. For subjects 28 days to 
<2 years  of age and  neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days of age)  imaging  should be performed  at the 
EOT.  All of the aforementioned imaging will be adjudicated.  
Additional  imaging  assessments  can be performed  at the discretion  of the Investigator, at any 
time during the study. Radiologic  images  that require  sedation  and/or  radiation at the Day 42 
or Day  84 (EOT) visits are not required and may be omitted, if not medically  necessary.  The 
reason for omitting images should be clearly documented in the appropriate Case Report Form (CRF).  In addition, when medically appropriate, new radiologic images will be 
obtained if recurrent VTE is suspected. All assessments obtained in the evaluation of 
symptomatic or asymptomatic recurrent VTEs, performed after randomization, will be 
adjudicated.  Further monitoring of thrombus status via radiologic images may be conducted 
per usual and customary practice.  
Palatability  of the apixaban  oral solution, the apixaban  0.5-mg tablets  and apixaban 0.1 mg 
sprinkle capsules will be assessed at the Day 14 study visit.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

4. SUBJECT SELECTION  
This study can fulfill its  objectives  only if appropriate  subjects  are enrolled.  The following 
eligibility  criteria  are designed  to select  subjects  for whom  protocol  treatment  is considered 
appropriate. All relevant medical and non -medical conditions should be taken into 
consideration when deciding whether this protocol is suitable for a particular subject.  
4.1. Inclusion  Criteria  
Subject  eligibility  should  be reviewed  and documented by an appropriately qualified  member 
of the investigator’s study team before subjects are included in the study. 
Subjects  must  meet  all of the following inclusion criteria  to be eligible  for enrollment  into the 
study:  
1. Children from  birth  to <18 years  of age with a minimum weight  of 2.6 kg at the time of 
randomization.  
• An approved amended  protocol  will be implemented  prior  to enrollment  of each 
subsequent age group.  
• Neonates  are defined  as infants  from  birth  up to ≤27 days of life. For pre-term infants 
born between 34 and <37 weeks gestation, investigators have the option to define the 
27 day neonatal period starting from the actual date of birth (post -natal age) or may 
choose to define the 27 day neonatal period starting when the postmenstrual age (gestational age plus the post -natal age) reaches 37 weeks and enroll the infant no 
more than 27 days thereafter into Cohort 4. “Gestational age” is the time elapsed 
between the first day of the last normal menstrual period and the day of delivery. Neonates or infants born prematurely at <34 weeks’ gestation are excluded from this study until the age of ≥ 6 months of life. Gestational age will only be taken into 
consideration for eligibility up to 6 months of age. 
2. Presence  of an index VTE  which  is confirmed  by imaging. Index VTE  include, but are 
not limited to, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, renal vein  thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, catheter -related thrombosis, 
and splanchnic  thrombosis. In Germany  only, cerebral  sinovenous  thrombosis  will be 
excluded.  
3. Intention to manage the index VTE with anticoagulation treatment for at least 12 weeks or intention  to manage the index VTE  with anticoagulation  treatment  in neonates  (birth  to 
≤27 days)  and children  28 days to <2 years  of age for 6  to 12 weeks.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

used in usual and customary practice, though not labeled for use in children, is acceptable.  
17. Other  severe  acute or chronic  medical  or psychiatric  condition or laboratory abnormality 
that may increase the risk associated with study participation or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.  
18. Use of aggressive  life-saving therapies  such as ventricular  assist  devices  (VAD)  or 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the time of enrollment.

21. Known  inherited  bleeding  disorder  or coagulopathy with increased  bleeding  risk 
(eg, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, etc.)  
4.3. Life Style Guidelines  
All female subjects  who, in  the opinion of the investigator, are biologically  capable of having 
children and are sexually active and at risk for pregnancy, must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly for the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 33 days (5 half -lives plus 30 days) after the last dose of 
investigational product, which includes SOC. The investigator, or his/her designee, in 
consultation with the subject, will select or confirm that the subject has selected the most appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and instruct the subject in its consistent and correct use.  
Subjects  need  to affirm  that they meet  at least one of the selected  methods  of contraception. 
The investigator or his/her designee will discuss with the subject the need to use highly 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 effective contraception consistently and correctly according to the Schedule of Activities  
(SOA)  and document  such conversation in the subject’s  chart.  In addition, the investigator  or 
his/her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception 
method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected.  
Highly effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure  rate of less than 1% per year  when  used consistently  and correctly  (ie, perfect  use) and 
include the following:  
1. Established use of oral, inserted, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception are allowed provided the subject remains on the same treatment throughout  the entire  study and has been  using that hormonal  contraceptive for an 
adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness.  
2. Correctly  placed copper  containing intrauterine  device (IUD).  
3. Male condom  or female condom  used WITH  a spermicide  (ie, foam,  gel, film,  cream, 
suppository). For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus 
spermicide is not accepted as highly effective contraception, this option is not appropriate.  
4. Bilateral  tubal  ligation/bilateral salpingectomy or bilateral  tubal  occlusive  procedure 
(provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).  
NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completely and persistently refraining from all heterosexual  intercourse  (including during the entire  period of risk associated  with the study 
treatments) may obviate the need for contraception.  
4.4. Sponsor  Qualified  Medical  Personnel  
The contact  information  for the sponsor's  appropriately qualified  medical  personnel  for the 
trial is documented in the study contact list.  
To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, 
at a minimum, protocol and investigational compound identifiers, subject study numbers, contact  information  for the investigational  site and contact  details  for a help desk in the event 
that the investigational site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study. The help desk number can also be used by investigational staff if 
they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems, however it should only be used in 
the event that the established communication pathways between the investigational site and the study team are not available.  It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace the 
established communication pathways between the investigational site and study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The help desk 
number  is not intended for use  by the subject/legally  acceptable representative directly  and if 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Treatment assignment will not be blinded. Up to 250 subjects will be randomized into the 
trial using a ratio of 2 to 1 to apixaban or SOC, respectively. A goal of 30 or more subjects will be randomized  into each  of the following three age groups: (1) 12  to <18 years;  (2) 2 to  
<12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years. For the age group 4, neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days), the 
sample  size may be adjusted  based  on a PK sub- analysis  that will be performed  using initial 
neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed dosing regimen for neonates as described in a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on apixaban will not exceed 20 subjects. 
The remaining  neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days) will be assigned  and treated  with apixaban  only.  
Neonates are defined as infants from birth up to ≤ 27 days of life. For pre -term infants born 
between 34 and <37 weeks gestation, investigators have the option to define the 27 day neonatal  period starting  from  the actual  date of birth  (post- natal  age) or may choose to define 
the 27 day neonatal period starting when the postmenstrual age (gestational age plus the post- natal  age) reaches  37 weeks  and enroll the infant  no more  than 27 days thereafter  into 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Apixaban will be provided as 5 mg tablets,  or 0.5 mg tablets,  0.1 mg sprinkle capsules,  or as 
0.4 mg/mL  solution  for oral administration.  Apixaban oral solution must be used only in 
children ≥ 5 years of age because the daily intake of  would exceed the 
threshold specified in a 2014 draft EMA guideline for children <5 years of age.
10,11 The 
apixaban 5 mg tablets, 0.5-mg tablets, and 0.1 mg sprinkle capsules will be packaged in 
and labeled  according to local  regulatory requirements.  Children <5 years  of age, at 
least 4 kg to <35 kg weight, and randomized to the apixaban arm should only receive the 
0.5-mg tablet or 0.1 mg sprinkle capsule formulation in accordance with the dosing instructions and regulatory requirements referenced within the protocol. 
Apixaban 0.4 mg/mL  oral solution is intended to be used only in children  ≥5 years  of age and 
will be provided in 
 labeled according to local regulatory requirements. 
In addition to  0.5 mg  strength, the 0.1 mg sprinkle capsule was  developed  for pediatric  
 
5.2.2. Preparation  and Dispensing  
Every effort should be made to keep a subject on the same formulation and dosing regimen 
(tablet,  oral solution or sprinkle capsule  formulation) for the duration of the study. However, 
a change in formulation (if permissible per age and body weight restrictions for the available 
apixaban formulations) will be permitted during the study in order to retain the subject in the study.  
Subjects who were originally randomized and dosed according to a weight-based (mg/kg) regimen  presented  in Table 2 (Amendment 3) and who are still on investigational product at 
the time of Amendment 4 approval, will continue on this weight- based regimen.  Subjects 
randomized to receive apixaban after implementation of Amendment 4 of the protocol will follow the fixed-dose, body weight-tiered regimen provided Table 2  using the appropriate 
formulation. If a change in formulation (ie, change from oral solution to 0.5- mg tablets) is 
necessary for a subject randomized and dosed under Amendment 3, then the subject will need to switch from mg/kg dosing to the tiered fixed-dose regimen based on the subject’s subjects.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Apixaban treatment beyond the Day 84 visit (Extension Phase): For subjects who require 
additional anticoagulation for the treatment of their index event, were compliant with the 
administration of apixaban, and completed all study visits and activities, apixaban will be made available for 6 or 12 additional weeks. For subjects who require long term anticoagulation beyond the 12 additional weeks  (ie, Day 84 visit plus 12 additional weeks),  a 
switch to SOC should be made after the end of treatment (Day 84) visit but no later than the Day 168 visit. Subjects who were randomized to SOC on Day 1 may not continue in this study beyond Day 84. 
For subjects who require 6 additional weeks of anticoagulation, the Day 28 and 42 visits will be repeated at Days 105 and 126, respectively, followed by the 35-day follow up visit. An 
EOT page will be completed when the subject has finished the 6-week or 12- week additional 
weeks.  Investigational product will be dispensed on Day 84 for 6 additional weeks of 
treatment.  For subjects who require 12 additional weeks of anticoagulation, the Day 28 and 
42 visits  will be repeated  at Days  105 and  126, respectively,  and the Day 63 and 84 visits  will 
be repeated at Days 147 and 168, respectively, followed by the 35-day follow up visit. Subjects  receiving  12 additional weeks  of investigational product will return  on Day 126 and 
the remaining study medication should be dispensed at this visit in accordance with the procedures outlined for Day 42 ( Section 6.4).  
5.2.4. Compliance  
Subjects  should not be discontinued from the trial based  solely  on compliance.  
To facilitate investigational product (IP) compliance, sites where permissible may offer caregivers the option to work with a designated trained home healthcare worker or trained site staff for investigational product administration at home.  This is not required for the 
study. Trained  designated home healthcare workers  provide additional guidance for dosing 
apixaban in children for the first dose at home or throughout the duration of the study if the 
caregiver and Investigator feels this would be beneficial.  Sites should appropriately 
document when a home healthcare service is used for subject investigational product administration as directed by the Sponsor. For the neonate PK cohort, if the first dose is administered at home, the trained home healthcare worker or trained site staff will draw, collect and appropriately transport back to site the Day 1 PK collection procedures (as described  in Section  7.4.1 Sampling  Time  Points and Section  7.2.2 for special  requirements 
when a dried blood spot blood collection method is used). 
Apixaban  
Compliance based  on pill count and volume of solution remaining  will be performed  by a 
qualified site staff member at each scheduled visit for subjects receiving apixaban.  
Compliance will be reinforced at each study visit and the importance should be reiterated at 
each telephone visit.  Subjects must maintain adequate compliance with the investigational 
product regimen.  If a discrepancy  of more  than 20% of doses exists  since the last scheduled 
visit, the site staff should re -instruct the subject/caregiver on the importance of compliance 
with medical treatment for their disease and on the dosing regimen. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

5.3. Drug  Storage  
The investigator, or an approved representative, eg, pharmacist, will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under recommended  storage  conditions  and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  
Investigational  product  should be stored  in its original  container  and in accordance with the 
drug label.  
Storage  conditions  stated  in the Single  Reference Safety  Document  (SRSD)  will be 
superseded by the label storage.  
Site systems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable,  including frozen, refrigerated  and/or  room  temperature  products). This should be 
captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout study. Even for 
continuous  monitoring systems,  a log or  site procedure  which  ensures  active  daily  evaluation 
for excursions should be available. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and 
storage  unit (for example,  refrigerator),  as applicable, should be regularly  inspected  to ensure 
it is maintained in working order.  
Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor 
or Sponsor’s  delegate upon discovery. The site should actively  pursue  options  for returning 
the product to labeled storage conditions, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage 
requirements,  including any actions  taken,  must  be documented and reported  to the sponsor.  
Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined in required temperature conditions  and not used until the sponsor  provides  documentation of permission 
to use the investigational product. Specific details regarding information the site should 
report for each excursion will be provided to the site. 
Site staff will instruct  subjects/legally  acceptable representatives  on the storage  requirements 
for take home medications including how to report temperature excursions. 
Drug  storage  for standard  of care treatments  will be based  on local  practice and  as indicated 
in the drug label.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

6.6. Temporary Treatment Interruptions  
During the course of the study, situations might occur in which the investigator considers a temporary  interruption of study drug treatment  to be indicated  (eg, lumbar  puncture, catheter 
replacement, scheduled surgical procedure, thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver function tests).  The treating physician should be made aware that when apixaban is administered at 
the protocol -specified doses, routine coagulation tests such as INR/prothrombin time (PT) 
and aPTT are relatively  insensitive measures of activity  and therefore may  be unsuitable for 
monitoring. Dose interruptions for selected events are described in Table 4 . For treatment 
interruptions ≥ 24 consecutive hours, the period of interruption should be noted, and the  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 investigator should document the following on the case report form (CRF): time of 
discontinuation and resumption of therapy, and the reason for discontinuation. If the 
treatment interruption is due to reasons other than the ones described in Table 4, a protocol deviation should be recorded.  An adverse event  (AE)/SAE  should be reported,  if applicable, 
and relatedness of the AE(s) will be determined by the investigator. For an individual subject, dose interruptions and treatment discontinuation may be more conservative than indicated below in Table 4, based on the clinical judgment of the investigator. Note that 
discontinuation of subjects from treatment is addressed in Section 6.7. 
Table 4.  Temporary  Dose  Interruptions  for Apixaban  
 
Event  Apixaban 
Lumbar  punctures 
(LPs)  Apixaban should  be held for at least 24 hours  prior  to any planned LP and will resume 
no earlier than 12 hours after the procedure.  
Scheduled  surgical 
procedures  Apixaban should  be discontinued at least 48 hours  prior  to elective  surgery  or invasive 
procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant 
bleeding.  Apixaban should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery 
or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled.  
If a subject participating in the study requires an elective procedure or surgery, the following considerations should be taken into account: The effective half -life of 
apixaban when administered twice daily is approximately 12 hours and it is expected 
that most  of the anticoagulation  effect  will be gone  within  24 hours  after the last dose 
of the drug.  Apixaban must be stopped for a sufficient period of time (eg, at least  
24 hours)  prior  to the procedure  to minimize  the risk of anticoagulant -related  bleeding. 
The treating  physician  should  be made  aware that when  apixaban  is administered  at the 
protocol -specified doses, routine coagulation tests such as INR/PT and aPTT are 
relatively insensitive measures of anticoagulation activity and are unsuitable for monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.  The subject will be re -started on 
discontinued study medication once hemostasis is secure and when, in the opinion of 
the investigator, it is safe to do so.  
Thrombocytopenia.  
An AE/SAE  should 
be reported if 
applicable  There  is no evidence -based  guidelines  for anticoagulation  therapy  in relation  to platelet 
counts.  In the absence of any other coagulopathy, the following guidelines are 
recommended during the course of the study period:  
• Full-dose apixaban  therapy  for subjects  with platelet count  ≥50×109 per L. 
 • Withhold  apixaban  for platelet count  <50×109 per L. 
 Close  monitoring of platelet count  and careful  watching  for signs  of bleeding are 
necessary. 
Elevated  liver 
function  tests.  If at any time during  the treatment  period  a subject’s  liver function  test (LFT)  results 
show:  
An isolated  elevation  of either  ALT/AST  ≥5 x ULN AND/OR a direct  (conjugated) 
bilirubin >2 x ULN, obtain the following laboratories: ALT, AST, total bilirubin, 
direct (conjugated) bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, CK as soon as possible (ie, within 3 days).  
If the repeat  tests indicate:  
1. ALT  <5 x ULN and direct  (conjugated)  bilirubin  ≤2 x ULN,  study medication 
may continue.  An AE/SAE  should 
be reported if

• Abdominal  ultrasound,  including liver and hepatobiliary  system.  
 
• Hepatitis  screen  (anti- HAV,  HBsAg,  anti-HBc,  anti-HBs and anti-HCV).  
 
• Obtain  relevant  specialist consultation.  
6.7. Discontinuation  of Subjects  from  Investigational  Product  
Subjects  MUST  discontinue  investigational  product  for any of the following  reasons:  
• Withdrawal  of informed  consent  (subject’s  or guardian’s  decision to withdraw  for any 
reason).  
• Any clinical  adverse event  (AE),  laboratory abnormality  or intercurrent  illness  which, 
in the opinion of the investigator, indicates  that continued participation  in the study is 
not in the best interest of the subject. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Termination  of the study by Bristol- Myers  Squibb (BMS)/Pfizer.  
• Loss  of ability  to freely  provide  consent  (subject  or guardian)  through imprisonment 
or involuntary incarceration for treatment of either a psychiatric or physical  
(eg, infectious  disease)  illness.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 • Thromboembolic  event  such as DVT,  PE, cerebral  sinovenous  thrombosis  or arterial 
thromboembolic event.  
• For the neonate PK cohort, if a 90% prediction interval  cannot  be achieved  with 
either 0.1 mg daily or 0.2 mg twice daily, the subject will be discontinued from 
apixaban.  
In the case of pregnancy, the  investigator  must  immediately  notify the medical  monitor  of 
this event. Please refer to Section 8.4 for follow -up. The investigational product will be 
permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner.  
Once any study- specified  thromboembolic  or any major  bleeding event  endpoint  is met, 
every effort must be made to confirm a suspected thromboembolic or bleeding event. 
Management of any asymptomatic or symptomatic events will be according to the local standards of practice.  If study medication is discontinued for a suspected thromboembolic 
event,  alternative  anticoagulant  therapy  may be initiated  per the Investigator’s  discretion  and 
standard of care.  
All subjects who discontinue investigational product (ie, are off protocol therapy) irrespective of reason,  should remain  in the study and complete  the EOT  visit and Safety 
Follow Up Visit, as described in the Schedule of Activities . The reason for the 
discontinuation must be documented in the subject’s medical records and a status page should be completed on the appropriate CRF page. 
The only exception to this requirement is when a subject/guardian withdraws consent for all 
study procedures including post -treatment study follow -up or loses the ability to consent 
freely  (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated  for the treatment of either  a psychiatric 
or physical illness). The Medical Monitor and Study Director should be informed of these 
situations.  
Subjects/legally  acceptable representatives  may withdraw  from  the study at any time at their 
own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or 
sponsor for safety or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. 
If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the 
subject/legally  acceptable representative.  All attempts  to contact the subject and information 
received  during contact  attempts  must  be documented in the subject’s  medical  record.  In any 
circumstance, every effort should be made to document subject outcome, if possible. The 
investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the subject/legally acceptable representative to return all unused investigational product(s), request the subject to return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject/legally acceptable representative regarding any unresolved adverse events (AEs).  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 If the subject/legally  acceptable representative withdraws  from  the study, and also withdraws 
consent  for disclosure  of future  information, no further evaluations  should be performed, and 
no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data 
collected before such withdrawal of consent.  
6.8. Lost  to Follow -up 
All reasonable efforts  must  be made to  locate subjects  to determine  and report  their  ongoing 
status.  This includes  follow -up with persons  authorized  by the subject  as noted  above. Lost 
to follow -up is defined by the inability to reach the subject after a minimum of three 
documented phone calls, faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one 
registered mail letter.  All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. 
If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.  
If investigator’ s use of a third -party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the 
study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a Sponsor -retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s 
contact information or other public vital status data necessary to complete the follow -up 
portion of the study. The site staff and representative will consult  publicly available sources, 
such as public  health  registries  and databases,  in order  to obtain updated  contact  information. 
If after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow -up, then the last known alive date as 
determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records.  
7. ASSESSMENTS 
Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol required tests and procedures are completed as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be 
circumstances, outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test.  In these cases, the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the 
safety  and well-being  of the subject.  When  a protocol  required  test cannot  be performed,  the 
investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he/she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The 
study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely fashion.  
7.1. Physical Examination  
Physical exam, including vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) and physical  measurements (height/body length and  body weight) will be conducted at screening.  
Since dosing will be based  on body weight, minimal clothing should be worn  during the body 
weight measurement.  
Uncontrolled severe  hypertension at randomization is an exclusion  criterion  and is defined  as 
a systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 99
th percentile plus 5 mmHg as defined by the 
National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group (NHBPEP) established guidelines for the definition of normal and elevated blood pressures in children in 1987 and  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Targeted  physical examinations for evidence of bleeding will be performed  at Day 14, 42, 
and 84 (EOT) visits and as clinically indicated. 
7.2. Blood Volume  Collection  
7.2.1. For Subjects  28 Days of Age or Older  
The current  total maximum potential blood sampling volume for individual subjects  
(ie, ≥ 28 days of age, and ≥4 kg weight) in this study is approximately 16.7 mL (this would 
include the optional 6-12 week extension visit for apixaban subjects only) for subjects 
randomized to apixaban and 9.3 mL for subjects randomized to SOC. Maximum blood volumes will be based on the child’s weight and in accordance with local thresholds. The 
actual collection times of blood sampling may change. INR may need to be repeated as per 
local  site procedures for those subjects  on standard  of care (SOC).  Additional blood samples 
may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by the Sponsor, provided the total volume taken  during the study does not exceed  1% of the total blood volume (eg,  0.8 mL/kg) 
at a single instance and up to 3% (2.4 mL/kg) over a four- week  period in accordance with the 
2008 version of the EU guidance titled, ‘Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products with the Paediatric Population.’
9 Table 5  summarizes  the total blood 
volume that may be collected from a subject who is randomized to either Apixaban or SOC. 
7.2.2. For Neonates  (≤27 days of age)  
Given the low body weight of neonates, and their low absolute circulating blood volume, 
special attention must be paid to the amount of blood drawn for neonates. For the neonates recruited  into the study, prior to the completion  of the neonate PK sub- analysis,  it is expected 
that the maximum blood volume for the 3 apixaban PK blood samples will be ≤ 3 mL total.  
To mitigate  excessive blood loss for the purposes of PK blood sampling, dried  blood spot PK 
samples may be acquired in lieu of direct venous phlebotomy. Dried blood spot (DBS) analysis has been developed as a blood volume preservation option for neonates (approximately 45 microliters of blood per DBS sample). If DBS is the method of choice, a hematocrit result must have been drawn and available from a local laboratory within 48-72 hours prior to the first PK sample timepoint (Day 1 for PK cohort, Day 14 for PK and post PK cohort). Further details of blood collection and processing will be provided to the site in a procedure manual. Additional blood samples  may be taken  for safety  assessments at 
times specified by the Sponsor, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 1% of the total blood volume (eg, 0.8 mL/kg) at a single instance and up to 3% 
(2.4 mL/kg) over a four- week  period in accordance with the 2008 version of the EU guidance 
titled, ‘Ethical Considerations for Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products with the Paediatric 
Population.’

7.3. Laboratory Assessments 
The following laboratory  tests are required  to satisfy  the exclusion criteria  for this study and 
should be analyzed by the local laboratory and reviewed prior to randomization: platelets, 
serum creatinine, eGFR, ALT, conjugated bilirubin, and pregnancy test when applicable.  
Only  the most  recent  laboratory  results,  obtained within  7 days prior  to randomization, may 
be used to satisfy this requirement. 
Blood samples for analysis by a central laboratory will be obtained during the Day 1 and 
Day 42 visits (and when applicable, Days 126 and 168) to establish baseline values  and to 
assess safety.  Note  for subjects  <2 years  of age, local  labs may be done  in place of central 
laboratory tests and noted in the appropriate CRF to provide the required laboratory parameters for evaluation.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

7.3.1. Platelet  Assessment  and Treatment  Guidelines  for Thrombocytopenia  
Platelet counts should be ≥ 50×109 per liter (L) prior to randomization.  There are no 
evidence -based guidelines for anticoagulation therapy in relation to platelet counts. Close 
monitoring of platelet  count  and careful  watching  for signs  of bleeding may be necessary  in 
children  with an anticipated  drop in platelet  count  due to comorbid conditions  and treatments.  
Apixaban  
In the absence of any other  coagulopathy, the following guidelines  are recommended during 
the course of the study period with apixaban:  
• Full-dose apixaban  therapy for subjects  with platelet count  ≥50×109 per L; 
• Hold  apixaban  for platelet count  <50×109 per L and restart  when  platelet  count  
≥50x109 per L or presumed  to be above  this threshold following a platelet  transfusion.  
Standard of Care  
SOC should be managed according to local practice.  
7.3.2. Estimated  Glomerular  Filtration  Rate  Assessment  
The enrollment  criterion  for eGFR  will be estimated  based  on the Schwartz  formula 
[Schwartz et al, 2009].27 
Inadequate renal  function is defined  as <30%  of 1 standard  deviation  (SD) below  normal 
GFR for age and size as determined by the Schwartz formula [eGFR  
(ml/min/1.73m2) = 0.413 * (height (cms)/serum creatinine (mg/dL) for ages up to 2 years. 
Beyond 2 years  of age, the qualifying GFR  for this study is ≥30 mL/min/1.73m2. If serum 
creatinine concentration is measured in SI units (umoles/L), divide this number by the 
conversion factor of 88.4 to get the SI units (mg/dL) before inserting into the Schwartz 
formula to calculate eGFR].  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

7.3.3. Pregnancy  Testing  
For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with 
sensitivity  of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, on Days 1, 14, 42, and at 
the end of treatment  visit.  Pregnancy  tests will also be done  whenever  one menstrual  cycle is 
missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected), repeated at visits on Day 14, Day 42 and at the end of the study to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study.  A negative pregnancy result is required. 
In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject on apixaban will be withdrawn from study medication and the subject on SOC will be managed per local practice, but in either case the subject may  remain in the study. Pregnancy  tests may  also be repeated as per 
request of the institutional review board (IRB)/ethics committees (EC) or if required by local 
regulations.  
7.4. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic  Assessment  
7.4.1. Sampling  Time  Points  
Subjects  on apixaban in Groups 1- 4 will have PK/PD samples drawn during the Day 14 visit. 
On the day of the Day 14 visit, the subject will refrain from taking the apixaban dose until  
the pre-dose sample  is drawn. After  the sample  is drawn, the subject  will be administered  the 
apixaban dose. A second PK/PD sample will be drawn between 2 and 4 hours after 
administration  of the apixaban  dose. All efforts  will be  made to  obtain  the PK/PD  samples  at 
the exact  nominal  time  relative  to dosing.  In addition, the  date and  time  of administration  for 
the last 6 doses of apixaban prior to a pre -dose PK/PD sample on the day of the Day 14 visit 
will be recorded.  Anti-FXa activity will be measured as a PD assessment using an aliquot 
from the plasma of the PK/PD sample.  If DBS is the method of choice, a hematocrit result 
must have been drawn and available from a local laboratory  within 48- 72 hours prior to each 
PK sample timepoint (Day 1 for PK cohort, Day 14 and/or Day 42 for PK and post PK cohort).  
If one or both samples  are not drawn  during the Day 14 visit,  then the procedure  should be 
repeated at the Day 42 visit to obtain the missing sample(s). If viable samples are not 
obtained on Day 14 or Day 42, the site monitor should be notified. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 If possible, blood samples for apixaban concentration and anti -FXa activity should be 
obtained within  24 hours  of any major  bleed  or thrombotic  event  along with the time of the 
last dose prior to the event. 
Only  for the apixaban  treated  neonates  recruited  into the study, prior  to the completion  of the 
neonate PK sub- analysis, PK samples will be drawn at 2 -4, 12 ±1 and 24 ±1 hours after 
administration of the first apixaban dose of 0.1 mg on Day 1. The sample at 12 - hour  
time-point  should be collected  prior  to the second  dose  of apixaban  on Day 1. The sample  at 
24- hour time -point should be collected prior to the first dose of apixaban on Day 2.  
7.4.2. Plasma  for Analysis  of Apixaban  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic  Samples  
Samples  will be analyzed  for apixaban  PK and anti-FXa activity  using a validated  analytical 
method in compliance with Pfizer standard operating procedures.  
Materials  and detailed  instructions  for specimen  collection,  processing, storage,  shipment  and 
contact information will be provided to the site.  
7.5. Concomitant Medications  
Prior medications will be recorded at Screening and Day 1 (baseline) (any medications 
during the last 30 days)  prior to randomization. Concomitant  medications  will be recorded  at 
each study visit following the first dose of investigational product up to the end of treatment (EOT) visit as indicated in the Schedule of Activities . 
7.6. Adjudication of Safety  and Efficacy  Endpoints  
All components  of primary  efficacy  and safety  endpoint  will be adjudicated  by blinded, 
independent adjudication committee. 
There are four types  of adjudication to be performed  in this study as defined by the 
independent adjudication committee:  
• Potential Symptomatic  Efficacy  Events  (Packaged  as Adverse  Event  (AE)/Serious 
Adverse  Event  (SAE)):  All recurrent  Venous  Thromboembolic  Events  (VTE),  All 
Stroke Events. 
• Bleeding  Events  and Death  Events:  Major  Bleeding,  Clinically  Relevant  Non-Major 
Bleeding, Minor Bleeding, VTE Related Death, and All Cause Death.  
• Interval  Studies  (IS): Recurrent  VTE  defined as either  contiguous  progression or 
non-contiguous new thrombus. 
Further  details  on the adjudication process  will be detailed  in the Pfizer  Adjudication Charter.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 7.7. Bleeding  Assessments  
All bleeding events  will be adjudicated  by a blinded, independent  adjudication committee  as 
major bleeding, clinically  relevant non -major bleeding, or minor bleeding.  These endpoints 
are consistent with those recommended by the International Society on Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis for pediatric clinical trials in venous thromboembolism [Mitchell LG, 2011].21 
The adjudication committee will maintain the actual definitions used for adjudication.  
Bleeding  definitions  are based  on the  Perinatal  and Paediatric Haemostasis  Subcommittee  of 
the International Society  on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria, and are described 
as follows:  
Major  bleeding  is defined as bleeding that satisfies  one or more  of the following  criteria:  
a (i) fatal bleeding; (ii) clinically  overt bleeding associated with a decrease in Hgb of at least 
20 g/L (2 g/dL)  in a 24-h period;  (iii) bleeding that is retroperitoneal,  pulmonary, intracranial, 
or otherwise involves the central nervous system; and (iv) bleeding that requires surgical intervention in an operating suite (including interventional radiology).  
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding is defined as bleeding that satisfies one or both of 
the following:  (i) overt  bleeding for which  a blood product  is administered,  and which  is not 
directly attributable to the subject’s underlying medical condition and (ii) bleeding that 
requires medical or surgical intervention to restore hemostasis, other than in an operating 
suite.  
Minor bleeding: is defined as any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not 
fulfill the above  criteria  for either  major bleeding or clinically  relevant,  non- major  bleeding.  
Although menstrual bleeding may result in a medical consultation and/or intervention, this 
will be classified  as a minor  bleeding event  rather  than clinically  relevant  non-major  bleeding 
event.  
All bruising events  are reportable as  a bleeding event.  
All bleeding events  and their  supporting documentation MUST be  sent for adjudication.  
7.7.1. Treatment  Guidelines  for Bleeding/Suspected  Bleeding  
Subjects with bleeding or suspected bleeding should undergo confirmatory laboratory or other testing [eg, ultrasound (US), computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance 
imaging  (MRI)],  as indicated  clinically
. The date and  time of the onset  of the bleeding event 
will be recorded on the CRF. 
The specific treatment for bleeding with SOC or apixaban is left to the discretion of the 
investigator and/or the attending physician based on the medical status of the subject and/or institutional policies.  Table 7 provides  information  for the treatment  of bleeding or suspected 
bleeding in subjects treated with apixaban.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

with Apixaban  
 
Minor  Bleeding  Apixaban  may or may not be held based  on an individualized  benefit -risk assessment  
Clinically relevant 
non-major  bleeding Apixaban  should  be held.  
 
The following  treatment  measures  may be considered:  
• Identify  the source  and institute  local  measures  to stop the bleeding;  
 
• Perform  laboratory  test monitoring (eg, hemoglobin,  INR,  aPTT,  platelet 
count, anti -Factor Xa activity); 
 
• Monitor apixaban using an anti -Factor Xa assay rather than the more 
standard  coagulation tests (eg, INR,  aPTT) which  are less sensitive  to 
apixaban;  
 
• If bleeding occurs  up to 6 hours  after apixaban  dosing,  administer  activated 
charcoal oral solution to reduce apixaban plasma exposure;  
 
• Institute  appropriate  symptomatic  treatment  (eg, mechanical  compression, 
surgical intervention, fluid replacement and hemodynamic support, blood 
product or component transfusion);  
 
• For bleeding that does not respond to local measures, administer fresh frozen 
plasma  (FFP)  as a supportive  measure,  recognizing  that FFP does not reverse the 
anticoagulant effects of apixaban.  
Major  Bleeding  Apixaban  should  be held.  
 
The following  treatment  measures  may be considered.  
• Administer  recombinant  Factor  VIIa,  however,  there  is no experience with 
this agent in apixaban- treated subjects.  Its effectiveness for counteracting 
the effects of apixaban is not known.  
 
• Administer activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC, also referred to as factor IX 
concentrate), but considering the variety of formulations available and the 
complexity  of dosing,  the decision  to employ  aPCC or PCC should be made 
by an experienced  clinician  with careful  evaluation  of the risks  and benefits.  
 
• If bleeding occurs  up to 6 hours  after apixaban  dosing,  administer  activated 
charcoal oral solution to reduce apixaban plasma exposure.  
Alternate treatments such as recombinant Factor VIIa have not been well evaluated in the 
pediatric population. There are few randomized clinical trials of recombinant Factor VIIa 
(rFVIIa, NovoSeven) and approved anticoagulant therapies [Bijsterveld et al, 2002; 
Bijsterveld  et al, 2004;  Smith,  2002;  Lankiewicz et al, 2006;  Levi et al, 2010;  Kessler,  2006; 
Leissinger et al, 2008].5,6,28,15,17,13,16 There is no experience with rFVIIa and apixaban in 
adults or pediatrics. Some experts have recommended the use of prothrombin complex 
concentrate (PCC, also referred to as Factor IX concentrate) for reversal of anticoagulants 
such as warfarin.  There are few randomized clinical trials in this area, but observational  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 studies  and some  guidelines  are cited  in support  of this approach. There  are a variety  of PCC 
formulations available, which differ in their concentration of clotting factors (II, VII, IX  
and X). Dosing depends on body weight, the formulation of PCC employed, the degree of 
anticoagulation (INR),  the clinical  picture  and whether  concomitant  FFP is also administered.  
Thrombotic  events  have  been  reported  with PCC use. Given  the complexity  of the dosing 
and the risks involved, it is recommended that the decision to employ a PCC for warfarin 
associated  hemorrhage  be made by an experienced  clinician  with careful  evaluation of the 
risks and benefits. There are no data regarding the use of PCC for treatment of apixaban 
related hemorrhage.  
The effect  of activated  charcoal  on the pharmacokinetics  of apixaban  in healthy  subjects  was 
assessed in a Phase 1 clinical trial (CV185104). Administration of activated charcoal 2 and 
6 hours after ingestion of a single oral dose of 20 mg apixaban reduced apixaban exposure (AUC) by approximately 50% and 27%, respectively. These data indicate that activated 
charcoal may be useful in managing exposure to apixaban several hours after apixaban administration.  
7.8. Efficacy Assessments  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the adjudicated composite of: (i) all image -confirmed and 
adjudicated symptomatic and asymptomatic recurrent VTE defined as either contiguous progression or non-contiguous  new thrombus  and including, but not limited  to, DVT,  PE and 
paradoxical embolism and (ii) VTE -related mortality.  This endpoint is consistent with that 
recommended by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis for pediatric clinical trials in venous thromboembolism [Mitchell LG, 2011].
21 All components of the 
primary efficacy endpoint will be adjudicated by a blinded, independent adjudication committee.  
Subjects will be assessed for signs or symptoms of VTE (eg, swelling, localized pain, 
redness, heat, localized warmth, unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain that gets worse 
with a deep breath, coughing or chest movement or coughing up blood) throughout the 
course of the study (inclusive of treatment and follow -up periods). If signs and symptoms 
are present, then subjects will undergo a diagnostic examination to confirm recurrence of VTE.  Suspected  VTE  that occurs  at any time after enrollment  should also be reported  as an 
AE or a SAE.  All VTE will be adjudicated by an independent central adjudication 
committee in a blinded manner.  
Materials  and detailed  instructions  for completing  and submitting  the required  documentation 
to the adjudication committee will be provided to the sites.  Investigators are encouraged to 
send the dossier  to the adjudication  committee  for assessment  within  2 weeks  of awareness  of 
the suspected outcome occurrence.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 7.8.1. Imaging Assessments 
• Children 2 years to <18 years: In addition to the radiologic images obtained to 
confirm the index event,  new radiologic images of the index clot site  will be obtained 
during the midpoint of the study (Day  42 ± 14 days), and at the end of treatment visit 
(Day 84 ± 7 days). If applicable, radiologic images may be obtained at Days 126 
(EOT) or Day 168 (EOT) (refer to the Extension Phase SOA ). At the midpoint and 
end of treatment visits, the investigator will reassess the index event and all areas around the index event  that were scanned  initially  based  on the clinical  assessment,  to 
account for the presence of any new asymptomatic clots. At the midpoint (Day 42) 
and end of treatment (Day 84) visits, radiologic images that require sedation or 
radiation are not required and may be omitted, if not medically necessary. In 
addition, when medically appropriate, new radiologic images will be obtained if recurrent VTE is suspected.  All assessments obtained in the evaluation of 
symptomatic or asymptomatic recurrent VTEs will be adjudicated.  
• Children < 2 years  of age: For neonates  (birth  to ≤27 days) and  children  28 days to  
<2 years  of age, if the treatment duration is <12 weeks,  a midpoint image  may be 
omitted at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• Additional imaging  assessments can be performed  at the discretion  of the Investigator 
at any time during the study. 
The study does not prohibit further monitoring via radiologic images  as part of standard 
practice for the care of the patient.  
7.8.2. Criteria  for Thrombus  Review  by Adjudication Committee  
The following criteria  will be used during the adjudication of all submitted  new or recurrent 
VTE:  
• “Resolution”: Complete  disappearance of the thrombus compared to  the index event.  
• “Regression”:  Unequivocal decrease (>50%) of the total volume/mass  of the 
thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Unchanged”:  No significant change in the extent  (defined  as <=50%  change in 
volume/mass) or location of the thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Recurrence-Contiguous”: Unequivocal increase (>50%) of the total volume/mass of 
the thrombus compared to the index event. 
• “Recurrence -New”:  
• Thrombus resolution followed by new thrombus formation  in the same location  as 
the index event; or 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 • New  non-contiguous  thrombus  formation  in a different  location  as the index 
event.  
• “Indeterminate/Non -Diagnostic  Study”:  
• Thrombus  present  but due to poor image  quality  or incomplete  imaging  cannot 
determine if the thrombus is present due to poor image quality or incomplete 
imaging.  
The full adjudication process  and criteria  for thrombus  review  is details  in the Pfizer 
Adjudication Charter.  
7.9. Palatability  Assessment  
For subjects  receiving  apixaban,  palatability  will be assessed  at the Day 14 study visit.  The 
assessment will be administered to the subject and/or legal guardian in the form of a questionnaire.  
8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse  Event  (AE)  is defined  as any new untoward medical  occurrence  or worsening of 
a preexisting medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered study drug (investigational product) and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. 
 
GRADE  If required  on the AE page  of the CRF,  the investigator  will use the adjectives 
MILD, MODERATE, SEVERE, LIFE -THREATENING or DEATH to  
describe  the maximum intensity  of the AE. For purposes  of consistency, these 
intensity grades are defined as follows:  
1 MILD  Does  not interfere  with participant’s  usual  function.  
2 MODERATE  Interferes  to some  extent  with participant’s  usual 
function.  
3 SEVERE  Interferes  significantly  with participant’s  usual 
function.  
4 LIFE -THREATENING  Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention 
indicated.

 The causal  relationship to study drug is determined  by a physician and should be used to 
assess all adverse events (AE).  The causal relationship can be one of the following:  
• Related:  There is a reasonable causal  relationship  between  study drug administration 
and the AE.  
• Not related:  There is not a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  study drug 
administration and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal  relationship"  means  there is evidence  to suggest  a causal 
relationship.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open- ended questioning, 
examination, or  evaluation  of a subject  (In order  to prevent  reporting bias,  subjects  should 
not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs).  
8.1. Serious  Adverse Events  
A Serious  Adverse Event (SAE) is  any untoward medical occurrence that  at any  dose:  
• Results  in death;  
• Is life-threatening  (defined  as an event  in which  the subject  was at risk of death  at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe);  
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization  or causes  prolongation of existing  hospitalization 
(see NOTE below);  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes  listed  in the definition  above). Examples  of such events  include,  but are not 
limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization). Potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important medical event.  (See Section 8.7 for the definition of potential DILI).  
Suspected  transmission  of an infectious  agent  (eg, pathogenic  or nonpathogenic)  via the 
study drug is an SAE. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Although pregnancy, overdose, cancer,  and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See 
Section  8.1.1 for reporting pregnancies).  
Any component of a study  endpoint that is considered related  to study therapy (eg, death  is 
an endpoint, if  death  occurred  due to  anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported)  should be 
reported as SAE (see Section 8.1.1 for reporting details). 
NOTE:  
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in this study:  
• A visit to the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours, that does not 
result  in admission  (unless considered  an important medical  or life-threatening event);  
• Elective  surgery,  planned  prior to signing consent;  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical  procedure;  
• Routine health  assessment  requiring admission  for baseline/trending of health  status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy); 
• Medical/surgical  admission  other than to remedy  ill health  and planned prior to entry 
into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases; 
• Admission  encountered  for another life circumstance that carries  no bearing  on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason);  
• Admission  for administration  of anticancer  therapy  in the absence of any  other  SAEs 
(applies to oncology protocols). 
8.1.1. Serious  Adverse Event Collection and Reporting  
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Investigator Brochure (IB) represent the Reference Safety Information to determine expectedness of serious adverse events for expedited reporting. Following the subject’s  written  consent to participate  in the study, all SAEs,  whether  related 
or not related  to study drug, must be collected,  including those thought to be associated  with 
protocol-specified procedures. All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 
period and up to the follow-up visit (35 ± 5 days after the EOT visit). 
The investigator must also report  any SAE  that occurs after these time periods and that is 
believed to be related to study drug or protocol- specified procedure.  
An SAE  report must be completed  for any event  where doubt exists  regarding its  seriousness . 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

PFIZER  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page  69 
Approved  v 11.80.0 930084727  10.0  
 If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study  drug, but is potentially related 
to the conditions  of the study (such  as withdrawal  of previous  therapy, or a complication  of a 
study procedure), the relationship must be specified in the narrative section of the SAE 
Report Form.  
SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, SAE updates with follow -up 
information  and pregnancies  must  be reported  to BMS  (or designee)  within  24 hours 
of awareness of the event.  SAEs and all SAE updates with follow -up information 
must be recorded on the SAE Report Form and submitted to BMS (or designee); pregnancies  must  be reported  on a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  (electronic  or paper 
forms) and submitted to BMS (or designee).  
SAEs must also be reported as Adverse Events in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF)  and the event  marked  as ‘serious’.  Recording  an Adverse  Event  and marking 
it ‘serious’ in the eCRF is not a substitute for reporting the SAE as described above.  
SAE  Email  Address:  Refer  to Contact  Information  list. 
SAE  Facsimile  Number:  Refer  to Contact  Information  list. 
In all cases, an SAE Reporting Form must be submitted as directed above.  For studies 
capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission is the required method for reporting. In the event  the electronic system  is unavailable  for transmission  paper 
forms must be used and submitted immediately.  When paper forms are used, the original 
paper forms are to remain on site.  
SAE  Telephone  Contact  (required  for SAE  and pregnancy  reporting):  Refer  to Contact 
Information list.  
If only limited  information  is initially  available,  follow -up reports  are required.  
(Note:  Follow -up SAE  reports  must  include  the same investigator  term(s) initially  reported).  
If an ongoing SAE  changes  in its intensity  or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, the SAE report must be updated and submitted within 24 hours to BMS (or designee) using the same procedure used for transmitting the initial SAE report.  
All SAEs must be followed to resolution or stabilization.  
8.2. Nonserious  Adverse Events  
A nonserious adverse event  is an AE not classified as  serious.  
8.2.1. Nonserious  Adverse Event  Collection  and Reporting  
The collection of nonserious AE information should begin at initiation of study drug. Nonserious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in 
period or other  observational  period intended to establish  a baseline status  for the subjects.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

Approved  v 11.80.0 930084727  10.0  
 Nonserious  AEs should be followed to resolution or  stabilization,  or reported  as SAEs  if they 
become serious  (see Section  8.1.1).  Follow -up is also required  for nonserious  AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study 
treatment as appropriate.  All identified nonserious AEs must be recorded and described on 
the nonserious  AE page of  the CRF  (paper  or electronic).  Completion  of supplemental  CRFs 
may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalities that are reported/identified during 
the course of the study. 
8.3. Laboratory Test Result  Abnormalities  
The following laboratory  test result  abnormalities  should be captured  on the nonserious  AE 
CRF page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) and the AE CRF page as appropriate:  
• Any laboratory test result  that is clinically  significant  or meets  the definition  of an 
SAE.  
• Any laboratory test result  abnormality  that required the subject  to have study drug 
discontinued or interrupted. 
• Any laboratory test result  abnormality  that required  the subject  to receive specific 
corrective therapy.  
It is expected  that wherever  possible, the clinical  rather  than laboratory  term would be used 
by the reporting investigator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
8.4. Pregnancy  
If, following initiation  of the study drug, it is subsequently discovered  that a study subject  is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study exposure, including during at least 
5 half -lives after product administration (3 days) plus 30 days for a total of 33 days, the 
investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor/designee of this event and 
complete and forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 8.1.1. 
The study drug will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate  manner.  
Other  appropriate  pregnancy follow -up procedures  should be  considered  if indicated.  
The investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and complete 
and forward  a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  within  24 hours  of awareness  of the event  and in 
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in 
Section 8.1.1. 
Follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and 
neonatal  outcome  and, where applicable,  offspring  information  must  be reported  on the 
Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
Any pregnancy  that occurs  in a female partner  of a male  study participant  should be reported. 
Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 8.5. Medication  Error  
A medication  error is any: 
• Unintentional  error in the prescribing.  
• Dispensing or administration of a medicinal product that may cause or lead to 
inappropriate  medication  use or patient  harm  while  in the control  of the health  care 
professional, patient or consumer. 
The following are medication errors  for Apixaban ONLY:  
• Missed  doses  due to misunderstanding of the dosing schedule  (ie, QD instead  of 
BID).  
• Four  or more  consecutive  missed  doses.  
• A consistent  dosing schedule  outside  of BID (ie, QD,  TID,  QID),  unless  otherwise 
directed.  
• A consistent  dose above  or below  that which  was prescribed  based  on IRT. 
• Extending the Week  1 dosing beyond Week  1. 
8.6. Overdose  
All occurrences  of overdose  must  be reported  as SAEs  (see Section  8.1.1 for reporting 
details).  
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose of a product  that is considered  both excessive and medically  important.  All occurrences  of 
overdose must be reported as an SAE (see Section 8.1.1 for reporting details).  
8.7. Potential  Drug  Induced  Liver Injury  (DILI)  
The following guidelines are intended to identify and manage subjects with LFT abnormalities.  Specific laboratory test criteria and instructions  for further follow  up are 
provided.  
If at any time during the  treatment  period a  subject’s  LFT results  show:  
An isolated  elevation  of either  serum  glutamic -pyruvic  transaminase (SGPT)  (ALT)  or 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≥ 5 x ULN AND/OR a direct (conjugated) bilirubin  
>2 x ULN, obtain the following laboratories: ALT, AST, total bilirubin, direct (conjugated) bilirubin, alkaline  phosphatase, gamma -glutamyl  transferase (GGT),  creatine kinase  (CK) as 
soon as possible (ie, within 3 days). 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 If the repeat  tests  indicate:  
1. ALT  <5 x ULN and direct  (conjugated)  bilirubin  ≤2 x ULN,  study medication  may 
continue.  
2. If the repeat  ALT/AST  ≥5 x ULN AND/OR  the direct  (conjugated)  bilirubin  is 
>2 x ULN,  the study medication  must  be interrupted. 
The study medication must be interrupted if:  
• Clinical jaundice  is present  for a subject  at any  time unless  there is an alternative 
causative factor such as Gilbert or Dubin -Johnson syndrome. 
OR 
• If ALT/AST  ≥5 x ULN on any two consecutive  occasions.  
OR 
• Direct  (conjugated)  bilirubin  >2 x ULN on any two consecutive  occasions.  
All subjects  with an ALT/AST  ≥5 x ULN or direct  (conjugated)  bilirubin  >2 x ULN  will be 
followed weekly until ALT/AST returns to <3 x ULN or to baseline, and the direct 
(conjugated) bilirubin returns to ≤ 1.5 x ULN or to baseline.  
If study medication  is discontinued due to elevated  ALT/AST  OR BILIRUBIN,  as defined 
above, inform the medical Monitor and Study Director and perform the following:  
• PT, aPTT,  fibrinogen to assess liver synthetic  function;  
• Abdominal  ultrasound, including liver and hepatobiliary system;  
• Hepatitis  screen  (anti-HAV,  HBsAg,  anti-HBc,  anti-HBs and anti-HCV);  
• Obtain relevant specialist consultation.  
8.8. Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, electrocardiogram, x -ray filming, any other potential safety assessment required or not 
required  by protocol  should also be recorded  as a nonserious  or serious  AE, as appropriate, 
and reported accordingly. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL  METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summary  and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial 
will be documented in an Analysis Plan, which will be maintained by the sponsor. This 
document  may modify the plans  outlined in the protocol;  however, any major  modifications 
of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol 
amendment.  
Efficacy  and safety  outcomes  will be presented  using descriptive  statistics  including but not 
limited to means and standard deviations for continuous variables along with counts and frequencies for discrete variables.  
9.1. Sample Size Determination  
This is a descriptive  study, and there is no formal  pre-defined hypothesis  testing.  Therefore, 
there is no power calculation for the sample size determination. Throughout the trial, the 
study team, in conjunction with regulators (ie, Food and Drug Administration [FDA]), will evaluate exposure duration, imaging  results,  and other  aspects  of the trial to  determine if  the 
data from the subjects in the trial are sufficient to address the objectives of the trial.  It is 
expected that a sample size up to 250, increased from an original sample size of 150, is needed in order to provide a reasonable safety and pharmacokinetic database in pediatric subjects.  A target of 30 subjects will be randomized into each of the following three age 
groups: (1) 12 to <18 years; (2) 2 to <12 years; (3) 28 days to <2 years. For age group 4, 
neonates (birth to ≤ 27 days), the sample size may be adjusted based on a PK sub- analysis 
that will be performed using initial neonatal data to confirm an apixaban fixed dosing regimen for neonates as described in a separate analysis plan.  The number of neonates on 
apixaban will not exceed 20 subjects. 
9.2. Efficacy Analysis  
Appropriate  summary  statistics  as described  at the beginning of this section  will be presented 
for all efficacy endpoints. A summary of overall results along with summaries for each of 
the age group will be presented. The neonates who are enrolled under amendment 8 without 
2 to 1 randomization will be excluded in the overall population efficacy endpoints analyses. 
9.2.1. Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
There is no planned hypothesis testing for primary endpoint. Primary endpoint will be 
summarized  by treatment  group. The event  rates  and their corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented for each treatment group. 
9.2.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
There  is no planned  hypothesis  testing  for secondary endpoint. Secondary  endpoints  will be 
summarized by treatment group. The event rates and their corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals will be presented for each treatment group. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 9.3. Safety Analysis  
There is no planned hypothesis testing for the primary safety endpoint. The primary safety 
endpoint  will be the incidence  of adjudicated  major  or clinically  relevant  non-major  bleeding. 
Each type of adjudicated bleeding will be summarized using counts and frequencies in each 
treatment group.  
9.4. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic  Analyses  
The PK analysis population is defined as all subjects randomized to and treated with apixaban who have at least 1 concentration of apixaban. The PD analysis population is 
defined  as all subjects  randomized to and treated  with  apixaban  who have  at least 1 apixaban 
concentration and 1 corresponding anti -FXa activity measure.  
A population PK (PPK)  model  will be developed for  plasma  concentration versus  time data 
using nonlinear mixed effects modeling (NONMEM, Icon Development Solutions, USA). Model -derived  population and individual  PK parameters  (eg, CL/F,  Vc/F,  KA) will be used 
to estimate C
max, Cmin, and AUC in each subject. A PPK -PD model will be also developed 
for apixaban plasma concentration and measured anti -FXa activity versus time data.  
Model -derived  population and  individual  parameters  (eg, slope  of anti-FXa activity  vs 
apixaban  concentration  relationship)  will be used to estimate  maximum and minimum 
anti-FXa activity in each subject.  
Details  of the analyses  will be described  in a separate population PK/PD  modeling analysis 
plan document and results will be presented in a separate population PK/PD report.  
For Age Group 4, a  PK sub -analysis  will be performed using initial neonatal data to  confirm 
an apixaban  fixed  dosing regimen  for neonates  as described  in a separate analysis  plan. This 
analysis will be performed to confirm a fixed dose regimen of apixaban in neonates, which achieves an exposure similar to the adult approved regimen of 10 mg twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily. 
9.5. Interim Analysis  
There is an interim analysis planned in this study.  The interim analysis will be performed 
when  all randomized  subjects  in age Groups  1, 2 and  3 have  completed  the required  minimal 
treatment  periods  or have  discontinued from  the study. The objective  of this interim analysis 
is to provide an interim clinical study report for age Groups 1, 2, and 3 while age Group 4 
continues to enroll the targeted number of subjects. 
9.6. Data  Monitoring  Committee  
This study will use an EDMC.  The EDMC  will be responsible  for ongoing  monitoring of the 
efficacy and safety of subjects in the study according to the EDMC Charter. Apixaban PK 
data will be reviewed periodically by the Sponsor and will be provided to the EDMC at its 
request.  The recommendations made by the EDMC to alter the conduct of the study will be 
forwarded  to Pfizer  for final decision. Pfizer  will forward  such decisions, which  may include 
summaries of aggregate analyses of endpoint events and of safety data which are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 10. QUALITY CONTROL  AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
During study conduct, Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits to ensure 
that the protocol  and Good Clinical Practices  (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors  may 
review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs is accurate.  The 
investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. 
The study site may  be subject  to review  by the Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)/  Ethics 
Committee (EC), and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies 
working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities.  
It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits  and possible  audits  or inspections  and that sufficient  time is devoted to the 
process.  
11. DATA HANDLING  AND RECORD KEEPING  
11.1. Case  Report  Forms/Electronic Data  Record  
As used in this protocol, the term CRF  should be understood to refer to either  a paper  form  or 
an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study.  
A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. The completed 
original  CRFs  are the sole property of Pfizer  and should not be made available  in any form  to 
third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer.  
The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety  and laboratory data entered  on the CRFs  and any other  data collection  forms  (source 
documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely  (contemporaneous), enduring and available when required. The 
CRFs  must  be signed by the investigator  or by an authorized  staff member to  attest  that the 
data contained  on the  CRFs  is true.  Any corrections  to entries  made in  the CRFs  or source 
documents  must  be dated,  initialed  and explained  (if necessary)  and should not obscure  the 
original entry.  
In most  cases,  the source documents  are the hospital's  or the physician's  subject  chart.  In 
these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts.  
In some cases, the CRF, or part of the CRF, may also serve as source documents.  In these 
cases,  a document  should  be available at the investigator’s  site as well as at Pfizer  and clearly 
identify  those data that will be recorded in the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the 
source document. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 11.2. Record  Retention  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator 
agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safety reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence  (eg, letters,  meeting  minutes,  telephone  calls reports).  The records  should be 
retained by the investigator according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), according to local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA), whichever is longer.  
If the investigator  becomes  unable  for any reason  to continue  to retain  study records  for the 
required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectively notified. The 
study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by Pfizer.  
Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or 
discontinuation of the study  or for longer  if required  by applicable local  regulations. 
The investigator  must  obtain Pfizer's  written  permission  before  disposing of any records, 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
12. ETHICS  
12.1. Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)/  Ethics  Committee  (EC)  
It is the responsibility  of the  investigator  to have  prospective  approval  of the study protocol, 
protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, 
eg, recruitment advertisements,  if applicable,  from  the IRB/EC.  All correspondence  with the 
IRB/EC should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/EC approvals should be 
forwarded to Pfizer.  
The only circumstance in which  an amendment  may be initiated  prior  to IRB/EC  approval  is 
where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects.  In 
that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation.  
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The study will be conducted in accordance with legal  and regulatory requirements,  as well as 
the general principles set forth in the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), Guidelines for GCP (ICH 1996), and the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association 1996 and 2008).  
In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, the ICH guideline 
on GCP, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 12.3. Subject  Information  and Consent  
All parties  will ensure  protection of subject  personal  data and will not include  subject  names 
or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where 
required by law.  
When study data is compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, subject names,  addresses,  and other  identifiable  data will be replaced by  a numerical  code  consisting 
of a numbering system provided by Pfizer in order to de -identify study subjects. The study 
site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study linking their numerical code to the subject’s actual identity.  In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain 
high standards of confidentiality and protection of subject personal data consistent with applicable privacy laws.  
In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified  as beneficial  in the study. This information  should also be disclosed  to participants 
during the informed consent process. All study participants should be informed about the 
outcome of the study.  
The informed  consent/assent  documents  must  be in compliance  with ICH GCP,  local 
regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws.  
The informed  consent/assent  documents  used during the informed  consent  process  must  be 
reviewed  by the sponsor, approved by the IRB/EC before  use, and available  for inspection.  
The investigator must ensure that each study subject, or his or her legally acceptable 
representative,  or parent(s)  or legal  guardian  if a minor, is fully  informed  about  the nature 
and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation.  
Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s legally acceptable representative/parent(s) or legal guardian, the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC. If the 
investigator determines that a subject’s decisional capacity is so limited, he/she cannot reasonably  be consulted, as permitted  by the IRB/EC and consistent  with local  regulatory and 
legal requirements, then the subject’s assent may be waived with source documentation of  
the reason assent was not obtained. If the study subject does not provide his/her own 
consent, the source documents must record why the subject did not provide consent  
(eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent  was the subject’s  legally  acceptable representative,  the consent  signer’s 
relationship to the study subject (eg, parent, spouse) and that the subject’s assent was 
obtained, or waived. If assent is obtained verbally it must be documented in the source

 If the study includes minor subjects who reach the age of majority during the study, as 
recognized  under  local  law, they must  be re-consented as adults  to remain  in the study. If the 
enrollment of ‘emancipated minors’ is permitted by the study age criteria, the IRB/EC, and local law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the permission of a parent or legal guardian.  
The investigator, or a person designated by the investigator, will obtain written informed consent  from  each subject  or the subject's  legally  acceptable representative,  parent(s)  or legal 
guardian and the subject’s assent, when applicable, before any study- specific activity is 
performed, unless a waiver of informed consent has been granted by an IRB/EC. The 
investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent/assent document. 
12.4. Subject  Recruitment  
Advertisements  and recruitment materials  approved by ethics  committees  and investigator 
databases may be used as recruitment procedures.  
12.5. Reporting  of Safety  Issues and  Serious  Breaches  of the Protocol  or ICH GCP  
In the event  of any prohibition or restriction  imposed (ie, clinical  hold)  by an applicable 
Competent  Authority in any area of the world,  or if the investigator  is aware  of any new 
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the 
investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. 
In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safety measures 
taken by the investigator to protect the study subjects against any immediate hazard, and of any serious  breaches  of this protocol  or of ICH GCP  that the investigator  becomes  aware of. 
13. DEFINITION  OF END  OF TRIAL  
13.1. End of Trial  in a Member State  
End of Trial  in a Member  State  of the European Union is defined  as the time at which  it is 
deemed  that sufficient  number  of subjects  have  been  recruited  and completed  the study as 
stated in the regulatory application (ie, Clinical Trial Application (CTA)) and ethics application in the Member State.  Poor recruitment (recruiting less than the anticipated 
number in the CTA) by a Member State is not a reason for premature termination but is considered a normal conclusion to the study in that Member State.  
13.2. End of Trial  in all other  Participating  Countries  
End of Trial  in all other  participating countries  is defined  as last  subject last  visit (LSLV).  
14. SPONSOR  DISCONTINUATION CRITERIA  
Premature termination  of this study may occur  because of  a regulatory authority decision, 
change  in opinion of the IRB/IEC,  drug safety  problems, or at the discretion  of Pfizer.  In 
addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of apixaban at any time. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

[APPENDIX 2 SUPERSEDES  APPENDIX 1] 
Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) models were developed for the adult VTE treatment 
population based on data from the Phase 2 and 3 VTE treatment clinical trials and for the pediatric population based on data from the pediatric PK/PD studies (CV185079 and CV185118). Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using these 
models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric  PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population. 
A PPK analysis, incorporating data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies, was conducted to support 
the VTE  treatment indication  in adults.
1 Apixaban exposure  was adequately  characterized by 
a 2-compartment PPK model with first- order absorption and first -order elimination. Table 8 
provides a summary of the predicted daily steady- state apixaban exposure (AUCss) for adult 
VTE treatment patients with the 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses based on the PPK model.

CV185079 study was a multiple -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics,  safety,  and tolerability  of apixaban  in pediatric  subjects  from  birth  to 
<18 years with an indwelling central venous catheter. However, the study was terminated 
prior to completion due to poor enrolment attributed to the complexity of the study design. 
Apixaban concentrations  were  available from  6 subjects  in Group 5A (age ≥12 to <18 years) 
and 2 subjects in Group 4A (age ≥ 6 to <12 years). CV185118 study is an ongoing 
single -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and 
tolerability  of apixaban  in pediatric  subjects  from  birth  to <18 years  at risk for a venous  or 
arterial thrombotic disorder.  Apixaban concentrations are available for 15 subjects in 
Groups 3- 5: 5 subjects from Group 5 (12 years to <18 years); 6 subjects from Group 4 
(6 years  to <12 years);  4 subjects  from  Group  3 (2 years  to <6 years)  as part of a

 A pediatric PPK model was developed using the combined available data from Studies 
CV185118 and CV185079. This pediatric PPK analysis included a total of 144 apixaban 
concentrations  from  23 subjects.  A Bayesian  analysis  with an uninformative  prior  was used 
and apixaban exposure was adequately characterized by a 2- compartment PPK model with 
first-order absorption and first -order elimination.  
Using this interim pediatric PPK model, a PK simulation was performed to select doses for the oldest  of 4 age groups  in Study B0661037/CV185- 325 (Age  Group 1: 12 to <18 years)  to 
achieve an exposure (daily AUCss) equivalent to that associated with a safe and effective dose regimen in the adult VTE treatment population ( Table 8 ). A combined approach using 
fixed doses along with weight -based dosing was evaluated in the simulation, as shown 
below:  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 12 to <18 years  who are >40 kg will receive 10 mg 
twice daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter.  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 12 to <18 years  who  are ≤ 40 kg will receive a  dose of 
0.2 mg/kg twice  daily  for 7  days  followed by 0.1 mg/kg twice  daily  thereafter.  
A total of 2000 subjects were randomly sampled from the age range of 12 years to <18 years 
and the body weight was sampled from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth chart  based  on each subject’s  age and sex. The PK simulation  results  are summarized 
as box- and-whisker plots in Figure 1. The results show that this dosing regimen is expected 
to achieve a median exposure that is similar to the median exposure in adults. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

pediatric population, a PPK model was  developed using the data from the ongoing Study 
CV185118. Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using these 
models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population. 
A PPK analysis, incorporating data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies, was conducted to support 
the VTE  treatment  indication  in adults.

CV185118 study is an ongoing single -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics,  safety  and tolerability  of apixaban  in pediatric  subjects  from  birth  to 
<18 years  at risk for a venous  or arterial  thrombotic  disorder. As of 31-May-2019, a total of 
46 subjects received apixaban in CV185118: 10 subjects 12 years to <18 years of age,  
9 subjects  6 years  to <12 years  of age, 8 subjects  2 years  to <6 years  of age, 9 subjects  
9 months  to <2 years  of age, 9 subjects  28 days  to <9 months, and  1 subject  birth  to 
<28 days.  
The Interim Analysis 2 was completed using the available PK data from these subjects. A 
total of 147 apixaban  concentrations  were  available from  28 subjects.  A 2-compartment  PPK 
model with first- order absorption and a dose dependent bioavailability adequately described 
the PK of apixaban in pediatric subjects. The estimated oral clearance of apixaban increased 
from 0.996 L/h in Group 2A (9 months to <2 years) to 4.77 L/h in Group 5 (12 years to  
<18 years).  For pediatric  subjects  older  than 12 years  of age,  oral clearance values  are 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 similar to those of adults.  The body weight was an important covariate for oral clearance of 
apixaban. When  modeled as a power  function, the parameter  estimate  for the covariate effect 
of weight on oral clearance was 0.634 [95% CI: 0.506- 0.762]. The magnitude of  
inter-individual  variability  in oral clearance is similar  between  adults  and pediatric  subjects 
(~30%).  
Using this Interim Analysis 2 pediatric PPK model, a PK simulation was performed to select 
doses  for the two oldest  of 4 age groups  in Study B0661037/CV185- 325 (Age  Group 1: 12 to 
<18 years  and Age  Group  2: 2 to <12 years)  to achieve  an exposure  (daily  AUC ss) similar  to 
that associated  with a safe and effective dose regimen  in the adult  VTE  treatment  population 
(Table 8). Considering that apixaban  oral clearance was  dependent  upon the  body weight  in 
pediatric subjects older than 2 years in CV185118, consistent with reported values for allometric scaling,
2 a uniform mg/kg approach for both Age Group 1 and Age Group 2 was 
evaluated for simplified and accurate dosing. In addition, the body weight cut -off was 
changed from 40 kg to 35 kg to ensure a smooth transition of doses between administration with oral solution and tablets. A combined approach using fixed doses along with 
weight -based  dosing was evaluated  in the simulation,  as shown below:  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 2 to <18 years  who are ≥35 kg will receive 10 mg twice 
daily for 7 days followed by 5 mg twice daily thereafter;  
• Subjects  between  the ages  of 2 to <18 years  who  are <35 kg will receive a  dose  of 
0.28 mg/kg twice daily  for 7 days  followed by 0.14 mg/kg twice daily  thereafter.  
A total of 4000 subjects (2000 subjects for each Age Group) were randomly sampled from the age range of 2 years  to <18 years  and the body  weight  was sampled  from  the Centers  for 
Disease Control and Prevention growth chart based on each subject’s age and sex. The PK 
simulation results are summarized as box -and-whisker plots in Figure 2. The results show 
that this dosing regimen is expected to achieve a median exposure that is similar to the median exposure in adults. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 The Interim Analysis 3C was completed using the available PK data from these subjects in 
CV185118 and CV185079. Consistent with the previous IA3, the pediatric data were 
enriched with data from additional clinical studies in healthy young adults to support the pediatric population PK analysis. A total of 287 apixaban concentrations were available 
from 54 subjects. A 2-compartment PPK model with first- order absorption and a dose 
dependent  bioavailability  adequately  described  the PK of apixaban  in pediatric subjects.  The 
apparent oral clearance of apixaban in pediatric subjects was characterized using allometric scaling with the estimated power function of 0.704 [95% CI: 0.651 -  0.756]
2 and a fixed 
maturation function based on the apixaban elimination profile and known ontogeny of those 
pathways.3 
The estimated oral clearance of apixaban increased with increasing age.  For pediatric 
subjects  older  than  12 years  of age,  oral clearance values  are similar  to those of  adults. Body 
weight  was an important  covariate for oral clearance of apixaban.  In addition, oral clearance, 
when normalized to body weight, was generally constant across the pediatric age range of  
28 days to 18 years, except  for the neonate  subject.  The magnitude  of inter-individual 
variability in oral clearance is similar between adults and pediatric subjects (~30%).

in Figure 4. The PK simulation had 286, 567, 2771, 4548, and 1559 simulated subjects for  
4 to <5 kg, 5 to <6 kg, 6 to <9 kg, 9 to <12 kg, and 12 to <18 kg tiers, respectively. No 
subjects  <2 year  were  simulated  to have  body  weight  ≥18 kg based  on the growth chart.  The 
results show that this fixed -dose body weight tiered regimen in the newly proposed 4- <6 kg 
tiers is expected to achieve a median exposure that is similar to the median exposure in adults. While the simulation using the IA3C final model predicted ~30% increase in  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 Appendix  5. B0661037/CV185- 325 Dose  Selection  Rationale  for Age Group  4 (≤27 Days 
of Age) in Amendment 7 - PK Cohort Neonates  
A population pharmacokinetic  (PPK)  model  was developed  for the adult  VTE treatment 
population based on data from the Phase 2 and 3 VTE treatment clinical trials. For the 
pediatric population, a PPK model was developed using the data from the ongoing 
Study CV185118. Dose  selection  in B0661037/CV185- 325 is based  on simulations  using 
these models with the following key assumptions:  
1. The pediatric PK/PD  profile  established  in the pediatric  PK/PD  studies  represents  the 
PK/PD profile in the pediatric VTE treatment population.  
2. Equivalent exposure from the doses proven to be safe and effective in adult VTE treatment  studies  will be similarly  safe and effective in the targeted  pediatric VTE 
treatment population. 
A PPK analysis, incorporating data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies, was conducted to support 
the VTE  treatment  indication  in adults.
1 Apixaban exposure  was adequately  characterized  by 
a 2-compartment PPK model with first- order absorption and first -order elimination.2 
provides a summary of the predicted daily steady -state apixaban exposure (AUCss) for adult 
VTE treatment patients with the 5 mg and 10 mg BID doses based on the PPK model.

CV185118 study is an ongoing single -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics,  safety  and tolerability  of apixaban  in pediatric  subjects  from  birth  to 
<18 years  at risk for a venous  or arterial  thrombotic  disorder. As of May  31, 2019, a total of 
46 subjects received apixaban in CV185118: 10 subjects 12 years to <18 years of age,  
9 subjects  6 years  to <12 years  of age, 8 subjects  2 years  to <6 years  of age, 9 subjects  
9 months  to <2  years  of age, 9 subjects  28 days to <9 months, and  1 subject  birth to  
<28 days. CV185079 study was a multiple -dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, safety, and tolerability of apixaban in pediatric subjects, which was 
terminated  due to poor enrolment.  Apixaban concentrations  were available from  6 subjects 
with age 12 to <18 years and 2 subjects with age 6 to <12 years in CV185079. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

 The Interim Analysis 3C was completed using the available PK data from these subjects in 
CV185118 and CV185079. Consistent with the previous IA3, the pediatric data were 
enriched with data from additional clinical studies in healthy young adults to support the pediatric  population PK analysis. A total of 287 apixaban  concentrations  were  available from 
54 subjects. A 2-compartment PPK model with first- order absorption and a dose dependent 
bioavailability adequately described the PK of apixaban in pediatric subjects. The apparent 
oral clearance of apixaban in pediatric subjects was characterized using allometric scaling with the estimated power function of 0.704 [95% CI: 0.651 -  0.756]
2 and a fixed maturation 
function based on the apixaban elimination profile and known ontogeny of those pathways.3 
The estimated oral clearance of apixaban increased with increasing age.  For pediatric 
subjects  older  than  12 years  of age,  oral clearance values  are similar  to those of  adults. Body 
weight  was an important  covariate  for oral clearance of apixaban. In addition, oral clearance, 
when normalized to body weight, was generally constant across the pediatric age range of  
28 days to 18 years. The magnitude  of inter-individual  variability  in oral clearance is similar 
between adults and pediatric subjects (~30%).  
For the first 5 neonates ( ≤27 days of age) randomized to apixaban, subjects will receive 
standard of care therapies for at least 5 days and then will receive apixaban 0.1 mg twice daily. To support this dose selection, a total of 10000 simulated neonate subjects was 
randomly sampled  from  the Centers  for Disease Control  and Prevention growth chart  based 
on each subject’s age and sex.  Simulated subjects had a body weight of 2.6 kg to less than 
6 kg and an age of 6 days to less than 28 days considering at  least 5 days of SOC treatment 
prior to apixaban administration. 
The PK simulation  results  are summarized  as box-and-whisker  plot in Figure  5. 
The results show that the initial dose of 0.1 mg twice daily for neonates is expected to result 
in a slightly lower exposure (~30%) than that in adults with 5 mg twice daily but are generally  consistent  with the range  in adults. Thus, this dose is considered  safe and  effective 
for neonates who will have been treated with standard of care therapies for ≥ 5 days. 
For each neonate, a series of blood samples will be collected after the first 0.1 mg dose of apixaban to predict each subject’s daily apixaban exposure (AUCss) at steady- state.  If the 
subject’s  predicted  AUCss  is outside  the 90% prediction interval  from  adults  with 5 mg twice 
daily (1293 ng*hr/mL to 4807 ng*hr/mL in Table 11 ), apixaban dose will be adjusted to 
remain within this interval.  
Once 5 neonates are enrolled, a pharmacokinetic analysis will be conducted using apixaban exposure data to confirm a fixed dose regimen of apixaban in neonates to achieve an exposure  similar  to the approved apixaban  regimen  in adults  (10 mg BID for 7 days followed 
by 5 mg BID).  090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

10. Section 1.2.4: updated Table 2 to include starting  dose for neonates  of both PK cohort 
and post -PK cohort. Added text to explain 
what happens with dosing when a subject reaches age 28 days or older.  The Table 2 
footnote  c was updated accordingly. Added 
Table 2 footnote e, to indicate that if the PK sub-analysis  determines  that a different  dose 
was necessary, a subsequent protocol amendment would be required. 
11. Section 1.2.4: Dose Selection for Age Group 4. Added  Area Under  the Curve 
(AUC) ranges for reference.  
12. Section 1.3.2: Potential Risks for Subjects. Statistics on subjects and patients treated with apixaban  updated with current  numbers.  
13. Section 2.2 Endpoints: modified to clarify that endpoints would not be limited to Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) or Pulmonary Embolism) PE, and would include “other thrombotic events,” as a component of the primary endpoint given that the most common category  of VTE  events  in neonates 
is catheter related thrombosis and DVT or PE would be exceedingly rare events in neonates.  This change is reflected  elsewhere 
in the protocol for consistency. Other 
thrombotic events is also being added as a secondary endpoint. For consistency with 
the description of DVT, the secondary endpoint of PE is now described as symptomatic and asymptomatic PE.  Other 
edits  to endpoints  section  made to  clarify  the 
intent of all planned analyses. 090177e19a131135 \Approved \Approved  On: 28-Apr-2022  20:29  (GMT)

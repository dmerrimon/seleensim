EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  9 2 INTRODUCTION  
It is anticipated that more than 40% of contact lens wearers would benefit from a contact lens that 
corrects their astigmatism but this target is not reached in most count ries.1 Daily disposable ( DD) 
lenses account for 45% of all soft lens fits today2 and it is important that DDs correct astigmatism 
are available in order to grow this c ategory. In the past DD lenses were mainly available in  
hydrogel materials, however, most of the  new DDs use highly  oxygen- permeable silicone hydrogel 
(SiHy) materials.  
The contact lens stabilisation design plays the major role in lens stability and maintaining on eye 
stability is a critical factor to achieve a good, stable vision. As well as visual performance, satisfaction with  lens handling lens and lens comfort influence success with a contact lens.  
The goal of this study  is to compare the performance of  MyDay  toric (Lens A),  a SiHy DD toric 
lens from CooperVision  Inc., which has successfully been established on the market with  
Precision1 for Astigmatism  (Lens B), a DD SiHy toric lens recently launched by Alcon to the US 
market.  
3 OBJECTIVES  
To compare the clinical performance of two different daily disposable, SiHy  toric contact lens 
types , Lens A and Lens B , in existing soft lens wearers when worn for  one week each . 
The prim ary outcome variable for this study is: 
• The rating for “ Ease  of overall lens handling for putting lenses on eyes, removing 
from eyes, opening packaging etc ”, using a 0 - 10 integer scale , collected in the 
subjective Experience ratings  after 1 week  of wear  (6-8 days ).  
The secondary outcome variable is:  
• Visual acuity (Snellen converted to LogMAR) after 1 week of wear (6 -8 days)  
4 HYPOTHESIS  
The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference for the primary outcome variable between 
Lens A  compared to Lens B.  
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  10 5 MATERIALS AND METHODS  
5.1 STUDY DESIGN  
5.1.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
This study will be conducted at several optometry practices in the US. This study  is a 
prospective, bilateral eye, double- masked, rando mized, 1- week cross -over, daily -wear design 
involving two different daily disposable toric lens types. Each lens  type will be worn for 
approximately one week, during which participants record their subjective lens -wear experience 
on three different days.  
5.1.2 RANDOMIZATION  
A randomization schedule will determine the order of Lens A and Lens B wear for the 
first/second week  for each participant . Participants  will be randomized immediately prior to their 
first lens dispense.  
This randomization schedule will be generated for each site using a web- based program: 
(www.randomization.com ). The lens type that will be worn during the first week is called “ Lens 
type #1”, the lens type dispended for the second week is called “ Lens type  #2”. The final study 
randomization schedule will be generated by CORE ’s Database Administrator  and provided to 
the research assistants  at each site.  
5.1.3 MASKING  
At the fitting visit, only the participant will be masked of the lens type, the investigator will know 
which type is fit in order to make changes to the lens at this visit  if needed . Strongly adhesive 
stickers will be placed on the packages/foils to mask the participant to the lens brand. At both 
dispense visits, participants and investigators will be masked to the lens type dispensed.  In order 
to achieve this, unmasked study personnel will determine the lens order according to the randomization schedule and will over -labeled the l ens packages/f oils prior to dispense . 
5.2 INVESTIGATIONAL  SITES  
5.2.1 NUMBER OF SITES  
This study will be conducted at several  optometry practice sites in the United States .   
 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  11 5.2.2 INVESTIGATOR RECRUITMENT  
The principal investigator at each site will be required to fulfil the following criteria:  
• Is a l icensed Optometrist with at least two years of contact lens fitting experience. 
• Can demonstrate training in Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
• Accepts responsibility for the conduct of the study at their site.  
• Has in- office email and document scanning capabilities.  
• Will scan and send all study visit documents to CORE, ideally the same day* as the 
visit or at most within 2 days of the study visit.  
• Is willing  to follow the study protocol and to co- operate with the study monitors  at 
CORE . 
* Study documents are required as soon as possible because this allows for prompt lens 
ordering and timely data review, query and entry.  
5.3 STUDY POPULATION 
5.3.1 SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION  
The sample size calculation was based on the standard deviations of paired differences from the subjective response data of a pilot study involving the spherical lenses of the toric lenses to be 
worn in this study, which used a 0-10 integer scale (10 being best) .  
Variable (0 -10 scale)  Difference to detect  Sample size  Target Power  
Handling on insertion  0.7 34 0.80 
Handling at removal  0.5 35 0.80 
Comfort on insertion  0.6 39 0.80 
Comfort at removal  0.7 45 0.80 
Vision quality on insertion  0.5 24 0.80 
Vision quality at removal  0.5 24 0.80 
 
A sample size of 45 is sufficient to detect a mean difference of 0.7 units on a 0 to 10 scale for all 
the above responses, with 80% power and alpha 0.05 in a two -tailed t -test.  
Therefore, up to 52 participants will be dispensed with study products with the goal to complete at 
least 45.  
 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  12 5.3.2 NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS  
Participants will be recruited using site records  and databases where consent for contact about 
research has been provided. There will also be general  advertising materials (eg. posters, social 
media posts ) and all these, including email scripts, will be approved by the ethics  review board. 
All initial individual- targeted recruitment activities, such as any direct mailing of recruitment 
scripts, will be conducted by practice staff that are not directly involved in conducting the 
research. This separation will reduce any undue influence of the optometrist -patient relationship. 
This process will also eliminate opportunity for the investigator to access personal health information before any consent for disclosure is provided by the potential participant.  
It is anticipated that up to 70 potential participants may attend a Screening visit and up to 52 
participants may be randomized and dispensed with study products, with a target of at least 45 
completing the study.  
 
5.3.3 INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
A person is eligible for inclusion in the study if he/she:  
1. Is at least 18 years of age and has full legal capacity to volunteer ; 
2. Has read and signed an information consent letter; 
3. Self reports having a full eye examination in the previous two years; 
4. Anticipates being able to wear the study lenses for at least 12 hours a day, 7 days a 
week;  
5. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule; 
6. Habitual ly wears  toric soft contact lens es binocularly , of any replacement frequency,  for 
the past 3 months minimum;  
7. Has refractive astigmatism at least  -0.75D C in each eye, maximum -2.25DC; 
8. Has refractive cylinder axis either between 155 to 25 or between 65 and 115 degrees;  
9. Is myopic and requires a spectacle spherical component of - 1.00D to -6.50D inclus ively; 
10. Can be fit and achieve binocular distance vision  of at least 20/30 Snellen with the 
available lens parameters (see Table 1).  
A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:  
1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study ; 
2. Habitually wears one of the study contact lenses; 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  13 3. Has any known active * ocular disease and/or infection that contraindicates contact lens 
wear ; 
4. Has a  systemic condition  that in the opinion of the investigator may affect  a study 
outcome variable;  
5. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator may 
affect contact lens wear or a study outcome variable; 
6. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic sodium fluorescein used in the study;  
7. Self-reports  as pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment#; 
8. Has undergone refractive error surgery  or intraocular surgery . 
 
* For the purposes of this study, active ocular disease is defined as infection  or inflammation which 
requires therapeutic treatment. Mild (i.e. not considered clinically relevant) lid abnormalities  (blepharit is, 
meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye are not considered 
active ocular disease.  Neovascularization and corneal scars  are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or 
inflammation and are therefore not act ive. 
 
# Pregnant and lactating women are not being excluded from the study due to safety concerns but due to 
fluctuations in refractive error, accommodation and/ or visual acuity that occur secondary to systemic 
hormonal changes  and water retention. It has  further been shown that pregnancy could impact tear 
production, which could impact dry eye symptoms. Such fl uctuations could affect the secondary outcome 
data, thereby negatively affecting study data integrity.  
 
5.4 STUDY MATERIALS  
Sites will be provided (if needed) with a trial kit  of Lens A and will source their own trial kit of 
Lens B. The sites will use these trial kits  to fit Lens B and Lens A  lenses  to determine the optimal 
lens power . The final lens prescription will be recorded on  the respective fields on the data 
collection forms  and lenses will be ordered as following:  Lens B will be ordered through the site’s 
normal commercial route  (Lenses from the fitting sets will not be used for dispense) . CORE will 
coordinate the Lens A  lens orders for each participant upon receipt of the lens order form, which 
is part of the study visit pack.   
Reimbursement to practice sites for study product expenses will be provided by CooperVision at 
the end of the study, after CORE has reconciled the invoices and the product accountability and dispensing logs.  
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  15 5.4.4 DISPOSING OF STUDY PRODUCTS  
At the end of the study, all sites will return all unused products  to CORE , unless  otherwise 
directed. Worn lenses will be disposed of by participants and at the sites according to local 
regulations.  
5.4.5 PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
Accountability  logs are completed to record all study products  that were used for each 
participant, which includes products used during the visits and t hose  dispensed to  and returned 
by each participant . 
5.5 SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
This study has a minimum of 4 scheduled study visits, including the screening visit.  There is an 
option for repeated screening visit if needed.  
A scheduled 1- week  follow -up visit may only take place  when the participant  attends  wearing  
the study lenses for at least two hours  that day . If this is not the case and the participant  is not 
experiencing any problems  with the lenses, the appointment will be rescheduled, ideally within 
the visit window.   
Visits that fall outside of the specified visit windows will be designated as protocol deviations and 
at the end of the study, the data collected during protocol deviations  will be assessed for their 
suitability to be included in the analysis population. 
Table 3 summarizes the scheduled study visits and study codes.

completed either at study completion, or if the participant is discontinued from the study at another time. A study exit form must be completed for all participants who have taken a study ID number. If in the opinion of the investigator post -study follow -up visits are required, the exit form will be 
completed after the last follow -up visit.  
Exit visual acuity will be recorded with either the participant’s  spectacles, refraction or habitual 
contact lenses. An exit biomicroscopy assessment will be conducted if not already completed on 
the same day for a concurrent study visit.  
After the  exit assessments have been completed, the participant and investigator will complete 
the study completion and remuneration forms. At this time the participant will be considered as 
having exited the study.  
 
5.5.7 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
An unscheduled visit is defined as an interim visit requested by the participant  or investigator 
due to an unanticipated problem. Data recorded at these visits will be entered into the database. 
Only relevant and applicable unscheduled visit information will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary.  
 
5.6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Table 4 summarizes  the procedures conducted at each visit.  

EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  29 5.6.2 VISUAL ACUITY  
This will consist of high contrast Snellen acuity, measured in full room illumination at distance 
(≥4m). A modification factor will be recorded; for exam ple 20/20+2 or 20/20 -2 would  indicate 
they read 2 letters beyond the 20/20 line or made 2 errors  on the 20/20 line , respectively.  Where 
no additional letters were read or missed, the correction factor will be recorded as ‘0’.

EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  30 6 MONITORING PROTOCOL ADHERENCE  
Adherence to study visit windows, lens wearing schedule, and time windows around other data 
collection points (i.e. subjective ratings) will be monitored by CORE. Deviations from the study 
plan as  described in the protocol will be reported in the study report. As described in Section 13.4, 
major protocol deviations will be reported to the Sponsor and Sterling Institutional Review Board  
within 7 days of becoming aware of them (as per Sterling Institutional Review Board guidelines) .  
7 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS TO HUMAN PARTICIPANTS  
There may be no direct benefits to the subjects in this study . Participation in a study may contribute 
to scientific research information that may be used in the development  of new contact lens 
products. The  subjects will receive an examination of the front part of their eyes and may have the 
opportunity to try a diff erent type of soft contact lenses and/or different lens care products at no 
cost to them. The contact lens materials used in this study are commercially available as daily wear. This study will investigate participants’ wearing schedule intended for daily wear (NOT extended wear) , similar to the average wearing time of 10 -16 hours for daily wear lenses.  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines , because the 
study devices used as intended in this study (1) do  not represent a potential for serious risk to the 
health, safety or welfare of the subject, and (2) are not implants, (3) are not used to support or sustain human life, (4) are not of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise prevents impairment of human health.   
The two study contact lens  types will be worn as per their approved use; on a daily wear , daily 
disposable basis. When contact lenses are worn on a daily wear basis there is a small risk of an 
adverse event compared to not wearing contact lenses. When contact lenses are worn on an extended wear basis, there is a significantly increased risk of an adverse reaction compared with 
wearing contact lenses on a daily wear basis.  
Adverse events and/ or complications in daily wear of  soft contact lenses can occur  (eg: 
inflammation and infection).  Complications that may occur during the wearing of contact lenses 
include discomfort, dryness, aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and 
variable or blurred vision.  More serious risks may include pain, photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact lens -related infections are very infrequent, the 
possibility does exist.  The incidence of infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  31 always an infection will occur only in one eye.  This risk is assumed by 35 -million Americans who 
currently wear contact lenses and only current soft lens wearers will be recruited for this study.  
A dye (fluorescein) normally used for eye examinations is being used in this study. Although 
rare, it is possible to have an allergic reaction to the dye. Participants will be asked if they  have  a 
known allergy or sensitivity to fluorescein. 
The assessments conducted in this study are r outine clinical procedures  and they includ e auto-
refraction, auto- keratometry, visual acuity,  anterior ocular health assessment, and contact lens 
fitting will be used. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 
mm or digital cameras . Patients will be monitored frequently  until the end of the study to reduce 
the occurrence of adverse or potential adverse events. Patients will be given instructions from 
their investigator regarding early symptoms and signs of adverse events.  
8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
See CORE SOP012 for a description of all adverse events, including management  and reporting.  
An ‘adverse event’ refers to any undesirable clinical occurrence in a participant, whether it is considered to be device -related or not. Adverse events (AE) may be classified as ‘unanticipated 
adverse device effects,’ ‘serious adverse events,’ ‘significant adverse events,’ or ‘non- significant 
adverse events,’ as defined below , Table 5.  
A number of conditions may result in temporary suspension until resolution. These include corneal 
infiltrates, corneal staining, limbal injection, bulbar injection or tarsal conjunctival abnormalities.  
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  34 An adverse event form will be completed for each adverse event. If both eyes are involved, a 
separate adverse event form will be completed for each eye. Whenever possible, the adverse 
event will be photo- documented.  
Expenses incurred for medical treatment as part of study participation will be paid by the sponsor 
(bills and prescription receipts kept). The participant must be followed until resolution or no further change is anticipated and/or referred for further care with the appropriate health care professional 
and/or recorded as being under appropriate health care as per investigator’s discretion. A written 
report will be completed indicating the subsequent treatment and resolution of the condition.  
8.3 REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
All potential Serious and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects that are related or possibly related 
to participant’s participation will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  (details below) and 
also to the sponsor (details below) within 24 hours of the investigator becoming aware of the event. The site’s Principal Investigator will also report the event to Sterling  IRB within 10 days of 
becoming aware of the Serious or Unanticipated event, using the Reportable Events Form. All 
fatal or life-threatening events will be reported immediately to the IRB.  
Significant and Non- Significant Adverse Events will be reported to CORE’s lead study coordinator  
and the sponsor as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days after becoming aware of 
the occurrence.  
 CORE contact details for adverse events are:

EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  35  
Details of all adverse events will be included in the study report. 
9 DISCONTINUATION FROM THE STUDY  
Participants may be discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor in consideration 
of participant safety or protocol compliance, or at discretion of the participant.  Participants 
discontinued from a study will be reimbursed US$25 per visit for their active involvement in the 
study (including the initial screening visit  and all lens fitting visits ).  Upon discontinuing, a 
participant will be offered the option of their data being withdrawn from future statistical analysis. The following is a list of possible reasons for discontinuation from the study: 
• Screening failure: Participants will be discontinued if  they do not meet the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria outlined in section 5.2.3. 
• Unacceptable performance with products to be used in study: Participants may be 
discontinued if they are unable to achieve acceptable comfort and /or vision with the study products.  
• Positive slit lamp finding: Participants may be permanently discontinued from the study depending on the severity of the condition and on the judgement of the investigator.   
• Adverse event: If a participant experiences an adverse event during the study,  they may 
be discontinued based on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Symptoms : If the participant has persistent sympto ms, they may be discontinued based 
on the clinical judgement of the investigator.  
• Disinterest, relocation or illness: The participant may choose to discontinue due to reasons within or beyond their control.  
• Violation of protocol or non- compliance:  The participant will be discontinued if they are 
unable or unwilling to follow the protocol specified visit schedules  and/or study 
procedures . 
• Instillation of topical ocular medication:  The participant will be discontinued if they elect to use a topical ocular medication during the study  unless  that topical ocular medication 
is prescribed for a limited duration (less than two weeks)  to treat a transient condition; in 
this case  the participant may remain an active participant (at the discretion of the 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  36 investigator) after stopping topical ocular medication following resolution of the ocular 
condition).  
• Lost to follow -up:  The participant will be discontinued if they cannot be contacted and do  
not return to complete the  final study exit, and if the investigat or has made a reasonable 
effort to contact the participant for a final study visit.  
• Premature termination of the study by the sponsor, CORE  or Sterling IRB . 
A discontinuation form , stating the reason for discontinuation will be completed, which requires 
the signatures of both the participant and the investigator except where the participant is lost to 
follow- up in which case only the signature of the investigator is required .   
When a participant choses to discontinue from the study they will be given the opportunity to 
withdraw their data from the statistical analysis. This choice will be captured on the discontinuation form.  
All discontinuations including their reasons will be included in the final report.  
10 DEVICE MALFUNCTIONS  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens that is  likely to cause or contribute to a  Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to CORE  and the sponsor within 24 hours  of the investigator 
becoming aware of the malfunction. Sterling IRB  would also be notified within 24 hours of any 
device malfunction that may contribute to a  Serious Adverse Event . 
Other defective lenses should be reported to CORE as soon as possible (usually in weekly study 
updates).  
This clinical study will also ascertain satisfaction or preference with subjective attributes such as comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be considered as complaints or device malfunctions. 
11 STUDY COMPLETION AND REMUNERATION 
At the last scheduled protocol visit a study completion form  will be completed, which requires the 
signatures of both the participant and the investigator.  Participants will also be prov ided with a 
letter of appreciation.    
Once their involvement in the study is complete, participants will be informed about receiving 
feedback following study completion in the Let ter of Appreciation. 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  39 password protection, a restricted time period for download, IP logging and email notification of 
download.  Files may be encrypted prior to transmission at the request of the sponsor. Using this 
method means that data files are only stored on University of Waterloo servers  during the 
transfer .  
12.3 COMMENTS ON SOURCE DOCUMENTS  
Data analysis will not be conducted on comments which have been recorded in the source 
documents. Only relevant and applicable comments will be included in the final report as 
deemed necessary by CORE’s L ead Co-ordinator .  
13 PROTOCOL & OTHER TRAINING  
All study personnel will be required to complete training prior to their involvement in the study. Records of training will be kept at CORE . This will include training by CORE on the study 
protocol , study procedures, informed consent procedures, and on the randomization and 
participant masking procedures , as well as training for Good Clinical Practice.   
All site Principal Investigators and co-investigators will provide a scan of their curriculum vitae, 
license to practice optometry and evidence of professional indemnity insurance.  
14 STUDY MONITORING  
Each site will provide regular  status reports to CORE . Status r eports will include:  
• The number of participants screened, enrolled, and randomized (i.e. assigned a study ID number), discontinued and completed.  
• Details of all protocol deviations, adverse events, device malfunctions . 
• Reports of unintended events.  
CORE will collate the site updates and provide 2 -weekly status reports to the study sponsor.  
Study monitoring visits to the sites may be conducted by CORE, the sponsor, or sponsor’s 
designate,  throughout the study and will be scheduled in conjunction with the Princip al 
Investigator at each site. In addition study records may be inspected by the sponsor, the 
sponsor's designate, Sterling Institut ional Review Board, and by regulatory authorities in Canada 
and the United States, namely Health Canada and the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA); however, they will not be permitted to take away any records containing identifiable personal information.  
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  40 Study data review and data monitoring will be conducted by CORE personnel. To improve data 
integrity, data entry will be conducted by two people and the entries will be compared. Data 
queries will be reported to the site within 5 working days of receipt of initial data. A response 
resolving the query will be expected from the site within 5 working days of receipt of the query.  
All adverse events and protocol deviations will be reviewed by the site Principal  Investigator  and 
CORE’s Lead Co- ordinator . All serious adverse events and major protocol deviations will be 
reviewed by the site Princip al Investigator  and CORE’s  Director and/or Head of Clinical 
Research.

15.4 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations are unanticipated or unintentional changes to a study after it has received 
prior sponsor approval and ethics clearance . Protocol deviations can be major or minor.  
15.4.1  MAJOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations may impact the research protocol, information consent document or 
other study materials , usually cannot be anticipated ahead of time and are often necessary to 
ensure the safety and welfare of the participants.  
The following are examples of protocol deviations that must be reported to the ORE : 
• Changes in procedures initiated to eliminate immediate risks/hazards to participants;  
• Enrollment of participants outside the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria whether agreed to or not by the sponsor;  
• Medication / device / intervention errors (i.e. incorrect drug or dosage of drug / incorrect 
contact  lens(es) dispensed / incorrect care system dispensed);  
• Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which could impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -related 
intervention or upon the experimental design; 
• Information consent documentation violations: no documentation of informed consent; 
incorrect version of, or incomplete, informed consent documentation used.  
15.4.2  MINOR PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
Protocol deviations caused by or which originate with research participants are considered minor, and normally are not reported to the ORE unless these result in increased risk to the 
participant (s). The following are examples of protocol deviations that are considered minor and 
do not require reporting to the ORE:  
• Logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., study participant missed 
appointment, change in appointment date) ; 
EX-MKTG -122 PEAR Protocol v 1.2 10feb2021  42 • Inadvertent deviation in specific research intervention procedures or timing of the 
research intervention which would not impact upon the safety or efficacy of the study -
related intervention or upon the experimental design (i.e., missing a measurement during 
a session that is not considered critical for the study).  
15.4.3  REPORTING AND DOCUMENTING PROTCOL DEVIATIONS  
Major protocol deviations must be reported to the Sterling Institutional Review Board within 10  
days  of the deviation occurring (or its discovery)  using the Reportable Events Form . To facilitate 
timely reporting to the sponsor , all sites must notify CORE o f a major protocol deviation as soon 
as possible.  
All protocol deviations (major and minor) occurring during the study will be documented and included in the final report . 
15.5 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
The sponsor, CORE  or Sterling Institutional Revie w Board may terminate the study at any time 
for any reason.

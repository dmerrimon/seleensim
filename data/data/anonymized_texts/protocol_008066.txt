verifier will have any involvemen t with subjects or pain 
assessments.  
In order to maintain the double-blind design of the study, on 
each treatment day (Days -1 to Day 3) all subjects will receive four tablets (either active study drug and/or placebo) for the first dose of the day  and one tablet  (either active study 
drug or placebo) for the second , third , and fourth  doses of the 
day. 
Study design  This study will be conducted as a Phase 2, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, inpatient study in subjects with acute postoperative pain (following bunionectomy surgery ). The study will compare each of the 
two active treatment groups receiving a total daily dose of 1600 mg ACP -044, administered either once daily or 400 mg 
every 6 hours, with a placebo group. The Sponsor, subjects, and Investigators will be blinded to treatment assignment. 
The study periods are: 
• Screening: up to 4 weeks  (prior to surgery) 
• Double- blind treatment: Day -1 (post first dose of 
study drug/day of surgery) to Day 4  
• Safety follow-up: approximately 7 days after end of 
treatment  (EOT)/early termination  (ET) and  
approximately 30 days (post last dose of study drug) 
Screening Period  
During the Screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. Only those subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study.  
All prohibited medications should be discontinued during the 
Screening period and prior to surgery. Investigators must not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of enrolling them into the study. Medications will be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically appropriate to do so and in consultation with the prescribing physician. 
With approval of the Medical Monitor, r escreening of a 
subject will be allowed one time if there is an extenuating 
circumstance that was not under the subject’s control or if is due to an identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, and there is no medical reason that would prevent the subject to be rescreened and enroll ed in the study.  
Treatment Period  
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 9 of 76 On the day of surgery  (Day -1), eligible subjects will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive  1600 mg 
ACP -044, administered either once daily or 400 mg every 
6 hours, or placebo, according to a randomization schedule. 
Randomization will be stratified by site.  
The first dose of study drug will be administered within 
60 (± 15) minutes prior to  the start of  surgery. S ubjects will 
then have a popliteal and/ or ankle nerve block administered to 
anesthetize the knee, distal leg, and foot, after which they will enter in to surgery. Following surgery, subjects will be 
administered the remaining three daily doses approximately every 6 hours after the initial dose .  
The popliteal and/or ankle nerve block will be discontinued approximately 2-4 hours prior to the first  dose on Day 1 
(i.e., the fifth  dose of the study) and nerve block removal; a 
discontinuation window of approximately 2 hours is permitted. The time at which the first dose on Day 1  is 
administered  will be time 0 for all pain  assessments. Study 
drug administration  and study procedures are to be completed 
on Days -1 through 4 according to the schedule of assessment s (Table  S-1). Subjects will be encouraged to 
refrain
 from taking rescue medication until 1-2 hours 
following the first dose of study drug on Day 1 (details provided in Section 4.8.1). 
On Day 4 ,
 after the 72 hour pain assessments are performed, 
the EOT procedures will be completed and subjects will be 
discharged from the clinical site.  
Safety Follow- up Period  
Safety will be further assessed during a follow-up visit to 
occur in the clinic approximately 7 (±3) days after EOT /ET 
procedures and s ubjects will receive a follow-up telephone 
call approximately 30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study 
drug. Subjects should return to standard of care after the follow-up visit that will occur in the clinic 7  (±3) days after 
the EOT/ET.  
The study schematic is presented in  Figure S–1. 
Study duration  The duration of participation for individual study subjects 
will be approximately 9 weeks, consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 4-day treatment period, and a 
safety follow-up period of approximately 30 (+4) days.

(predose, within one hour of dosing) , Day  1 (one sample 
taken between 2 -3 hours and one sample taken between 
4-6 hours, after the first dose of the day), Day 2 (prior to the first dose of the day), and Day 3 (one sample taken between 2-6 hours and one sample taken between 8-12 hours, after the first dose of the day). 
When possible, an additional PK sample will be collected from subject s who experience a serious adverse event (SAE) 
or an adverse event (AE) leading to discontinuation, as soon as possible after the occurrence of that event. For samples collected from subjects who experience an SAE or an AE leading to discontinuation, the date and time of the last dose prior to the SAE or AE should also be recorded. 
ACP -044 plasma concentration data will remain blinded until 
the unblinding of the clinical database at the end of the study.

Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 14 of 76 Sample size calculations  The planned sample size is 240 subjects randomized 
(80 subjects per treatment group). Randomization will be 
stratified by site.  
Assuming a treatment difference in the AUC from 0 to 
24 hours is 23 points between the ACP-044 groups and 
placebo group, and the common standard deviation is 50 points, 76 subjects per treatment arm will provide approximately 80% power to detect the assumed treatment difference between each ACP -044 dose arm and placebo at a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming no more than 5% of randomized patients will be ex cluded from primary 
efficacy analysis, 80 subjects per treatm ent group will be 
randomized . 
Statistical methods  Population Analysis Sets  
The Safety Analysis Set  includes all randomized subjects 
who received at least one dose of study drug (ACP-044 or placebo). Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that th ey actually received. The S afety Analysis Set will be 
used for all safety analyses.  
The Full Analysis Set  (FAS) includes all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of study drug and who have undergone bunionectomy with at least one postoperative pain assessment. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per -protocol (PP) Analysis Set  will consist of those 
subjects in the FAS  who did not have any protocol deviations 
that could potentially have a substantia l impact on the 
primary efficacy outcome. The precise reasons for excluding 
subjects from the PP Analysis Set will be fully defined and documented prior to the clinical database lock. Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment assignment. The PP Analysis Set will be used for supportive analyses of selected efficacy endpoints.  
For ACP -044 plasma concentration summaries, the 
Pharmacokinetics Analysis Set  will consist of subjects with 
at least one measurable ACP -044 plasma concentration. 
Subgroup Analysis 
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups and will be defined in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy variable, AUC 0-24, will be analyzed by 
using analysis of variance (ANOV A) with treatment group 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protoco l Amendment 5   Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 15 of 76 and site as factors in the model. Each active dose group  will 
be compared to placebo using this model.  
Details of the analysis procedure will be descri bed in the 
SAP.  
Key Secondary Analyses  
Time to first rescue medication use will be analyzed using log 
rank test  stratified by site . 
Proportion of patients who are opioid free through 24, 48, and 72 hours will be analyzed using stratified Cochran- Mantel -
Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site.  
Secondary Analyses  
Continuous secondary variables will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy variable. Proportion of patients who are pain free at each specific timepoint will be analy zed using 
stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling 
for study site. 
General Statistic al Approach  
Continuous measurement results will be reported using the number of subjects with data values, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median. For each categorical outcome, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be reported.  All 
statistical hypoth esis tests will be 2- sided at the significance 
level of 0.05. 
Multiple Comparisons / Multiplicity  
A fixed sequence method at alpha=0.05 for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be used to control for multiplicity. The sequence of endpoints for testing  is listed in 
Section  9.2.1. 
Safety Analyses  
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. No formal statistical testing will be performed for any of the safety endpoints. Adverse events will be classified into standard terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events, TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by maximum severity, fatal TEAEs, and SAEs  reported after 
study drug start will all be summarized. Other TEAEs of special interest (e.g., ORAEs ) may also be summarized.

Additionally, categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for ACP -044 will be listed and 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Results will be used for other analyses (e.g., population PK modell ing), which will 
be presented in a separate report.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analyses  
A population PK/PD model to describe the exposure response relationship between ACP -044 plasma concentrations and the 
relevant efficacy and safety endpoints will be developed using appropriate PK/PD methods. Results will be presented in a separate report.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol, the International Council for Harmonis ation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) Guideline, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
1.1 Background Information 
Acute postoperative pain has limited treatment options, each  with their own benefits  and 
shortcomings. The mainstays of acute pain treatment are opioids. While they provide efficacy 
to the patients that take them, there are significant risks of constipation, tolerance and dependence, respiratory depression, abuse, diversion and potentially addiction. Postoperative pain following surgery is expected to be moderate to severe and often requires opioids for 
analgesia that thereby improve the quality of the recovery period. Many operative procedures 
result in pain that f ollows a predictable course and is typically short in duration. More than 
thirteen million ambulatory surgeries were performed in hospital- owned facilities in the 
United States in 2016 ( Karaca and  McDermott  2019).  
Following the procedure, patients are 
typically given opioids to tr
eat their pain and promote recovery. While opioids are often 
effective in this setting, many physicians have concerns about the potential for subsequent opioid medication misuse, addiction, and diversion. With an ongoing opioid epidemic in the United States that is leading to an average of 128 overdose deaths each day ( Wilson et al. 
2020),  and prescription opioid misuse costing $78.5 billion per year, new nonaddictive pain 
therapies are crit ically needed ( Florence et al. 201 6). There is a growing medical need for 
non-opioid pain management options. Therefore, Acadia is developing ACP-044, a 
peripherally -acting molecule  with demonstrated efficacy in a wide array of nonclinical 
models of pain to prevent and treat acute postsurgical pain. 
1.2 Investigational Produc
t 
ACP -044, is a non- metal based, orally bi oavailable, small molecule Reactive Species 
Decomposition Accelerant (RSDAx) that works by promoting degradation of peroxynitrite 
(PN) and peroxide. Peroxynitrite and peroxide are powerful oxidants produced under conditions of injury (e.g., surgical incision) and disease (e.g., diabetes) that cause untoward effects via protein nitration and modification of sensory ion channels leading to neuronal 
sensitization and pain ( McConnell et al. 2003; Lee et al
. 1998a ; Lee et al.  1998b; 
Chaplan  et al. 1994
; Hargreaves et al. 1988; Fehrenbacher et al. 2012 ; Sluka and Willis 1997; 
Brennan et al. 1996) . By removing PN, ACP-044 prevents or disrupts the ensuing pathways 
causing hypersensitivity thereby preventing the development of hyperalgesia or reversing existing hyperalgesia.

In vivo, ACP -044 is efficacious in pre- clinical models of acute post -incisional hyperalgesia, 
both prophylactically and palliatively. This suggests that ACP-044 may be of use in 
peri-operative settings as a replacement or to  reduce the amount of opioid products 
(i.e., Percocet, Vicodin) often prescribed following minimally invasive surgical procedures. 
1.4 Previous Clinical Experience  
1.4.1 Clinical Pharmacology 
Three Phase 1 studies have been clinically completed to date in healthy subjects up to 
55 years of age. A total of 54 subjects have received ACP-044 (single oral doses up to 
2000 mg) and 14 subjects received placebo.  In the single ascending dose study, 32 subjects 
were enrolled in four dose cohorts (150, 450, 1100, and 2000 mg ACP-044; subjects were randomized to six  active and two placebo for each dose cohort). In the food effect study, 
12 subjects received two  single oral doses of 600 mg ACP -044 according to fed or fasting 
conditions. In the multiple ascending dose study, 24 subjects w ere enrolled in three dose 
cohorts (200, 400, and 600 mg dosed orally three times each day for 7 days ; subjects were 
randomized to 6 active and 2 placebo for each dose cohort). The s ingle and multiple 
ACP -044 doses were safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.  
ACP -044 exhibits linear kinetics with no time - or dose-dependent effect on pharmacok inetic 
(PK) parameters. Systemic exposure to ACP -044 was dose-proportional across the studied 
dose range. Minimal to no accumulation was observed following multiple-dose administration, and as such the single-dose PK profile is considered representative of the 
steady -state profile.  The PK profile of ACP-044 following oral administration is best 
described by a one- compartment model with first-order absorption and fir st-order 
elimination. Following oral administration, ACP -044 is rapidly absorbed with a median time 
to maximum drug concentration (T
max) of approximately  1-2 hours. Ingestion of a high- fat 
meal had a small effect on the rate of absorption (approximately  23% reduction in maximum 
observed drug concentration (C max) and 1 hour delay in T max) and had no effect on the extent 
(area under the curve [ AUC ]) of ACP -044 absorption. Since the relative extent of absorption 
was unaffected by the presence of a hi gh fat meal, it is anticipated that the slight reduction in 
Cmax and prolongation of T max will be of no clinical significance.  
In vitro, ACP -044 has shown moderate protein binding in human plasma. At concentrations 
of 10 µM, binding was 88%. 
Consistent with the nonclinical data, ACP-044 volume of distribution in studied subjects was 
<30 L, which suggests that ACP -044 does not reach beyond the extracellular fluid with 
limited to no distribution into tissues (intracellularly).  
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 30 of 76 ACP -044 is primari ly metabolized and the major metabolite is sulfate conjugate  and to a 
lesser extent is glucuronide conjugate. Consistent with preclinical data, following oral 
administration in healthy subjects, a pproximately 35% of ACP -044 was excreted unchanged 
in urine indicating that hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute to ACP-044 
elimination. Following oral administration in healthy subjects, decline from peak is mono-exponential and is characterized by a rapid  elimination phase with rapid clearance 
(mean CL/F =6.04 to 11.3 L/h) and a short  half-life ( mean t
½=1.6 to 3.2 hours).   
According to nonclinical assessments ACP-044 did not directly inhibit (IC 50 values >100

benefit/risk assessment and the most accurate and current information regarding nonclinical data,  drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety.  
1.5 Study Rationale 
ACP -044 has demonstrated efficacy in  acute 
 and chronic nociceptive models in rodents and 
has been shown to be safe and well tolerated in single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteer subjects. The present study is a proof of concept study to evaluate the efficacy of ACP -044 as an analgesic for the treatment of acute postoperative pain  and to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic profile. The postoperative 
bunionectomy model is a widely used human orthopedic model in the development of analgesic drugs ( Desjardin
s et al.  2002; Daniels et al. 2009; Pollak et al. 2018) . 
1.5.1 Rationale for Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled inpatient study in subjects with acute postoperative pain following bunionectom y. The study will assess the efficacy of 
ACP -044 by compar ing the same maximum dos e of ACP -044, 1600 mg administered either 
as a single dose or as 400 mg administered every six  hours. Guided by nonclinical animal 
models where ACP -044 provided robust analgesic effects  when  given prior to incision as a 
single dose or w hen administered daily at 24 , 48, and 72 h post- incision , dosing in the present 
study will begin prior to surgery and will continue for 3 days after surgery .

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 31 of 76 1.5.2 Rationale for Dos e Selection  
In a nonclinical animal m odel, a single oral  dose of ACP -044 prevented the development of 
incisional hyperalgesia for at least 3 days, with the highest dose tested (30 mg/kg) producing 
essentially complete prevention of hyperalgesia. Similarly, daily doses of ACP -044 given 
postincision provided continuous relief from an ongoing hyperalgesic insult in a 
dose-dependent manner . It is not clear , however, whether the response is driven by C max or 
AUC . In the present proof of concept study, the maximum tolerated dose of ACP-044 is 
being evaluated by testing  two dosing regimens (i.e., once-daily or every 6 hours) to allow 
the selection of the optimal dosing regimen and better characterization of  the 
exposure-response relationship.  
1.6 Potential Risks and Benefits  
Nonclinical studies in animal models of acute and chronic nociception have demonstrated 
efficacy  (i.e., analgesia)  with ACP -044 and that it is safe and well tolerated. This study will 
help identify whether ACP-044 is efficacious as an  analgesic treatment in humans as it is the 
first clinical eff icacy study to date. If the study shows treatment with ACP -044 is effective, 
this could lead to further clinical development of this treatment for pain. 
A detailed summary of the potential risks and benefits is available in the ACP -044 
Investigator’s brochure. 
1.6.1 Known Potential Risks  
In the Phase 1 clinical studies in healthy volunteers, the side effects that occurred in more 
than 1 subject treated with ACP-044 were indigestion and headache.  
In the nonclinical studies, side effects seen in animals that were given ACP -044 were 
vomiting, stomach acid reflux, loose stools, and changes in some organ weights. Although 
these side effects have not been seen in human studies, they may be potential risks. 
There may be unforeseeable risks or side effects that are related to the study drug and that are 
unknown at this time. The study drug, when taken alone or in combination with other 
medications, may have risks that are unknown. Rare or unknown side effects may occur. It is not possible to predict the chances of such problems or how bad they could be. 
All drugs have a potential risk of an allergic reaction which, if not treated promptly, could 
become life threatening. Some symptoms of allergic reaction are: rash, difficulty breathing, 
wheezing, swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes, a fast pulse, and sweati ng. Each 
research center is expected to have qualified staff, equipment, and drugs to be able to manage an acute allergic reaction.

and approximately 240 subjects are planned for enrollment (80 subjects per treatment group). 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 35 of 76 The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be approximately 9 weeks, 
consisting of a screening period of up to 4 weeks, a 4-day treatment period, and a safety 
follow-up period of approximately 30 (+4) days. 
The study periods are: 
• Screening: up to 4 weeks  (prior to surgery) 
• Double- blind treatment: Day -1 (post first dose of study drug/day of surgery) to Day 4 
• Safety follow-up: approximately 7 days after end of treatment (EOT)/early termination 
(ET) and approximately 30 days ( post last d ose of study drug) 
The study start date is defined as the date the first subject signs the informed consent form . 
The study completion date is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes 
their final protocol- defined assessment. Please note: this includes the safety follow-up visit or 
contact) . Procedures for when a subject is lost to follow-up are provided in Section 4.6. 
The study schematic is presented in  Figure S–1 and  the schedule of assessm ents is provided 
in Table  S-1.  
3.1.1 S
creening  Period  (Up to 4 Weeks ) 
During the Screening period, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility. Only those 
subjects who meet all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will be eligible for the study. 
All pr ohibited medications should be discontinued during the Screening period and prior to 
surgery. Investigators must not withdraw a subject’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study. Medications will be discontinued only if it is deemed clinically 
appropriate to do so and in consultation with the prescribing physician. 
With approval of the Medical Monitor, r escreening of a subject will be allowed one time if 
there is an extenuating circumstance that was not under the subject’s con trol or if  it is due  to 
an identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, and there is no 
medical reason that would prevent the subject to be rescreened  and enroll ed in the study.  
3.1.2 Treatment  Period  (Day -1 to Day 4) 
On the day of surgery (Day -1), eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1600 mg ACP -044, administered either once daily or 400 mg every 6 hours, or 
placebo, according to a randomization schedule. Randomization will be stratified by site. 
The first dose of study drug will be administered within  60 (±15) minutes  prior to the start of 
surgery. S ubjects will then have a popliteal and/or ankle nerve block administered to 
anesthetize the knee, distal leg, and foot, after which they will enter into surgery. Following 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 36 of 76 surgery, subjects will be administered the remaining three daily doses approximately every 
6 hours after the initial dose.  
The popl iteal and/or ankle nerve block will be discontinued approximately 2-4 hours prior to 
the first  dose on Day 1 (i.e., the fifth  dose of the study) and  nerve block removal ; a 
discontinuation window of approximately 2 hours is permitted . The time at which the first  
dose on Day 1 is administered  will be time 0 for all pain assessments. Study drug 
administration and study procedures are to be completed on Days -1 through 4 according to 
the schedule of assessments ( Table S –1). Subjects will be encouraged to refrain from taking 
rescue medication until 1-2 hours following the first dose of study drug on Day 1 ( details  
provided in Section 4.8.1). 
On Day 4 , after the 72 hour pain assessment s are performed , the EOT procedures will be 
completed and  subjects will be discharged from the clinical site.  
See Section  4.5 for subjects who discontinue early from the study. 
3.1.3 Safety Follow- up Period  (30 Days) 
Safety will be further assessed during a follow-up visit to occur in the clinic approximately 
7 (±3) days after EOT /ET procedures  and s ubjects will receive a follow-up telephone call 
approximately 30 (+ 4) days after the last dose of study drug. Subjects should return to 
standard of care after the follow- up visit that will occur in the clinic 7 (±3) days after the 
EOT/ET . 
The study schematic is presented in  Figure S–1.

4.5.1 Discontinuation of Study Drug for Individual Subjects  
The Investigator and Medical Monitor will review all laboratory, ECG, and related safety 
data regularly throughout the study for all individual subjects in order to determine whether 
any individual subject may continue to safely participate in the study. In general, either the Investigator or the Medical Monitor may discontinue the subject from the study at any time when any specific laboratory or ECG data change from Baseline indicates that the subject is 
placed at increased risk from continued participation in the study. 
In rare instances, it may be nec essary for a subject to permanently discontinue study drug. 
Study drug stopping criteria are described below. If a subject experiences any of the below 
events, it must be documented as an AE. 
4.5.1.1 Cardiovascular- Related Stopping Criteria  
If a clinically significant finding  of change in blood pressure, bradycardia, or change in 
QTcF, as defined below, is identified after enrollment, the Investigator or qualified designee 
or Medical Monitor will determine if the subject can continue in the study and if any change 
in subject  management is needed.  
• Clinically significant hypotension defined as  systolic blood pressure (SBP)  <85 mmHg  
and changes in blood pressure  with decrease in SBP ≥20 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) 
≥10 mmHg  
• Significant bradycardia, defined as heart rate of ≤45 beats per minute (BPM) on an 
ECG, or pulse decrease of ≥25% from Baseline with resulting heart rate <60 BPM  
• QTcF result >4 80 ms or QTcF increases ≥60 ms from Baseline

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 of 76 4.5.2 Handling of Subject  Discontinuation During the Treatment Period  
Unless the subject has withdrawn consent from all components of the study, every reasonable 
effort should be made to complete Day 4 /EOT/ET  and all  safety follow-up assessments 
(as outlined in Table S –1) for all subject s who  discontinue prematurely during the treatment 
period of the study. All information will be reported on the applicable pa ges of the electronic 
case report form (eCRF).  
If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt should 
be made to follow and appropriately treat (or refer for treatment) the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to be chronic or stable. For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, SAEs  should continue to be reported as described in 
Section 7.4.2. All SAEs will continue to be followed and appropriately treated until such 
events have resolved or the Investigator deems them to be chronic or stable. 
4.6 Subject Lost to Follow -up 
A subject wi ll be considered lost to follow-up if they fail to attend a scheduled visit 
(including the safety follow-up clinic visit [ 7 days after EOT ]) and are unable to be contacted 
by the study site.  Every reasonable effort should be made to contact the subject an d will include a minimum of 
three documented phone calls  and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject’s  last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods. All contact attempts are to  be documented in the 
source documents. 4.7 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medications used from study screening until completion of the safety follow-up telephone 
call contact a re to be recorded. 
4.7.1 Prior Medication  
Prior medication is defined as any medication with stop dates prior to the date of the first 
dose of study drug. 
4.7.2 Concomitant Medication 
Concomitant medication is defined as any medications taken after the date of the first dose of 
study drug through to the follow-up telephone call.  
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment for a medical emergency).

• opioids, NSAIDs  and, importantly , drugs that are used to treat chronic pain (e.g., 
gabapentin, pregabalin, carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants, and duloxetine) 
• systemic corticosteroids  
• immune suppressant drugs 
4.8 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and restrictions for concomitant medications should be followed between the 
initial screening  visit and the safety follow- up clinic visit that occurs 7 days after EOT/ET  as 
specified in Appendix B . 
Permitted concomitant medications should remain at a stable dose throughout the study. 
Ondansetron may  be used at the discretion of the I nvestigator to treat moderate or severe 
nausea and vomiting.  
Subjects who require current treatment with a prohibited medication will be withdrawn from 
the study. 
Subjects who have taken a prohibited medication during the study will be withdrawn from 
the study unless: 
• the prohibited medication has been discontinued, AND  
• withdrawal from the study presents an unacceptable medical risk to the subject  
The justification to allow the subject who has taken a prohibited medication to continue in 
the trial will be made by the Sponsor /Medical Monitor,  with medical input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented. If a subject is allowed to remain in the trial, this will be 
reported as a major protocol deviation and not a waiver. 
4.8.1 Rescue Medications, Treatments, and Procedures  
Subjects will be encouraged to refrain from taking rescue medication  until 1-2 hours after 
removal  of the nerve block. The allowed rescue medication in the present study is 400 mg of 
ibuprofen every 4  to 6 hours as needed for pain. The total daily dose of ibuprofen should not 
exceed 3200 mg  (8 tablets).  If ibuprofen does not provide the necessary pain relief, subjects 
may take hydrocodone/acetaminophen 5 mg/325 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed for pain. 
The total daily dose of acetaminophen should not exceed 3250 mg (10 tablets).

subject may  be unblinded to a controlled group of the Sponsor ’s Safety and /or Regulatory 
personnel for reporting purposes; the site personnel, Investigators, and monitors will remain blinded in this situation .  
Details regarding medical emergency unblinding procedures are provided in Section 9.8. 
5.1.6 Study Drug Compliance  
Study drug dosing will be observed by the clinical site staff.  If a subject misses a dose, they 
should not take an extra dose. Missed doses will be documented as protocol deviations. 5.1.7 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported, irrespective of outcome, 
even if toxic effects were n ot observed ( Section 7.4.4). All events of overdose are to be 
captured as protocol deviations. 
5.2 Investigational Product and Rescue Medication Accountability Procedures  
An unblinded pharmacist will keep current and accurate records of the study drug product 
used and returned for each subject to assure the regulatory authority and the Sponsor that the 
study drug is being handled appropriately. Any study drug supplied is for use in this study only and should not be used for any other purpose. An unblinded clinical research associate 
(CRA)  will be responsible for monitoring product accountability procedures and tablet counts 
by the site staff . 
Site staff will keep current records of rescue medicatio n dispensed, used, and returned for 
each subject to assure the regulatory authority and the Sponsor that the study drug is being handled appropriately.  
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site. Final stu dy drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at the 
Sponsor. Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent back to the Sponsor’s designee for destruction. Documentation of study drug destruct ion will 
be recorded and maintained by both the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s designee. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES  
Study specific procedures are detailed below. All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in  Table S –1. Every effort should be made to complete the required 
procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times. 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 47 of 76 6.1 Remote Assessments or Vi sits 
Circumstances may arise (e.g., pandemic, natural disaster, or political upheaval) when the 
follow-up safety  assessment  at the clinic may not be possible. In those cases, the follow-up 
assessments may be performed at a location other than the research site either in person, or 
via video technology or telephone where possible. The Investigator must contact the Medical 
Monitor for approval with the plan. Sites must keep a log to identify details of all visits that 
are performed  remotely.  The location of the collected assessments should be captured in the 
source documents. 
6.2 Screening  Assessments 
All screening assessments  must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The I nvestigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
6.2.1 Medical and Medication History  
A complete medical  and surgical  history will be obtained from each potential subject at the 
Screening visit. Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well.  
Any new medical condition reported with a start date after the informed consent form (ICF) 
has been signed will be captured as an AE. Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or 
medical records to substantiate the medication history . 
Any medicati on reported as taken on or after Day - 1 will be captured as concomitant 
medication . 
6.3 Block Quality Assessment  
Postoperatively, assessment s of the popliteal block depth (Block Quality Assessment) will be 
performed and recorded hourly (±15 minutes) at the top  of each hour until 2200 hours. 
Between the hours of 2200 and 0600 hours, Block Quality Assessments will continue to be performed hourly (±15 minutes) if subject is awake, but , even if asleep, the subject will be 
awakened to perform a Block Quality Assessment at 0300 hours (±15 minutes ). Block 
Quality Assessments will continue  until the block is removed .

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 48 of 76 6.4 Efficacy Assessments  
6.4.1 Numeric Rating Scale of Pain Intensity  
A 0 to 10 NRS w ill be used to assess the subject’s pain at the time of popliteal and/or ankle 
nerve block removal , for the subsequent 72 hours, and for the 7 days after EOT. Subjects will 
be asked:  
“Please describe your foot pain at the present time from 0 to 10 where “0 ” 
mean s “no pain at all” and “10” mean s “the worst pain imaginable”. 
Trained study coordinators will present the NRS scale and all other questionnaires at the 
designated times.  
Pain (efficacy) assessments are to be recorded hourly (±15 minutes) for a 12-hour interval on 
Day 1  beginning immediately prior to  the fifth dose (time 0) administered in the study. Pain 
assessments will continue every  3 hours during the subsequent 12 hour interval, and then 
every 6 hours thereafter until 72 hours, then once daily in the morning until the follow-up 
clinical visit. Pain  assessments should also be obtained immediately prior to the 
administration of rescue medication.  
Subjects should not  have ice administered  to the surgical area within the 30 minutes prior to 
each pain assessment.  Pain assessments should be performed before blood sample collection, 
ECG, and other procedures. 
Subjects will be provided a diary upon discharge to document their pain from EOT to the follow-up clinic visit that occurs 7 days after EOT.  
6.4.2 Global Evaluation of Study Drug  
For the global evaluation of study drug subjects will be asked to provide a graded  response 
(4=excellent, 3=very good, 2=good, 1=fair, or 0=poor) to the statement “How would you rate 
the study drug you received to delay or reduce your foot pain?” The time at which the statement is completed will be recorded.  
Evaluation of study drug will be completed  just before receiving the first dose of rescue 
medication , and  at the end of 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours relative to time 0 (when the 
first dose on Day 1 is administered). The evaluation of study drug should be performed before blood sample collection, ECG, and other procedures. 
6.4.3 Foot and Ankle Ability Measure  
The FAAM is a validated , self -r
 eported evaluative instrument specific to those with leg, 
ankle, and foot musculoskeletal disorders ( Marti
n et al. 2005).  The questionnaire co nsists o f 
21 movements the subject rates as “no difficulty at all”, “slight difficulty”, “moderate

of function during usual activities of daily living , graded on a scale of 0 to 100 with 
100 being at the level of function prior to the foot and ankle problem and 0 being the inability 
to perform any of their usual daily activities.  
The FAAM will be completed prior to the subject receiving their first dose on Day -1 and at the follow-up visit conducted 7 days after the EOT procedures. 
6.5 Safety Assessments 
6.5.1 Physical Examination 
A complete, general physical examination will be conducted at Screening and a brief physical 
exam, including mental status exam, will be conduct ed on Day -1 and Day 4/ EOT/ET.  Height 
will only be measured and reported at Screening and weight will be measured and recorded at 
Screening  and Day -1 predose. An exam of the operative site will also be performed on Day 4  
(EOT/ET) prior to discharge and at the follow-up visit 7  (±3) days after the EOT procedures 
are completed.  Both exams must include visual inspection of the operative site. 
The full examination should include a review of body systems and should include a neurological examination (e.g., level of consciousness, speech, cranial nerves [including pupil equality and reactivity], motor assessment, sensory assessment, coordination, gait, reflexes, and Romberg test). Height and weight will be measured and reported as described  
above. 
The brief physical exam will include the following: evaluation of general appearance, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. A general physical examination will 
be conducted. 
6.5.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include body temperature, resting respiration rate, sitting systolic a nd 
diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. The sitting blood pressure should be measured after 
the subject has been sitting for ≥ 3 minutes.  
Vital signs will be evaluated at Screening , Day - 1 predose , and on Day 1 every 2 hours for 
the first 6  hours after the initial dose. Vital signs will then be evaluated every 6 hours 
thereafter until Day 4/ EOT/ET . A 15 -minute window is permitted for vital sign 
measurements.  
Vital signs should be measured prior to ( PK and laboratory) blood draws.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 50 of 76 6.5.3 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings. A s ingle 
12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening, Day -1 predose, on Days 1 through 3 at 1 hour 
postdose (the first dose of the day ), and Day 4 /EOT/ET. A 1 -hour window is permitted  for the 
predose ECG; a 20-minute window is permitted  for the postdose ECG. ECGs should be 
performed prior to blood sampling and vital signs but after pain assessments are completed . 
Electrocardiograms should be performed before blood sampling or at least 30 minutes after blood sampling. The subject must rest in a supine position for 5 minutes  before the ECG is 
obtained. ECG tracings (paper or electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF, and QTcB 
intervals) will be included in the subject's study records. 
At Screening, if the ECGs has a prolonged QTcF due to an identifiable cause, and it is 
medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat ECG may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical Monitor. 
On Day -1, a subject may be enrolled based on the review and interpretation of the ECG by a 
qualified physician. If the interpretation of the ECG indicates a QTcF outside of the allowable 
range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but this will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
6.5.4 Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS monitors changes in suicidal thinking and behavior over time, in order to 
deter
mine risk ( Posner e
t al. 2011).  The following four constructs are measured: the severity 
of idea
tion, the intensity of ideation, behavior, and lethality.  
The Baseli
ne/Screening version will be administered at Screening, and the Since Last Visit 
version will be administered at all subsequent visits. The C- SSRS results for each subject 
should be reviewed by the Investigator after completion. If at any time the C -SSRS results for 
a given subject reveal potential suicidality, then the Investigator should assess the clinical 
significance of such results. If a clinically significant risk of suicidality  is identified for a 
subject, then the Investigator should discontinue the subject and implement appropriate treatment ( Section  4.5).  
6.5.5 Laboratory Evaluations 
Clinical laboratory sample collection (including HbA1c at S creening  only) is  encouraged, but 
not required to be completed under fasting conditions. The laboratory eval uations will 
include, but are not limited to, the following:

Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations 
of ACP -044. ACP -044 plasma concentration data will remain blinded until the unblinding of 
the clinical database at the end of the study.  
PK blood samples will be collected Day - 1 (predose, within one hour of dosing), Day  1 
(one sample taken between 2 -3 hours and one sample taken between 4-6 hours, after the first 
dose of the day), Day 2 (prior to the first dose of the day), and Day 3 (one sample taken 
between 2 -6 hours and one sample taken between 8 -12 hours, after the first dose of the day). 
A 15 -minute window is permitted around each nominal timepoint on Day 1 and beyond. 
Pharmacokinetic samples will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit or the visit 
immediately following any SAE or following any AE leading to discontinuation, even if it is 
an unscheduled visit. 
6.6.1 Blood Sampling  
Six (6) approxi mately 4 mL venous blood samples will be collected from each subject for 
measurement of  plasma ACP -044 concentrations. 
In addition, a blood sample (approximately 4 mL sample) for determination of concentrations 
of ACP -044 will be collected in the ev ent of an SAE or an AE leading to discontinuation. 
6.6.2 Specimen Preparation, Handling, Stor age, and Shipment  
PK blood samples may be collected from a cannula port or via venipuncture. Pre- prepared 
PK sampling tubes will be provided to each site within the lab visit kits for collection and storage of PK samples. At each time point, blood will be collected, processed as appropriate, 
and samples will be shipped to the central laboratory for storage and to the bioanalytical laboratory for analysis. 
For samples coll ected from subjects who experience any SAE or experience an AE leading to 
discontinuation, the date and time of the last dose of study drug prior to the SAE or AE 
leading to discontinuation will also be recorded. 
A laboratory manual will be provided for sample processing, storage, and shipping 
procedures. 
6.7 Safety Follow- up 
Safety will be further assessed during the follow-up period regardless of whether a subject 
completes the study or withdraws (or when they withdraw; see also Section 4.4 for 
limitations in case of withdrawal of consent) . The assessments to be conducted are outlined 
below and in Table S –1. 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 54 of 76 The first  evaluation  is a follow-up visit that will be conducted  at the clinic approximately 
7 (±3) days after EOT  visit. The assessments to be conducted at this visit include: 
• Examination of the operative site , which must include visual inspection (at the 
follow-up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• FAAM  (at the follow -up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• Collect diary  (at the follow -up visit 7 days after EOT) 
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs  
The second evaluation is a follow- up telephone call to occur approximately 30 (+4) days after 
the last dose of study drug. The subject will be asked about the following during the 
telephone call:  
• Concomitant medications  
• AEs  
6.8 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator. The following safety 
assessments generally should be recorded at each uns cheduled visit : assessment of AEs, 
concomitant medications/treatments, and measurement of vital signs . The Investigator may 
perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by the Investigator to be clinically 
indicated.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to study drug”. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulatio n, or dose, including an overdose. 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 55 of 76 A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
drug caused the AE. 
AEs do not include the following: 
• Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglas ses) that are 
present prior to Baseline and do not worsen during the study 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion). The condition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at the 
time of informed c onsent, or scheduled surgery/procedure. 
• Overdose of concomitant  medication without any signs or symptoms. If subject is 
hospitalized or has other serious criteria, the overdose shall be reported on the Sponsor’s Overdose Reporting form 
• Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an 
untoward medical occurrence has not occurred)  
• Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a pregnancy form  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to t he severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious.” The seriousness of an event will be  defined according to the applicable 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event. An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following: 
• Is fatal  
• Is life threatening  
• Results in disability or permanent damage  
• Requires hospitalization  (initial or prolonged) 
• Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect 
• Other serious event  (medically significant/important medical event)  
Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject  at immediate
 risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE, which, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused deat h.

 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 56 of 76 Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined by the Sponsor as a full  admission to the hospital for diagnosis and 
treatment . This includes prolongation of an existing inpatient  hospitalization . 
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not  meet the serious criteria for 
hospitalization include: 
• Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission ) 
• Outp atient surgery  
• Preplanned or elective procedures  
• Protocol procedures 
• Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject’s primary residence  
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage 
Disability is defined as a  persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator or M edical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event 
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be assessed as described belo w and reported in detail as 
indicated on the eCRF: 
• Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities 
• Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyd ay activities  
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 57 of 76 • Severe: incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities 
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related” or 
“not related.” An event is considered related  if the re is a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by the product under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence, or 
arguments to suggest possible causation). 
Consider the following when assessing causality: 
• Temporal associations between the agent and the event 
• Response to drug cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
• Compatibility with known class effect 
• Known effects of concomitant medications 
• Pre-existing risk factors 
• A plausible mechanism  
• Concurrent illnesses 
• Past medical history 
7.2.3 Duration 
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria: 
• Start : Date of the first episode of the AE or date of worsening in severity 
• Stop: Date when AE ceased  permanently , worsened in severity,  or resolved with or 
without sequelae  
7.2.4 Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be indicated according to the following definitions: 
• Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
• Recurrent : More than one discrete episode with the same severity  
7.2.5 Action Taken with Study Drug  
• Dose not changed : No change in study drug 
• Drug interrupted : Study drug temporarily stopped 
• Drug withdrawn : Study drug discontinued permanently

• Unknown  
7.2.6 Therapy  
• None : No new treatment instituted  
• Medication : New treatment initiated  as a direct resu lt of AE  
• Other: Other action required  
7.2.7 Outcome 
• Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae: Recovered  or resolved with sequelae  
• Not recovered/not resolved : Not recovered or not resolved 
• Fatal : Death due to an AE 
• Unknown: Unknown 
7.2.8 Seriousness  
• Not serious  
• Serious  (see Section 7.1.2)  
7.2.9 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information  provided in the 
Reference Safety Info rmation section of the current ACP -044 Investigator’s brochure. 
7.3 Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
Adverse events will be recorded from the time informed consent is  obtained through the 
study safety follow-up period. If an AE is ongoing at the end of the study safety follow-up 
period, every reasonable attempt should be made to follow and appropriately treat  the subject 
until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to be chronic or stable. 
In the event that a subject discontinues and has an ongoing AE at the time of discontinuation 
(Section  4.5.2) or is w ithdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject should be 
followed and appropriately treated until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the 
AE to be chronic or stable.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 59 of 76 7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must re cord all observed AEs and all reported AEs . At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anything 
different since your last visit?”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienc ed since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that may need to be recorded on both the AE and the concomitant medication page.  
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator. 
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms 
(e.g., “cold” or “seasonal allergies” instead of “runny nose”).  
All AEs, whether or not related to the study drug, must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eCRF and in the subject’s notes. 
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by the Sponsor or designee to the regulatory authorities is a regulatory 
requirement . Each regulatory authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs ba sed 
upon established criteria. 
Serious AEs must be reported within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee ; use 
the appropriate form for initial and/or follow-up reporting. At a minimum, events identified by the Sponsor to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related  to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible 
institutional r eview board/e thics c ommittee ( IRB/ EC), as per applicable regulations. These 
will be provided by the Sponsor after their assessment. For European Union member states, the Sponsor or its designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions  (SUSARs ) directly to the ECs, as required by local legislation. In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the 
responsible IRB/ EC. It is also the Investigator ’s responsibility  to notify the responsible 
IRB/ EC regarding any new and significant safety information.  
When an SAE occurs, Investigators will review all documentation related to the event and 
will complete the paper SAE form with all required information (for initial and/or follow -up 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 60 of 76 information) and fax or email (within 24 hours of discovery) to the contact information 
provided on the SAE form.  
Subjects will be followed through the safety follow-up period (i.e., 30 [+4] days after last dose of study drug) for any SAEs and/or other reportable information until such events have resolved or the Investigator deems them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study subject will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF. All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or de signee as soon as is feasible 
following the report of the SAE. 
Serious AEs occurring after the safety follow -up period (i.e., 30 [+4] days after last dose of 
study drug)  should be reported if in the judgment of the Investigator there is “a reasonable 
possibility” that the event may have been caused by the product. SAEs should also be reported to the IRB /EC according to local regulations. 
7.4.3 Reporting of Pregnancy 
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the Pregnancy form within 24 hours of discovery to the Sponsor or its designee. Any female subject  who becomes 
pregnant during the study will be followed through the pregnancy outcome. 
If pregnancy occurs during the study, the pregnant subject should be unblinded so that 
counseling may be offered based on whether the fetus was exposed to the active drug or placebo.  
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious should also be reported via the SAE form. 
7.4.3.1 Reporting Paternal Drug Exposure 
Paternal drug exposure is defined as a father’s exposure to a medicinal product before or 
during his partner’s pregnancy. Any paternal drug exposure cases must be reported to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the Pregnancy form. Any AEs that are the consequence of paternal drug exposure and which meet the criteria for serious must also be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery via the SAE form . 
7.4.4 Reporting of Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than the maximum recommended dose per protocol. It must be reported to the Sponsor or 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 61 of 76 designee on the Sponsor Overdose Reporting form within 24 hours of discovery. In addition, 
all events of overdose are to be captured as protocol deviations (see Section 5.1.7). 
8 CLINICAL  MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section  11. 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well-being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and 
amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements . Details 
of the study site monitoring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan document. 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS AND DATA ANALYSIS  
9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans 
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan (SAP) to be 
approved by the Sponsor prior to database lock . Deviations from the approved SAP will be 
described and justified in the final clinical study report. 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The primary endpoint is AUC
0-24 based on the pain intensity scores from 0 to 24 hours 
assessed using NRS.  
Let Δ auc_1 and Δ auc_ 2 be the difference between each of the two  ACP -044 dose groups and 
placebo group in the mean AUC 0-24, respectively.  
The null hypotheses are: Δ auc_i = 0 and the alternative hypothesis is: Δ auc_i ≠ 0, i=1,2 
9.2.1 Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
A fixed-sequence method at alpha=0.05 for the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be used to control for mult iplicity . The following will be the  sequence for testing:  
1. 400 mg Q6H compared to placebo on mean AUC 0-24 of NRS of pain intensity scores 
2. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on mean AUC 0-24 of NRS of pain intensity scores 
3. 400 mg Q6H compared to placebo on time to first rescue medication use after time 0  
4. 400 mg Q6H compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free 
through 24 hours 
5. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on time to first rescue medication use after time 0 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 62 of 76 6. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free 
through 24 hours 
7. 400 mg Q6H compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free through 48 hours 
8. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free through 48 hours 
9. 400 mg Q6H compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free through 72 hours 
10. 1600 mg QD compared to placebo on proportion of subjects who were opioid free through 72 hours 
The testing procedure will stop once a p-value in the sequence is greater than 0.05. P-values that 
are less than or equal to 0.05 prior to stopping, will be declared statistically significant; p-values 
after stopping will be nominal.  
9.3 Sample Size Determination  
The planned sample size is 240 subjects randomized (80 subjects per treatment group). 
Randomization will be stratified by site.  
Assuming a treatment difference in the AUC from 0 to 24 hours is 23 points between the ACP -044 groups and placebo group, and the common standard deviation is 50 points, 
76 subjects per treatment arm will provide ap proximately 80% power to detect the assumed 
treatment difference between each ACP -044 dose arm and placebo at a 2-sided significance 
level of 0.05. Assuming no more than 5% of randomized patients will be excluded from primary efficacy analysis, 80 subjects per treatment group will be randomized. 
9.4 Subject Populations  for Analysis 
The Safety Analysis Set  includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug (ACP-044 or placebo). Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that they 
actually received. The Safety Analysis Set will be used for all safety analyses.  
The Full Analysis Set  includes all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of 
study drug and who have undergone bunionectomy with at least one postoperative pain 
assessment. The Full Analysis Set will be used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per -protocol (PP) Analysis Set  will consist of those subjects in the FAS  who did not 
have any protocol deviations that could potentially have a substantial impact on the primary 
efficacy outcome. The precise reasons for excluding subjects from the PP Analysis Set will be fully defined and documented prior to the clinical database lock. Subjects will be analyzed 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 63 of 76 based on their randomized treatment assignment. The PP Analysis Set will be used for 
supportive analyses of selected efficacy endpoints. 
For ACP -044 plasma concentration summaries, the Pharmacokinetics Analysis Set  will 
consist of subjects with at least one measurable ACP -044 plasma concentration. 
9.5 Statistical  Analyses 
9.5.1 General Statistical Approach  
Continuous measurement results will be reported using the number of subjects with data 
values, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median. For each categorical outcome, the number and percentage of subjects in each category will be reported. All statistical hypothesis tests will be 2 -sided at the significance 
level of 0.05. 
9.5.2 Primary  Analyses 
The primary efficacy variable, AUC
0-24, will be analyzed by using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with treatment group and site as factors in the model. Each active dose group will 
be compared to placebo using this model. P- value and associated 95% confidence interval for 
treatment difference betw een each active dose and placebo will be presented. Missing pain 
assessment at scheduled time point will be imputed. The details of missing data imputation 
and multiplicity adjustment will be described in the SAP.  
9.5.3 Key Secondary Analyses 
Time to first rescu e medication use will be analyzed using log rank test stratified by site . 
Proportion of patients who are opioid free through 24, 48, and 72 hours will be analyzed 
using stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site. 
9.5.4 Secondary Analyses 
Continuous secondary variables will be analyzed similarly as the primary efficacy variable. 
Proportion of patients who are pain free at each specific timepoint will be analyzed using 
stratified Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test controlling for study site. 
9.5.5 Exploratory Analyses 
The analysis of the exploratory variables will be  described in the SAP.   
9.5.6 Safety Analyses 
Safety results will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. No formal 
statistical testing will be perfo rmed for any of the safety endpoints. Adverse events will be 
classified into standard terminology using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 64 of 76 (MedDRA). Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to discontinuation, 
TEAEs related to  study drug, TEAEs by maximum severity, fatal TEAEs, and SAEs  reported 
after study drug start  will all be summarized. Other TEAEs of special interest (e.g., ORAEs ) 
may also be summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs and weight, and clinical laboratory parameters, 
including changes from Day -1 ( prior to first dose), will be tabulated by timepoint. 
Additionally, categorical analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
9.5.7 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for ACP -044 will be listed and summarized using descriptive 
statistics. Results will be used for other analyses (e.g., population PK modelling), which will 
be presented in a separate report.  
9.5.8 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
A population PK/PD model to describe the exposure response relationship between ACP -044 
plasma concentrations and the relevant efficacy and safety endpoints will be developed using appropriate PK/PD methods. Results will be presented in a separate report. 
9.5.9 Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses may be performed in subgroups. Details will be provided in the SAP.  
9.6 Interim Analyses  
No interim ana lyses are planned for this study. 
9.7 Measures to Minimize Bias  
On Day - 1 eligible  subjects who meet inclusion and do not meet exclusion criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 1600 mg ACP -044, administered either once daily or 
400 mg every 6 hours, or placebo, according to a randomization schedule. Treatment 
assignments will be blinded to all study subjects, Investigators, site personnel  (with the 
exception of the unblinded pharmacist and verifier), and Sponsor personnel. An unblinded 
pharmacist and a verifier will prepare the study drug and shall have no role in pain assessment or patient care. 
In order to maintain the double-blind design of the study, all subjects will receive the same 
numbers of tablets at the same intervals , regardless of the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. Placebo tablets  will be size - and color -matched to the ACP -044 tablets.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 65 of 76 9.8 Breaking the Study Blind/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and t he clinical database is locked.  
In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if 
unblinding of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides 
that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact the Sponsor 
prior to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of the  participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the 
sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. 
If pregnancy occurs during the study, the pregnant subject should be withdrawn and 
unblinded so that counseling may be offered based on whether the fetus was exposed to the active drug or placebo. 
10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND DATA COLLECTION 
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities 
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained by the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory authorities. 
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and auditors), regulatory authorities (including inspectors), and the IRB/EC direct  (or remote ) access to source documents (such as original medical 
records)  as allowed by local regulations. Direct (or remote) access includes permission to 
examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and reports that are needed for the evaluation of the study, either in person or through a remote video/electronic medium, if applicable. The Investigator must ensure the reliability and availability of source documents 
from which the information on the eCRF was derived. 
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recorded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation), and then entered into a validated electronic data capture 
(EDC ) database by trained site personnel. The source documentation may consist of source 
notes captured by site personnel as well as laborat ory reports, ECG reports, and electronic 
source data.  
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 66 of 76 10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an EDC system on eCRFs. The 
Investigator and his or her site personnel will be responsible for completing the eCRFs. The 
Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the information recorded on 
the eCRFs . All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be supplied, including subject  
identification  data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and any omission or discrepancy will 
require explanation. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to source documentation 
(unless eCRF is considered the source) at the site.  
10.4 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject’s anonymity is maintained as described below. 
On the eCRFs, medical records,  or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, 
subjects must be identified by a s ubject identification number only. Subject identifiers 
uniquely identify subjects within the study and do not identify any person specifically. 
Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or designees (e.g., signed ICFs) should 
be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in compliance with Federal regulations or 
other applicable laws or ICH guidance on GCP. Data collection and handling should comply with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation  (EU GDPR ), where applicable. 
Acadia has assigned a Data Protection Officer (DPO) as per the EU GDPR . 
10.5 Study Records Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH GCP guidelines. This includes, but is not limited to, copies of signed, dated and completed eCRFs, 
documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject- related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug. 
Investigators should maintain all essential study documentation, for a period of at least 2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, 
and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is required by applicable law or regulation. Only the Sponsor can notify an Investigat or or vendor  when any records may be discarded. Investigators should 
contact  the Sponsor before destroying any files. 
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed ; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study . 
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances. 
If, during the course of a subject’s post- enrollment participation in the trial it is discovered 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 67 of 76 that the subject did  not meet  all eligibility criteria, this will be reported as a major protocol 
deviation and not a waiver. In this situation, the subject will be discontinued, unless the 
discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk. The justification to allow the subject 
to continue in the trial will be made by the Sponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, 
and will be documented. All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined in the protocol ( Section  6.7). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local regulations, within reasonable time.  
10.7 Protocol Amendments  
Changes to the protocol may be made only by the Sponsor (with or without consultation with  
the Investigator) . All protocol modifications must be submitted to the site IRB /EC in 
accordance with local requirements and, if required, to regulatory authorities , as either an 
amendment or a notification . Approval for amendments must be awaited before any changes 
can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to trial 
subjects, or when the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial. 
No approval is required for notifications. 
11 QUALITY MANAGEMENT  
11.1 Risk Management  
The Sponsor utilizes the ICH E6 (GCP) Revision 2 risk management approach that includes methods to assure and control the quality of the trial proportionate to the risks inherent in the trial and the importance of the information collected. The intent is that all aspects of this trial 
are operationally feasible and that any unnecessary complexity, procedures, and data 
collection are avoided. The Sponsor’s risk management approach includes the following documented activities: 
• Critical Process and Data Identification: during protocol development, risks of 
processes and data that are critical to ensure human subject protection and the reliability of trial results are identified and assessed.  
• Risk Identification: risks to critical trial processes, governing systems, investigational 
product, trial design, data collection, and recording are identified.  
• Risk Evaluation: identified risks are evaluated by considering the following factors: 
(a) likelihood of occurrence, (b) impact on human subject protection and data 
integrity, and (c) detectability of errors.  
• Risk Control: risks that can be avoided, reduced (i.e., mitigated ), or accepted are 
differentiated. Risk mitigation activities are incorporated in protocol design and 
Study: ACP -044-004  Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 5  Date: 01 February 2022  
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 68 of 76 implementation, study plans, training, processes, and other documents governing the 
oversight and execution of study activities. Where possible, predefined quality 
tolerance limits are defined to identify systematic issues that can impact subject safety 
or data integrity and deviations from the predefined quality tolerance limits will trigger an evaluation and possibly an action. Contingency plans are developed for issues with a high risk factor that cannot be avoided. 
• Periodic risk review, communication, and escalation of risk management activities 
during trial execution and risk outcome reporting in the clinical study report (CSR).  
11.2 Quality Control and Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor or designees and regulatory authority inspectors are responsible for contacting 
and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, 
inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confidentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor’s or designee’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, 
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research. The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study- related 
records need ed to verify the entries on the eCRFs. T he monitor may review documents 
remotely, as needed , in conjunction with site policies and procedures. 
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
In accordance with ICH guidance on GCP and the Sponsor’s audit plans, sites participating in 
this study may be audited. These audits may include a review of site facilities (e.g., 
pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of study- related records may 
occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with  the protocol, ICH guidance 
on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. 
The Sponsor’s or designee ’s representatives, regulatory authority inspectors and IRB/ EC 
representatives who obtain direct access to source documents should also respect subject  
confidentiality, taking all reasonable precautions in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities.  
12 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
12.1 Ethical Standard  
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and other applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Serious Breach reporting,

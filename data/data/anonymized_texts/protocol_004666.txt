1 1. BACKGROUND 
There is growing evidence supporting neoadjuvant ther apy for transitional cell 
carcinomas confined to the bladder.1 However, for the appropriately selected 
group of patients with tumor invading the mu scle wall (i.e. clinical T2 tumors), 
the evidence is not so clear.  Though m any patients may be cured by surgical 
resection alone, there is a subset of these patients who relapse and develop 
incurable metastatic diseas e.  Therefore, while one may not want to put these 
patients through the toxicity of syste mic multi-agent chemotherapy, there is 
certainly the feeling that something fu rther must be done.  Since, at the 
current time, these patients often undergo radical cystectomy where the entire 
bladder, prostate and regional lymph nodes are removed, this group of 
untreated patients with intact bladders provides an ideal opportunity to 
explore new agents and collect tissue specimens to measure candidate 
prospective markers of response, receptor phosphorylation, and other 
downstream targets of biological agents.   
Among the numerous biological target s implicated in transitional cell 
carcinoma progression, inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGF-R) remain extremely attractive.  The receptor for EGF-R is over-
expressed by more than 75% of all hum an TCC, with the level of expression 
correlating directly with tumo r grade, stage, and survival.2 Numerous studies 
have demonstrated that clinic ally relevant inhibitors of the EGF-R, strongly 
inhibit the growth of hum an bladder tumor xenografts.3,4 Thus, there is 
compelling rationale to target these pat hways in this patient population. 
However, EGFR inhibitors have not displa yed consistent activity in clinical 
trials performed in other disease sites, which has dampened clinical 
enthusiasm for aggressively developing them further.  Studies performed 
within the context of non-small cell lung  cancer demonstrated that clinical 
responses were linked to activating mutations within the EGFR tyrosine 
kinase domain, suggesting that a be tter understanding of the biological 
effects of EGFR inhibitors on tumor cells will help to identify tumors that will respond (biologically or clinically) to therapy.   
Although none of the urothelial carcinoma cell li nes nor any of 75 primary 
tumors we evaluated contained activati ng EGFR kinase domain mutations or 
expressed the truncated form of the EG FR (EGFRvIII) that mediates ligand-
independent signaling and promotes tumo r growth in other model systems, 
we found that EGFR inhibitors (gefitin ib or cetuximab) blocked cell cycle 
progression in 8/20 human bladder c ancer cell lines.  Through a large 
collaborative effort in our Bladder SPORE program, with a Core Project 
studying EGF-R inhibition in urothelial cancer, we have identified molecular 
mechanisms that appear to correlate wit h or mediate these effects.   
Consistent with emerging evidence from other solid tumors, is the so-called 
“epithelial to mesenchymal transition”  (EMT) which correlates with resistance 
Protocol 2007-0704

2 to EGFR antagonist-induced growth inhibition.   Specifically, the sensitivity to 
EGFR inhibition in urothelial carcinom a as defined by cell cycle arrest was 
proportional to the pre-tr eatment expression of E-cadherin and HER4, and 
inversely proportional to the expression of PDGFR- β, a mesenchymal growth 
factor receptor. Moreover, the response to therapy could be predicted ‘early’ 
in the course of treatment by quant ifying changes in the expression of 
proliferation markers, in cluding Ki-67/PCNA, p27, Cyclin D1, and GSK-3- β. 
Thus, we have designed a proof-of-principle clinical trial to provide 
information to prospectively identify tumo rs likely to respond to this form of 
therapy.  Knowledge gained from this tr ial may have substantial impact in 
bladder cancer, including the setting of secondary chemoprevention, or in 
future combinations with other agents. 
 
1.1 EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACT OR RECEPTOR EXPRESSION AND 
SIGNIFICANCE IN CANCER  
The control of cell growth is mediat ed by a complex network of signaling 
pathways responsive to external influences , such as growth factors, as well 
as to internal controls and checks.  Ep idermal growth fact or (EGF) was one of 
the first growth factors to be described.   It was shown to be mitogenic, an 
effect mediated by the binding of EG F (or other ligands) to the cell surface 
EGF receptor (EGFR), stimulating aut ophosphorylation of the intracellular 
tyrosine kinase domain of the receptor .  Subsequent investigations revealed 
EGFR to be one of a family of closely related receptors that includes EGFR 
(HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4.   
EGFR and other HER family members ar e considered to be important in the 
development, progression, and aggressi ve behavior of human epithelial 
malignancies and to be relevant ther apeutic targets.  A number of human 
malignancies are associated with aberr ant or over-expression of EGFR 
(Salomon et al. 1995).  Stim ulation of tumor cells vi a the EGFR is important 
for both tumor growth and tumo r survival in vivo.  Ove r-expression of EGFR in 
certain human tumors, including non–small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), has 
been correlated with both chemo-resistanc e and poor prognosis (Rusch et al. 
1996, 1997; Davies and Chamberlin 1996;  Veale et al. 1987, 1993; Sekine 
et al. 1998; Pfeiffer et al. 1996; Ce rny et al. 1986; IMPATH Inc 1998–1999; 
Reissmann et al. 1999; Fujino 1996; Font anini et al. 1995; Lei et al. 1999). 
Inhibitors of EGFR tyrosine kinase ac tivity have been in development for a 
number of years, and al though earlier compounds lacked specificity and 
potency, newer compounds have proven acti ve in nonclinical and clinical 
studies. 
Tarceva (previously known as OSI-774) is an orally active, potent, selective 
inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase .  Early clinical data with Tarceva 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 3  
3 indicate that the compound is generally safe and well tolerated at doses that 
provide the targeted effective concentration based on nonclinical 
experiments.  A recently complet ed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial has shown that Tarc eva as a single agent significantly 
improves the survival of patients with incurable Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC who 
have failed standard therapy for advanced or metastatic disease (Shepherd et 
al; Proceedings of ASCO 2004; Abst 7022). 
1.2 TARCEVA AS AN EGFR TY ROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR 
Tarceva is an EGFR tyrosine kinase i nhibitor that has been investigated in 
several Phase III studies.  An overview of relevant nonclinical and clinical 
information is presented below; complete details are available in the 
Tarceva™ Investigator Brochure. 
1.2.1 Non-clinical Data  
a. Pharmacology 
Tarceva, a quinazoline, directly and reversibly inhibits the human EGFR 
tyrosine kinase with an IC 50 of 2 nM (0.79 ng/mL) in an in vitro enzyme assay 
and reduces EGFR autophosphorylation in intact tumor ce lls with an IC 50 of 
20 nM (7.9 ng/mL).  This potent inhibi tion is selective for the EGFR tyrosine 
kinase both in assays assessing the effect s of Tarceva on a variety of other 
isolated tyrosine kinases and in cellula r bioassays designed to isolate this 
functional pathway.  Tarceva is designed to inhibit EGF-dependent 
proliferation of cells at submicro molar concentrations and blocks cell cycle 
progression in the G1 phase.  
Data on drug exposure and anti-tumor re sponses in human tumor xenograft 
models (HN5 and A431) were analyzed in order to estimate the plasma concentration of erlotinib associated with anti-tumor activity.  Based on these efficacy models, the minimu m steady-state plasma concentration targeted for 
clinical activity in humans is projected to be 500 ng/mL. 
b. Toxicology 
Toxicology studies have been performed in mice, rats (up to 6 months), dogs 
(up to 1 year), and monkeys (1 week).  Treatment-related effects observed in 
at least one species or study incl uded effects on the cornea (atrophy, 
ulceration), skin (follicular degenerat ion and inflammation, redness, and 
alopecia), ovary (atrophy), liver (nec rosis), kidney (papillary necrosis and 
tubular dilatation), lacrimal glands (atrophy), salivary glands (atrophy), 
mandibular lymph nodes (inflamma tion), spleen (hematopoiesis), 
gastrointestinal tract (delayed gast ric emptying and diarrhea), and embryo-
fetal toxicity.  Red blood cell parameters were decreased, and white blood cells (primarily neutrophils) were incr eased.  There were  treatment-related 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 4  
4 increases in ALT, AST, triglyceride and bilirubin and decreases in albumin; 
increases in bilirubin were likely caus ed by a treatment-related impairment of 
bilirubin metabolism.  
 
1.2.2 Clinical Experience with Tarceva  
a. Dose Selection for Singl e-Agent Trials of Tarceva 
Phase I trials of Tarceva explored both schedule and dose to evaluate the 
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic  profile of the compound given as a 
single agent.  A number of phar macokinetic trials in healthy subjects have 
been conducted, along with three classi c Phase I trials in patients with 
advanced cancer.  The single-agent maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was estimated to be 150 mg administered once daily.   
The primary toxicities of single-agent Tarceva consist ed of rash (dermatosis), 
diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, stomatitis, vomiting, and headache.  When given daily, dose-limiting toxicity (diarrhea)  was observed at 200 mg/day.  At 
150 mg/day, diarrhea was manageable with the addition of loperamide 
therapy; this dose was considered the maximal tolerated dose.  
Rash (variously referred to as dermati tis, acneiform rash, or maculopapular 
rash) has been variable in onset, durati on, and severity, but typically appears 
on the face, neck, scalp, chest, and back st arting after ~1 week of treatment.  
The mechanistic basis of the rash  remains uncertain; histopathologic 
examination of biopsies of  the rash demonstrated infl ammatory cell infiltrate 
and mild epidermal hyperproliferation.  In some cases, the rash gradually 
improved despite continued dosing and, in general, resolved without sequelae following Tarceva discontinuation.  T he rash did not result in study 
discontinuation in patients with cancer in the Phase I trials.  Laboratory 
abnormalities observed infrequently wit h single-agent Tarceva involved 
primarily liver function tests, including elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin. 
Selection of the 150 mg/day dose of  Tarceva for subsequent single-agent 
studies was based on pharmacokinetic paramet ers, as well as the safety and 
tolerability profile of this dose in Phas e I trials in heavily pretreated patients 
with advanced cancer.  Drug levels seen in patients with cancer receiving the 
150 mg/day dose were consistently above the average plasma concentration of 500 ng/mL targeted for clinical efficacy.  
b. Pharmacokinetics  
Oral Tarceva is well absorbed and has  an extended absorp tion phase, with 
mean peak plasma levels occurring at 3 hours after oral dosing of 150 mg/dL 
at steady state.  A study in health y subjects provided an estimate of 
bioavailability of 59% (95% CI:  55%, 63%).  The time to reach steady-state 
plasma concentration was ~5 days.  The accumulation ratio with daily dosing 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 5  
5 of Tarceva was estimated to be 2.0.   From a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis of 708 patients, the median trough concentration (C min) 24 hours 
following the previous dose was 1041 ( ±697) ng/mL.  Median AUC achieved 
during the dosing interval at steady state was 19,801 ng  • hr/mL.  Exposure 
after an oral dose is increased by food.   
There is extensive binding of Tarceva and metabolites to both serum albumin 
and AAG (alpha-1-acid glycoprotein), wit h total plasma protein binding for 
Tarceva and OSI-420 of ~95% and 91%, res pectively.  Tarceva is extensively 
metabolized in the liver by the hepatic  cytochromes in humans–primarily by 
CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2.  The primary metabolite of 
Tarceva, OSI-420, has potency comparable to  that of erlotinib, but is present 
at levels that are < 10% of erlotinib levels.  Tarc eva is excreted predominantly 
via the feces ( > 90%).  The eliminati on half-life after a 150-mg oral dose is 
~30 hours.  In population-based data  analyses, no relationships were 
identified between predicted steady-sta te trough concentration and patient 
age, body weight, sex, ethnici ty, or creatinine clearance. 
c. Phase II and III Trials in Pa tients with Advanced Cancer  
Multiple Phase II trials ev aluating the safety, tolerabi lity, and antitumor activity 
of Tarceva have been conducted in pat ients with advanced, refractory 
malignancies including cancer of the head and neck, lung, aerodigestive tract, 
ovary, breast, central nervous system (glioma), and others. Tarceva has been 
evaluated both as a single agent and administered concurrently with 
conventional chemotherapy agents using various doses and schedules.     
Evidence of activity has been observed in squamous cell carcinoma of the 
head and neck, ovarian, breast and pancreatic carcinoma, non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and glioblastoma mu ltiforme (GBM).  Patients received 
150 mg/day of Tarceva in all of thes e studies except the GBM study where 
dose escalation was allowed until limit ed by rash and where a higher starting 
dose was tested in subjects receiv ing concomitant enzyme inducing anti-
epileptic drugs.  Dose reduction was allo wed in all studies in the case of 
intolerance.  Diarrhea was treated with loperamide therapy and/or dose 
reduction.  Rash was treated with a variety of agents, including oral and 
topical antibiotics, corticos teroids, and other agents.   
Patients receiving Tarceva in combinat ion with various c hemotherapy agents 
have generally experienced the same ty pe of adverse events (AEs) as with 
either agent alone.   
The first randomized placebo controll ed trial to demonstrate a survival 
advantage for an EGFR inhibitor was t he Phase III study, BR21.  This 
international trial, conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada 
Clinical Trial Group (NCIC CTG), incl uded 731 patients with incurable Stage 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 6  
6 IIIb/IV NSCLC who have failed standard t herapy for advanced or metastatic 
disease.  Patients randomized in a 2: 1 ratio to single-agent Tarceva 150 
mg/day obtained a 42.5% improvement in median survival over placebo, from 
4.7 to 6.7 months.  The one-year surviv al increased significantly (from 22% to 
31%) as did the median and 6 month PFS,  response rate, and the time to 
deterioration of tumor related sympt oms of pain, cough, and dyspnea.  
(Shepherd 2004). 
In BR-21, of the 727 patients evaluable fo r safety (485 Tarceva, 242 placebo), 
the most common AEs in the Tarceva arm were rash (75% Tarceva, 17% placebo), diarrhea (54% Tarceva, 18% pl acebo) and stomatitis (17% Tarceva, 
18% placebo) events.  The majority of these events were mild to moderate in 
severity.  The incidence of ILD re ported was the same in the placebo and 
Tarceva groups at 0.8% in each arm. 
Two large, Phase III, randomized st udies in first-line NSCLC patients 
evaluated Tarceva in combination with platinum-based two-drug combination 
chemotherapy.  A total of 1079 previ ously untreated patients received 
carboplatin/paclitaxel with either Tarceva or placeb o in the TRIBUTE trial 
(OSI2298g) conducted in the United Stat es.  An additional 1172 patients 
received cisplatin/gemcitabine plus eit her Tarceva or placebo in the TALENT 
trial (BO16411) conducted in 27 countri es in Europe and other ex-U.S. 
locations.  Neither study met its primar y endpoint of improved overall survival 
or a secondary endpoint of improved time  to disease progression or overall 
response rate.  Overall, the number of adverse events and serious adverse 
events were well balanced between the two arms of each study, with two 
exceptions.  As expected, rash and di arrhea occurred more frequently in the 
Tarceva arms.  In the TRIBUTE study, more serious adverse events resulting 
in death were seen in the Tarceva a rm compared with the placebo arm (53 
vs. 27).  Most of t he apparent imbalance was due to events reported as 
pneumonia or progression of underlying cancer . (Gatzemeier U. et al.- Talent 
trial  - ASCO 2004 - Abstract 7010 and Herb st R. et al. – Tribute trial - ASCO 
2004 - Abstract 7011). 
d. Patients with Hepatic or Renal impairment 
The influence of hepatic metastases and/or hepatic dysfunction on the 
pharmacokinetics of Tarceva is not yet known.  However, Tarceva is cleared predominately by the liver, and cauti on should be used when administering 
Tarceva to patients with hepatic dysfunction.  Tarceva is also a strong inhibitor 
of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 enzyme responsible for the 
glucuronidation of bilirubin.  Hyperbilirubinemia appears most often to be a side effect related to genetic polymor phisms of UGT1A1.  Rare cases of 
hepatic failure (including fatalit ies) have been reported during the 
postmarketing use of Tarceva.  Conf ounding factors for severe hepatic 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 7  
7 dysfunction have included pre-existing liv er disease such as cirrhosis, viral 
hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepat ic metastases, or concomitant 
treatment with potentially  hepatotoxic drugs. 
Rare cases of myocardial infarction (i ncluding fatalities) have been reported 
during the postmarketing use of Tarceva. 
No clinical studies have been conduct ed in patients with compromised renal 
function since Tarceva and its metabolites  are not significantly excreted by 
the kidneys.   
 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE 
The receptor for EGF-R is over-exp ressed in more than 75% of all human 
transitional cell tumors, with the level of  expression correlating directly with 
tumor grade, stage, and surviv al.  In our pre-clinical models, clinically relevant 
inhibitors of the EGF-R strongly inhibit the growth of tumor cells in xenograft 
models.  While EGF-R mutational stat us has been predictive of response 
within the context of non- small cell lung cancer, we have not found these 
mutations to present in our cell lines nor in 75 primary tumors that were 
evaluated for activating EGFR kinase domai n mutations or the truncated form 
of the EGF-R (EGFRvIII).  Despite thes e findings, we have observed  that 
EGFR inhibitors blocked cell cycle progr ession in 8/20 human bladder cancer  
cell lines.  Through a large collaborative  effort in our Bladder SPORE program 
we have identified molecular mechanism s that appear to correlate with or 
mediate these effects. 
While the primary endpoint will be focused on clinical response, it is clear that 
that a strong inducement fo r this study is the propo sed biologic endpoints.  
With our current model, we have the oppor tunity to study novel agents in the 
preoperative setting with the ability to colle ct tissue both prior to therapy (with 
tissue collected on routine cystoscopy), and at cystectomy.  Ultimately, we 
hope to use the knowledge gained from th is descriptive study to identify 
appropriate patients for EGFR -directed or other select ively targeted therapies. 
 
2. OBJECTIVES 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To estimate the response rate (ie: pT0 rate) of patients wit h urothelial cancer 
treated with erlotinib prior to cystectom y.  In this context, response will be 
defined as the absence of residual cancer in the resected specimen.  
Protocol 2007-0704

Page 8  
8 2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE(S) 
Clinical Objectives:  
1.  To estimate the 4-year disease- free survival of pat ients with urothelial 
cancer treated with erlotinib prior to cystectomy. 
Biologic Objectives:  
1.  To measure EMT markers (E-cad herin, HER4, PDGFR-beta, vimentin, 
fibronectin) in pre- and post-treatment  biopsies and correlate expression 
patterns with the biological responses measured below. 
2. To quantify target inhibition, antiproliferation (K I-67), and apoptosis 
(TUNEL) in biopsies obtained from patients before, during, and after 
therapy. 
3. Interrogate membrane (phosphoryl ated EGFR) and downstream receptor 
signaling pathways (ERKs, AKT/mTOR,  GSK-3beta) to provide further 
insight into whether or not a given tumor displays a biological response. 
4. To correlate the changes in Ki-67 expression with changes in angiogenesis 
and angiogenesis related gene expressi on utilizing fluorescent tissue 
staining techniques that we have dev eloped in the laboratory (such as 
two-color TUNEL, phosphor-recept or, and microvessel density.) 
5. To profile mRNA expression in pr e- and post-treatment biopsies using 
Affymetrix arrays and corre late the changes observed with EMT, growth 
arrest, and apoptosis. 
6.  To quantify EGFR copy number and correlate with changes observed with 
EMT, growth arrest, and apoptosis. 
 
3. STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY Population:
 
Patients must have invasive transitiona l cell carcinoma, and be candidates for 
cystectomy.  Patients with transitional cell  tumors of the upper tract and urethra 
tumors may also be eligible. Patients with high-risk features including micropapillary 
features, small cell carcinoma, 3-D ma ss on EUA, and lymphovascular invasion, 
require treatment with syst emic chemotherapy (figur e 1) and therefore will be 
generally excluded from this study unless they refuse the recommended 
cytoreductive chemotherapy.   Patients may have received prior intravesical treatment for their tumor.  Patients tr eated with prior systemic chemotherapy for 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 9  
9 urothelial carcinoma are not eligible for this study.  Patients with metastatic or 
surgically unresectable disease ar e not eligible for this study. 
Patient must have no significant co-morbidit ies interfering with treatment.  Patients 
with interstitial lung disease are not eligible for this trial. 
Since tumor response and target inhibition on patient tissue are end-points of the 
study, patients should agree to have biopsy and cystectomy at M. D. Anderson.  
Tissue collection is an optional procedure. 
 
Study Schema: 
This is a phase II exploratory study of pre-operative treatment  with erlotinib for 
patients with muscle invasive transitional ce ll carcinoma.  The primary endpoint is 
pathologic response rate, with additional end points regarding target inhibition on 
patient tissue.  Biopsies will be obtained pr ior to therapy, and residual tumor will be 
collected at cystectomy. 
Treatment Regimen: 
Patients will receive erlotinib 150 mg po daily .  Patients will receive at least 3 weeks 
of therapy, scheduled so that the last dose of therapy will be given within 24 hours 
prior to cystectomy.   Since cystectomy will usually be scheduled within 3-5 weeks, 
therapy will not delay surgery.  The treat ment may be shortened, if necessary, to 
accommodate the surgical schedule, but will generally last for 3 weeks.

  3.2 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN  
 
Current Clinical Practice:
 
Our current clinical practice for low-risk muscle invasive bladder cancer, is to 
proceed with cystectomy, and consider  additional adjuvant chemotherapy 
depending upon pathologic stage.  Though m any of these patients may be 
cured by surgical resection alone, t here is a subset of  these patients who 
relapse and develop incurable meta static disease.  Neoadjuvant 
cytoreductive chemotherapy is given only for those patients with the following 
high-risk features: micropapillary tumor, small cell tumor, 3-D mass on EUA, 
and lymphovascular invasion.   
Clinical Endpoint Rationale : 
 (Please also see section 1.3 for ra tionale regarding exploring EGFR targeted 
therapy in bladder cancer). 
 Though many patients may be cured by su rgical resection alone, there is a 
subset of these patients who relaps e and develop incurable metastatic 
disease.  Therefore, while one may not want to put these patients through the 
toxicity of systemic multi-agent chemot herapy, there is certainly the feeling 
that something further must be done.  This group of untreated patients with 
intact bladders provides an ideal o pportunity to explore new agents and 
collect tissue specimens to measure candidate prospective markers of response, receptor phosphorylation,  and other downstream targets of 
biological agents.   
Use of the pT0 rate has been a well- established surrogate for activity and 
outcome in the setting of neoadjuvant  therapy, and has been employed by 
our bladder trials group for over a decade of research.  Evidence suggests that patients who achieve this surrogat e have the highest rates of overall 
survival, compared to those who do not achieve this clinical endpoint. 
 
Biologic Endpoint Rationale 
In addition to the main clinical endpoin t, biologic hypotheses will be tested in 
the studies proposed as part of this tria l. The first is t hat quantification of 
markers of EMT (E-cadher in, HER-4, and PDGFR- β), and correlation with 
changes in Ki-67, will allo w us to prospectively identify tumors likely to 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 11  
11 respond to EGFR-directed therapy. T he second is that changes in the 
expression of active EGFR, cyclin D1, p27, and KI-67 will iden tify those which 
are biologically responding to EGFR-dir ected therapy. The th ird is that tumor 
cell death may result from either direct effects on tumor cells or indirect 
effects of angiogenesis inhibiti on, so we will also assess the 
pharmacodynamics of angiogenesis inhi bition by measuring the pro-
angiogenic factors VEGF and IL-8 as we ll as MVD, pericyte coverage, and 
endothelial cell apoptosis by laser sc anning cytometry. These studies are 
important to determine w hether angiogenesis inhibition occurs within the 
same tumors that displa y growth arrest; it is certainly possible that 
angiogenesis inhibition occurs more broadly or less frequently than growth 
arrest, which could have important  implications for the early 
pharmacodynamic assessment of biol ogical benefit fr om therapy.  
 Serum and urine levels of MMP-9, IL -8, bFGF, and VEGF will be collected at 
baseline, weekly ( ± 3 days) during treatment, pr ior to cystectomy, following 
cystectomy, and at the firs t routine follow-up visit. 
 In vitro studies suggest that micro RNAs are regulators of tumor phenotypes 
and therapeutic response in bladder cancer. We will also measure free 
circulating microRNAs in serum or plasma, and in tissue specimens and 
correlate their expression with protein ma kers of biologic response, including 
Ki67, PCNA, and TUNEL. We will also co rrelate microRNAs to other protein 
markers related to EGFR sensitivity:  ZEB2, ERRF-1, ZEB1, E-cadherin, and 
TGFalpha. By intercorrelating their results, we hope to derive a comprehensive tumor signature discrim inating between EGFR sensitive and 
resistant tumor.  
The overall scientific objective is to def ine the molecular pr ofile of urothelial 
carcinoma that responds to EGFR-target ed therapy. Additionally, we will also 
isolate mRNA, total RNA and micro RNA from pre- and post-treatment 
biopsies for analysis on Affymetrix micr oarrays, using the institutional core 
facility (PI: Mini Kapoor, Ph.D.).  Ultimately, we hope to use the knowledge 
gained from this descriptive study to  identify appropriate patients for EGFR-
directed or other select ive targeted therapies. 
 
 
3.3 SAFETY PLAN 
3.3.1 ADVERSE EVENTS USING TARCEVA 
Common adverse events associated with Ta rceva administration include rash 
and diarrhea.  Other common adverse  events include nausea/vomiting, 
mucositis/stomatitis, headache, and fatigue.  
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 12  
12 A rash occurred in 75% of Tarcev a-treated NSCLC pati ents enrolled in 
BR.21.  Similar incidence of ra sh have occurred when erlotinib was 
administered concurrently with c hemotherapy includ ing gemcitabine, 
paclitaxel/carboplatin, and gemcitabine/cisp latin.  A papular, pustular rash 
manifesting most often on the face and upper trunk was common across all studies, but rash was rarely the cause of study drug discontinuation. Other dermatologic manifestations reported in clinical studies or postmarketing use 
of Tarceva include nail changes, paronych ia, painful fissures or cracking of 
the skin on the hands and feet, and hair growth abnormalities (alopecia, thinning hair, eyelash/eyebrow changes, hirsutism). 
Wearing of contact lenses while receiving Tarceva therapy is not 
recommended.  The incidence of diarr hea in BR.21 was 54% of Tarceva-
treated NSCLC patients.  The median time  to onset of skin rash was 8 days 
and median time to occurrence of fi rst diarrheal symptom was 9 days.  
There have been infrequent reports of serious (including fatal) interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) in patients receiving Tarc eva for treatment of  NSCLC or other 
advanced solid tumors.  In Study BR.21, the incidence of ILD (0.8%) was the 
same in the placebo and Tarceva groups.  The overall incidence in Tarceva-treated patients from all studies (inclu ding uncontrolled studies and studies 
with concurrent chemotherapy) is approximately 0.6%.  Incl uded in this rate of 
ILD are reported diagnoses of pneum onitis, radiation pneumonitis, 
hypersensitivity pneumonitis, interstitial pneumonia, interstitial lung disease, 
obliterative bronchiolitis , pulmonary fibrosis, acut e respiratory distress 
syndrome, alveolitis, and lung infiltration, irrespective of investigator assessed 
causality.  Most of the cases were a ssociated with confounding or contributing 
factors such as concomitant/prior  chemotherapy, prior radiotherapy, 
preexisting parenchymal lung disease, meta static lung disease, or pulmonary 
infections. 
Rare cases of acute renal failure or renal insufficiency have been reported 
(including fatalities).  Many of these cases have been associated with 
dehydration associated with nausea, vomi ting, diarrhea, and/or anorexia.  
There have been rare reports of renal fail ure in patients receiving Tarceva in 
combination with platinum-containi ng chemotherapy regimens. Febrile 
neutropenia has been reported in pat ients receiving concomitant 
chemotherapy.   
Tarceva is both protein bound (92%–95%) and metabolized by hepatic 
cytochromes CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 and pulmonary cytochrome CYP1A1.  
Therefore, a potential fo r drug–drug interaction exists when Tarceva is 
co-administered with drugs that are hi ghly protein bound or that are CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers.   
Co-administration of Tarceva with om eprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, 
decreased the exposure of Tarcev a (AUC) by 46% and the maximum 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 13  
13 concentration (C max) by 61%. There was no change to Tmax or half-life.  
Therefore, drugs that alte r the pH of the GI tract ma y alter the solubility of 
Tarceva and hence its bioavailability. 
The exposure to Tarceva (AUC) increased to a moderate extent, by 39%, and 
the maximum concentration (C max) by 17%, when Tarceva was co-
administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. 
Co-administration of Tarceva with an inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism 
(ketoconazole, 200 mg po BID for 5 days)  resulted in increased exposure to 
Tarceva as measured by an 86% incr ease in median Tarceva AUC and a 
69% increase C max, compared with administration of Tarceva alone. 
Induction of CYP3A4 metabolism by a known enzyme inducer (rifampin, 
600 mg po QD for 7 days) resulted in a 69% decrease in the median Tarceva AUC, compared with administr ation of Tarceva alone.  However, the effect of 
rifampin on C
max was negligible.  In another st udy, rifampicin pretreatment 
followed by co-administrat ion of rifampicin with a single 450 mg dose of 
Tarceva resulted in a mean Tarceva expo sure (AUC) that wa s 57.6% of that 
observed following a single 150 mg Tarceva dose in the absence of rifampicin 
treatment.  Therefore, a potential for drug-drug interaction exists when 
Tarceva is co-administered with drugs t hat are highly protein bound or that 
are potent CYP3A4 inhi bitors or inducers. 
International normalized ratio (INR) elev ations and/or bleeding events have 
been reported in some cancer pati ents while on Tarceva alone and in 
combination with other c hemotherapeutic agents, and concomitant NSAIDS 
or anticoagulants, including warfarin. 
3.3.2 General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns 
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients 
participating in this trial, addressed through exclusion cr iteria and routine 
monitoring.  Patients will be evaluated for adverse events at each study visit 
for the duration of their participation in the stud y and for 30 days after the 
discontinuation of Tarceva.  
Skin toxicities will be monitored by routine physical exam ination and managed 
symptomatically.    The following agents may be used to treat rash:  
diphenhydramine, topical or oral cortic osteroids, and topical (clindamycin) or 
oral antibiotics (tetracycline, minocycli ne, doxycycline).  Topical drying agents 
are not recommended.   
Diarrhea will be monitored and managed symptomatically.  Guidelines for 
management include administration of loperamide and Tarceva dose reduction/interruption as described  in Section 4.3.3 and Table 2.  
Although quite rare, ILD can be life thr eatening.  Therefore, patients should 
be monitored closely for symptoms consis tent with ILD, such as new onset 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 14  
14 dyspnea without an obvious cause.  In the event that ILD is suspected, 
Tarceva treatment should be discont inued and the patient should receive 
appropriate medical management.  Alt hough there is no proven therapy, 
systemic corticosteroids are often provided.  Tarceva should not be restarted in those patients suspected of having drug-related ILD.  See Section 4.3.3 
and Table 2 for management guidelines, including Tarceva dose interruption. 
Liver function abnormalities, including elevated serum ALT, AST, and/or 
bilirubin, have been observed infrequent ly with single-agent Tarceva and 
occasionally with Tarceva in combi nation with concomitant chemotherapy.  
Periodic monitoring of liver function is recommended.  Tarceva dosing should 
be interrupted if changes in liver function are severe. 
Women of childbearing pot ential should have a negative pregnancy test prior 
to starting therapy with Tarceva and should use adequate contraceptive 
methods during and for at least 2 weeks a fter Tarceva therapy.    Treatment 
should only be continued in pregnant wo men if the potenti al benefit to the 
mother outweighs the risk to the fetus.   If Tarceva is used during pregnancy, 
the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus or potential 
risk for loss of the pregnancy. 
It is not known whether Tarceva is excreted in human milk.  Because many 
drugs are excreted in hum an milk and because the effects of Tarceva on 
infants have not been studied, women should be advised against breast-
feeding while receiving Tarceva therapy. 
 
3.4 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE 
This is a single institution, investi gator sponsored trial performed with the 
approval of Genentech, Inc. and OSI Pharmaceuticals. 
The Department of Genitour inary Medical Oncology will manage this single

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
4.1 PATIENTS 4.1.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
Patients must fulfill all of the following cr iteria to be eligible for study entry: 
1. Patients must have histologic proof of  urothelial cancer.  This includes 
bladder cancer, in addition to other tumo rs of the urothelia l lining including 
renal pelvis, ureteral, and urethral cancer. This group may include any 
patient requiring cystectomy, including pat ients with recurrent or extensive 
superficial disease (cTa-T1N0M0), CI S (carcinoma in situ), or muscle 
invasive disease (cT2-3aN0M0), w hose tumor could not be completely 
removed at transurethral resection. 
2. Patients with the following high-risk features:  Micropap illary features 
(more than focal on pathology); Small cell carcinoma; 3-D mass on exam 
under anesthesia (EUA); Lymphova scular invasion; Hydronephrosis 
(unless in the opinion of the treating physician, this is not due to tumor); 
High grade (grade 3) tumors  of the ureter, renal pe lvis, or urethra, or 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 17  
17 tumors in these areas with radi ographic abnormality large enough to 
recognize as an abnormal mass by CT or MRI imaging; Direct invasion of 
the prostatic stroma or the vaginal  wall (ie: cT4a disease) should be 
offered neoadjuvant cytoreductive chemot herapy (ie: cisplatin-based).   
Patients refusing or who are not c onsidered candidates for cytoreductive 
chemotherapy may be considered eligible .  Dr. Siefker-Radtke will be the 
final arbiter in determining eligibility for the trial. 
3.  4. Please note that the pr esence of variant histologic  subtypes is acceptable, 
except in the case for small cell va riant which is traditionally treated with 
cytoreductive chemotherapy.  Pati ents with small cell who refuse 
recommended cytoreductive chemother apy may still be considered 
eligible. 
5. Patients must have an evaluation in  the department of urology, and be 
deemed an acceptable surgical candidate. 
6. Patients must NOT have clinical evi dence of metastatic disease by either 
CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis, and chest x-ray.  In the absence of 
a bone scan, patients should be free of bone pain and have an alkaline 
phosphatase < 1.5 x ULN of the upper limit of normal, or a normal bone 
fraction of alkaline phosphat ase.  If these features  are present, patients 
should have a bone scan and this should be interpreted as showing no evidence of metastatic diseas e in order to be eligible. 
7. Individuals must be > 18 years of age.  In general, urothelial cancer occurs 
in the 6
th to 7th decade of life, so it is unlik ely that pediatric patients will be 
included. 
8. Patients, all 18 years and older, mu st either be not of child bearing 
potential or have a negative pregnancy te st within 2 weeks of treatment. 
Patients are considered not of child bear ing potential if they are surgically 
sterile (they have undergone a hysterecto my, bilateral tubal ligation, or 
bilateral oophorectomy) or  they are postmenopausal. 
9. Bone marrow function: abs olute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,000/ul; 
platelets ≥ 75,000/μl. 
10. Renal function: creatinine ≤ 2.0 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), 
or a creatinine clearance of ≥ 30 ml/min as calculated by Cockroft-Gault or 
by 24-hour urine collection.  
11. Hepatic function: bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN; AST ≤ 5.0 x ULN. 
12. Zubrod PS ≤ 2. 
13. Patients with second malignancies are eligible provided that the expected 
outcome from the second cancer is such  that this will not interfere in the 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 18  
18 delivery of this therapy, or in doing cystectomy, and provided that the 
expectation of survival from any pr ior malignancy is reliably > 4 years. 
 
4.1.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA 
Patients meeting any of the following criteria are ine ligible for study entry: 
1. Acute hepatitis or known HIV. 2. Active or uncontrolled infection. 3. Significant history of  uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled 
hypertension, unstable angina, recent my ocardial infarction (within prior 6 
months), uncontrolled congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with 
decreased ejection fraction ≤ 40%. 
4. Prior therapy specifically and direct ly targeting the EGFR pathway (i.e.: 
erlotinib, gefitini b, and cetuximab). 
5. Patients with interstitial lung disease. 6. Any concurrent chemotherapy not indi cated in the study protocol or any 
other investigational agent(s). 
7. Patients with metastatic or surgically  unresectable disease are not eligible 
for this study.  In addition, patient s who do not agree to surgery are not 
eligible for this trial. 
8. Patients who have received prior systemic chemotherapy or radiation 
therapy for urothelial canc er are not eligible.  Any prior intravesical 
chemotherapy is allowed. 
 
4.2 METHOD OF TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  
All patients will receive daily Tarceva.   There is no randomization planned, 
and no placebos will be used.  Since this is  a single-armed trial, consecutively 
eligible patients will be offered enrollment.  
 
4.3 STUDY TREATMENT 
4.3.1 Formulation
 
Tarceva oral tablets are conventional, immediate-release tablets containing 
erlotinib as the hydrochloride salt. In addition to the active ingredient, Tarceva 
contains lactose (hydrous), microc rystalline cellulose, sodium starch 
glycolate, sodium lauryl sulf ate, and magnesium stearate.   
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 19  
19 Tablets containing 25 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg of Tarceva are available. 
Each bottle will contain 30 tablets, a quantity sufficient for 4 consecutive 
weeks of dosing, with overage.   
For further details, see the Tarc eva Investigator’s Brochure. 
 
4.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Storage  
Tarceva will be self-administered in  an open-label, unblinded manner to all 
patients enrolled in the study . During the treatment period, patients will 
receive single-agent Tarceva, 150 mg/ day.  Tablets should be taken at the 
same time each day with 200 mL of wa ter at least 1 hour before or 2 hours 
after a meal.  Patients who are unable to swallow tablets may dissolve the 
tablets in distilled water for administration. 
Dose reductions for adverse events will be permitted (see Section 4.3.3).  
Treatment is continued daily until disease progre ssion or other reason for 
termination of study ther apy (see Section 4.7). 
Tarceva tablets will be supplied for clin ical trials in white, high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with ch ild-resistant closures and should be 
stored at temperatur es between 15°C and 30°C (59°F and 86°F). 
 
4.3.3 Dose Modification  
Dose reduction or interruption of Tarcev a for toxicity may take place at any 
time during the study.  Toxicity grading is based on NCI-CTCAE, v 3.0.  Dose 
level reductions are presented in Table 1.  If patients do not tolerate the 
second dose reduction, Tarceva is to be discontinued.  
 
Table 1  
Tarceva Dose Level Reductions 
Starting Dose  First Reduction Second Reduction 
150 mg/day 100 mg/day 50 mg/day 
Dose modification guidelines are summarized in Table 2.  
Management of a tolerable Grade 2 or 3 rash should include continuation of 
Tarceva at the current dose and symptomatic management.  If skin rash is 
intolerable, dose reduction according to  Table 2 should be considered.  When 
skin toxicity improves by at l east one grade level, the dose may be 
re-escalated as tolerated.  In Phase II trials, this approach enabled dose 
re-escalation for the majority of pat ients requiring dose reduction for skin 
Protocol 2007-0704

20 toxicity.  Patients experiencing Grade 4 skin toxicity should be discontinued 
from study treatment.     
For Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea, early inte rvention should include continuation of 
Tarceva at the current dos e and initiation of loperami de therapy as described 
in Table 2.  Grade 2 diarrhea that per sists over 48–72 hours, despite optimal 
medical management, should be managed by  dose reduction according to 
Table 2.  Patients experiencing Grade 3 diarrhea should interrupt Tarceva 
until resolution to Grade ≤1 and re-start at a reduced dose according to Table 
2.  Patients should be maintained at  the reduced dose without attempt at 
dose re-escalation .  Patients experiencing Grade 4 diarrhea should be 
discontinued from study treatment. 
Tarceva should not be restarted in t hose suspected of having drug-related 
ILD.

4.4 CONCOMITANT AND EXCLUDED THERAPIES 
Use of anti-neoplastic or anti-tumor agent s not part of the study therapy, 
including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, and hormonal 
anticancer therapy, is not permitted wh ile participating in this study.  
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 22  
22 Use of concurrent investigat ional agents is not permitted. 
There are potential interactions betw een Tarceva and CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
CYP3A4 promoters.  Although caution and careful monitoring are 
recommended when use of these compoun ds is necessary, use of these 
compounds does not exclude patients from  participating in this trial (see 
Appendix B for a list of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers). 
Grapefruit juice is a CYP3A4 inhibitor, therefore, consumpti on of grapefruit or 
grapefruit juice should be avoi ded during Tarceva treatment. 
The solubility of Tarceva is pH dependent.  Tarceva solubility decreases as 
pH increases. Co-administration of Tarceva with omeprazole, a proton pump 
inhibitor, decreased the exposure of Tarceva (AUC) by 46% and the maximum concentration (C
max) by 61%.  There was no change to Tmax or 
half-life.  Therefore, drugs that alte r the pH of the GI tract may alter the 
solubility of Tarceva and hence its bioavailability. 
The exposure to Tarceva (AUC) increased to a moderate extent, by 39%, and 
the maximum concentration (C max) by 17%, when Tarceva was co-
administered with ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and CYP1A2. 
Tarceva clearance can be induced by smoking via CYP1A2 induction. 
Potential drug-drug interaction is expected when Tarceva is taken with 
CYP1A2 inducers or inhibitors.  In a single-dose study in healthy volunteers, 
the AUC was reduced by 64% in sm okers when compared with nonsmokers.  
In BR.21, current smokers achieved Tarceva trough plasma concentrations 
that were approximately 2-fold lowe r than never smokers.  Smokers should 
be advised to stop smoking while taking Ta rceva as plasma concentrations of 
Tarceva are reduced due to the e ffect of cigarette smoking. 
Pretreatment or co-administration of Tarceva did not alter the clearance of a 
prototypical CYP3A4 substrate, midazol am.  Therefore, si gnificant metabolic 
interactions with other CYP3 A4 substrates are unlikely.  However, the oral 
bioavailability of midazolam decr eased by up to 24% following Tarceva 
treatment, which was not attribut ed to a metabolic interaction. 
Patients taking warfarin or other warf arin-derivative anticoagulants should be 
monitored regularly for changes in  prothrombin time or INR. 
 
  
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  (SEE APPENDIX 1) 
 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 23  
23 4.5.1 SCREENING AND PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENTS  
Patients should have a history and physical examination.  All patients must be 
seen by a Urologic Surgeon at M. D. Anderson and have a cystoscopy and exam under anesthesia (EUA ) prior to registration .  (Please note, an EUA is 
only done in the setting of urot helial tumors of the bladder). 
 
Laboratory studies: CBC with platel ets and automated differential, 
electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, al bumin, LDH, AST (or ALT), alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, creatinine,  and BUN.  Patients should have a 
prothrombin time if they  have not yet had a cysto/EUA.  These studies should 
be obtained within 3 weeks of study entry. 
 
Other baseline studies requi red at study entry: chest x-ray (within 6 weeks), 
EKG (within 6 months), CT (or MRI) of the a bdomen and pelvis within 6 
weeks of study entry.  Si nce the bone scan is known to be falsely negative in 
a high percentage of cases and is not r outinely done in this setting, patients 
are not required to have a bone scan unl ess they meet alkaline phosphatase 
or pain criteria as listed in the inclusion criteria. 
 
Tissue/specimen collection:   Cancer tissue will be obtained during 
cystoscopy (or from archived specim ens) and transurethral resection of 
bladder tumor during routine staging pr ocedures.  Tissue following treatment 
will be obtained at cystectomy   We will also record the time at which the vascular pedicles of the bladder are 
ligated so we can determine the co rrelation between ischemic time and 
integrity of these phosphor ylated proteins.  Immunohi stochemical staining be 
performed include EGFR, phospho- EGFR, PCNA, CD31, TUNEL, 
AKT/phospho-AKT, MAPK, and GSK3B.  Ot her markers will be evaluated if 
appropriate. 
 
Serum and urine levels of MMP-9, IL -8, bFGF, and VEGF will be collected at 
baseline, weekly ( ± 3 days) during treatment, pr ior to cystectomy, following 
cystectomy, and at the firs t routine follow-up visit. 
 Pathology specimens and serum and urine samples derived by surgical or other procedures during st andard patient care will be stored in the Bladder 
SPORE tissue bank.  Tissue will be appr opriately annotated/dated.  Requests 
for tissue will be preferentially used fo r (1) clinical care, (2) meeting the 
endpoints of this trial.  Additional sa mples remaining will be made available to 
investigators interested in studying im portant molecular targets that may be 
predictive of outcome or provide additi onal insight into the mechanism of 
action of Tarceva or the biology of trans itional cell urothelial tumors.  Samples 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 24  
24 will be collected and stored as per instit utional guideline.  All requests must 
be in the context of IR B approved protocols. 
 
4.5.2 EVALUATIONS AND PROCEDURES DURING TREATMENT   
All patients will be seen weekly ( ± 3 days) while on Tarceva by the physician 
or their designee (research nurse, advance practice nurse, physician 
assistant, nurse practitioner, clinic nurse) to evaluate for to xicity.  Patients will 
have weekly ( ± 3 days) CBC with platelets,  AST or ALT, serum Cr, and 
electrolytes.  
 
4.5.3 TREATMENT DISCON TINUATION ASSESSMENTS   
Patients discontinuing treatm ent for toxicity, will be seen every other week by 
the physician or their designee (resear ch nurse, advance practice nurse, 
physician assistant, or nurse  practitioner) to document improvement, until the 
time of surgery.  Patients discontinuing treatment by choice alone (ie: in the 
setting of no toxicity), will not be required to follow weekly. 
 
4.5.4 FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS  
Patients should be seen in the clinic or contacted by telephone to determine if 
any serious or non-serious adverse events have occurred within 30 days 
(± 3 days) of terminati on of Tarceva dosing. 
Patients will have routine post-surgical  follow-up after cystectomy as 
determined by their urologist.  Long- term follow-up, including CT of the 
abdomen and pelvis, CXR, and laboratory tests will be done as determined by 
the treating physician.  Long-term follo w up will be done every 6 months for 
the first year, followed by yearly interv als for the next 4 years.  Follow-up may 
be done more frequently based upon the pathol ogic stage/discretion of the 
treating physician.  Patients may go on to adjuvant chemot herapy if deemed 
appropriate by their treating physician.  They will continue to be followed for 4 years. 
 
4.6 ASSAY METHODS  
Patients will be treated with daily Ta rceva for 3 weeks, followed by 
cystectomy (or ureterectomy/nephrectomy /urethrectomy).  The last dose of 
Tarceva will be given within 24 hours prior to scheduled surgical time. 
Patients will have tissue collected at baseli ne, prior to Tarceva, as part of 
staging cystoscopy (or from archived specimens), and will have residual 
tumor tissue collected at t he time of cystectomy (or 
ureterectomy/nephrectomy).  Blood and urine specimens will also be 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 25  
25 collected at baseline, weekly ( ± 3 days) while on treatment, at cystectomy, 
and at the first restaging follow-up vi sit (usually within 3-6 months). 
 Markers of the epithelial to mesenchy mal transition (EMT) (ie: E-cadherin, 
ZEB1, ZEB2, ERRF-1, TGF α, HER4, PDGFR-beta, vimentin, and fibronectin) 
will be analyzied in pre- and post-treatment biopsies to correlate expression 
patterns with clinical response (ie pT0 rate) and biological response and target inhibition.   EMT expression patterns will be correlated with markers of 
anti-proliferation (KI-67), apoptosis (TUNEL) and angiogenesis (two-color 
TUNEL, phosphor-receptor, and microve ssel density).  EGFR copy number 
and mRNA expression in pre and post-tr eatment biopsies using Affymatrix 
arrays and tumor tissue and serum micro RNAs and Total RNA will also be 
correlated with changes with changes obs erved with EMT, growth arrest, and 
apoptosis. To provide further insight in to biology, we will also interrogate 
membrane (phosphorylated EGFR) and downstream receptor signaling 
pathways (ERKs, AKT.mTOR, GSK-3beta). 
 
4.7 PATIENT DISCONTINUATION 
Patients may discontinue study treatment  at any time.  Any patient who 
discontinues treatment will be encouraged to return to the st udy center to 
undergo treatment discontinuation asse ssments.  The primary reason for 
discontinuation should be reco rded.  Reasons for discontinuation of a patient 
by the investigator include, but ar e not limited to, the following:   
• Documented disease progression    
• Clinically significant de terioration of the patient’s condition prior to 
treatment discontinuation  
• Patient noncompliance 
• Persistent ( ≥
 3 weeks) NCI-CTCAE vers ion 3.0 Grade 3 or Grade 4 
adverse event or any significant adv erse event that compromises the 
patient’s ability to participate in the study  
• Investigator determination that it is not in the patient’s best interest to 
continue participation 
• Pregnancy 
• Patient Decision

26 4.8 STATISTICAL METHODS 
Determination of Sample a nd Monitoring for Efficacy  
Sample Size: Clinical Endpoint  
 
Assume the baseline response (pT0 rate) to be 10%, and an increase of the response rate to 25% after the neoadjuvant therapy. With type I and type II error 
rates of 0.1 and 0.1, we need a maximum number of 40 patients for the Simon’s 
Min-max two-stage design. At the first stage of the trial, if there are 2 or less 
responses observed among the first 27 patie nts, the trial s hould be terminated and 
the treatment will not be considered for fu rther study. If there are at least 3 
responses observed among the first 27 patient s, 13 more patients will be enrolled in 
the second stage for a total of 40 patients. If  at least 7 responses are observed from 
all 40 patients, the trea tment will be considered for further investigation.  To take into 
consideration of possible unevaluable pati ents in assessing the biologic endpoints, 
we plan on accruing a total of 42 patients.  
 
Safety Endpoints and Monitoring: 
Toxicity outcomes will be monitored periodica lly for patients after the treatments. 
Termination will be recommended if it is very likely that the surgery-limiting toxicity 
rate has exceeded 15%. For this trial, su rgery-limiting toxicity will be defined as 
hemorrhage requiring major non-elective in tervention or wound dehiscence (defined 
as fascial disruption with evisceration)  within 30 days post-operatively. [Formally, 
stop if Prob ( θ > 0.15) ≥ 0.80, where θ refers to the toxicity rate for the investigated 
regimen. The prior distribution on θ is Beta(.1, .9)]. The tr ial will be terminated if the 
following stopping boundaries are crossed:

Note that the trial may be terminated pr ior to reaching the specified number of 
patients in a cohort. For exam ple, if there are two pati ents with toxicity among the 
first 3 patients, the tr ial will be terminated for excessive toxicity.  
 A simulation study was conducted to exami ne the property of t he stopping rule under 
a variety of scenarios (10,000 simulated tr ials per scenario). The following table 
summarizes the probability of stopping the tr ial early due to toxicity and the expected 
sample size for the indi cated true toxicity rate :

28 4.8.1 Analysis of th e Conduct of the Study  
Methods for detection of violations of  enrollment criteria, major protocol 
violations and deviations can be found in  section 6.5.  Reasons for patient 
discontinuation from the study will be documented, as per section 4.7 
 
4.8.2 Analysis of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic characteristics will be co llected at baseline.  These should 
included age, gender, Zubrod performance status, date of initial diagnosis, 
any prior treatment including resecti on and prior intravesical therapy. 
Descriptive analysis will be performed.   
 
4.8.3 Efficacy Analysis  
The primary endpoint of this trial is to  estimate the response rate (ie: pT0 
rate) of patients with urothelial canc er treated with erlotinib prior to 
cystectomy.  In this context, respons e will be defined as the absence of 
residual cancer in the resected specimen.  Since this is a single institution 
study, all specimens will be reviewed by  a genitourinary pathologist in the 
department of pathology at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. 
Use of the pT0 rate has been a well- established surrogate for activity and 
outcome in the setting of neoadjuvant  therapy, and has been employed by 
our bladder trials group for over a dec ade of research.  Evidence suggests 
that patients who achieve this surrogat e have the highest rates of overall 
survival, compared to those who do not achieve this clinical endpoint. 
A secondary objective is to estimate t he 4-year disease-free survival of 
patients with urothelial cancer treated with erlotinib prior to cystectomy. 
An interim analysis will be performed after the first 27 patients.   If there are 2 
or less responses among the first 27 patient s, the trial will be terminated.  If 
there are 3 or more responses , the trial will continue accrual. 
Full details regarding the analysis pl ans can be found in section 4.9.7 
 
4.8.4 Safety Analysis  
Patients will be monitored for toxicity us ing NCI CTCAEv3.0.  Toxicity will be 
monitored at the weekly ( ± 3 days) visits while on therapy.  Dose reductions 
based upon toxicity can be found in section 4.3. 
Surgery will not be delayed for missed Ta rceva doses.  Patients who miss a 
dose of Tarceva may resume treatment if  timing permits.  However, if the 
toxicity will interfere with or delay surgery, Tarceva will be discontinued. 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 29  
29 Though treatment with this agent is genera lly expected to be well-tolerated, 
patients will be monitored for specific to xicities which would be of concern in 
the surgical setting.  For this trial, surgery-limiting toxicity will be defined as 
hemorrhage or wound dehiscence withi n 30 days post-operatively.  The 
statistics employing the early stopping rules can be found in section 4.8. 
 
4.8.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
This will be a descriptive study and ex tent of target inhibition will be 
correlated with clinical outcomes, includ ing tumor response. In this setting, 
a 50% decrease in KI-67 will serve as a measure of antip roliferation, with 
a sample size of 42, the response rate  can be estimated within 15% of the 
true value with 95% confidence interval. In  the initial phase of analysis, we 
will apply a univariate analysis for eac h of the markers:  E-cadherin, 
HER4, PDGFR- β, GSK3β, phosphorylation, cyclin D1, p27 and KI67 
expression. We will estimate the change in proportion of each marker 
expression after treatment with a 95% confidence interval. We will also 
evaluate correlations among these mark ers before and after the treatment.  
These events will be correlated with any effects of therapy on MVD, mean 
vessel volume, changes in the percentages  of tumor pericytes, endothelial 
cells, or both, and tumor and stromal cell apoptosis. Extent of target 
inhibition (EGFR signaling) will be correlated with KI67 as an indicator of response, because the study design does not allow us to measure objective tumor response. Angiog enesis factor expression will be 
correlated with endothelial ce ll apoptosis and MVD. 
 
4.8.6 Missing Data
 
Patients receiving at least 1 dose of study medication will be assessable for 
both response and toxicity.   Patients who come off study without having received any of the study therapy will be replaced.     
 
4.9 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Clinical information regarding registra tion and off study will be entered to the 
Institutional required dat a base CORe and PDMS.  Clinical data for analysis 
will be entered to the departmental database GURU.  The Data Base 
Coordinator will work with the protocol specific team in order to generate 
reports for quality analysis. 
Protocol 2007-0704

30 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
The safety of Tarceva will be asse ssed through collection and analyses of 
adverse events (AEs) and laboratory test s.  These assessments will occur 
weekly (± 3 days) while on therapy. In additi on, patients will be assessed for 
potential surgical toxicity occurring wit hin 30 days of cystect omy.  Though this 
treatment is expected to be generally well-tolerated, specific therapy-limiting 
toxicity can be found in section 4.8. 
5.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAFETY VARIABLES  
Safety assessments will consist of moni toring and recording protocol-defined 
adverse events (AEs) and serious adver se events (SAEs); measurement of 
protocol-specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis variables; 
measurement of protocol-s pecified vital signs; and other protocol-specified 
tests that are deemed critical to the safety eval uation of the study drug(s). 
Death as a result of disease progression is only to be assessed as efficacy 
measures and not as AEs or SAEs. 
 
5.1.1 Adverse Events  
An AE is any unfavorable and unint ended sign, symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of an investigational (medicinal) product or 
other protocol-imposed interventi on, regardless of attribution. 
This includes the following: 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient that emerge during the 
protocol-specified AE reporting peri od, including signs or symptoms 
associated with urothelial cancer that were not present prior to the AE 
reporting period (see Section 5.2.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated 
interventions (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies) 
• If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment 
associated with medication washout, no treatment run- in, or other 
protocol-mandated intervention 
• Preexisting medical conditions (ot her than the condition being studied) 
judged by the investigator to have wors ened in severity or frequency or 
changed in character during the prot ocol-specified AE reporting period 
• Diagnoses and/or symptoms associat ed with urothelial cancer should 
be reported as AEs if they worsen or change in character.  Clinical 
progression of urothelial cancer should not be reported as an AE. 
 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 31  
31 5.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if: 
• It results in death (i.e., the AE actua lly causes or leads to death).  
• It is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe fo rm, might have caused death.). 
• It requires or prolongs i npatient hospitalization. 
• It results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the AE results 
in substantial disruption of the pat ient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions). 
• It results in a congenital anomaly/birt h defect in a neonate/infant born to a 
mother exposed to the in vestigational product. 
• It is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on 
medical judgment (e.g., may jeopar dize the patient or may require 
medical/surgical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed above). 
All AEs that do not meet any  of the criteria for seri ous should be regarded as 
nonserious AEs. 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous.  Severity (or intensity) 
refers to the grade of a specific AE, e. g., mild (Grade 1), moderate (Grade 2), 
or severe (Grade 3) myocardial infarcti on (see Section 5.2.2).  “Serious” is a 
regulatory definition (see pr evious definition) and is based on patient or event 
outcome or action criteria usually asso ciated with events that  pose a threat to 
a patient’s life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as the guide for defining regulatory repor ting obligations from the Sponsor to applicable 
regulatory authorities.  
Severity and seriousness should be indep endently assessed when recording 
AEs and SAEs on the CRF. 
5.2 METHODS AND TIMING FOR A SSESSING AND RECORDING SAFETY 
VARIABLES 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are 
observed or reported duri ng the study, as outlined in Section 5.1.1, are 
recorded on the CRF and reported to the Sp onsor in accordance with protocol 
instructions.  
Death as a result of disease progr ession endpoints are only to be assessed 
as efficacy measures and not as AEs or SAEs. 
 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 32  
32 5.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which all AEs  and SAEs must be reported begins 
after informed consent is obtained and in itiation of study treatment and ends 
30 days following the last administrat ion of study treatment or study 
discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier.  After this period, 
investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study 
treatment. 
SAEs that are observed or reported prio r to initiation of study treatment 
should be recorded as SAEs on the CRF if they are associated with protocol-
mandated interventions (e.g., invasive  procedures such as biopsies, 
medication washout, or no treatment run-in). 
 
5.2.2 Assessment of Adverse Events  
Investigators will assess the occurrenc e of AEs and SAEs at all patient 
evaluation timepoints during the st udy.  All AEs and SAEs whether 
volunteered by the patient, discovered by  study personnel during questioning, 
or detected through physical examination,  laboratory test, or  other means will 
be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the appropriate AE or SAE 
CRF page. 
Each recorded AE or SAE will be descri bed by its duration (i.e., start and end 
dates), severity (see Table 3), regulator y seriousness criteria if applicable, 
suspected relationship to the investi gational product (see following guidance), 
and actions taken. 
The AE grading (severity) scale found in the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Advers e Events (NCI-CTCAE), Version 3.0, 
will be used for AE reporting. 
 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 33  
33 Table 3 
Adverse Event Grading (Severity) Scale 
Grade Severity Alternate Description a 
1 Mild (apply event-specific 
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria) Transient or mild discomfort 
(< 48 hours); no interference with the 
patient’s daily activities; no medical intervention/therapy required 
2 Moderate (apply event-specific  
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria) Mild to moderate interference with the 
patient’s daily activities; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required 
3 Severe (apply event-specific  
NCI-CTCAE grading criteria) Considerable interference with the 
patient’s daily activities; medical intervention/therapy required; hospitalization possible 
4 Very severe, life threatening,  
or disabling (apply event-specific NCI-CTCAE grading criteria) Extreme limitation in activity; 
significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospitalization probable 
5 Death related to AE  
Note:  Regardless of severity, some events may al so meet regulatory serious criteria.  Refer to 
definitions of an SAE (see Section 5.1.2). 
a Use these alternative definitions for Grade 1,  2, 3, and 4 events when the observed or 
reported AE is not in the NCI-CTCAE listing. 
 
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE ca usality assessments, investigators 
should apply the follo wing general guideline: 
• YES 
There is a plausible temporal relati onship between the onset of the AE and 
administration of the investigationa l product, and the AE cannot be readily 
explained by the patient’s clinical state,  intercurrent illness, or concomitant 
therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of response to the 
investigational product; and/or t he AE abates or resolves upon 
discontinuation of the in vestigational product or dose reduction and, if 
applicable, reappears upon re-challenge. 
• NO 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etio logy other than the investigational 
product (e.g., preexisting medical conditi on, underlying disease, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant m edication); and/or the AE has  no plausible temporal 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 34  
34 relationship to administration of the in vestigational product (e.g., cancer 
diagnosed 2 days after firs t dose of study drug). 
Note:  The investigator’s assessment of  causality for individual AE reports is 
part of the study documentat ion process.  Regardless of the “Yes” or “No” 
causality assessment for individual  AE reports, the Sponsor will promptly 
evaluate all reported SAEs against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible ne w safety findings to investigators 
and applicable regulatory authorities. 
 
5.2.3 SAE Reporting Guidelines
 
All STEAEs will be recorded on an MDACC Internal Adverse Event Form and 
faxed to: 
Genentech Drug Safety Fax: (650) 225-4682 or (650) 225-4683 AND: Arlene Siefker-Radtke, M.D. MD Anderson Cancer Center 1155 Pressler Street, Unit 1374 Houston, TX 77030 
Follow-up information:
 
Additional information may be added to a previously submitted report by 
completing a new MDACC Internal Ad verse Event Form and indicating “F/U 
Follow-Up” in the appropriate field.  
Occasionally, Genentech may contact the reporter for additi onal information, 
clarification or current status of th e subject for whom an adverse event was 
reported.  For questions regarding ST EAE reporting, you may contact the 
Genentech Drug Safety r epresentative noted above. 
5.3 PROCEDURES FOR ELICITING, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.3.1 Eliciting Adverse Events  
A consistent methodology of non-directiv e questioning for eliciting AEs at all 
patient evaluation timepoints should be adopted.  Examples of non-directive 
questions include:  
 “How have you felt since your last clinical visit?” 
Protocol 2007-0704 
March 11, 2010 
Page 35  
35 “Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last 
here?” 
5.4 EXPEDITED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
Investigators will submit wri tten reports of all SAEs, r egardless of attribution, 
to Genentech within 48 hours of learni ng of the events.  For initial SAE 
reports, investigators should record a ll case details that can be gathered 
within 48 hours.  The completed SAE form and SAE Fax Cover Sheet should be faxed immediately upon completi on to Genentech’s Drug Safety 
Department at: 
(650) 225-4682 
or  (650) 225-5288 
Relevant follow-up information shoul d be submitted to  Genentech’s Drug 
Safety as soon as it becomes available and/or upon request. 
 
5.5 TYPE AND DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS AFTER ADVERSE 
EVENTS 
All AEs and SAEs that are encounter ed during the protocol-specified AE 
reporting period should be followed to their resolutions, or until the 
investigator assesses them as stable, or  the patient is lo st to follow-up.  
Resolution of AEs and SAEs (with dates) should be documented on the 
appropriate AE page and in the patient’s m edical record to facilitate source 
data verification. 
For some SAEs, the Sponsor or its desi gnee may follow-up by telephone, fax, 
electronic mail, and/or a monitoring vi sit to obtain additional case details 
deemed necessary to appropriately eval uate the SAE report (e.g., hospital 
discharge summary, consultant repor t, or autopsy report).  Contact

37 6.3 INFORMED CONSENT 
The informed consent documents must  be signed by the patient, or the 
patient’s legally authoriz ed representative, before hi s or her participation in 
the study.  The case history for each patient shall document that informed 
consent was obtained prior to participat ion in the study.  A copy of the 
informed consent documents must be provi ded to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative.  If applicable, they will be provided in a 
certified translation of the local language. 
Original signed consent forms must be fil ed in the site study binder or in each 
patient’s study file. 
 
6.4 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVAL 
This protocol, the informed cons ent document, and relevant supporting 
information must be submitted to the IR B for review and must be approved 
before the study is initiat ed.  In addition, any adver tising materials must be 
approved by the IRB.  T he study will be conducted in accordance with U.S. 
FDA, applicable national and local health authority, and IRB requirements. 
The Principal Investigator is responsi ble for keeping the IRB apprised of the 
progress of the study and of any c hanges made to the protocol as deemed 
appropriate, but in any case the IRB mu st be updated at least once a year.  
The Principal Investigator must also keep the IRB informed of any significant 
adverse events. 
Investigators are required to  promptly notify their respective IRB of all adverse 
drug reactions that are both serious and un expected.  This generally refers to 
serious adverse events that are not al ready identified in the Investigator 
Brochure and that are cons idered possibly or probably related to the study 
drug by the investigator.  Some IRBs may have other specific adverse event 
requirements to which investigators ar e expected to adhere.   Investigators 
must immediately forward to their IRB any written safety report or update 
provided by Genentech (e.g., IND safety report, Investigator Brochure, safety 
amendments and updates, etc.). 
 
6.5 STUDY MONITORI NG REQUIREMENTS 
An important part of rout ine clinical trial management  is scheduled reporting.  
All trials must have and annual review every 365 days per CFR312.33.  The 
Office of Protocol Research will send a reminder notice 60 days prior to the 
anniversary of the last review.  The a ssigned research team must be able to 
report all protocol relat ed deaths, routine AEs, SAEs. 
Monitoring, accrual, eligibility eval uability, deviations, violations 
Protocol 2007-0704

Page 38  
38 Protocol specific checklists will be devel oped for the eligibility and protocol 
compliance review.  The following will be audited from  both source and 
database entry: 
a. Informed consent b. Eligibility/Evaluability c. Stratum or randomization d. Trial Management or  Treatment (correct dose/schedule/therapy) 
e. Scheduled assessments such as labwork and diagnostic tests 
f. Toxicities/adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) g. Response if appropriate, stopping ru les or safety assessments as 
written 
h. Off study evaluation i. Data verification against source 
 
Department Audit and Monitoring 
Each protocol not already monitored by a sponsor or the ORERM will be a 
priority for Departmental monitoring or audit.  The cases for audit will be 
chosen by reviewing the overall accrual .  A minimum of 10% patient accrual 
will be assessed.  The long term goal of the program is to audit 25% of patient 
accrual.   
 Once the patients are chosen we will audit a minimum of 1 course of therapy. 
The goal is to audit 30% of the protoc ol assessment points but the minimum 
will be 10%, or registration date in co mparison to treatment date, consent 
form, eligibility criteria , and a full cycle of therapy. 
 
6.6 DATA COLLECTION 
Data collection for this trial will meet  the required elements noted within the 
trial.

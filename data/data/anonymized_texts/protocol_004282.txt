Summary of changes to version 5.0 
Underline  indicates the addition and strikethrough  indicates the deletion in this summary.  
Administrative changes: Minor changes involving grammar, wordsmithing, punctuation, and 
other editorial changes have been made thro ughout the document and are not detailed in this 
summary.   
Overall rationale for changes in the protocol:  
This study includes a main study and a sub -study.  Up to 40 patients were expected to  be 
included in th is sub-study ( i.e. up to 10 patients per treatment group).  Due to unexpected 
recruitment difficulties , only 1 4 patients were randomized in the sub -study. In addition, the sub -
study site activities have been restricted due to  the COVID -19 pandemic which made the sub-
study assessments even more com plex if not impossible . The number of evaluable patients 
would have  been very low and the decision was made  by POXEL  to discontinue  the sub-study. 
Ongoing patients will continue the study visits and perform the assessments planned in the main 
study  but wil l not performed the assessments planned in the sub -study at End-of-treatment Visit 
(V7) . As a consequence, the sub -study objectives will be considered as exploratory.  
Other changes include  the addition of key secondary endpoints and minor editorial and 
typographical updates .

Secondary  Exploratory objectives for Sub -study only:  
• To assess the effect of PXL770 versus placebo in NAFLD patients on metabolic and non -
metabolic parameters at the daily dose of 250 md QD and BID and 500 mg QD after 12 
weeks of treatment:  
- Fructose stimulated  hepatic De Novo Lipogenesis (DNL)  
- Glycemic parameters during a 3 -hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)  
 The two tests being combined, OGTT will be a 3 -hour glucose + fructose tolerance 
test (OGTT+F)  
• To assess PXL770 plasma concentrations before, during and after the 3 -hour OGTT+F 
and fructose stimulated hepatic DNL assessment in NAFLD patients and correlation with 
pharmacodynamics and/or safety

Efficacy analyses  
Primary Endpoint :  
The primary endpoint, i.e. expressed as the relative change in the percentage of liver fat mass 
(assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7), will be 
analyzed in an analysis of covariance (ANCO VA) model adjusting for treatment (PXL770 doses 
of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo) and for stratification factors, i.e. 
T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients) and study site (main site 1 vs main 
site 2 vs main site 3 vs other s) and baseline liver fat mass as a covariate. Least square means 
(LSMs) of the primary endpoint for treatment groups and pairwise differences in LSMs will be 
estimated along with their unadjusted  p-values and 95% confidence intervals.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at  Week 12 (V7)  will be estimated using a multiple imputation method 
assuming missing at random (MAR) mechanism that will be detailed in the SAP. Missing 
baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated . 
[…] 
Key secondary Endpoints:  
• Absolute change in the percentage of liver fat mass from baseline (Randomization Visit 
(V3)) to Week 12 (V7): this will be analyzed in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model adjusting for treatment, T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients), s ite (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) and baseline liver fat mass. Least 
square means of the change in the percentage of liver fat mass for treatment groups 
(PXL770 doses of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo) and pairwise 
differences in LSMs will be estimated along with their unadjusted  p-values and 95% 
confidence intervals.  
• Responders (as defined in the Assessment for Efficacy Section ): Response will be 
defined for a patient when the (absolute) reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline 
(Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7)) is higher than or equal to 5% (≥ 5 %). 
The response  will be analyzed in a logistic regression model adjusting for treatment 
(PXL770  doses of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo), T2DM status 
(T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients), site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) 
and baseline liver fat mass.  Pairwise differences in treatment groups will be estimated 
in this model as odds ratios along with their p -values and 95% confidence interva ls. Corporate confidential information

8.3.8.2 DILI: edits  
To detect and monitor a possible DILI, the following evaluations should be performed in the 
presence of significant elevations of liver indices.  
[…] 
• Close observation for suspected drug -induced liver injury includes the following:  
- Repeating liver enzyme ( ALT, AST, and ALP) and TBL tests 2 or 3 times weekly. The 
frequency of repeat testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities 
stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the patient is asymptomatic.  
- Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  Corporate confidential information

- Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications 
and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, 
and special diets.  
- Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
- Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
- Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g. INR, direct 
bilirubin, lactate, liver ultrasound ). 
- Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
If a DILI is confirmed or suspected by the Investigator , or in case of liver function 
parame ters (ALT, AST, ALT, TBL) above the threshold defined in this section , the 
Investigator will complete an Expedited Liver Assessment Report page  form  (ELAR) in 
the eCRF within 24 hours of knowledge of the case  and submit it to Medpace Clinical 
Safety in the  same timelines as a SAE (see Section 8.3.6.4  Procedure for Reporting 
Immediately Reportable Events (IREs = SAEs and Pregnancy )). If the DILI is 
confirmed, it should be reported in addition as an AE (see Section 8.3.6.2 Methods of 
Recording and Assessing Adverse Events).  
 
9.4.2  Safety analyses and Safety Set : addition  
The Run -in Safety Analysis Set (RISS) is defined as all patients having received at least one 
dose of the single -blind placebo run -in treatment.  The population will be used to assess 
exposure and compliance with the single -blind placebo run -in treatment only.  
The Safety Analysis Set (SS) comprises all randomiz ed patients having received at least one 
dose of the study drug (either PXL770 or placebo) and considered as -treated. Safety and 
tolerability will be analyzed on the safety set.  
  
9.4.4  PK Population : edits  
The PK population corresponds to the Safety Set and includes all randomized patients who have 
been treated with PXL770 according to the protocol and have provided at least one pre -dose 
PK assessment during the study  with sufficient plasma to derive the C pre.

(assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7), will be 
analyzed in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for trea tment (PXL770 doses 
of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo) and for stratification factors, i.e. 
T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients) and study site (main site 1 vs main 
site 2 vs main site 3 vs other pooled sites) and baseline liver fat mass as a covariate.  Corporate confidential information

Least square means (LSMs) of the primary endpoint for treatment groups and pairwise 
differences in LSMs will be estimated along with their unadjusted  p-values and 95% confidence 
interval s.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at Week 12 (V7)  will be estimated using a multiple imputation method 
(fully conditional specification method) assuming missing at random (MAR) mechanism 
which will be detailed in the SAP. Missing baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated . 
Validity of the ANCOVA model will be checked (studentized residuals will be plotted against 
predicted values, etc.).   
 
9.5.2.1  Absolute Change in the percentage of liver fat mass : edits   
The (absolute) change in the percentage of liver fat mass (assess ed by MRI -PDFF) from 
baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7) will be analyzed in an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for treatment, T2DM status (T2DM patients versus 
non-T2DM patients), site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others)  and baseline liver fat mass. 
Least square means of the change in the percentage of liver fat mass for treatment groups 
(PXL770 doses of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo) and pairwise 
differences in LSMs will be estimated along with their unadjusted p-values and 95% confidence 
intervals.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at Week 12 (V7) will be estimated using a multiple imputation method 
(fully conditional specification method) assuming missing at random (MAR) mechanism 
which will be detailed in the SAP. Mi ssing baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated.  
Validity of the ANCOVA model will be checked (studentized residuals will be plotted against 
predicted values, etc.).  
The same sensitivity analyses proposed for the primary endpoint will be performed.  
 
9.5.2.2  Analysis of responders : edits     
Four types of responders will be proposed and analyzed:  
- Response will be  defined for a patient when the  as an (absolute ) reduction in liver fat 
mass (from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7)) is higher than or 
equal to 5% (≥ 5 %).  
- Response defined as a relative reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline 
(Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7)) higher than or equal to 30% (≥ 30 %).  
- Response defined as a relative reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline 
(Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7)) higher than or equal to 50% (≥ 50 %).  
-  Response defined as a liver fat mass value at Week 12 (V7 )) that is normalized, i.e. 
lower than or equal to 5% (≤ 5 %).  
Percentages of response will be estimated within each treatment group.  
The response will be analyzed in a logistic regression model adjusting for treatment (PXL770 
doses of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BI D and 500 mg QD and placebo), T2DM status (T2DM patients 
versus non -T2DM patients), site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) and baseline liver fat 
mass.  Pairwise differences in treatment groups will be estimated in this model as odds ratios 
along with  their p -values and 95% confidence intervals.  Corporate confidential information

 Exploratory  objectives for Sub -study only:  
• To assess the effect of PXL770 versus placebo in NAFLD 
patients on metabolic and non -metabolic parameters at the 
daily dose of 250  md QD  and BID and 500 mg QD after 12 
weeks of treatment:  
- Fructos e stimulated  hepatic De Novo Lipogenesis 
(DNL)  
- Glycemic parameters during a 3 -hour oral glucose 
tolerance test (OGTT)  
 The two tests being combined,  OGTT will be a  3-hour 
glucose + fructose tolerance test ( OGTT+F ) 
• To assess PXL770 plasma concentrations before, during 
and after the 3 -hour OGTT+F and fructose stimulated 
hepatic DNL assessment in NAFLD patients and 
correlation with pharmacodynamics and/or safety  
Trial Design and Plan  
(Design description in Figure 1 
and schedule of visits  in Table 1) Phase IIa, multi -center, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
randomized study with 4 parallel groups in NAFLD  patients.  
There will be a total of 4 study periods, as follows:  
• Screening period: maximum of 2 weeks  
• Single -blind placebo Run -in period: 4 weeks  
• Double -blind treatment period: 12 weeks  
• Follow -up period: 1 week  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either:  
• PXL770  250 mg QD 
• PXL7 70 250 mg BID 
• PXL770  500 mg QD 
• Placebo  
Randomization will be stratified according to type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients) and study site (main study site  1 vs main study site 2 vs 
main study site 3  vs other study sites).   
A sub -study will be performed in up to 3  study site s. This sub -
study will include:  
- A fructose stimulated hepatic DNL assessment  
- A 3-hour OGTT +F 
Planned Number of Patients  120 patients to be randomized in order to obtain at least 96 
evaluable patients (24 patients per treatment group) accounting 
for a 20% drop -out rate. Among the 120 randomized patients, up 
to 40 patients will be included in the sub -study ( i.e. up to  10 
patients per treatment group).

Statistical Methods  Sample size calculation  
Sample size determination is based on the primary endpoint, i.e. 
the relative percent change in liver fat mass (assessed by MRI -
PDFF) from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3) to  Week 12  
(V7) . 
Assuming an expected difference of 30% between at least one 
dose of  PXL770 and placebo , a common  standard deviation of 
30% (estimated from previous published data [1]), a two-sided 
significance level of 0.05, 24 patients per treatment group are 
required to achieve a power  of 90% . Given the early stage of 
development (i.e. a Phase II trial for internal decision) , no 
adjustment for comp arison multiplicity  will be considered . 
The s ample size is expanded to 30 patients per group to account 
for an expected 20% drop -out rate, which amounts to a total 
required number of 120 patients to be randomized . 
Statistical methods  
Full details of analyses will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the 
unblinding and locking of the database.

Efficacy analyses  
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint, i.e. expressed as the relative change in 
the percentage of liver fat mass (assessed by MRI -PDFF) from 
baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12  (V7) , will be 
analyzed in an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA) model 
adjusting for treatment ( PXL770  doses of 250 mg QD , 250 mg 
BID and 500 mg QD and placebo)  and for stratification factors, 
i.e. T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients) 
and study site (main site 1 vs main site 2 vs main site 3 vs 
others)  and baseline liver fat mass as a  covariate . Least square 
means (LSMs) of the primary endpoint for treatment groups 
and pairwise differences in LSMs will be estimated along with 
their p -values and 95% confidence intervals.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at Week 12  (V7)  will be estimated using a 
multip le imputation method assuming missing at random 
(MAR) mechanism that will be detailed in the SAP. Missing 
baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated  
Sensitivity analyses will be performed based on a rank analysis.  
Subgroup analyses will be performed : 
- withi n each T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients). The treatment by T2DM status interaction will be 
tested .  
- within each site (main site 1 vs main site 2 vs main site 3 vs 
other pooled sites). The treatment by site (main 1 vs main 2 vs 
main 3 vs others) interaction will be tested.

2 Background Information  
2.1 Scientific Rationale  
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease  associated with fat 
accumulation in the liver exceeding 5% in people with no or little alcohol consumption [2]. The 
development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) is the result of both environmental 
(sedentary lifestyle and excessive calorie intake) and individual predispositions, which  lead to 
adipose tissue expansion, insulin resistance, liver fat accumulation (steatosis or non -alcoholic fatty 
liver - NAFL) with potentially  development of inflammation and fibrosis (NASH) . The ultimate 
stage of cirrhosis contributes to hepatic impairment and development of hepato -carcinoma. 
NAFLD has shown  a rapid increase in prevalence worldwide  (25% in the global population) and 
is particularly  important in subjects with obesity, metabolic syndrome and T2DM reaching 70% to 
90% in these high -risk populations  [3]. It is estimated th at around 1.8 billion individuals have 
NAFLD  worldwide [4].  Up to now, the best therapeutic approach for NAFLD consists in diet and 
exercise. This approach has proven an efficacy evidenced by improvement of liver biopsy [5]. 
However, these important lifestyle modifications are difficult  to achieve  and to sustain for the wide 
majority of the population [6]. Although the initial description was published in 1980 [7], its full 
spectrum and impact as a major chronic liver disease have only been recognized for the past 2 
decades [8]. To date , no pharmacological agent has proven a clinically meaningful benefit/risk 
profile as potential drug for NAFLD , and, to  date, no drug has been recognized as standard 
pharmacotherapy and approved in this indication . Hence, there  is an unmet medical need for 
pharmacological agents for management of NAFLD  patients . 
The pathogenesis of NALFD is primarily driven by the progressive expansion of the adipose tissue 
secondary to poor lifestyle, triggering a low -grade inflammation state r esponsible for insulin 
resistance. Insulin resistance enhance s fatty acids ( FAs) release from the adipose tissue (lipolysis)  
towards the liver , FAs synthesis from carbohydrate in the liver  (DNL), both promoting unexpected 
FAs accumulation in the liver (steatosis) . Steatosis can stay uncomplicated for decades, but in a 
subset of subjects, inflammatory processes will develop leading to hepatocellular injuries and 
promoting fibrosis (steatohep atitis).  
5' adenosine monophosphate -activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) is an energy sensor that regulates 
cellular  metaboli sm in multiple peripheral tissues (liver, adipose tissue, muscle, pancreatic  
cells…). When activated under low energy condition , AMPK  stimulates catabolic pathways to 
produce energy (glucose uptake and lipid oxidation) while turning off energy consuming processes 
(gluconeogenesis and FA synthesis), in order to restore energy balance. In addition or in parallel 
to its metabolic effect, A MPK activation has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects, 
improving the cellular functional environment.  It is already well -established that AMPK activation 
by pharmacological compounds (metformin, thiazolidinediones), adipokines (leptin, adiponecti n)

or physical activity causes many beneficial metabolic changes in subjects with metabolic syndrome . 
New drugs that directly activate AMPK are expected to improve both glucose and lipid homeostasis 
and may bring a substantial improvement in the treatment of NAFLD.  
PXL770 is a new chemical entity from a new class of drug . It is a direct AMPK activator  and is 
currently under develop ment  in the treatment of NAFLD .  
2.2 PXL770  
2.2.1 Non-clinical Information  
PXL770 activates AMPK isoforms both allosterically and by protecting the enzyme from its 
dephosphorylation.  PXL770 binding involves 1 and 2 subunits.  PXL770 activates most of all 
12 AMPK complexes with a higher potency for 1 isoforms.  It triggers dow nstream AMPK 
signaling, including acetyl -CoA carboxylase ( ACC ) inhibition and peroxisome proliferator -
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 -alpha (PGC -1α) activation  in the liver, as well as hormone -
sensitive lipase (HSL ) inhibition in adipose tissue. PXL770 was shown in vitro  to induce inhibition 
in hepatic gluconeogenesis, to increase muscle glucose uptake, and to decrease hepatic  lipogenesis  
both in mouse and human hepatocytes . 
In various in vivo  rodent models of diabet es, PXL770 (25, 50, 75, 100 and 150 mg/kg BID orally) 
was shown to significantly decrease HbA1c  and basal glycemia , to improve oral glucose tolerance 
with a concomitant decrease in insulin secretion suggesting a potential insulin sensitizing effect, 
and to  delay the onset of diabetes.  A significant benefit in lipid profile was also observed with a 
significant decrease in plasma triglycerides and FFA.  PXL770 was shown also to improve liver 
steatosis.  
In a mouse model of NASH, PXL770 treatment increased AM PK phosphorylation, reduced liver 
weight, reduced liver triglyceride levels, reduced liver inflammation, and reduced markers of liver 
damage (including ALT and AST).  PXL770 also improv ed the overall NAFLD Activity Score, 
which is the sum of an individual’ s scores for steatosis, inflammation, and ballooning.  
A decrease in body weight during first days of treatment was only observed in some obese mouse 
models associated with a decrease in food intake.  During these first days of treatment 
gastrointestinal ( GI) events (diarrhea) were also observed in some specific obese mouse models.  
PXL770 administration with progressive dose escalation prevented the GI adverse reaction while 
still inducing a sustained decrease in food intake and in body weight. PXL770 admi nistered orally 
was tested up to 1000  mg/kg/day in the rat and was well -tolerated in the 4 -week study while in the 
13-week toxicity study, one satellite female rat in the 1000 mg/kg/day group died prematurely 
following clinical signs (hypothermia and decre ased activity). At the doses of 400 and 1000 mg/kg, 
some gastrointestinal symptoms were observed, mainly diarrhea, hypersalivation and abdominal Corporate confidential information

distension, with a dose -dependent increase in the incidence and severity of the symptoms. The no-
observed -adverse -effect -level ( NOAEL ) was considered to be 400 mg/kg/day in rat. In dog 
PXL770 was tested up to 300 mg/kg/day . In the 13 -week toxicity study , instances of severe liquid 
feces occurred that were considered adverse at doses of 300 mg/kg/day , but were completely and 
rapidly reversible. No treatment -related changes in cardiac function were observed during the 
13-week dosing period, as shown by telemetry and absence of glycogen accumulation in the heart. 
The NOAEL was cons idered to be 150 mg/kg/day in  dog. 
PXL770 did not show any evidence of genotoxicity  and no specific findings were reported during 
the safety pharmacology studies .  
2.2.2 Clinical Information  
The development of PXL770 started in Europe, and the following studies were conducted:  
• A first -in-human , single ascending  dose (SAD) , phase I study (PXL770 -001) to evaluate 
the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of single doses of PXL770 ranging from 
30 mg up to 500 mg and to assess the food effect  in Caucasian healthy male subjects.  
• A multiple ascending  dose (MAD) , phase I  study (PXL770 -002) to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of multiple doses of PXL770 ranging from 60 mg 
up to 500 mg for 10 days and to assess the drug -drug interaction with rosuvastatin  in 
Caucasian healthy male subjects.  
2.2.2.1  PXL77 0-001: SAD phase I study  
In this study, t he safety and tolerability profile of PXL770 doses up to  500 mg w ere very good. The 
only treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) considered possibly related to PXL770 was mild 
dizziness and occurred in the 250 mg  treatment  group.  
After a single oral dose of 30 mg to 500 mg, PXL770 is rapidly absorbed and distributed, and is 
eliminated according to a multi -exponential decay with a first elimination phase from 8h to 24h 
and a terminal elimination phase after 24h with an estimated terminal half -life ranging from 19h to 
30h (enterohepatic cycle) .  PXL770 is metabolized by the liver and is not eliminated in urine. The 
median time to reach the maximum concentration ( Tmax) is 1.5-2.5 hours across all doses.  Plasma 
exposures increase approximately linearly and dose proportionally.  PXL770 maximum 
concentration ( Cmax) and exposure decrease in presence of food by around 60%.    Dose escalation 
was stopped after a single dose of 5 00 mg as the corresponding PXL770 AUC inf exceeded the 
defined AUC PK cap (corresponding to plasma exposure observed in dog after 4 weeks of repeated 
administration at the NOAEL dose (100 mg/kg/day)) by around 11%. The maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD ) was not r eached.  A food effect was also investigated at the dose of 250 mg. There was a 
decrease in the C max (57% of fasting state) and in the exposure AUC 0-24h (67% of the fasting state) 
of PXL770 observed after a high fat breakfast compared to the values observed  in fasting condition.  Corporate confidential information

2.2.2.2  PXL770 -002: MAD phase I study  
In this study, t he safety and tolerability profile of PXL770 doses up to  500 mg were  good.  There 
were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) , nor premature discontinuation.  Related TEAE were 
reported in 17% of subjects receiving the placebo and in 36% of the subjects receiving PXL770  
without clear dose dependency . All AEs were of mild or moder ate intensity.  They were mainly 
from the gastrointestinal system  (transient abdominal pain or discomfort) or from the central 
nervous system  (headache) . All TEAEs were resolved at the end of the study. During the  drug-drug 
interaction assessment with rosu vastatin , only one TEAE (headache) was considered as related in 
the rosuvastatin alone group.  
PXL770 was rapidly absorbed and distributed. The elimination was multi -phasic with a slow 
terminal phase. The median T max was 1.5 -3 hours across all doses.  Plasm a exposures (C max and 
AUC inf) were approximately linear and dose proportional up to 375 mg and tended to saturate 
between 375 mg and 500 mg. Steady -state was reached after 6 days of treatment. The highest mean 
PXL770 C max and AUC inf were observed at the 37 5 mg dose and represented approximately 40% 
and 67% of their respective tox -covers. There was no relevant accumulation for C max but a slight 
accumulation for exposure was observed  (slightly exceeded one (up to 1.88 after QD regimen (60 
mg) and 1.96 at a BID regimen) after 10 days of treatment . The PK was show n to be time invariant. 
Inter -interindividual variability of the PK parameters was overall moderate. Urinary excretion of 
PXL770 after repeated oral administration was almost null. There was no clinical ly relevant drug -
drug interaction between PXL770 and rosuvastatin.  
A concentration -response model between QTcF and PXL770 concentrations was developed to 
describe the relationship between changes from baseline in QTcF (∆QTcF) and PXL770 plasma 
concentratio ns. 
Predicted ∆∆QTcF calculated for each dose level were always negative due to a shift in intercept 
for PXL770 treated subject compared to placebo. Indeed, the subjects receiving PXL770 had a 
difference of -3.2 msec in intercept compared to placebo subjec ts. However, this difference was 
not significant (p=0.4928) and did not suggest any model misspecification. The 90% CI upper were 
all below the regulatory threshold of 10 msec allowing to conclude that PXL770 is unlikely to 
induce QT/QTc prolongation.

4 Study Design  
4.1 Study Design and Schedule  
This study is  a phase IIa, multi -center, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized study with 4 
parallel groups in NAFLD patients.  
There will b e a total of 4 study periods, as follows:  
• Screening period: maximum of 2 weeks  
• Single -blind placebo Run -in period: 4 weeks  
• Double -blind treatment period: 12 weeks  
• Follow -up period: 1 week  
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive either:  
• PXL770  250 mg QD 
• PXL700  250 mg BID 
• PXL770  500 mg QD 
• Placebo  
Randomization will be stratified according to T2DM  status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients) and study site (main study site  1 vs main study site 2 vs main study site 3 vs other study 
sites).  
The study site stratification “Main study site # (1 to 3)” refers to sites of the sub -study only.  
A sub -study will be performed in up to 3  study site s. This sub -study will include:  
- A fructose stimulated hepatic DNL assessment  
- A 3-hour OGTT +F 
The diagram of the study design is shown in Figure 1 and the visit schedule is tabulated in Table 
1 and in  Figure 2.  
The duration of study  for each patient from the first visit for the informed consent signature (I CF) 
up to the end of the Follow -up period will be between 17 and 19 weeks.  
The End-of-study is defined as the date of last visit of last patient  participating in the study .  
4.2 Rationale for Study Design, Doses and Control Group  
This study is a phase II a, multi -center, double -blind, placebo -controlled, randomized, parallel -
group study in NAFLD  patients to assess the efficacy , safety and tolerability of PXL770  
administered as monotherapy , following International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E6 
Good Clinical Practice  (GCP) .  Corporate confidential information

The Single -blind placebo Run-in period is set to reduce  any bias regarding placebo effect , to assess 
patient compliance  and to minimize the possible confounding influence of dietary and activity 
changes . The 12 -week Double -blind treatment duration period is selected based on  the 
pharmacological data observed in the rodent NASH model . This duration is supported by the 13 -
week toxicological studies in rats and dogs.   The Follow -up period is set to examine the reversibility 
of potential AE after taking the last dose of IMP.  
The dose selection was based on the estimated dose range of effi cacy established during the 
pharmacological program and the PK, safety and tolerability observed in healthy subjects during 
the SAD/MAD phase I studies. The study has been designed to investigate the effects of  two daily 
doses ( 250 mg or 500 mg) and two re gimens ( QD or BID).  As a matter of fact, the Cmax and AUC inf 
were approximately linear and dose proportional from 60 mg up to 375 mg but they both tended to 
saturate between 375 mg and 500 mg (highest dose tested in the MAD phase I study but not the 
MTD).  As mentioned previously, the food affect s both the C max and the exposure of the drug (57% 
and 67% of the fasting values, respectively). The active dose range is expected to be 165 mg to 350 
mg QD based on the effects observed during the pharmacological studies in several animal models 
of NASH and T2DM. Considering the good tolerability of the drug in phase I and the food effect, 
the doses of 500 mg and 250 mg have been selected for evaluation in this proof of c oncept study, 
250 mg being  in the lower part  of the expected active dose  range  and 500 mg QD at the higher 
end of the active dose range . The once daily  regimen is expected to be the appropriate regimen 
based on the relatively long half -life of the compou nd. However, it is not fully determined  whether 
the effects of PXL770 are mainly driven by the Cmax or by the exposure as the half -life is shorter 
in the rodents  and most of the stud ies have been conducted with a twice daily regimen . So, it 
appeared  also critical to investigate the activity of the top dose ( 500 mg per day) administered as a 
twice daily regimen.   
A sub -study will be performed in up to 3  study site s. This will be a mechanistic study performed 
in T2DM or non T2DM  population . It is expected to include up to  10 patients per treatment group  
for a total of up to  40 patients.  Corporate confidential information

Patients will then be referred to their physician for the pursuit  of routine medical care.  
5.6 Criteria for Withdrawal from the Study for Randomized Patients during 
the Double -blind Treatment P eriod  
5.6.1 Criteria for withdrawal from the study  
Patients may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request.  
The Investigator must temporarily interrupt or permanently discontinue the IMP  if 
continued administration of the IMP  is believed to be detrimental to the pat ient well -being.  
IMP should be discontinued  and the patient should be withdrawn from the study  in the event 
of any of the following:  
1. Occurrence of an AE or SAE which is clinically relevant and affects patient’s safety, if 
discontinuation of the IMP is considered necessary by the Investigator or POXEL Medical 
Representative   
2. Occurrence of DILI (as defined in Section  8.3.8.2  DILI ) 
3. Occurrence of pregnancy  
4. Important p rotocol deviation if discontinuatio n of IMP is considered necessary by the 
Investigator or POXEL Medical Representative /designee  
5. Intake of non -permitted drug (as defined in Section  6.5 Non-permi tted Medicines ) if 
discontinuation of IMP is considered necessary by the Investigator or POXEL Medical 
Representative /designee  
6. Requirement of an e mergency unblinding (as described in Section 6.3.3.2  Emergency 
Unblinding   
7. Withdrawal of patient informed consent  
8. Lost to follow -up  
9. Sponsor decision  (as defined in Section  5.7 Discontinuation of the Study ) 
In case of temporary discontinuation of the IMP, the decision to resume the IMP should be taken 
in agreement by the Investigator, POXEL Medical Representative and Medpace  Medical Monitor . 
5.6.2 Procedure for withdrawal  from the study  
In the case of discontinuation of IMP  for any reason listed in Section 5.6.1  Criteria for 
withdrawal from the study  except SAE leading to death and lost to follow -up, patients will be 
asked to perform an Early Termination Visit  within 11 days after the IMP discontinuation . 
At the Early Termination Visit, patients will be considered as withdrawn patients. This visit 
will allow the Investigator to check the medical st atus of the patient and the patient to return all the 
IMP blister cards ( used and unused ), his/her patient diary  and the SMBG device for review if  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  50 / 110 
applicable . The SMBG device will be kept by the patient after the end of his/her study participation 
if applicable. Investigator will complete the eCRF (Early Termination Visit section).   
The reason and date for withdrawal from the study must be documented in source d ocuments, in 
the eCRF and reported in the IWRS. If more than one reason of study withdrawal is given, the 
Investigator should make all efforts to establish the main reason.  
If there is any medical reason for withdrawal from the study, the patient will rema in under the 
supervision of the Investigator until satisfactory health has returned. The Investigator must make 
every effort to collect the information related to the outcome of the event.  This information is 
recorded in the part of eCRF dedicated to AEs. If the Investigator cannot organize a follow -up visit 
to collect this information, he/she must try to call the patient and/or his/her treating physician. If 
the IMP is discontinued as a result of a SAE, the procedure described in Section 8.3.6.4  Procedure 
for Reporting Immediately Reportable Events (IREs = SAEs and Pregnancy ) is to be 
implemented.  
If patients are lost to follow -up, all reasonable means of contact must be used. In addition, a letter 
must be sent to the patient and a copy filed in the patient file  (if allowed by site’s S tandard 
Operating Procedure s). All the attempts (at least 3 by telephone by the Investigator or Clinical 
Research Coordinator (CRC) at study site) must be recorded in the patient file and reported in the 
eCRF.  
Irrespective of the withdrawal reasons, any withdrawal is to be notified immediately to the 
Medpace  Medical Monitor and Poxel Medical Representative.  
5.7 Discontinuation of the Study  
The whole study may be discontinued by POXEL  in the event of any of the follo wing:  
• New information leading to unfavorable risk -benefit ratio of IMP, e.g. due to:  
▪ Occurrence of significant previously unknown adverse reactions or unexpectedly 
high intensity or incidence of known adverse reactions, or  
▪ Other unfavorable safety findings  
• POXEL’s decision that continuation of the study is unjustifiable for medical or ethical reasons  
• Poor enrollment of patients making completion of the study within an acceptable time frame 
unlikely  
• Discontinuation of development of the POXEL’s IMP  
Competent Authorities and institutional review boards /ethics committee s (IRB s/ECs) will be 
informed about the discontinuation of the study in accordance with applicable regulations.

6 Investigational Medicinal Product and Other Drugs Used in the 
Trial  
According to the Article 2(d) of Directive 2001/20/EC, t he definition of  an “Investigati onal 
Medicinal Product (IMP)” is a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo tested or 
used as a reference in a clinical trial , including products already with a marketing authorization but 
used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way di fferent from the authorized form, or when 
used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized 
form”  [9]. 
In this study, the term inology  IMP refers both to PXL770  or placebo.  
The IMP administered are  hard gelatin capsules (Swedish orange size 00) . The capsules are 
packaged in blisters .   A description of the two types of capsules, PXL770 and placebo, is given in 
the IB  [10]. 
All IMPs will be produced i n accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Annex 13 
of GMP dedicated to IMP.  
6.1 Description of Investigational Medicinal Product  
PXL770 capsules  will contain 250 mg of PXL770  plus the excipients. The active pharmaceutical 
ingredient is the monohydrate potassium salt of PXL770. Placebo capsules will contain excipients 
alone, as described in the IB  [10]. Both capsules  have the same shape, size and appearance 
(including the sam e color, smell and taste) .  
6.2 Dosage and Administration  
PXL770 and/ or placebo capsules will be taken BID with a glass of water. An optimal interval 
between the two IMP intakes would be 12 ± 2 hours. The interval of IMP intake s must not be less 
than 6 hours.  
To harmonize IMP intake, it is recommended to take IMP at least 15 min before a meal in the 
morning time and in the evening time.   
No IMP should be taken in the morning at home before each on-site visit. IMP will be taken at 
study site  after all  visit assessments are performed  as specified in Table 1. 
Patients will be provided with the patient diary (paper format) as specified in  Table 1. IMP intake 
(date and time) will be documented by  the patients in the patient diary .  
The patient diary is to be returned at each visit together with the IMP  kit(s) ( used and unused ).  Corporate confidential information

6.2.1 Single -blind Placebo  Run-in Period  
At Run -in Visit (V 2), patients will start an oral dose of 2 capsules  of placebo BID (4 capsules  per 
day). The Single -blind placebo Run -in period will last for 4  weeks from Run-In Visit (V2) to 
Randomization Visit (V3). 
First dose intake of IMP will be taken by the patient in the evening time on the day of  Run-in Visit 
(V2). Last IMP intake will be at study site on  the day of Randomization Visit (V 3) (morning time; 
after completion of all pre -dose assessments ). 
6.2.2 Double -blind Treatment Period  
The Double -blind treatment  period starts on the day of the Randomization Visit (V 3) (evening 
time) , following randomization to one of the 4 double -blind treatment groups in this study. On the 
day of Randomization Visit (V 3), the  first dose of Double -blind treatment period IMP will be taken 
by the patient in the evening.  
To ensure a double-blind design, regardless of the treatment group, all patients  will take an oral 
dose of  2 capsule s BID of either placebo and/or PXL 770 250 mg depending on the group they have 
been allocated to:  
Table 2. Treatments to be administered in the 4 treatment g roups  
Treatment Group  Number of Capsule s (Total = 4 Capsules /Day)  
PXL770 250 mg QD (250 mg/day)  - 1 capsule of PXL770  250 mg + 1 capsule of placebo 
in the morning  
- 2 capsule s of placebo in the evening  
PXL770 250 mg BID (500 mg/day)  - 1 capsule of PXL770  250 mg + 1 capsule of placebo 
in the morning  
- 1 capsule of PXL770  250 mg + 1 capsule of placebo 
in the evening  
PXL770 500 mg QD (500 mg/day)  - 2 capsule s of PXL770  250 mg in the morning  
- 2 capsule s of placebo in the evening  
Placebo  - 2 capsule s of placebo in the morning  
- 2 capsule s of placebo in the evening  
The Double -blind treatment period will last for 12 weeks after Randomization Visit (V 3). 
The last dose of each IMP kit should be taken by the patient at site in the morning of the visit after 
completion of all pre -dose assessments. Then, the first dose from the  new IMP kits dispensed 
during the visit should be taken in the evening time on the day of the visit.  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  54 / 110 
Last IMP intake will be at study site  on the day of End-of-treatment Visit (V7) (morning time; after  
completion of all pre -dose assessments ). 
6.2.3 Follow -up Period  
The Follow -up period starts at the end of the 12-week Double -blind treatment period. At the End-
of-treatment Visit (V 7), patients will not receive a n IMP kit and consequently they will not take 
IMP during the follow -up period.  
The Follow -up period will last for 1 week. 
6.3 Treatment Assignment and Blinding  
Allocation of patients to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an IWRS and will be 
performed according to the IWRS manual.  
6.3.1 Patient Numbering  
Patients will be identified during the whole study (V1 to V8) by a patient number assigned at 
Screening Visit (V1).  
The patient number consist s of a unique 5-digit number using the schema X X-YYY . The first 2 
digits (X X) indicate the pre -defined study site  number. The last 3  digits ( YYY ) identify the patient 
within the study site . The first patient entered in a study site  will be assigned the number 001, the 
second will be assigned the number 002, and so on. For example, patient 04-001 will be the first 
patient screened at study site  04. So that each patient is numbered uniquely across all clinical 
database s (IWRS, eCRF…).  
Upon ICF signature by the patient and the Investigator, the Investigator (or designee) will register 
the patient in the IWRS. The patient number will be created and allocated automatically by the 
IWRS. Once assigned, the patient number must not be reused for any other patient and the patient 
number for this patient must not be changed.  
6.3.2 Treatment Assignment or Randomization  
Single -blind placebo Run -in period  
At Run -in Visit (V 2), once  eligibility criteria have been checked by the Investigator, the 
Investigator (or designee) will log on to the IWRS to confirm the patient eligibility and enter the 
patient into the Single -blind placebo  Run-in period for 4  weeks.  
Double -blind treatment  period  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  55 / 110 
At Randomization Visit (V 3), after  re-confirming the eligibility criteria, the Investigator (or 
designee) will log on to the IWRS to re -confirm the eligibility and enter the patient into the Double -
blind treatment period. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 :1:1 ratio to receive either PXL770  250 
mg QD, 250 mg BID, 500 mg QD or placebo for 12 weeks.  
Randomization will be stratified according to T2DM status  (T2DM patients  versus non-T2DM 
patients ) at Randomization Visit (V 3) and according to study site s (main study site  1 vs main study 
site 2 vs main study site 3 versus other study site s).  
Patients wi ll be assigned a unique randomization number at the Randomization Visit (V 3) by 
IWRS. This randomization number identifies which record in the randomization list and therefore 
which treatment will be allocated to the patient.  
The randomization list will be generated and kept by the Medpace statistical department  by a 
statistician independent of the project team . A copy will be provided to Creapharm  in charge of 
medication packaging and logistics, and to the b ioanaly tical laboratory in charge of  the PK 
assessments on samples from patients  receiving PXL770 . 
During the Double -blind treatment period, at each on -site visit (except at Week 2 (V4)) after all 
visit assessments and safety evaluation are performed, the Investigator (or de signee) will log on to 
the IWRS for IMP kit allocation.  
All confirmation reports generated by IWRS must be stored at least in the patient  file. 
6.3.3 Treatment Blinding  
6.3.3.1  Method of Blinding  
The study will be conducted using a Double -blind design with a placebo capsule  that has the same 
shape, size and appearance (including the same color, smell and taste) as the PXL770 capsules . 
Whatever the dose group they will be assigned to, patients will receive the same number of capsule s 
(PXL770 and/or placebo) in order to keep the blind, both during the Single -blind placebo Run -in 
period and the Double -blind treatment period.  
PXL770 and placebo capsules  will be identical in packaging, labelling, schedule of administration 
and appearance. T raceability of the IMP kit content is ensured by the IMP kit number and the 
randomization list.  
Blinded IMP will be assigned according to a computerized randomization list using the IWRS. The 
IWRS will assign IMP kits containing blinded medication for eac h patient at  each visit requiring 
IMP kit dispensation .  Corporate confidential information

6.3.3.2  Emergency Unblinding  
Only in case of emergency, the Investigator  is authorized to access the IWRS’s randomization 
system using the randomization code break provided at the beginning of the study.  
Code -breaking can be accessed via internet. The exact description of the treatment assigned to the 
individual patient will be accessible. A code -break can thus be made for any patient without 
affecting the double -blind nature of the study. Patients IMP information may only be accessed in 
the event of an emergency and out of necessity to know the identity of the allocated IMP in order 
to institute appropriate therapeutic management. The Investigator is obliged to make every effort 
to discuss the code -break with POXEL and  Medpace  before code breaking. Once the code is 
broken for a patient, this patient must discontinue IMP , perform Early termination Visit and 
withdraw from the study . 
In the event that a code -break is performed, the Investigator will receive a confirmation by email 
from IWRS. The Investigator must document on the confirmation printout the reason for the code -
break, and sign the document. The document has to be kept in a  safe place until the end of the 
study. Once a code has been broken, the Investigator must confirm the unblinding to the Clinical 
Research Associate (CRA) , the Medpace Medical Monitor and the Poxel Medical Representative  
within 24 hours in writing.  
POXEL a nd / or its designee(s) will also receive an authorization to access IWRS’s randomization 
information and will be attributed a specific access code that can be used if a suspected Serious 
Adverse Reaction (SA R) occurs, to assess the expectedness of the rea ction. Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions ( SUSARs) need  to be reported according to regulatory requirements 
(see Section  8.3.6.4  Procedure for Reporting Immediately Reportable Events (IREs = SAEs and 
Pregnancy )). 
6.4  Concomitant Medications and Therapies  
The use of any systemic medication will be restricted during the study, with the exception of 
ongoing authorized medications, and/or potential medications that could be required for  the 
patient’s welfare, apart from cont ra-indicated medications as listed in Section  6.5 Non-permi tted 
Medicines .  
As far as possible, no change should be made to the dosing of these concomitant medications from 
the ICF signature  to the End -of-study Visit (V 8). Patients must not take any unlicensed medication, 
i.e. other investigational drugs except PXL770  or placebo, during their participation in the study.   
Medications taken within 28 days prior to ICF signature and stopped before or on ICF signature 
date will be considered as prior medication.   
 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  57 / 110 
Medications that are ongoing before and continue after the ICF signature  will be considered as 
concomitant medication.  
Medications that will be prescribed during  the study ( from the ICF signature to End -of-study  Visit 
(V8)) will be considered as new medication.  
Any concomitant medication must be recorded in the corresponding section of the eCRF, its dose, 
dosage form, frequency, date of onset and stop date of the medication, indication, reason and route 
used. Patients should inform the Investigator of any change in their usual treatment and any change 
should be recorded. All patients will be questioned about concomitant medication at each study 
visit.  
6.5 Non-permi tted Medicines  
Patients must not take any of the following licensed medication within the 24 weeks prior to the 
Screening Visit (V1):  
• Pioglitazone  
• Insulin  
• GLP1 -RA 
• SGLT2 -I 
• Anticoagulant agents  
• Amiodarone  
• Bile salt chelators  
• Methotrexate  
• Equal o r more than 4 00 U of vitamin E per day  
• Corticosteroids with significant systemic effect (e. g. oral or intravenous  administrations ) 
• Any other medications know n to affect liver function  / steatosis at the Investigator’s 
discretion  
• Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (i.e. gemfibrozil and clopidogrel) and CYP2C9 (i.e. tazizulam, 
miconazole and sulfaphenazole)  
• Rifampin (moderate inducer of both CYP2C8 and CYP2C9)  
• Any herbal drug or Chinese traditional medicines  
If, during the study, the administration of a non -permitted concomitant drug occurs or becomes 
necessary, e.g. because of AE, the Investigator together with the POXEL Medical Representative 
and Medpace  Medical Monitor  will decide whether the patient can continue the  IMP. Corporate confidential information

6.6 Packaging and Labeling  
PXL770  and placebo capsules  will be packaged in appropriate blister  and will be labeled in English  
with respect to the regulatory requirements in the US. 
Blister : A blister contains  32 capsules  corresponding to 8 days of BID treatment. The morning and 
evening doses will be clearly identified. The patient must strictly follow these indications.  
IMP  kit: An IMP kit contains 4 blisters ( 128 capsules  – 32 days).  
• During the Single -blind placebo Run -in period , 1 IMP kit containing 4 blisters (total of 
4 blisters – 128 capsules  – 32 days) will be dispensed at  Run-in Visit  (V2). 
• During the Double -blind treatment  period, 1 IMP kit containing 4 blisters (total of 4 blisters 
– 128 capsules  – 32 days) will be dispensed at each dispensing visit.  
IMP kit numbering  
The IMP kit number will identify medication packs.  
Packaging and labeling will be in accordance with applicable US regulatory requirements . 
6.7  Management of IMP  
The Investigator (or designee) will be responsible for the IMP storage, dispensing, stock inventory, 
accountability and return in the view of destruction of all IMP kits.  
6.7.1 Shipment of IMP  
The depot will store and supply IMPs to the study  sites. The shipments will contain the IM P kits  
as agreed upon for the timely completion of the clinical study, once the necessary regulatory 
documents have been received.  
6.7.2 Supply and Receipt of IMP  
Upon receipt of IMP, the Investigator (or designee) will check for accurate delivery and 
acknowledg e receipt via IWRS. The receipt and inventory of IMP in the study  site is tracked in 
IWRS. Furthermore, IMP stock at study site must be followed and documented by the Investigator 
(or designee) on a Master Accountability log  throughout the whole duration of the study.  
IMP resupply will be managed automatically through IWRS.

Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  59 / 110 
6.7.3 Storage of IMP  
The Investigator (or designee) will ensure that all IMPs are stored under recommended storage 
conditions and in accordance with applicable  US regulatory requirements. IMP  must be carefully 
and safely stored at the study site, and separately from other drugs, in a locked area under the 
responsibility of the Investigator (or designee). Only the Investigator (or designee) will have access 
to this room.  
The storage condition of IMP will be indicated in the pharmacy manual.  
The Investigators (or designee) are reminded to check temperature daily ( e.g. manually)  and before 
the first dispensation of the day, at least on every working day (i.e. manua lly or by using alarm 
system to alert of any excursions)  and ensure that thermometers are working correctly as required 
for proper storage of IMP. Any temperature excursions should be addressed according to the 
procedures described in the pharmacy manual.  
Under no circumstances, the Investigator is allowed to use IMP in conditions other than described 
in the protocol and the pharmacy manual otherwise the insurance coverage will become null and 
void.  
It must be ensured at the study site that IMP is not disp ensed to a patient with an expiry date prior 
to the date of the patient’s next on-site visit. The IMP expiry  date might be extended after the drug 
stability has been re -analyzed. In such case, IMP should then be re -labeled before dispensation. 
The re -labeling of the medication will be performed by an authorized person at the US depot, 
following appropriate instr uctions and documented. Further details of procedures will be described 
in the pharmacy manual.  
6.7.4 Dispensing, Accountability and Compliance of IMP  
IMP dispensing  
Only the IMP kit number assigned by the IWRS will be dispe nsed to the patient. The dispensing 
of the IMP will be carefully recorded on the appropriate drug accountability logs provided by 
Medpace . 
IMP accountability  
The Investigator (or designee) must maintain an accurate record as follows:  
• Master Accountability  log recording IMP receipt, dispensing and return by the CRA to the 
depot for destruction. The global stock at study site level must be carefully tracked and 
documented on this log. The Investigator (or designee) should ensure that this stock is 
consistent with the inventory described in IWRS.  Corporate confidential information  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  60 / 110 
• Subject Accountability  log recording IMP dispensing and IMP return by patient detailed in 
terms of number of capsules.    
For both logs, dates, quantities, dose, batch numbers, expiry dates and init ials of the Investigator 
(or designee) must be recorded.  
The supplies, inventory and accurate IMP documentation must be available for monitoring visit, 
audit by the designated representatives of POXEL or inspection by regulatory authorities, upon 
request.   
Any unused IMP must not be discarded or used for any other purpose than the present study. IMP 
that has been dispensed to a patient must not be re -dispensed  to the patient neither  to a different 
patient.  
IMP compliance  
Compliance will be calculated by th e Investigator (or designee) from Run-in Visit ( V2) to 
Randomization Visit (V 3) for the Single -blind Run -in period and from Randomization Visit ( V3) 
to End-of-treatment Visit ( V7) (from Day 0 to Week 12) for the Double -blind treatment period 
based on the patient diary and IMP kits returned by the patient.   
The Investigator (or designee) must document the IMP compliance in source document  and in the 
eCRF . In case of inconsistency between data in the patient  diary and IMP returned, the Investigator 
(or designee) should question the patient and the reported compliance will be based on Investigator 
judgment.  
The compliance will be calculated using the following formula based on the medication returned:  
Number of capsules  taken×100 
Theoretical number of capsules  to be taken during the period (based on on-site visit days )*  
* In case of IMP temporary interruption requested by the Investigator (e.g. due to AE), the duration 
of the temporary interruption should be deducted from the theoretical number of capsule s to be 
taken during the period.  
The acceptable compliance will be wit hin 80 % - 120%  (≥80 % - ≤120%) . If at any visit the 
compliance does not fall within this range,  it must be reported as a protocol deviation  (if it occurs 
during Double -blind treatment period)  and the Investigator must remind the patient to follow the 
IMP instructions.

6.7.5 Return and Destruction of IMP  
The Investigator (or designee) will reconcile capsules  returned by the patients with the Subject 
Accountability Logs . The CRA will verify and confirm this reconciliation by checking IMP 
accountability logs and all IMP returns (both unused and used kits). Thereafter, the CRA will place 
IMP kits in sealed containers to be sent to a predefined location designated by POXEL,  for interim 
storage. The description of IMP kits returned will be recorded on a form completed by the CRA 
and signed by the Investigator (or designee). The allowed number of sealed container returns by 
the study site is described in the pharmacy manual.  
Upon database lock and after green light from POXEL, the company in charge of IMP destruction 
will proceed with IMP kits destruction (both unused and used). They should provide certificates of 
destruction including but not limited to destruction dates, qua ntities and batch numbers.  
6.8 Overdose  
The packaging has been designed to prevent any overdose with a clear indication on the blisters of 
the morning and evening dose to be taken per day. Moreover, to limit the risk of overdosing while 
still allowing some fle xibility in the Double -blind treatment period duration, only 1 extra  daily dose 
is available per week. In total, 4 extra  daily doses are provided between 2 on-site visits (4 weeks).  
For Week 2 (V4, 2 weeks after randomization), patients will have to come at the visit with the IMP 
kit but no other kit will be provided. Patients will continue to use the IMP kit provided at 
Randomization Visit (V3) until Week 4 (V5, 4 weeks after randomization).  
6.8.1 Preclin ical and Clinical Status  
Clinical data available so far with PXL770  showed a good safety and tolerability profile in healthy 
Caucasian male subjects after single administration of PXL770  up to 500 mg and multiple 
administrations ( 10 days) up to 500 mg QD. The dose of 500 mg QD is the maximal dose tested in 
humans.  
6.8.2 Overdose Definition  
Based on available data, an overdose is considered as any dose greater than the hi ghest daily dose 
administered as single or repeated doses in the phase I study ( i.e. 500 mg per intake and per day ). 
Plasma exposures (C max and AUC inf) were approximately linear and dose proportional up to 375 
mg and tended to saturate between 375 mg and 5 00 mg. Steady -state was reached after 6 days of 
treatment. The median T max is 1.5 -2.5 hours across all doses.  Plasma exposures increase 
approximately linearly and dose proportionally.  PXL770 C max and exposure decrease in presence 
of food by around 60%.     Corporate confidential information

However, this study will be blinded during the Double -blind treatment p eriod. As the daily dose 
received will be unknown up to the end of the study, an overdose can only be identified relying on 
the number of capsules administered over a defined period of time.  
Based on data obtained duri ng the single and repeated dose administration up to 500 mg in healthy 
subjects , overdose is defined by the intake of 3 capsules  or more per intake  and/or  more than 4 
capsules  per day  (if morning and evening indications are followed)  and/or 3 capsules  or more per 
day if at least 3 capsules come from the morning part of the blister).   
Error in dosing schedule may happen as for instance misdosing (i.e. 4 capsules QD in place of 2 
capsules  BID). In such cases, dosing error will be recorded in the patient file by the Investigator 
and reported as a protocol deviation by the CRA. Patient will be retrained by the Investigator and 
it will be documented in source documents.  
In any case, these overdoses based on number of capsules  will need to be confirmed at the end of 
the study, once unblinding and identification of the treatment group will allow real dose calculation. 
Only doses exceeding 500 mg per day will be  considered as overdose.  
Conclusion on overdose will be included in the final study report.  
6.8.3 Reporting  
Any suspicion of overdose, when occurring in the Double -blind  treatment period, whether or not 
associated with an AE (serious or non -serious) must be reported to POXEL /Medpace  in an 
expedited manner .  
6.8.4 Treatment

7 Study Pro cedures  
At each visit, i t will be  recommended to perform the assessments in the following order: ECGs, 
vital signs and blood samplings. Blood sampling for PK analysis should be collected nearest to the 
scheduled time point.  
7.1 Screening  Perio d, Screening Visit (V1): On -site Visit  
Eligible  patients (see definition in section  5.1 Inclusion Criteria ) will be informed about the study 
in detail and sign the ICF prior to any study -related procedure.  Re-screening will not be allowed.  
The Screening period starts from the date of ICF signature.  
On the basis of the findings from the assessments made at this visit, the Investigator will decide 
whether the patient is to be included in the study.   
The following procedures will be completed:  
• Obtain written ICF 
• Register the patient in the IWRS to retrieve his/her patient study number   
• Review Inclusion and Exclusion criteria  
• Obtain demography  (year of birth , age, gender, ethnic origin , race , child -bearing potential if 
woman)  
• Obtain complete medical history (including liver disease history, diabetes history, history of 
drug abuse, alcohol and tobacco consumptio n) 
• Collect AE

8 Study Assessments  
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are completed 
as described.  
8.1 Blood Volume  
The total blood sampling volume for individual patients in this study  will be  described in the central 
laboratory manual.  
Additional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by the Investigator 
(in case of safety issue for example) with the agreement of POXEL Medical Representative.  
8.2 Efficacy Assessment  
8.2.1 Liver fat mass assessed by MRI-PDFF  – Central imaging core lab  
The primary evaluation of efficacy will be based on MRI -PDFF . This primary endpoint will be the 
relative change in the percentage of liver fat mass (assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline 
(Randomi zation Visit ( V3)) to Week 12 ( End-of-treatment Visit, V7).  
As key secondary efficacy endpoint s, the (absolute) change in the percentage of liver fat mass 
(assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline  (Randomization Visit (V3))  to Week 12 (V7) and the 
percentage of responders defined by the percentage  of patient s who achieve a clinically meaningful 
reduction of at least 5 %  (≥ 5%)  in absolute liver fat mass  as measured by MRI -PDFF at Week 12  
(V7)  will be also compared between placeb o and PXL770  groups.  
Local MRI facilities in each study site  will complete a qualification and quality assurance process 
prior to perform MRI acquisitions. MRI scans will be then performed on qualified and standardized 
devices at high field strength (either 3 or 1.5 Tesla) without enhanced contrast agents. MRI -PDFF  
acquisition protocols will include the acquisition guidelines for multi -echo PDFF sequence for 
most common manufacturers (GE, Siemens, Philips) and field strength (1.5T and 3.0T) . All 
acquisitions images will be transfer red to the Medpace Core Laboratorie s for central calculation 
and measurement of MRI -PDFF using a validated and established technique. The imaging 
submission manual will provide sites with information on data submission to Medpace Core 
Laboratories. Central readings will be performed by mask ing study site s, timepoints, clinical data 
and treatment groups information.  
Fat mass results of MRI -PDFF at Randomization Visit  (V3) and Week 12  (End-of-treatment Visit, 
V7) will be blinded for Investigators and POXEL until database hard lock.   
 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  72 / 110 
MRI -PDFF technique will be exclusively used for assessment of liver fat mass. The image 
acquisition technique and programmable sequences used for MRI -PDFF in the study will restrict 
the obtainable diagnostic information to liver fat quantity and will not support it s use for other 
clinical purposes.  
Please refer to central imaging core lab manual for further details.  
8.2.2 Other Efficacy P arameters  
The following parameters will be also determined at various timepoints to further assess efficacy:  
• Liver enzymes: ALT and AST  
• Measured m etabolic parameters: FPG, HbA1c, serum insulin, C-peptide, total cholesterol, 
HDL -c, LDL -c, triglycerides, Apo A1, Apo B, FFA, glycerol  and adiponectin  
• Calculated metabolic  parameters: HOMA -IR, QUICKI,  HOMA -β, Adipo -IR 
The homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR), the quantitative insulin 
sensitivity check index  (QUICKI) and the homeostasis model assessment of β -cell function 
(HOMA -ß) will be calculated  using the fasting  insulin  and FPG values at visits specified in 
Table 1. The adipo -IR will be calculated using  fasting insulin and fasting FFA .  
- The HOMA -IR is calculated as  [11]:  
Fasting insulin (µIU/mL) × FPG (mg/dL) / 405  
- The QUICKI is calculated as  [12]:  
1 / (log (FPG (mg/dL)) ＋ log (Fasting insulin (µIU/mL)))  
- The HOMA -ß is calculated as  [11]:  
(Fasting insulin (µIU/mL) × 360) / (FPG (mg/dL) – 63) 
- The Adipo -IR is calculated as  [13]: 
Fasting FFA (mmol/L) x Fasting insulin (µIU/mL)  
To minimize the variability in insulin concentration, two blood samples should be collected at 
a 10-min interval at each timepoint  these metabolic parameters are calculated . In the above 
formulas, the mean of the two insulin results will be used.  
• hsCRP and other biomarkers of inflammation: fibrinogen  and MCP -1 
• Fibrosis biomarkers: NAFLD Fibrosis score  (NFS)  and Fib-4 score  
The NFS is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory measurements (i.e. age, 
glycemia, BMI, platelet, albumin and AST/ALT ratio). This score has been validated in a large 
cohort of patients with biopsy -proven NAFLD (> 700 patients)  [14].  
- NFS is calculated as [14]:  
1.675 + 0.037 x age (years) + 0.094 x BMI (kg/m²) + 1.13 x I mpaired Fasting Glucose or 
Diabetes  (yes =1; no=0) + 0.99 x AST/ALT ratio – 0.013 x platelet (109/L) – 0.66 x 
albumin (g/dL)  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  73 / 110 
The Fib-4 score is based on a combination of clinical and laboratory (i.e. age, platelets, AST, 
ALT). This score has been created and validated in different cohorts of patients  [15, 16].  
- Fib-4 score is calculated as [15]:  
(Age (years) x AST (U/L))/ (platelet (109/L) x √(ALT (UI/L)))  
• Body weight, waist circumference  and waist -to-hip ratio  
For Sub -study only:  
Fructose stimulated hepatic DNL assessment  and OGTT +F will be performed at baseline 
(Randomization Visit (V3)) and at Week 12 (End -of-treatment Visit, V7).  The following 
parameters will be determined : 
• Fructose stimulated h epatic DNL as assessed by deuterated water incorporation in very low -
density lipoprotein (VLDL)  
• Glucose, insulin, C -peptide , FFA , glycerol : pre -dose fasting and AUC during a 3 -hour 
OGTT +F; A SMBG measurement should be performed prior to the beginning of the 
procedure in order to ensure that the glycemic status of the patient allows  the procedure.  
• Insulin sensitivity index  using the 3-hour OGTT +F (Matsuda  index [17]) 
Patients included in the sub -study will be admitted to the site at around 5:00 pm the day prior 
to Randomization Visit (V3) and  the day prior to  Week 12 (End -of-treatment Visit, V7). A 
blood sample will be collected to evaluate the natural abundance of the palmitate enrichment  
and the IMP will be administered before dinner which will be served at around 5:00 pm to 
6:00 pm. Patients should drink 3 doses of deuterat ed water 70% at around 7:00 pm, 10:00 pm 
and 03:00 am  as described in Figure 2. Deuterated water 0.5% will be provided ad libitum  to 
patients. This will be the only beverage allowed during DNL and OGTT+F procedures.  After 
an overnight fast and after completion of pre -dose assessments  as per protocol, patients will 
take their IMP at study site : last intake of single blind placebo IMP at Randomization Visit 
(V3) and last intake of Double -blind  IMP at End-of-treatment Visit (V7).  
Two (2)  hours after the intake of the last single blind placebo IMP (for Randomization Visit 
(V3)) or after the last intake of Double -blind  IMP (for End-of-treatment Visit (V7)), two blood  
samples will be collected at a 10 -min interval  for evaluation of FPG, insulin, C -peptide , FFA, 
glycerol  and fructose stimulated hepatic DNL . Then, patients will drink a solution containing 
75 grams of glucose  and 25 grams o f fructose  in 5 minutes. The beginning of the drinking will 
correspond to the time 0 for the subsequent blood collection s. Blood will be drawn at regular 
time-points up to 6 hours post glucose  + fructose  load as detailed in Figure 2. 
8.3 Safety  
8.3.1 Physical Examination  
Physical examination must  be conducted by the Investigator.  Corporate confidential information

Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  74 / 110 
A complete physical examination will include head, ears, eyes, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung 
examinations, lymph nodes, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurological systems.  
The limited physical examination will be focused on general appearance , the cardiovascular system 
as well as towards patient reported symptoms.   
Physical examinations (complete and limited) will also include height, weight, BMI, waist and hip 
circumference s for Screening Visit (V1) and weight, BMI, waist and hip circumferenc es for other 
visits as planned in Table 1. 
Any new clinically significant abnormal findings or worsening of conditions previously recorded 
as medical history should be documented in the source documents and reported in the eCRF as AE . 
For weight measurement, a scale with appropriate resolution will be used and should be placed on 
a stable, flat surface. Patients should remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that 
only light clothing remains.  
8.3.2 Vital S igns 
One HR  measurem ent will be taken after the patient has been rest in supine position for at least 10 
minutes and before blood samples are taken. The HR measurement will be followed by 3 BP 
measurements , using a standardized cuff adapted to the size of the patient’s arm. BP readings will 
be taken with patients comfortably in a supine position with the arms raised to the level of the heart 
and in a supported position. All readings should be recorded as accurately as possible and the same 
BP device and the same patient’s arm (preferentially the left arm) should be used for all assessments 
for a given patient.  
All 3 readings have to be recorded in the source documents and reported in the eCRF. For analysis, 
the average of the 3 BP readings will be used.  
8.3.3 Patient D iary 
Patient d iary will be dispensed according to  Table 1.  
Patients will be  asked to report their IMP intakes (date + dose + time)  and meal taken after IMP 
intakes (date + time) . Any new AE or concomitant medications should be reported by the patient 
on the diary.  
At each visit, the Investigator will review the patient diary dis pensed at the previous visit  and will 
report in eCRF the appropriate data . To confirm the review, the Investigator will have to sign and 
date the previous patient diary and it will be kept in the patient  file.

8.3.4 Supine 12 -Lead ECG  
A 12 -lead ECG (I, II, III , aVR, aVL, aVF, V1 -V6) will be performed at the visits shown in the 
Visit Schedule  Chart in  Table 1 after the patient has been lying down resting for at least 10 minutes.  
Standard 12 -lead digital ECGs will be recorded as single measurement at Screening  Visit (V1) and 
in triplicate , at leas t 1 minute apart at all other visits. The ECG printout or electronic record will be 
evaluated by the Investigator and reported as “Normal” or “Abnormal” in the source documents 
and in the eCRF. If the ECG is evaluated as “Abnormal” the Investigator should document in the 
source documents as well as in the eCRF, the specific abnormality and if this abnormality is 
“clinically significant” or “not clinically significant”.  ECG printouts or electronic record will 
include date, time, patient number, and date/sig nature of the Investigator who reviewed the ECG . 
The ECG printou ts or electronic records  will be kept in the patient  file. 
Any new clinically significant findings or worsening of abnormalities previously recorded as 
Medical History  on the ECG will be reported as AE s, and followed up and/or treated locally until 
the AE has resolved or the condition has stabilized.  
All 12 -lead ECGs  will be sent to Banook  for a centralized interpretation a posteriori  by 
cardiologist s. 
8.3.5 Laboratory Assessments  
All labor atory measurements will be performed at central laboratory using samples collected at the 
visits  shown in the Visit Schedule  Chart in  Table 1. However, if judged necessary for the safety of 
the patients, the Investigator or POXEL may request unscheduled central laboratory assessments.  
Blood samples will be collected, handled and stored according to the instruction s described in the 
central laboratory  manual.  
A list of normal reference ranges  will be provided by the central laboratory to POXEL and the 
Investigators before the study start.  Any change in the normal reference ranges during the study 
will be forwarded by the central laboratory  to POXEL and the Investigators , who will have to keep 
it in the Trial master file (TMF)  and respectively, in the Investigator site file ( ISF).   
Central laboratory reports must be reviewed by the Investigator as soon as received. Each parameter 
must be assessed by the Investigator and the clinical significance of the abnormal parameter s must 
be documented. To confirm the review, the Investigator will have to sign and date the report and 
keep it in the patient file.  
The following panel will be evaluated.

141 x min(Scr/κ,1)α  x max(Scr/κ, 1)-1.209 x 0.993Age x 1.018 [if female] x 1.159 [if black]  
 
Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is -0.329 for females and 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  77 / 110 
-0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ 
or 1.  
8.3.5.4  Serum  and urine  Pregnancy Test 
For female patients of child -bearing potential only, a serum  or urine  β-HCG test will be pe rformed 
at the visits  shown in the Visit Schedule  Chart in  Table 1. 
8.3.6 Adverse Events  
Comprehensive assessment of AE experienced by the patient will be performed throughout the 
course of the study, from the time of the patient’s ICF signature.  
It is of the utm ost importance that all staff involved in the study is familiar with the content 
of this section. The Investigator is responsible for ensuring this.  
8.3.6.1  Adverse Event Definitions  
8.3.6.1.1  Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom,  or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal, whether 
or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
The official definition also extends to AE s occurring under placebo or in a reference group 
receiving drug or non -drug therapy. Becau se of regulatory requirements, events occurring during 
drug-free and pre - and post -treatment periods should also be designated as AE s. 
Therefore, safety surveillance applies to the time when the patient is included into the study (date 
of ICF signature) un til the End -of-study Visit (V8) performed one week after the End -of-treatment 
Visit (V7). 
In cases of surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is 
considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself.  
The Investi gator is required to grade the severity/intensity of each AE. 
8.3.6.1.2  Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered ADR . 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  78 / 110 
The phrase “responses to a medicinal product” means that a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility e.g., the relationship cannot be 
ruled  out.  
8.3.6.1.3  Serious Adverse Event ( SAE) 
A SAE is an AE occurring duri ng any study phase ( i.e., Screening , Run-in, Treatment, Follow -up), 
that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is immediately life -threatening  
NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in this definition refers to an event in which the pa tient is 
at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might 
cause death if it were more severe  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay will be considered an 
inpatient hospitalization. An emergency room visit without hospital admission will not be 
recorded as a SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitalization for a procedure s cheduled or 
planned before signing of ICF. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation of 
hospitalization that occur during elective surgery should be recorded as AE and assessed for 
seriousness.  
Admission to the hospital for social or situationa l reasons ( e.g. no place to stay, live too far 
away to come for hospital visits) will not be considered inpatient hospitalizations.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is otherwise considered as medically important  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered as SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize  
the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in 
this definition. Examples of such events include:  
• allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home  
• angioedema not severe enough to require intubati on but requiring intravenous  hydrocortisone 
treatment  
• blood dyscrasias ( e.g. neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, or convulsions that 
do not result in inpatient hospitalization ) 
• development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
Events that do not meet the definition of an SAE  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  79 / 110 
Elective hospitalizations to simplify study treatment or study procedures are not considered as 
SAE. However, all events leading to unplanned hospitalizations or unplanned prolongation of an 
elective hospitalization (e.g. unde sirable effects of any administered treatment) must be 
documented and reported as SAE.  
Events not to b e considered as AE/SAE  
Medical conditions present at the informed consent visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency 
during the study are defined a s baseline medical conditions and are NOT to be considered as AEs. 
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings  
Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g. on an ECG trac ing) 
should not be reported as AE unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to 
IMP discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by the Investigator. If an 
abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical c ondition (e.g. anemia , pancreatitis ) must 
be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself.   
8.3.6.2  Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events  
All AEs will be collected from the time of ICF signature  to the End-of-study Visit (V8) . All AEs 
will be followed until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized  or until  the database 
hard lock  if not resolved or stabilized before . 
Complete, accurate and consistent data on all AE s experienced for the duration of the reporting 
period (defined above ) will be reported on an ongoing basis in the appropriate section of the eCRF.  
The following aspects must be recorded for each event in the source documents and in the eCRF 
for AE:   
• A description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by patients (AE verbatim)  
• The date and time of onset (start date and time)  
• The date and time of recovery (stop date  and time ) 
• The grade as assessed by the Investigator according to the following definitions:  
- Mild ( awareness of event but easily tol erated)  
- Moderate (discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity)  
- Severe (inability  to carry out usual activity)  
• Seriousness: yes or no  
• The causal relationship to IMP as assessed by the Investigator; the decisive factor in the 
documentation is the temporal relation between the AE and the IMP. The following 
judgments of the causality to IMP or study procedures are to be used:  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  80 / 110 
- Unrelated: IMP cannot be reasonably suspecte d, a reasonable explanation must be 
given  
- Related: IMP can be reasonably suspected. AE could medically 
(pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IMP 
• Action taken on IMP (no change, temporary interruption , permanent discontinuation , not 
applicable ) 
• Other actions (none, corrective treatment, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, 
other)  
• The outcome and date of outcome according to the following definitions:  
- Recovered/resolved (AE disappeared)  
- Recovering/resolving (patient is recovering)   
- Not recovered/not resolved (AE remains without signs of improvement)  
- Recovered/resolved with sequel ae 
- Fatal  
- Unknown (only applicable if patient has been lost to follow -up) 
The following aspects must be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRF for  SAE : 
• A SAE medical term  
• A description of the SAE in medical terms, not as reported by patient; only the term(s) that 
fulfills the seriousness criteria should be listed  (including sequence of events, symptoms, 
diagnosis, treatment and any other relevant information)  
• The seriousness criteria, according to Section 8.3.6.1 , Adverse Event Definitions  
• The date of onset  
• The outcome according to criteria already mentioned  
• Causality assessed by the Investigator accordin g to the criteria already mentioned  
• Date and time of last IMP intake prior to SAE  
If a patient experienced several times the same AE along his /her participation in the study, then 
this AE must be documented and assessed as a new AE  each time.  
Each AE will be classified using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®). 
8.3.6.3  Definition of the Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The AE reporting period for safety surveillance begins when the patient is included into the study 
(date of first ICF sign ature) and continues through the end of the study’s post -treatment Follow -up 
period, defined as the End -of-study Visit (V8) . In case any AE occurs, the  Investigator will follow 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  81 / 110 
up the patient until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. All SAE s that the 
Investigator considers related to IMP occurring after the post -treatment Follow -up period must be 
reported to POXEL.  
AE will be recorde d on an ongoing basis from date of IC F signature up to the End -of-study Visit 
(V8) . 
Only events that occur after the first dose intake of IMP of the Double -blind  treatment period (V3) 
or if they were present prior to the first intake of IMP of the Double -blind  treatment period and 
increased in severity or relationship to IMP after the first intake of IMP of the Double -blind 
treatment period will be considered as TEAEs.  
8.3.6.4  Procedure for Reporting Immediately Reportable Events (IREs = SAEs and 
Pregnancy ) 
The I nvestigator must report immed iately (within 24  hours of the I nvestigator’s awareness) to 
Medpace  all SAEs/Pregnancy occurring from the date  of ICF signature to the End -of-study Visit 
(V8) or to the last study visit performed in case of premature discontinuation .  
An AE eCRF page must be completed with as much available information within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the SAEs . 
For pregnancy th e study site  will be required to complete the appropriate eCRF page within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event and also complete the Manual Exposure in Utero F orm once 
received from Medpace .  
Manual Back -Up Reporting Procedures  
This study is utiliz ing an Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system for data entry. In the event that 
the EDC system is unavailable for electronic reporting, the manual back -up reporting procedures 
below should be followed.  
• Complete a SAE  or Exposure in Utero  Form  
• Email (pref erred) or Fax the form to Medpace Clinical Safety  
When the EDC system becomes available, the EDC system should be updated with all previously 
reported information.

8.3.6.4.1  Safety Reportin g to Regulatory Authorities, Investigators and Independent 
Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards  
SUSAR s and other safety information  requiring expedited reporting will be reported to 
Investigators, Ethics Committees and /or Competent Authorities in agreement with  applicable 
guidelines and US regulations.  
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, POXEL will inform the Investigator of “findings that 
could adversely affect the safety of patients , impact the conduct of the study or  alter the IRB /EC’s 
approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.” In particular, and in line with respective US 
regulations, POXEL  will inform the Investigator of AE that are both serious and unexpected and 
are considered to be related to the administ ered product (“suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions” or SUSARs). The Investigator should place copies of these safety reports in the ISF. 
National regulations with regard to safety report notifications to Investigators will be considered . 
8.3.6.5  Monitor ing of Patients  with Adverse Event 
Any AE that occurs during the course of a clinical trial and is possibly related to IMP must be 
monitored and followed up until the outcome is known, unless patients are documented as “lost to 
follow -up”. Reasonable attem pts to obtain this information must be made and documented. It is the 
responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and 
follow -up procedures are performed.  
8.3.7 Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure  
All pregnancies with an estimated conception date  after the date of ICF signature until the End -of-
study Visit (V 8) must be reported. Upon immediate notification, the Investigator (or designee) will 
complete the Pregnancy eCRF  page . Medpace  Clinical Safety  will send the Exposure In Utero form 
to the study site  for completion within 24 hours. POXEL must be notified by Medpace  Clinical 
Safety within 24 hours of being notified.  
In case of pregnancy, patients will discontinue  the IMP and withdraw from the study . The 
Investigator must actively follow up, document and report on the outcome of these pregnancies.  
Any abnormal outcome:  
1. Spontaneous abortion includes abortion or missed abortion  
2. Induced abortion  
3. Stillbirth  Corporate confidential information

4. Death of newborn  
5. Congenital anomaly  
6. Delivery wi thin appropriate pregnancy terms, but congenital abnormalities in the newborn  
should be reported first to Medpace  Clinical Safety with 24 hours of the Investigator’s awareness.  
The Exposure In Utero form should be used for the reporting of the outcome . 
The Medpace  Clinical Safety  will forward pregnancy reports to POXEL the next business day. If 
the pregnancy outcome occurs following the end of the study; the Investigator will report the 
pregnancy outcome directly to POXEL . 
Newborns should be follow ed up for at least 8 weeks for any potential congenital anomalies.  
Pregnancy and pregnancy outcome of female partners of male trial patients need to be reported in 
the same way. The Exposure In Utero form can be used to report the pregnancy information for  the 
partner of a male patient.  
8.3.8 Special Precautions   
8.3.8.1  Hypoglycemia  
PXL770 is an insulin sensitizer and preclinical  data in diabetic models, showed an improvement in 
insulin sensitivity. Based on this mechanism of action, hypoglycemia is not expected. However, as 
this study allow s the inclusion of T2DM patients with mono - or bi -therapy, the improvement of 
glycemic control c ould lead to hypoglycemia induced  by the background oral hypoglycemic 
agent(s).  
Patients  with T2DM  should be reminded of symptoms of hypoglycemia i.e. increased sweating, 
palpitation, trembling, shaky feeling, headaches, anxiety, poor concentration, confus ion, dizziness, 
irritability, hunger or pale skin.  
Patients are requested to immediately perform a finger stick glucose measurement with the SMBG  
device  provided for this study  if any symptoms occur that may be related to hypoglycemia but to 
avoid any del ay in treating these symptoms. After the recovery of the symptoms, patients may 
report all the symptoms, date and time, dietary intake states, time of the recovery in the patient 
diary as well as blood glucose values if available. Only symptoms and / or pl asma glucose 
concentration values deemed by the Investigator to meet the definition of hypoglycemia should be 
reported in the  eCRF. Hypoglycemia will be reported as recommended by the FDA guidance [19]: 
- Hypoglycemia evidenced only by symptoms without blood glucose measurement will be 
reported as probable symptomatic hypoglycemia.   
 
Corporate confidential information  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  84 / 110 
- Hypoglycemia evidenced only by plasma glucose concentration of less than 70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L) will be reported as asymptomatic  hypoglycemia.  In case of asymptomatic 
hypoglycemia observed on SMBG, it should be reported using the verbatim of 
asymptomatic hypoglycemia (with the glucose value) reported from SMBG.  
- Hypoglycemia evidenced both by typical symptoms and plasma glucose conc entration of 
less than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) will be reported as documented symptomatic 
hypoglycemia.  
- Hypoglycemia requiring assistance of another person to administer carbohydrate or 
glucagon or other procedure will be reported as severe hypoglycemia.  
Therefore, there might be values coming from the SMBG device under the threshold for 
hypoglycemia without any associated symptoms. In such case, it is important for the Investigator 
to judge whether this has to be reported or not as an AE of hypoglycemia, dep ending on the clinical 
context and the overall glycemic control.  
In case of hypoglycemia, the Investigator should query the patient to understand the clinical context 
that may have explained a low glucose value (exercise, missing meal, timing of IMP intake  and 
SMBG…).  
8.3.8.2  DILI  
To detect  and monitor a possible DILI , the following evaluation s should be performed in the 
presence of significant elevations of liver indices.   
• For patients with normal liver transaminases and total bilirubin at baseline  
(Randomization Visit (V3)) :  
If patients with normal baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) liver indices develop new elevations 
of AST or ALT or ALP >3  ULN or TBL >2  ULN values during the study, repeat testing should 
be performed within 48 to 72 hours. Investigators should also ask the patient if he /she has 
symptoms.  
If there are persistent elevations (ALT or AST >3  ULN or TBL >2  ULN) upon repeat testing, 
then close observati on (as described below) should be implemented and discontinuation of drug 
should be considered.  
Drug should be discontinued, and the patient followed until resolution of symptoms or signs in the 
following situations:  
- ALT or AST >8   ULN  
- ALT or AST >5   ULN for more than 2 weeks.  
- ALT or AST >3   ULN and (TBL >2   ULN or INR >1.5 ) 
- ALT or AST >3   ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  85 / 110 
• For patients with elevations in liver transaminases or total bilirubin  at baseline  
(Randomization Visit (V3)) :  
If patients with abnormal baseline liver indices develop elevations of AST or ALT >2   baseline 
or TBL >2   baseline values during the study, re peat testing should be performed within 48 to 72 
hours.   Investigators should also ask  to the patient if he /she has symptoms.  
If there are persistent elevations (ALT or AST >2   baseline or TBL  >2  baseline values) upon 
repeat testing, then close observat ion (as described below) should be implemented and 
discontinuation of drug should be considered.  
Drug should be discontinued, and the patient followed until resolution of symptoms or signs in the 
following situations:  
- If baseline measurements were <2   ULN, discontinue if ALT or AST increases to >5   
baseline measurements.  
- If baseline measurements 2  ULN ( <200 I U/L as per eligibility requirements), 
discontinue if ALT or AST increases to >3  baseline measurements.  
- If baseline measurements 5  ULN  (<200 IU/L  as per eligibility requirements) , 
discontinue if ALT or AST increases to >2  baseline measurements.  
- Disconti nue if ALT or AST increase >2  baseline measurements AND the increase is 
accompanied by a concomitant increase in TBL to >2   baseline measurements or the 
INR concomitantly increases by >0.2.  
- For any patients who present with a constellation of syndromes indicative of liver disease 
as per the Investigator’s overall assessment (i .e. fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia [>5%]).  
• Close observation for suspected drug -induced liver injury includes t he following:  
- Repeating liver enzyme (ALT, AST, and ALP) and TBL tests 2 or 3 times weekly. The 
frequency of repeat testing can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize 
or the study drug has been discontinued and the patient is asymptoma tic. 
- Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.  
- Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and  
special diets.  
- Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease.  
- Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
- Obtaining additional tes ts to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e .g. INR, direct 
bilirubin , lactate, liver ultrasound ). 
- Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
If a DILI is confirmed or suspected by the Investigator , or in case of liver function parameters 
(ALT, AST, ALT, TBL) above the threshold defined in this section , the Investigator will complete 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  86 / 110 
an Expedited Liver Assessment Report page  (ELAR) in the  eCRF within 24  hours of knowledge 
of the case. If the DILI is confirmed, it should be report ed in addition as an AE (see Section 8.3.6.2  
Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events ). 
8.4 Pharmacokinetics  
During this study , pre-dose and post -dose plasma concentration of PXL770  will be assessed as 
indicated in Table 1. 
The assays of PXL770  will only be carried out in patients who have received the active drug. Thus, 
the laboratory responsible for PK bioanalys is will be provided with a randomization list. Under no 
circumstances will this list be brought to the attention of the Investigators, or to the project team 
members.  
Pre-dose and post -dose p lasma samples for PK bioanalysis will be collected at study sites  and 
forwarded to central laboratory.  For the determination of PXL770 , blood samples will be taken by 
an indwelling catheter or direct venipuncture, as appropriate.  
Please refer to the lab manual for further explanations.  
8.5 Biobanking Samples for Post-hoc Assessments  
Blood sample s for supplementary tests will be collected at  visits shown  in Table 1 to enable post -
hoc testing of any additional efficacy and safety parameters  or any potential biomarkers related to 
liver, cardiovascular diseases or metabolic diseases in relation with the dr ug target . The samples 
will be frozen and stored until further use. All the biobanking samples will be destroyed within 
2 years after the final study report is issued.  
Please refer to the lab manual for further explanations.  
8.6 Pharmacogenetics  
Blood  samples for genotyping purposes  will be collected at visits shown  in Table 1 to enable post -
hoc genetic and pharmacogenetic research on the DNA /RNA  samples fr om patient s who sign an 
optional, additional informed consent.  The samples will be frozen and stored until further use. All 
samples will be destroyed within 2 years after the final study report is issued.  
Please refer to the lab manual for further explanat ions.

9 Statistic al methods  
Statistical analysis will be performed by Medpace  under the supervision of POXEL . A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data is outlined 
below. Full details  of analyses  will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) , which will 
be finalized prior to the unblinding and l ocking of the database.  
9.1 General considerations  
In general, summary tabulations will be presented by treatment arm and will display the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, 
and the number a nd percent per category for categorical data.   
Unless stated otherwise, tests will be performed at the nominal alpha two -sided level of 0.05 along 
with 95% two -sided confidence intervals.  
Given the early stage of development (i.e. a Phase II trial for in ternal decision), no adjustment for 
multiplicity will be considered. Hence, pairwise comparisons between PXL770  doses (250 mg QD, 
250 mg BID and 500 mg QD) vs placebo and pairwise comparisons between active doses will be 
tested at the two -sided nominal lev el of significance of 0.05.  
The primary endpoint will be the relative change in the percentage of liver fat mass (assessed by 
MRI -PDFF) from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12  (V7) . 
The primary set for efficacy analysis will be the  Intention -to-treat Set . 
No interim analysis is planned for this study.  
Few missing data are expected and, unless stated otherwise, they will be not replaced.  
9.2 Sample Size  Determination  
Sample size  determination  is based on the primary endpoint, i.e. the relative change in the 
percentage of liver fat  mass  (assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline  (Randomization Visit (V3))  
to Week 12  (V7)  and the following assumptions:  
• Superiority design of PXL770  compared to placebo  
• 2-sided alpha (Type 1) error = 0.05  
• Beta (Type 2) error = 0.1 0 (Power = 9 0%) 
• Expected difference (percentage change in liver fat mass):  30%  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  89 / 110 
• Relative change in  percentage liver fat mass : standard deviation ( SD) = 30%, estimated from 
previous published data [1] 
• No adjustment for multiple comparison s between PXL770  doses and placebo  
With these assumptions, the sample size is  24 evaluable patients  in each group  to achieve a 90% 
power for each pairwise comparison . 
Assuming a dropout rate of approximately 20%, 30 patients  are to be randomized per treatment 
group  (120 p atients in total).  
9.3 Randomization  
A statistician independent of POXEL  will prep are the randomization list . Each  patient will be 
assigned to one of four treatments  in a 1 :1:1:1 ratio:  
• Group 1: Placebo  
• Group 2: PLX770  250 mg QD 
• Group 3: PXL770  250 mg BID 
• Group 4: PXL770  500 mg QD  
Randomization will be stratified according to T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients) and study site  (main study site  1 vs main study site 2 vs main study site 3 vs other study 
sites).  
See Section  6.3.2  Treatment Assignment or Randomization  for further details of the 
randomization procedures to be applied.  
9.4 Analysis Sets  
9.4.1 Screened Analyses Set  
The Screened Analysis Set is defined as all patients who were screened for inclusion int o the study.  
9.4.2 Safety analyses and Safety Set  
The Run -in Safety Analysis Set (RISS) is defined as all patients having received at least one dose 
of the single -blind placebo run -in treatment.  The population will be used to assess exposure and 
compliance with  the single -blind placebo run -in treatment only.  
The Safety Analysis  Set (SS) comprises all randomize d patients having received at least one dose 
of the study drug (either PXL770 or placebo) and considered as-treated . Safety and tolerability will 
be analyz ed on the safety set.  Corporate confidential information

9.4.3 Efficacy Analyses  
All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using the intention -to-treat set 
(ITTS). The  per protocol ( PP) set will be used only for the analysis of the primary endpoint to 
assess  the robustness of the primary analysis . 
9.4.3.1  Randomized Set (RS):  
All patients considered as -randomized regardless of the treatment actually received.  
9.4.3.2  Intention -to-treat  Set 
The ITTS  consists of all as -randomized patients having received at least one dose of the IMP (either 
PXL770 or placebo).  Patients will be assigned to the  treatment group as -randomized regardless of 
the treatment actually received . The ITTS will be considered as th e primary set for efficacy 
analyses.  
9.4.3.3  Per Protocol  Set (PPS)   
The PPS consists  of all ITTS patients without any major violations of study procedures. Major 
protocol violations will be identified prior to breaking the blind. Protocol deviations will be 
reviewed and classified as minor or major during a data review meeting  that will be held  before 
database lock and breaking the blind .   
9.4.4 PK Population  
The PK population corresponds to  the Safety  Set and includes all randomized patients  who have 
been treated with PXL770  according to the protocol and have provide d at least one pre-dose PK 
assessment during the study . 
9.5 Efficacy analysis  
9.5.1 Primary Endpoint : relative change in the percentage of liver fat mass  
The primary analysis of efficacy will be performed on the  ITTS. 
Primary analysi s: 
The primary endpoint, i.e. expressed as the relative change in the percentage of liver fat mass 
(assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline (Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12  (V7) , will be 
analyzed  in an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA)  model adjusting for treatment ( PXL770  doses 
of 250 mg QD, 250 mg  BID and 500 mg QD and placebo)  and for stratification factors, i.e. T2DM

status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients)  and study site (main site 1 vs main site 2 vs 
main site 3 vs other pooled sites)  and baseline liver fat mass as a covariate .  
Least square mean s (LSMs) of the primary endpoint for treatment groups and pairwise differences 
in LSMs will be estimated along with their p -values and 95% confidence interval s.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at Week 12 (V7) will be estimated using a multiple imputation method (fully 
conditional specification method) assuming missing at random (MAR) mechanism which will be 
detailed in the SAP. Missing baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated.  
Validity of the ANCOVA model will be c hecked (s tudentized residuals will be plotted against 
predicted values , etc.) .   
Sensitivity analyses:  
Pairwise Wilcoxon tests stratified according to T2DM status and Site will be performed. Hodges -
Lehmann estimates along with their 95% confidence intervals will also be provided.    
The primary and sensitivity  analys es will be repeated on the PPS.  
Subgroup analyses:  
Subgroup analyses will be performed : 
• within each T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM patients) . The treatment by 
T2DM status interaction will be tested.   
• within each site (main site 1 vs main site 2 vs main site 3 vs other pooled sites).  The treatment 
by site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) interaction will be tested.  
9.5.2 Key Secondary Endpoint s 
9.5.2.1  Absolute Change in  the percentage of liver fat mass    
The (absolute) change in the percentage of liver fat mass (assessed by MRI -PDFF) from baseline  
(Randomization Visit (V3))  to Week 12  (V7)  will be analyzed in an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA)  model adjusting for treatment, T2DM status (T2DM patients versus non -T2DM 
patients) , site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) and baseline liver fat mass . Least square 
means of the change in the percentage of liver fat mass  for treatment groups ( PXL770  doses of 250 
mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo)  and pairwise differences in LSMs will be 
estimated along with their p -values and 95% confidence intervals.  
Missing MRI -PDFF at Week 12 (V7) will be estimated using a multiple imputation method (fully 
conditional specification method) assuming missing at random (MAR) mechanism which will be 
detailed in the SAP. Missing baseline MRI -PDFF will not be estimated.  
Validity of the ANCOVA model will be checked (s tudentized residuals will be plotted against 
predicted values , etc.) .  
The same sensitivity analyses proposed for the primary endpoint will b e performed.  Corporate confidential information

9.5.2.2  Analysis of responders     
Four types of responders will be proposed and analyzed:  
- Response defined as an  absolute reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline  
(Randomization Visit (V3)) to Week 12  (V7) ) higher than or equal to 5% ( ≥ 5 %).  
- Response defined as a relative  reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline (Randomization 
Visit (V3)) to Week 12 (V7)) higher than or equal to 30% ( ≥ 30 %). 
- Response defined as a relative  reduction in liver fat mass (from baseline (Randomization 
Visit (V3))  to Week 12 (V7)) higher than or equal to 50% ( ≥ 50 %). 
- Response defined as a liver fat mass  value  at Week 12 (V7)) that is normalized, i.e. lower 
than or equal to 5% (≤  5 %). 
Percentages of response will be estimated within each treatment group.  
The response will be analyzed in a logistic regression model adjusting for treatment ( PXL770  doses 
of 250 mg QD, 250 mg BID and 500 mg QD and placebo) , T2DM status (T2DM patients versus 
non-T2DM patients) , site (main 1 vs main 2 vs main 3 vs others) and baseline liver fat mass .  
Pairwise differences in treatment groups will be estimated in this model as odds ratios along with 
their p -values and 95% confidence intervals.  
Methods handling m issing MRI -PDFF at  Week 12 (V7) and therefore missing responder status at 
Week 12 (V7) will be detailed in the SAP.

10 Ethical and Regulatory Aspects  
10.1 Ethics and Good Clinical Practice  
The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full compliance with the principles of 
the ‘Declaration of Helsinki’ (as amended in Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, Somerset West, 
Edinburgh and Seoul), and with the laws and regulations of the country in wh ich the clinical 
research is conducted. A copy of the Declaration of Helsinki will be provided to each study  site. 
All studies must follow ICH GCP Guidelines  and local regulations . Investigators will strictly 
ensure adherence to the stated provisions.  
For any study site  staff member responsible for performing a critical task, ICH GCP experience 
and train ing must be documented on the Curriculum Vitae . Any study site  staff member not familiar 
with or having conducted an ICH GCP training more than 2 years pri or to the study initiation or 
start of involvement in the study  will have to be trained before the start of the study . 
10.2 Patient  Information and Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain informed consent according to GCP and local 
regulations from each individual participating in this study.  
An unconditional prerequisite for patients’ participation in the study is their written informed 
consent. The patient’s written informed consent to participate in the study must be given b efore 
any study -related activities are carried out.  
Adequate information must therefore be given to the patient by the Investigator before informed 
consent is obtained. A patient information sheet prepared in accordance with the Note for Guidance 
on GCP (ICH E6) will be provided by Medpace  and validated by POXEL for the purpose of 
obtaining informed consent. In addition to providing this written information to a potential patient, 
the Investigator (or his/her designate ) will inform the patient verbally of all pertinent aspects of the 
study. The Investigator (or his/her designate ) must provide adequate explanation of the methods, 
objectives and potential hazards of the study. The language used in doing so must be chosen so that 
the information can be full y and readily understood by laypersons. The Investigator (or his/her 
designate ) must explain to patients that they are completely free to refuse to enter the study, or to 
withdraw from it at any time for any reason.  
The ICF must be signed and dated by the patient in person at study site and the Investigator in 
person at study site. The signed and dated declaration of informed consent will remain at the 
Investigator’s site and must be safely archived by the Investigator so that the forms can be retrieved 
at any time for monitoring, auditing and inspection purposes. A copy of the signed and dated ICF  
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  96 / 110 
should be provided to patients prior to participation. The whole consenting process must be clearly 
documented in the patient file . 
The information Leaflet and IC F will be provided in the local language.  
Whenever important new information become available that may be relevant to the patient’s 
consent, the written patient information sheet and any other written information provided to 
patients will be revised by POX EL and be submitted again to the IRB /EC for review and favorable 
opinion. The agreed, revised information will be forwarded to each patient in the study. The 
Investigator (or his/her designate ) will explain the changes to the previous version and patient w ill 
be asked to sign the new version.  
The patient  identification log must be maintained for all patients who consented to participate in 
the study, whether or not they were randomized.  
10.3 Patient  Identification and Privacy  
A unique patient number (see Section 6.3.1  Patient Numbering ) will be assigned to each patient 
at Screening  Visit (V1) . This number will serve as the patient’s identifier in the study as well as in 
the clinical study database.  
The patient’s data collected in the study (including genetic tests) will be stored under this number. 
Only the Investigator will be able to link the patient’s study data to the patient via an identification 
list kept at the study site . The patient’s original medical data that are reviewed versus eCRF data 
(source data verific ation process) at the study site  during routine monitoring, audits and authority 
inspections will be kept strictly confidential.  
Data protection and privacy regulations will be observed in capturing, forwarding, processing, and 
storing patient data. Patien ts will be informed accordingly and will be requested to give their 
consent on data handling procedures in accordance with US regulations.  
10.4 Emergency Medical Support and Patient  Emergency Card  
Patients  included in this study will be provided with a Patient Emergency Card at Screening Visit 
(V1). The Patient Emergency Card is based on the need to provide patients  with a way of 
identifying themselves as participating in this study, and subsequently to give health care providers 
access to the information about this participation that may be needed to determine the course of the 
patient’s  medical treatment.  
This card is designed to provide information to health care providers who are not part of the clinical 
study; this may include the possibility of emergency unblinding if needed, in case of blinded 
studies. The Investigators, who are already aware of the protocol an d treatment, have other means 
PXL770 / Study No. PXL 770-004 
Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  97 / 110 
of accessing necessary medical information for the management of emergencies occurring in their 
patients . 
The first point of contact for all emergencies will be the Investigator caring for the affected patient . 
The Investigato r agrees to provide his or her emergency contact information on the card for this 
purpose. If the Investigator is available when an event occurs, he/she will answer any questions. 
Any subsequent action (e.g. unblinding) will follow the standard processes e stablished for the 
Investigators.  
10.5 Patient  Insurance and Compensation to Patients  
Insurance coverage shall be provided in line with the regulations. Coverage will be provided from 
the time a patient has been screened in the study, i.e. from the time the pat ient has given written 
informed consent.  
In the event that a patient is injured as a direct result of study participation, POXEL will reimburse 
for treatment of such injuries, as long as those costs are not covered by the patient’s health care 
payer.   How ever, if the patient has not complied with the study procedures, has not followed the 
instructions of the Principal Investigator or if the injury is a result of a medical condition not related 
to the IMP, the patient’s health care payer will be responsible  for the costs of diagnosing and 
treating the condition.   
10.6 Institutional Review Board /Ethics committee  
Prior to commencement of the study at a given study site , the study protocol will be submitted 
together with its associated documents (Patient Informa tion and Consent Form , IB) and any other 
relevant information (e.g. patient diary)  to the responsible IRB/EC for its favorable 
opinion/approval. The written favorable opinion/approval of the IRB /EC will be filed in the ISF, 
and a copy will be filed in the TMF at Medpace . 
The study must not start at a study site  before POXEL  has obtained written confirmation of 
favorable opinion/approval from the concerned IRB /EC. The IRB /EC will be asked to provide 
documentation of the date of the meeting at which the favorable opinion/approval was given, and 
of the members and voting member s present at the meeting. Written evidence of favorable 
opinion/approval that clearly identifies the study, the protocol version and the Patient Information 
and Consent Form version reviewed should be provided. Where possible, copies of the meeting 
minutes  should be obtained. Amendments to the protocol will also be submitted to the concerned 
IRB/EC, before implementation in case of substantial changes (see Section  11.6 Changes to the 
Protocol ). Relevant safety information will be submitted to the IRB /EC during the course of the 
trial in accordance with national regulations and requirements.

11 Study Management  
11.1 Data collection and CRF management  
In this study, an eCRF will be used. CRF data will be captured via EDC  using ClinTrak  EDC , a 
web-based tool.  An eCRF will be completed for each screened patient.  
Patient diary, specifically designed for the clinical trial by POXEL and provided to the study sites 
will be given to the patients. Data collected in t his patient diary are detailed in  Section  8.3.3  Patient 
Diary. 
The data in the eCRF should be consistent with the relevant source documents as verified by 
Medpac e’s CRA during monitoring visits. The data will be processed, evaluated, and stored in 
pseudonymous form in accordance with the data -protection regulations.  
The Investigator must ensure that any document associated with an eCRF forwarded to POXEL 
contains no mention of any patient  names.  
The eCRFs will be reviewed by the Investigator for completeness and accuracy. Each patient’s 
eCRF must be signed electronical ly by the Investigator to document correctness and accuracy of 
data contained. Any amendments and corrections necessary must be undertaken and countersigned 
electronically by the Investigator, stating the date of the amendment/correction. The Investigator 
must state his/her reasons for the correction of important data. Electronic errors will be captured 
by the audit trail within the collection system. Details on eCRF completion will be given in the 
eCRF completion guidelines.  
The eCRFs are regulatory docum ents and must be suitable for submission to authorities.  
The Investigator or designee will be responsible for entering study data in the eCRF provided by 
Medpace . It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the data entered in the 
eCRFs. The eCRF information need to be completed as soon as possible after each patient’s visit 
(but no later than 5 business  days after the patient’s visit).  
In addi tion to eCRF, other external data are collected:  
• MRIs performed during the study  will be sent to a centralized imaging core laboratory .  
Results will be electronically transferred to the Medpace Data Management Department .  
• ECGs performed during the study will be sent to a centralized  ECG core  laboratory. Results 
will be electronically transferred to the Medpace Data Management Department . 
• Laboratory b lood and urine sampling s will be sent to Medpace  centralized laboratory and 
results will be transferred electronically to Medpace Data Management Department . 
• Blood sampling s for DNL assessments will be sent to the University of Florida  for analysis .

• PK samplings will be sent to Charles River Saint -Nazaire for analysis  and results will be 
transferred electronically to Medpace Data Management Department . 
Reconciliation of all centralized data will be done by Medpace  before database lock and final data 
transfer received.  
During the study, SAE data (reported on the AE form in eCRFs) will be integrated into the Medpace  
centralized pharmacovigilance  databa se upon receipt of these forms and after a duplicate check. 
Each case will be assigned a case identification number. Each case will be assessed by POXEL 
before being reported to the relevant authorities as necessary.  
The information from the pharmacovigila nce database cases will be reconciled with that in the 
clinical database.  
All t hese data will be integrat ed into a validated database. Medpace  will be responsible for data 
processing, in accordance with Medpace ’s data  management procedures. Database lock will occur 
once quality assurance procedures have been completed. Patient Data Reports, recorded on CD or 
DVD, will be provided to the Investigators at the completion of the study. Each patient data report 
will contain  all the data for a particular patient in the same format as the eCRF pages as well as 
audit trails and indexed comments.  
11.2 Handling of Protocol Deviations  
In the event of a significant deviation from the protocol due to an emergency, accident, or mistake 
(e.g. violation of informed consent process, IMP dispensing or patient dosing error, treatment 
assignment error, patient enrolled in violation of eligibility criteria, or concomitant medication 
criteria), the Investigator (or designee) will contact POXEL (or  its designee) at the earliest possible 
time by telephone or by email.  The Investigator and POXEL (or its designee) will come as quickly 
as possible to a joint decision regarding the patient’s continuation in the trial.  This decision will 
be documented b y the Investigator and POXEL (or its designee) and reviewed by the CRA.  
11.3 Source Data and Patient  Files  
The Investigator must keep a patient file (medical file, original medical records) on paper or 
electronically for every patient included in the study. Thi s file will contain the available 
demographic and medical information for the patient and should be as complete as possible.  
It should be possible to verify the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study from the available 
data in this file.  
It must be possible to identify each patient by using this patient file.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  101 / 110 
Printouts of electronic patient file documents as stated above must be signed and dated by the 
Investigator  and kept with the Investigator’s copy of the document.  
Additionally, any other  documents with source data, especially original printouts of data that were 
generated by technical equipment or printouts have to be filed in the patient files. This includes 
e.g. ECG recordings, BP monitoring, laboratory value listings, patient diary, et c. All these 
documents have to bear at least the patient number, study number, scheduled time and the printing 
date printed by the recording device to indicate to which patient and to which study procedure the 
document belongs. The medical evaluation of su ch records should be documented as necessary and 
signed/dated by the Investigator.  
11.4 Investigator Site File and Archiving  
The Investigator will be provided with an ISF upon initiation of the study. This file will contain all 
documents necessary for the cond uct of the study and will be updated and completed throughout 
the study. It must be available for review by the CRA , must be ready for inspection by Competent 
Authorities during and after the study, and must be safely archived for at least 15 years after t he 
end of the study. The documents to be thus archived include the Patient Identification List and the 
signed patient ICF. If archiving of the Investigator Site File is no longer possible at the study site , 
the Investigator must notify POXEL . 
All original patient files (medical records) must be stored at the study site  (hospital, research 
institute, or practice) for the longest possible time permitted by the applicable regulations, and/or 
as per ICH GCP guidelines, whichever is longer. In any case, the Inve stigator should ensure that 
no destruction of medical records is performed without the written approval of POXEL.  
11.5 Monitoring, Quality Assurance and Inspection by Authorities  
This study will be monitored in accordance with the ICH Note for Guidance on GCP ( ICH E6). 
The CRA will perform visits to study site at regular intervals.  
During monitoring visits, the CRAs will review:  
• the conformity of ICFs with the applicable regulation  
• the compliance of patient inclusion with protocol Inclusion/Exclusion criteria  
• that the data management is adequate: source data verification , queries resolution, SAEs/ 
AEs reporting, protocol deviations reporting  
• Investigator Site File (ISF) (e.g. Protocol & Amendments and Regulatory sections, 
delegation  list and training records)  
• that IMP handling is compliant with the protocol requirements  
• the compliance of centralized procedures management (e.g. central laboratory  and central 
imaging ) by study site  staff 
• the adequacy of facilities, equipment and materi al management

Protocol Version 6.0 / 24th July 2020  
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page  102 / 110 
In line with ICH GCP guidelines, monitoring will include verification of data entered in the eCRF 
against original patient’s records. This verification will be performed by direct access to the original 
patient records, and POXEL guarantees t hat patient confidentiality will be respected at all times. 
Participation in this study will be taken as agreement to permit direct source data verification.  
Representatives of appropriate POXEL personnel or its designee(s), as well as Competent 
Regulatory  Authorities, must be permitted to inspect all study -related documents and other 
materials at study site, including the ISF, the completed eCRFs, IMP and the patients’ original 
medical records/files.  
The protocol, each step of the data capture procedure, a nd the handling of the data, as well as the 
eventual clinical study report, will be subject to independent Clinical Quality Assurance. Audits 
may be conducted at any time during or after the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the 
study data.  
11.6 Changes to the Protocol  
Changes to the protocol will be documented in written protocol amendments. Major (substantial, 
significant) amendments will usually require submission to the competent authorities and to the 
relevant IRB /EC for approval or favorable op inion. In such cases, the amendment will be 
implemented only after approval or favorable opinion has been obtained.  
Minor (non -substantial) protocol amendments, including administrative changes, will be submitted 
to the relevant IRB /EC or to competent authorities only where requested by pertinent regulations.  
Any amendment that could have an impact on the patient’s agreement to participate in the study 
requires the patient’s informed consent prior to implementation (see Section  10.2 Patient  
Information and Informed Consent ) 
11.7 Clinical Study Report and Publication Policy  
11.7.1  Clinical Study Report

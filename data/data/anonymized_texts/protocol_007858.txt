 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 8 1. Background  
eSight Corp., Toronto , Canada  (Sponsor) , has developed a wearable, electronic low vision aid, 
“eSight Eyewear”  (Device) .  eSight Eyewear deploys ophthalmic grade video camer a and 
display components, and real -time video modification algorithms to significantly improv e the 
functional visual performance of people with non -correctable, inoperable low vision caused by 
eye diseases such as  but not limited to : 
• Macular Degeneration  
• Diabetic Retinopathy  
• Stargardt’s Disease  
 
Over 100 million people in the developed world have low vision, defined by the World Health 
Organization as best corrected visual acuity in the better e ye of 20:60 or worse2.  Other factors 
can also contribute to low vision such as diminished field of view or impaired occipital/cognitive 
image processing.  
In most cases of low vision, individuals will retain sufficient residual visual function  that, with t he 
help of Assistive Technology  (AT) devices they can still perform various life tasks or Activities of 
Daily Living (ADLs).    The eSight device can help people perform various ADLs such as : 
• Reading   
• Interacting with others  
• Viewing a computer screen  
• Orientation and Mobility  
• Watching television  
• Distance Viewing  
 
The mechanism of eSight Eyewear is to stimulate vest igial retinal function through existing 
retinal photoreceptors (rods and cones), thereby enabling more effective neurological 
(cortical/occipita l) visual processing, helping the brain to extract more us able information from a 
visual scene.  We do not believe eSight Eyewear affect s disease progression, nor  does it 
interact with the body’s metabolism or physiology in any wa y other than through the s timulus 
described above.  eSight Eyewear is a Class -I medical device.  The mechanism of

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 10 (LVES) , developed by researchers at John Hopkins University3.  The LVES device was the 
subject of various studies  and notably, was evaluated extensively by the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs as an aid suitable for visually impaired veterans.4 
More recently, the “Joint Optical Reflective Display  (Jordy) system was developed by Enhanced 
Vision Systems, Huntington CA, in collaboration with scientists from the National  Aeronautics 
and Space Administration.  The Jordy enjoyed margin commercial success, but has been 
discontinued5. 
The use of head worn video as opposed to optical mag nification does present exciting 
poss ibilities for the partially sighted.  Various researchers hav e sought to understand how video 
enhancements such as contrast, edge enhancement, overlays, and various other techniques not 
possible through simple optical magnification or filtering, can be used to enhance functional  
vision6, 7, 8, 9. 
There have been other attempts at head -borne video devices for low vision.  Historically, all 
have suffered from the same drawbacks, largely due to technological implementation at that 
time.  These units were large  and cumbersome, with limited field of view, poor camera 
performance, and unacceptable latency10.  eSight Eyewear, by far the most commercially 
successful such device to date, overcomes these historical shortco mings through leading edge 
technology choices a nd various proprietary design elements.

January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 12 About ⅓ to ½ of subjects who fall into the a cuity and visual field inclusion criterion described in 
Section 3.2 below, demonstrate acute objective improvement and an immediate aptitude with 
the device.  Therefore, we anticipate a total of 150 -200 to be enrolled in screening arm of the 
study, from which 60 will be selected to participate in the extended arm, a three month take-
home trial of the device.  We expect attrition to be low due to the rigorous sc reening process for 
participation .13 
In addition to a clinician’s unit, which incorporates tria l lens frames and other unique features for 
fitting and demonstration, each Site will receive devices for Subjects  as they are required .  The 
Site and eSight can, at any time, agree to deploy add itional devices to accelerate the collection 
of data.  
3.2. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Male or female subjects between the ages of 13 -75.  The goal for the extended arm is 
that  50% of subjects will be 65 years of age or younger, and 50% will be older than 6514.  
2. Subject mu st have distance BCVA measured with ETDRS of between 20 :60 and 20:400  
in the better eye . 
3. Subjects have been diagnosed with a condition that presents as one or all of the 
following: Central scotomata, geographic atrophy, or scattere d scotomata.  These are 
typically symptoms attributed to condition s such as :  Diabetic Retinopathy, Stargardt’s 
Disease, Age Related Macular Degeneration, Leber’s Dise ase, Retinopathy of 
Prematurity , Cone Rod Dystrophy, or Ocular Albinism 15. 
4. Subject must have a n estimated  functional  field of view of at least  20 degrees  (bilateral or 
monocular) .16.  
5. If the subject is employed, they must be prepared to use eSight Eyewear in their 
workplace environment, have informed their employer of their involvement in the study, 
and receiv ed permission from their employer to bring eSight Eyewear into the workplace.  
If the subject is self -employed, they must be prepared to use eSight Eyewear in their

14 The intention of this stratification of the cohort is to understand age e ffects related to the eSight Eyewear device.  This stratification 
does not impact the statistical analysis in Section 3.1  
15 These have been demonstrated by current eSight users to be conditions for which eSight Eyewear can provide significant benefit.  
For other conditions, especially those which present as peripheral degeneration encroaching inwardly  ultimately towards the c entral 
vision, eSight Eyewear’s effectiveness has not yet been convincingly demonstrated (e.g.: early stage R etinitis Pigmentosa, early 
stage Glaucoma).  
16 Acuity and field criteria, while firm requirements h ere, are inflection points in the real world popula tion.  Evidence indicates that 
eSight users outside of the 20/60 – 20/400 BCVA and 20 ° field can still have  success with the eSight device, but results are less 
consistent.

influence their participation in t he study . 
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 15 Note that the Case Report Form (CRF) that will be used fo r the eQUEST Study will be Microsoft  
Excel spreadsheet with appropriate con straints (restricted cells, validated data entry, drop down 
choices, help text, etc.).  Each site will be provided wi th a ta blet computer with the CRF pre -
installed.  This will help to ensure data completeness and in tegrity.  Each section of the CRF will 
identify the level of staff (eSight or Study Site) that is  required to conduct that portion of the 
protocol.   Information pro vided to the Study sponsor will be de -identified.  
The components of the study are described in greater  detail in Section 4.1 below:  
4.1. Schedule of Events  
This section indicates data that will be collected for each subject.  Subjects will be screened for 
enrol lment prior to their initial visit.  At the initial v isit, subjects will provide informed consent and 
the investigator will obtain medical and ophthalmic histo ry information as described in the CRF , 
and conduct a complete low vision assessment.  
At various points through the protocol, decision points  are identified as red boxes below.  
STEP 1: Pre -Screen, Subject Profile, and Informed Consent  
The Eyecare Physician at the Study S ite will select potential candidates from the Site’s regular 
flow of patients.  In some cases, eSight may direct interested  persons  to the Site, wh o have 
contacted eSight directly.  
 
Steps 1.01 through 1.0 3 may be administered by a Research Assistant  or a s imilarly suitable 
staff person at the clinic  (e.g.: CLVT, OT, etc.) . 
Step 1.01 Subject ID:   When a potential Study Subject has been identified, the Site 
Administrator will assign a unique subject identification number from the site -specific list of 
numbers  provided by eSight.  
Step 1.02 Demographic Data :  The Site Administrator will  contact prospective study 
participants and obtain demographic data.  
Step 1.03 Inclusion/Exclusion, and Informed Consent :  The Site Administrator will work 
through the inclusion/e xclusion criteria to verify the subject is qualified f or the study, and then 
work with the subject through the informed consent pr ocess, obtaining their written approval to 
proceed.   An IRB approved informed consent form will be used.  
The site administrato r will then provide to  the Third Party Surveyor, contact information for the 
study subject in order to proceed with Step 2 below.   The Third Party Surveyor will complete 
Step 2 and send that information back to the Site Man ager for inclusion in the Subject ’s CRF . 
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 16 STEP 2: Pre -Study LV Inventory Assessment  & VA LV VFQ -48 
Steps 2.01 through 2.03 will be administered by telephone using  a Third Party Surveyor17.  
Step 2.01 AT Inventory:  The Third Party Surveyor  will conduct a telephone interview with 
each subjec t.  The purpose of this phone interview is to inventory the  subject’s current assistive 
devices  and usage habits .  This background information will be used by the study examiner  to 
determine which visual aids will be used during benchmarking activities.  
Step 2.02  Baseline VA LV VFQ -48 Questionnaire:   Third Party Surveyor  will work with the 
subject to complete the VA LV VFQ -4818 questionnaire.  
Step 2.03  Baseline eSight -8 Questionnaire:   Third Party Surveyor  will work with the 
subject to complete seven  QoL t ype questions which will provide predictive insights r egarding 
their affinity with the eSight device.  
Step 2.04  Advancement Decision:   Based on the Subject’s responses to 2.02 and 2.03 
above the Eyecare Physician will determine  whether or not the Subject ought to proceed through 
the Protocol.   
Note :  While not an explicit inclusion criterion,  there are seven questions on the VA LV VFQ -48 
items identified in red (2, 3, 5, 12, 14, 19, 45) for which the eSight Eyewear device has b een 
shown to be particularly effective .  If a subject scores four or more of these items as “mode rately 
difficult” or “extremely difficult”, they will be considered a strong candidat e. 
STEP 3: Clinic Visit – LV Assessment  & eSight Demonstration  
Subjects wi ll also be asked to complete a series of supervised activit ies to establish a baseline 
of their visual function and functional visual performance without  eSight Eyewear19. 
Duration: 2-3 hours . 
Steps 3.01 through 3.04 may be administered by a Research Assistant  or a similarly suitable 
staff person at the clinic  (e.g.: CLVT, OT, etc.) . 
Step 3.01 Low Vision Rehabili tation Goals:  The CRF form identifies five ADLs, prioritized 
by the subject, which they wish do (or do better).  It also asks how satisfi ed they are currently 
with their ability to perform this task, and how impo rtant this task is to their day -to-day quality of 
life.  The purpose of this step is provide the subject with  specific goals that they can work to 
achieve (or improve) using eSight Eyewear over the course of the study.  
                                                
17 In the case of Johns Hopkins University Wilmer Eye Institute , research assistants from the institute will conduct Step 2.  These  
research assistants will be dis -assoicated from the PI and other researchers who have face -to-face interaction with the subject.  
18 Using the VA LV VFQ -48 and LV VFQ -20 in Low Vision R ehabilitation , Stelmack, Massof, Optom Vis Sci. 2007 Aug;84(8):705 -9. 
19 Because we intend to deploy standardized ADL measures, it may be possible to compare our findings directly to some other 
interventions ( e.g.: Haymes, Johnston, & Heyes, 2001).  
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 17 Note: If, in the estimation of the researcher, the S ubject identifies goals which are too abstract 
(e.g. “I want to do more”, “I want to be happier”), or not s uitable uses for eSight Eyewear (e.g. “I 
want to swim”, “I want  to drive”, “I want to go downhill skiing”), they will be e ncouraged to 
elaborate or identify a different goal that can be considered applicable to the Study/Device.  
Step 3.02 Cognitive  Assessment:   To determine the cognitive c apability of the subject to 
continue with the remainder of the study protocol, an assessment using the Montreal Cognitiv e 
Assessment – BLIND (MoCA)20 test will be conducted.   Psychometric properties of the MoCA in 
its full version include a test -retest correlation of r = .92, while int ernal consistency was 
evaluated with a Cronbach’s alpha of .83.21 
While the cognitive suitability of the Subject for t he test protocol is ultimately the decision of the 
researcher, a MoCA score of less than 20 indicates that  careful consideration is necessary22.  If 
the researcher determines that the subject is cognitively unsuited for the study, the remain ing 
steps below are unnecessary  (skip to 3.10).  
Step 3.03 36-item short -form health survey ( RAND SF-36)23:  The SF -36 is a brief 
questionnaire that provides a validated indication of the subject’s broad general health.   It was 
chosen in part because of its excellent psychometric propert ies, which include a minimum of .70

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 18 determined in step 1.04 is substantially different from the subject’s ha bitual glasses, this portion 
of the protocol may be conducted with a trial lens frame.  
Step 3.04 Medical and Ophthalmic History :  The c linician  and/or site administrator will 
record the following in formation  on the CRF : 
• OD and OS disease type(s) , and approximate number of years, if possible.26 
• Free -form field: other eye -health related histor y (e.g.: laser photocoagulation, Lucentis, 
etc.), considered by the examiner to be relevant.  
• subject’s verbal description of visual scotoma if present  
Step 3.05 Refractive Prescription:   The clinician will perform a refraction to determine  the 
prescription lenses required by the subject  for best distance and near vision .  Note:  No prism 
element may be included in  the refraction prescription.  
Step 3.06 Acuity Test:   Choose ONE OF  ETDRS or Snellen  
ETDRS27:  Using the subject’s habitual corrective lenses (if a pplicable).  For each eye 
independently, and then binocularly, determine the ETDRS acuity.  
• Determine the last row where the subject can correctly identify all 5 lett ers on that row.  
• Determine the log score for that row (these scores ar e shown in the margin of the 
ETDRS test, e.g. the 20/25 line has a log score of 0. 1) 
• subtract 0.02 log units for every letter that is correctly identified beyond the last row 
where all of the letters are correctly identified.  
For example: if the subject reads all of the letters  correctly on the 20/ 32 row and then 3 
letters correctly on the 20/25 row, the Log Score wou ld be calculated as follows:  
 ETDRS Acuity Log Score  = 20/32 Row = 0 .20, plus 3 letters on 20/25 row  
  = 0.20 – (3 × 0.02)  
  = 0.14 
Snellen:  Using the Subject’s habitual corrective lenses (if a pplicable).  For each eye 
independently, and then binocularly, determine the Snellen acuity28. 
 
Step 3.07 Mars Contrast Sensitivity Test:   Test Contrast Sensitivity using the Mars chart.  
Mars test score sheet to be provided 29. 
                                                
26 On the CRF this will be a date range, because subjects will not recall with accuracy.  E.g.:  <6mos, 6 -12mos, 1 -2yrs, 2 -5yrs, 5 -
10yrs, >10yrs.  
27 https://www.good -lite.com/Details.cfm?ProdID=639  
28 In some cases (e.g. dense scotoma) the test Subject may hav e difficulty reading ALL 5 letters on any line of the ETDRS chart,  
which limits the precise ETDRS scoring algorithm  above. Adding Snellen allows greater flexibility in participant inclusion and data 
analysis.

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 19 Step 3 .08 eSight Demonstration:   eSight Eyewear will be demonstrated using a clinic ian’s 
version of the device30.  The subject will be provided basic instruction on its use (zoom in/out, 
contrast adjust). The researcher will observe the Subject’s performanc e in tests  of, acuity 
(ETDRS) contrast performance, facial recognition, and reading (MNRead) .  These abo ve tests 
are observational only, and are not recorded to provide a baseline performance measure with 
the eSight Device.  
 
Step 3. 09 Advancement Decision:  At this point in the protocol the Subject and the Eyecare 
Physician will come to an agreement about whe ther to continue with the extended portion of the 
protocol evaluating eSight Eyewear.  The decision will be based on  a minimum 4 -line ETDRS 
improvement using the device, the subject’s performance of the various tasks above,  their 
impressions of the eSight Eyewear demonstration , and the continued compliance with 
inclusion/exclusion criteria as defined in Sections 3.2 and 3.3  respectively .  There is a subjective 
and personal aspect to this decision, not unlike  a patient’s decision about whether or not to 
purchase the device.  
Should the subject and/or the examiner decide not to proceed with the remainder of the study, 
this should be noted on the CRF, along with their reason for withdrawal . 
 
Step 3.10 Micr operimter  Test  (without eSight) :  This test is optional.  Bilateral. The intent 
is to understand how field performance correlates with efficacy results .  Because this diagnostic 
test requires a significant time commitment, the subject will  be asked for consent, as indicated 
on the CRF.  Ideal candidates for this test are <60 years old, with a central scot oma in both 
eyes.   A 10 -2 pattern is preferred.  Indicate on the Case Report Form which test was conducted.  
 
Steps 3.11 through 3 .13 may be administered by a Research Assistant,  or a similarly suitable 
staff person at the clinic  (e.g.: CLVT, OT, etc.) . 
Step 3.11 Minnesota Low Vision Reading Test (MN READ):   Under normal “office” lighting 
conditions, using the hand held MNREAD charts, record the  subject’s score.  Score sheets to be 
provided31.  This test will be conducted without eSight Eyewear, using the Subject’s habitual 
spectacle correction if applicable.  
Step 3.12 Cohn -Kanade Facial Recognition Test:   The subject will complete a task of 
recognizing the sex and facial expressions on a random ized selection of faces from the 
University of Pittsburgh Cohn -Kanade Facial Images Database.  These will be displa yed on a 
                                                
30 The clinician’s version of eSight Eyewear is more adjustable (e.g. trial lenses, pupil distance, etc.), but compromises on we ight, 
comfort and aesthetics.  Subjects who receive eSi ght Eyewear for the trial will be provided a consumer version of the product,  
appropriately sized, incorporating their prescription lenses and correct pupil spacing.  
31 Scoresheets will follow Lighthouse Low Vision Products  format.

January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 21 Steps 4.01  through 4.04 are administered by the eyecare physician (Optometrist or 
Ophthalmologist) , or suitably trained and supervised clinical staff .  eSight staff will be in 
attendance throughout this visit to provide guidance and support.  
Step 4.01a Fitting subject’s eSight Eyewear:   The subject’s personalized eSight Eyewear 
will have their ophthalmic lens prescription incorpo rated into the prescription frames, and the left 
and right PD set internally.  The device will be properly fitted to the subject by adjusting the nose 
bridge, forehead strap, and headband.  
Step 4.01b Training on eSight Eyewear Controls:   The subject will receive complete 
training on the features and controls of eSight Eyewear.  This will include a demonstration of  
1. Using the HDMI input for  computer use and television viewing, including using the motion 
sensors in the device to control panning across the scene.  
2. Using the various binary colour modes to improve rea ding capability.  
3. Various other features such as saving images, etc.

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 22 The subject will be trained that there are certain A DLs that are not permitted , such as driving or 
operating any sort of dangerous machinery (e.g.: power tools), and walking or performing other  
mobility tasks while using the device in “immersive” mo de.  Other ADLs will be prescribed, using 
eSight to purchase  a coffee, using eSight to attend an event where distance viewing is required 
(e.g. church, theatre, wedding, conference, classroom, e tc.), watching television, using a 
computer, social event, etc.  
Site staff will contact the subject by telephone in accordance with the “eSkills Proficiency 
Program”  as follows:  
- Day 9 : verify Session O ne steps are satisfactory, confirm commitment  to proceed with 
session T wo steps.   This interaction can occur within a window of ± 2 day s of Step 4.

Session Three steps.   This interaction can occur within a window of ±2 day s of Step 4.  
- Day 23:   Verify Session T hree steps are satisfactory, confirm commitment to proceed 
with Session Four steps, and confirm one -month check in appointment.   This interaction 
can occur within a window of ±2 days of Step 4.  
STEP 6: Subject  Visit – Midterm Assessment  
Step 6 must occur within  26-34 days of Step 4.  
Step 6.01 The purpose of this visit is to assess  the subject’s progress with the eSight device, 
and provide additional guidance and training as required.  Part of this visit will be to assess the 
Subject’s self reported progress with the goals identified in Step 3.01 above , and to work with 
the Subject to improve their achievement  of these goals through further device training.  If 
necessary, the researcher  may contact eSight to learn goal -specific ways that eSight Eyewear 
can be used.   This visit may be conducted in -clinic.  
Step 6.02 Also in this visit,  the Subject will complete Session Four, the final part of th e 
eSkills program.

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 24 5. Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject may withdraw or be removed from the study at any time without prejudice for any of 
the following reasons:  
• The subject wishes to withdraw  
• Occurrence of any serious or adverse device -related effect that is considered by the 
investigator to represent an unacceptable risk to the s ubject’s physical or mental well -being.  
• Occurrence of any physical or mental illness that  affects the subject’s further participation.  
• The subject fails to comply with the requirements of  the study.  
Time permitting, subjects that withdraw from the stu dy will be replaced by other candidates.   
Every effort will be made to have withdrawn subjects  complete the follow -up procedures (Part 4).  
6. eSight Support for Clinical Sites  
At each site, before the Study commences, eSight staff  will visit the Study location to provide 
one full day of training with the eSight Eyewear device.  This will include the f ollowing:  
• Training on device demonstration and fitting (trial lenses, adjustment of forehead strap and 
headband, P.D. adjustment , etc. ). 
• Explanation of device controls (zoom, video modes, O S/OD displays on/off, saving images.  
• Training on various ADLs ( bioptic and immersive activities ). 
• Using direct video feed for television and computer use.  
• Facial Recognition test training.  
• Training on the eSkills program.  
• Training on study management, data collection, and C RF administration.  
In addition, eSight will visit site locations for clinical visit number two, during which fitting and 
training of the subject is provided.  To control costs, site s will attempt to consolidate  multiple 
subjects in a single day for this step in the process.  This means that each study site will have 
two or three visits by eSight staff over the course of the stu dy, assuming 8 -12 subjects per study 
site. 
7. Adverse Events  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as a ny untoward medical occurrence, including deterioration of 
a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject which may or may 
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 25 not have a causal relationship with the investigational product (i.e. eSight Eyewear). An AE can 
therefore be any unfavo urable and unintended sign, symptom,  or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a n investigational product, whether or not considered relate d to the 
investigational product . 
The Principal Investigator/Sub -Investigator  will assess the relationship of all adverse reaction s to 
the investi gational product , using the following scale:  
 
Probable  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormal ity, with a 
reasonable time sequence to device usage , unlikely to be attributed 
to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and which 
follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal.  
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormal ity, with a 
reasonable time sequence to d evice usage , but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. 
Information on device  withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Unlikely  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormal ity, with a 
temporal relationship to device usage  which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and which other drugs, chemica ls or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanation.  
Unrelated  This category is applicable to A es which are judged to be clearly 
and incontrovertibly due to extraneous causes (diseases, 
environment, etc.) and do not meet the criteria for device  
relationship listed for the above mentioned condition s. 
 
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 26 The incidence, severity and duration of all adverse events will be recorded according to the 
following scale : 
 
Mild Adverse  event resulting in discomfort, but not sufficient to cause 
interference in normal daily activities.  
Moderate  Adverse event resulting in discomfort that is suffic ient to cause 
interference in daily activities.  
Severe  Adverse event resulting in discomfort causing an ina bility to carry 
out normal daily activities.  
 
All severe Aes, whether or not the event is deemed d evice -related, will be reported to the 
Sponsor by telephone within twenty -four hours of being aware of  a severe AE, followed by a 
written report within five business days.  
Practically speaking, the risk of adverse events wit h eSight Eyewear is extremely low.  The most 
significant risk is injury resulting from disorientation o r poor psycho -spatial hand -eye 
performance related to using the device to perform any tas k where injury may be possible.  
Some examples include: Falling or tripping while wea ring the eSight device in an immersive 
mode while walking; risk of burns while cooking  or drinking hot beverages ; participating in 
specifically prohibited  activities such as riding a bicycle or driving.  
8. Stopping Criteria  
Should any AE necessitate that a specific Subject must terminate their participation in the Study, 
the Site Administrator will, within their best judg ement,  inform his/her counterpart s at the other 
Study Sites  so that they are prepared for similar circumstances at the ir respective Study Sites.  
9. Study Materials  
If the study site does not already own any of the materials below, they will be provided  by eSight 
at the beginning of the study:  
• Case Report Form (CRF):   This form is used to record and track the subject’s progress 
through the course of the study.  For each unique CRF, Subject identifying information 
appears on the first page of the form only.  Subsequent pages show only a unique 
identification number provided by the Study Sponsor .  CRFs returned to eSight for 
 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 27 analysis will be “de -identified”, refere nced by this identification number only.  The first 
page will be removed.  
• ETDRS Acuity Chart  
• Mars  Contrast Chart  
• MN READ Test Charts  
• Clinical Unit:   This unit is identical to the subject’s configured u nit except that it 
incorporates provision for trial len ses so that it may be used on multiple subjects.  
• eSight Facial Recognition Test:   Materials required to conduct this test and record 
results38. 
• MLVAI Materials  
• Subject’s Unit:   If the subject is deemed a suitable candidate for an extend ed evaluation 
period,  they will receive a unit with the user interface customize d for them, along with 
their prescription lenses incorporated, if applicable.  
• Materials for In -Clinic ADL Testing:  Telephone book, kitchen ingredients, etc.  
10. Analysis  
Some of the data gathered through the course of this study is subjective, and will be used by 
eSight to prioritize ongoing improvements to the device.  
The minimum objective data that will be reported is acuity, contrast, reading speed, without 
eSight Eyewear  at the beginning of the trial, and with e Sight Eyewear at its conclusion.  
Further objective data is the comparison between the  initial VFQ , and RAND SF-36 score s, and 
the change, if any, in score at the conclusion of the study.  
Data analysis will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statis tics version 22.  The data will be pooled 
from all testing sites  by the Study Manager.   Before merging of the data, any systematic 
differences among testing sites will be asses sed.  Should such differences exist, they will be 
considered in subsequent analyses.   
Repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and t -tests will be used to compare the 
effect of the eSight devices on all dependent variables that adhere to the assumptions of 
parametric data analysis (continuous variables, normal distribution etc.).   Categorical variables 
or those who do not adhere to parametric assumptions will be compared using repeated -
measures non -parametric techniques (e.g. Friedman Test ).  Qualitative data will be analyzed 
using qualitative description (Sandelowski, 2000) .

 eQUEST  -- ESIGHT QUALITY OF LIFE AND EFFICACY STUDY   
January 2 1, 2016, (v1.4)  Page 28 The eSight device contains an electronic logging cap ability, wherein daily on -time hours, and 
user commands (e.g.: zoom in/out, focus distance, increase/decrease contrast, etc.)  are saved 
to an SD card.  No images or video or other information that may personally identify the subject 
is recorded.  These electronic logs may be used to valida te user reported usage data39. 
Methodological Limitations:  Given the multi -site nature of the study, it is possible that inter -site 
differences may occur, based on recruitment possibilities or slight differences i n procedural or 
testing administration differences.  The research teams wil l closely work together with eSight 
during the preparat ion phase, in order to minimize such differences.  In add ition, before data are 
pooled across sites, statistical comparison will be conducted in order to detection and possibly 
compensate statistically for such site differences.  
As for the limited follow -up time of 3 months, the current study may be limited in its ability to 
show long -term benefits (or device abandonment).  However, follow -up and continuation 
possibilities are currently being discussed, in order to eventually examine the long -term 
variables  involved in the eSight device use.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA209647
Protocol Title :A Phase 2, Open -label, Single -arm, Two-cohort Study of Nivolumab in Relapsed/Refractory Primary 
Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) or Relapsed/Refractory Primary Testicular Lymphoma (PTL)
(CheckMate 647: CHECKpoint pathway and nivoluMAB clinical Trial Evaluation 647)
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Nivolumab (BMS -936558) monotherapy administered intravenously (IV) 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W )
for 8 cycles, followed by  480 mg every 4 weeks (Q4W ) for a total treatment duration of 2 years , or until progressive 
disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent .
Study Phase: 2
Research Hypothesis: Treatment with nivolumab will demonstrate clinically meaningful efficacy in subjects with 
relapsed/refra ctory PCNSL or PTL.
Objectives : 
Primary Objectives:
To assess the clinical benefit of nivolumab in subjects with relapsed/refractory PCNSL orrelapsed/refractory PTL as 
measured by overall response rate ( ORR )by blinded Independent Central Review (BICR). 
Secondary Objectives:
To assess progression -free survival ( PFS) based on BICR assessment for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
To assess ORR and duration of response (DOR )based on investigator assessment for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
To assess overall survival (OS) for PCNSL orPTL, respectively
.
Study Design : This is a Phase 2 open -label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in subjects with 
relapsed/refractory PCNSL or PTL (Figure 1) . Subjects should receive nivolumab at a dose of 240 mg as a 30 -minute 
infusion on Day  1 of each treatment cycle for 8 cycle. Beginning with Cycle 9, subjects should receive nivolumab at 
a dose of 480mg as a 30- minute infusion every 4 weeks (+/- 3days),for a total of 2 years of treatment , or until 
progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent .Subjects should begin study treatment within 3 
calendar days of tre atment assignment.

Study Assessments :The primary  endpoint is BICR-assessed ORR, and will be analy zed 6months after last patient 
first treatment ineach cohort. All treated subjects will be evaluated. The BICR -assessed objective response will be 
further characterized by  the DOR. DOR is defined as the time from first response ( partial response [PR ]or compl ete 
response [ CR]) to the date of initial objectively documented progression as determined using the International Primary 
CNS Ly mphoma Collaborative Group (IPCG )criteria for PCNSL and Lugano 2014 response evaluation for PTL, as 
determined by BICR, or death due to any  cause, whichever occurs first. The secondary endpoints are PFS based on 
BICR assessment, ORR and DOR based on investigator assessment , and OS. Tumor assessments for PCNSL will 
occur every 2 months for 2 years, then every 6 months until diseas e progression . Tumo r assessments for PTL will 
occur every 2 months for 6 months ,then every 3 months for 1.5 years ,then every  6 mo nths until disease progression . 
Toxicity assessments will be continuous during the treatment phase as well as during the first 2safety follow -up visits.

Once subjects reach the survival follow -up phase, either in -person visits or documented telep hone calls to assess the 
subject’s status are acceptable .
Statistical Considerations :
Sample Size:
The planned sample size for this study will be approximately 65 treated subjects, placed into 2cohorts of subjects: 
PCNSL (N= 45) , and PTL (N= 20) .
In addition, Table 2summarizes the 95% exact confidence interval ( CI)for the target ORRs ranging from 28.9% to 
60% with sample size of 20 and 45. At observed ORR 28.9% with 45 PCNSL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% 
CI excludes the historical response rates in of 14% in recurrent primary central nervous system lymphoma . At 
observed ORR ≥ 40% with 20 PTL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes the response rate of 14%.
The sample size for the PCNSL cohort was empirically determined to support expanded assessment of the benefit -
riskprofile of n ivolumab in PCNSL through observation of less common safety events. In particular, administration 
of nivolumab to 45 subjects provides 90% probability of observing at least 1occurrence of any adverse event that 
would occur with 5% incidence i n the population from which the sample is drawn.
Table 2: Observed ORR with Exact 95 % CI
N ORR 95% Exact CI
20 30% [11.9% -54.3%]
35% [15.4% -59.2%]

40.0% [25.7% -55.7%]
51.1% [35.8% -66.3%]
60% [44.3% -74.3%]
Endpoints:
The primary  objective will be measu red by  the primary  endpoint of BICR-assessed ORR. It is defined as the number 
of subjects with a BOR of CR or PR, based on the IPCG criteria for PCNSL ,and Lugano Classification 2014 response 
evaluation for PTL , divided by the number of treated subjects within each cohort. 
The BICR-assessed BOR is defined as the best response designation recorded between the date of first dose and the 
date of initial objectively documented progr ession per criteria or the date of subsequent therapy , whichever occurs 
first. 
The BICR-assessed PFS i s defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of the first documented progression 
per criteria , as determined by BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.
Investigator -assessed ORR and DOR are defined similarly as described for ORR and DOR per BICR assessment 
above, but will be assessed per investigator.
Analyses:
All analyses will be performed separately for each cohort. 
The analy sis of the primary endpoint in each cohort will occur at least 6months after last patient first treatment of 
each cohort.

The ORR based on B ICR assessment will be summarized by binomial response rates and their corresponding 
two-sided 95% exact CIsusing the Clopper -Pearson method. The analysis of ORR per investigator is similar as ORR 
analy sis per BICR, but based on investigator assessment.
DOR based on BICR assessment will be summarized for subjects who achieve PR or CR using the Kaplan -Meier 
product -limit method. Median values of DO R along with 2 -sided 95% CIs and range will also be calculated. The same 
analy sis will be performed for the duration of CR.
PFS based on BICR assessment and OS will be summarized by the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Median 
values along with two -sided 95% CIs based on the log -log transformation, will be calculated. The PFS rate at 6, 12 ,
and 24 months will also be calculated.
The analy sis of ORR and DOR per investigator is similar as ORR and DOR analy sis per BICR, but based on 
investigator assessment.

2 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS
2.1 Good Clinical Practice
This s tudy will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP), as defined by the 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and in accordance with the ethical principles 
underlying European Unio n Directive 2001/20/EC and the United States Code of Federal 
Regulations, Tit le 21, Part 50 (21CFR50).
The study  will be conducted in com pliance wi th the protocol . The protocol  and any amendments 
and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/I EC) approval/favorable opinio n prior to init iation of the study .
All potenti al serious breaches must be reported to Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS )immediately. A 
serious breach is a breach of the condit ions and principles of GCP in connect ion with the study  or
the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safet y or physical or mental 
integrity of the subjects of the study  or the sci entific value of the study.
Personnel involved in conducting this study  will be qualified by educat ion, training, and 
experience t o perform their respective tasks .
This study  will not use the services of study personnel where sancti ons have been invoked or where 
there has been scient ific misconduct or fraud ( eg, loss of medical licensure, debarment). 
2.2 Instituti onal Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee 
Before study  initiation, the invest igator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinio n 
from the IRB/IEC for the protocol , consent form, subject recrui tment materials 
(eg,advertisements), and any other written information to be provided to subje cts. The investigator 
or BMS should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy  of the Invest igator Brochure64or product 
labeling informat ion to be provided to subjects and any updates. 
The investigator or BMS shoul dprovi de the IRB/IEC with reports, upd ates,and other informatio n 
(eg, expedited safet y reports, amendments ,and administrative letters )accor ding to regulatory 
requi rements or i nstitution procedures .
2.3 Informed Consent
Invest igators must ensure that subjects are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential 
risks, and other crit ical issues regarding clinical studies in which they  volunteer to participate. 
In situations where consent cannot be given to subjects, their legally acceptable representatives
(asper country guidelines) are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and 
other cri tical issues regarding clinical studies in which the subject volunteers to participate. 
BMS will provi de the invest igator with an appropri ate (ie, Global or Local) sample informed 
consent form (ICF) which will include all elements requi red by ICH, GCP ,and applicable

regul atory  requirements. The sample ICFwill adhere to the ethical principles tha t have their origin 
in the Declarat ion of Helsinki .
Invest igators must ensure the fo llowing :
1)Provi de a copy  of the consent form and written information about the study in the language in 
which the subject is most proficient prior to clinical study part icipation. The language must be 
non-technical and easily  understood. 
2)Allow time necessary for subject or subject's legally acceptable representative to inquire about 
the details of the study .
3)Obtain an informed consent signed and personally dated by  the subje ct or the subject's legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussio n. 
4)Obtain the IRB/IEC’s written approval /favorable opinio n of the written ICF and any other 
inform ation to be provided to the subjects, prior to th e beginning of the study, and after any 
revisio ns are com pleted for new informat ion.
5)If informed consent is initially given by a subject’s legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, and the subject subsequent ly beco mes capable of making a nd co mmunicat ing his or 
herinformed consent during the study, consent must addit ionally be obtained fro m the subject.
6)Revise the informed consent whenever important new informat ion becomes available that is 
relevant to the subject's consent. The invest igator, or a person designated by the invest igator, 
shoul d fully inform the subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative or legal 
guardi an, of all pertinent aspects of the study  and of any new inform ation relevant to the 
subject's willingness tocontinue participat ion in the study . This communicat ion shoul d be 
docum ented. 
The confidentialit y of records that could ident ify subjects must be protected, respecting the privacy 
and confident iality rules applicable to regulatory  requi rements, the subjects' signed ICF and, in the 
US, the subjects’ signed HIPAA Authorizat ion.
The consent form must also include a statem ent that BMS and regul atory  authori ties have direct 
access to subject records. 
The ri ghts, safet y, and well -being of the study  subjec ts are the m ost important considerati ons and 
shoul d prevail  over interests of science and societ y.
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
3.1 Study Design and Duration
CA209 647is a Phase 2, open -label, single -arm, 2-cohort study to estimate the safet y and efficacy 
of nivolumab in subjects with relapsed/ refractory PCNSL orPTL. Nivolumab 240 mg will be 
given every  2 weeks for 8 cycles . Beginning with Cycle 9, nivolumab 480 mg will be given every 
4 weeks for a total therapy  durati on of 2years , or unt il progressive disease, unacceptable toxicit y, 
or withdrawal of consent . Nivo lumab will be administered as a 30-minute infusio n.A finite 
treatm ent duration with immune therapi es in this patient popul ation remains an area of ongoing 
research; therefore the treatment duration chos en was 2 y ears.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone 
surgi cal sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) and is not postm enopausal . 
Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a wom an over age 45 years in the absence 
of other biological or physio logical causes. In addition, females under the age of 55 years must 
have a serum follicle st imulating horm one(FSH) leve l >40mIU/mL to confirm menopause.

Females treated with hormone replacement therapy  (HRT) are likely to have artificially  suppressed 
FSH levels and may requi re a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH level. The 
durati on of the washout period is a funct ion of the type o f HRT used. The duration o f the washout 
period below are suggested guidelines and the investigators shoul d use their judgeme nt in checking 
serum  FSH levels:
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products
Other parenteral products may require washout periods as long as 6 mo nths. If the serum FSH level 
is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausal.
3.3.4 MRI Contraindication
Study -related MRI imaging of the brain will be perform ed per the frequency  specified in the 
protocol . Invest igators may obtain additional follow-up MRI scans as medically indicated. For 
other locally  performed imaging, it is the local imaging facilit y’s responsibili ty to determine, based 
on subject attributes (eg, allergy  history, diabetic history ,and renal status), the appropriate imaging 
modality,and contrast regimen for each subject. Imaging contraindications and contrast risks 
shoul d be considered in this assessment. Subjects with renal insufficiency should be assessed as to 
whether or not they should receive contrast, and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. 
Specific to MRI, subjects with severe renal insuffici ency (ie,estimated glomerular filtration rate
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject popul ation, who shoul d be excluded from the study . In addit ion, 
subjects with surgically implanted devices (pacemaker, deep brain stimulator, metallic implants, 
etc.) incompat ible with MRI shoul d not undergo such imaging techniques. The local imaging 
facilit y and invest igator should determine the appropriate precautions or guideli nes that should be 
instituted for subjects with tattoos, body  piercings ,or other body  art.
The ultimate decisio n to perform MRI in an individual subject in this study  rests with the site 
radiologist, the invest igator and the standard set by the local Ethi cs Committee.

3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects following any Treatment with Study Drug 
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent
Disease progressi on, except as described in Section 4.5.6
Unacceptable toxicit y, see S ection 4.5.5
Any clinical AE, laboratory abnorm ality,or intercurrent illness which, in the opinio n of the 
investigator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in the best interest of the 
subject , see Section 4.5.5
Pregnancy (as specified in Sect ion6.4)
Terminat ion of the study  by BMS
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent thro ugh imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of ei ther a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious di sease) illness.
This is a survival study; therefore subjects discontinuing study  treatment will remain on study  for 
docum entati on of  progressi on and death.
In the case of pregnancy, the invest igator must immediately notify  Sponsor or designee of this 
event. In most cases, the study drug(s) will be permanent ly discont inued in an appropriate manner 
(eg, dose tapering if necessary  for subject safet y).Please contact the Sponsor or designee within 
24 hours of awareness of pregnancy . If the investigator determines a possible favorable benefit/ris k 
ratio that warrants continuat ion of study drug, a discussio n between theinvest igator and the 
Sponsor or designee must occur.
All subjects who discont inue study  drug should comply with protocol  specified follow-up 
procedures as outlined in Section 5. The only excepti on to this requi rement is when a subject 
withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post -treatm ent study  follow-up or l oses the

a psy chiatri c or phy sical illness).
If study  drug is discont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study , the reason for the 
discontinuat ion must be docum ented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate case report form (CRF) page.
3.6 Post Study Drug Study Follow- up
In this study , OSis a secondary endpo int. Post study follow-up is of critical importance and is 
essent ial to preserving subject safet y and study  integrity. Subjects who discontinue study  drug 
must continue to be followed every  3 months after the second follow-up visit, for collect ion of 
outcom e and/or survival fo llow-up data as req uired and in line w ith Section 5until death or study 
concl usion.Survival follow -upmay be acco mplished by  visit or phone contact .
BMS may request that survival data be collected on all treated subjects outsi de of the protoc ol-
defined window (Table 5.1-1). At the time of this request, each subject will be contacted to 
determine thei r survival  status unless the subject has wi thdrawn consent for all  contacts or i s lost 
to fo llow-up.
In addition, for subjects who discont inue study  therapy by proceeding to allogeneic stem  cell 
transpl ant, documentati on of acute and chronic GVHD will be captured on Day 100, at 6 months, 
1year, and every year thereafter from the date of stem cell infusi on until the first non-CR after 
stem cell transplant is documented.
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study  drug will remain in the study  and must continue to be 
followed for protocol specified fo llow-up procedures. The only exception to this is when a subject 
specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authorized by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal  of consent shoul d be explained in detail in the medical records by the invest igator, as 
to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study fo llow-up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the 
event that vi tal status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
inform ation shoul d be used to determine vi tal status only as appropriately  directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up wi th persons authori zed by  the subjec t as noted above. Lost to fo llow-up 
is defined asthe inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum o f 3docum ented phone calls, faxes, 
or em ails as we ll as lack of response by  subject to 1registered mail letter. All attem pts shoul d be 
docum ented in the subject’s medical records. If  it is determined that the subject has died, the si te 
will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of de ath.

4.1 Investigational Product
An IP, also known as IMP in someregions, is defined as a pharmaceut ical form of an active 
substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study , including products 
already with a marketing authorizat ion but used or assembled (f ormulated or packaged) different ly 
thanthe authorized form, or used for an unauthori zed indicat ion, or when used to gain further 
inform ation about the authorized form.
The IPshould be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is the responsibilit y of 
the invest igator to ensure that IP is only dispensed to study  subjects. The IPmust be dispensed 
only from official study  sites b y authorized personnel according to local regulat ions.
In thi s protocol , the investigational product is nivo lumab (BMS -936558).
4.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnosti c, or therapeutic 
reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosi s, may be considered as non-
IPs. 
4.3 Storage and Dispensing
The product storage manager shou ld ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidi ty) as determined by BMS . If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study drug arise, the study drug should not be dispense d
and BMS shoul d be contacted immediately.
Study  drug not supplied by  BMS will  be stored in accordance with the package insert.
Invest igational product documentation (whether supplied by BMS or not) must be maintained that 
includes all processes requi red toensure drug is accurately administered. This includes 
docum entati on of drug storage, administration ,and, as applicable, storage temperatures, 
reconstitution, and use of required processes ( eg,required diluents, administration sets).

4.5 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
4.5.1 Nivolumab Dose and Schedule
Subjects shoul d receive nivo lumab at a dose of 240 m g as a 30 -minute infusio n on Day 1 of each 
treatm ent cycle for the first 8 cycles until progressi on, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, or the study  ends, whichever occurs first. Subjects shoul d begin study treatment within 
3calendar days of treatm entassignment. Beginning with Cycle9, subjects shoul d receive 
nivolumab at a dose of  480 mg as a 30-minute infusionuntil progressi on, unacceptable toxicity, 
withdrawal  of consent, or the study  ends, whichev er occurs first.
There will  be no dose escalati ons or reducti ons of  nivo lumab allowed. Subj ects m ay be dosed no 
less than 12 days from the previous dose. For Q4W dosing cycles, subjects may be dosed within a 
+/- 3-day window . Prem edicati ons are not recomme nded for the first dose of nivo lumab.
Subjects should be carefully mo nitored for infusio n reactions during nivo lumab administration. If 
an acute infusion react ion is noted, subjects should be managed according to Section 4.5.8 .
Doses of nivolumab may be interrupted, delayed, or discont inued depending on how well the 
subject tolerates the treatment. Dosing visit s are not ski pped, only  delayed.

4.5.6 Nivolumab Treatment Beyond Progression
Evidence indicates a minorit y of subjects treated wit h immunotherapy  may derive clinical benefit  
despite init ial evidence of PD ,61eg, due to inflammatory  reacti on simulat ing progression (“tumor 
flare” or pseudoprogressi on). Pseudoprogression is well described in neuro -oncol ogy, and refers 
to radi ographic enlargement of tumor lesions that woul d be interpreted as disease progressi on by 
convent ional response criteria, but upon histol ogic examinat ion reveals necrosis and/or

inflammat ion (treatm ent effect) and not disease progressi on.61A similar pheno menon has been 
observed in various tumors when treated with immunotherapeutic agents, in which transient 
enlargement of lesions or appearance of new lesions is attributab le to the influx of immune cells. 
These potential  immune treatm ent effects complicate the evaluat ion of response and may lead to 
prem ature discont inuat ion of therapy. Furtherm ore, the time period to pseudoprogression or tumor 
flare with different immune therapies varies in different malignancies. See Appendix 6 for the 
management of tumor flarefor subjects enrolled in this study . 
Subjects treated with nivo lumab will be permitted to continue ni volumab treatm ent bey ond init ial 
progressive disease , assessed by the invest igator, as long as they meet the fo llowing cri teria:
Invest igator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance of study  drug
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases or fro m ma ss effect )
Subject provides written informed consent prior to receiving a dditional nivolumab treatment
All other elements of the main consent including descript ion of reasonably  foreseeable risks or 
discomforts, or other alternat ive treatment options will still apply .
A radiographic assessment/ scan shoul d be performed within 8weeks of initial 
investigator -assessed progression to determine whether there has been a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD. The assessment of clinical benefit should be balanced by clinical judgment as to 
whether the subject is clinically  deteriorating and unlikely  to receive any benefit from continued 
treatm ent wi th nivo lumab.
If the investigator considers that the nivolumab subject continue s to achieve clinical benefit by 
continuing treatment, the subject shoul d remain on the trial and cont inue to receive monitoring 
according to the time and events schedule in Section 5.1.
If at the radiographic assessment/scan at 8 weeks of initial invest igator -assessed progression 
(based on IPCG for brain in PCNSL, or Lugano for systemic disease and potenti al brain/spine 
lesions in PTL) the assessment de termines continued PD but all the above criteria are met and the 
investigator considers the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by cont inuing treatment, the 
subject mayremain on the trial and continue to receive treatm ent and monitoring according to the 
time and events schedule in Section 5.1.Potential for clinical benefit shoul d be balanced by clinica l 
judgment as to wheth er the subject i s clinically  deteri orating and unlikely  to receive benefit from 
continued treatment with nivo lumab. 
A second radiographic assessment/scan shoul d be performed within 8 weeks of second 
investigator -assessed progression to determine whether t here has been a decrease in the tumor size 
or continued PD (based on IPCG for brain in PCNSL, or Lugano for systemic disease and potentia l 
brain/spine lesio ns in PTL) . If this second 8-week radiographic assessment/scan determines 
continued PD, then the pat ient shoul d discontinue therapy and enter the follow -up peri od.

4.5.7 Management Algorithms for Immuno -Oncology Agents
Immuno-oncol ogy (I-O) agents are associated with AEs that can differ in severit y and durati on 
than AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Nivo lumab is considered an I-Oagent in this 
protocol . Early recogni tion and management of AEs associ ated with I-O agents may mitigate 
severe toxicity. Man agement algorithms have been devel oped to assi st invest igators in assessing 
and managing the following groups of AEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmo nary
Hepati c
Endocrinopathy
Skin
Neurol ogical
The above algorithms are found in the nivolumab Investigator Brochure64and Appendix 5of this 
protocol .
4.5.8 Treatment of Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since nivolumab contains only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, it is unlikely to be
immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a reaction were 
to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, arthralgia, 
hypot ension, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic -like reacti ons. All Grade 3 or 4 
infusio n react ions shoul d be reported within 24 hours to the study  medical  monitor and reported 
as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusion react ions should be graded a ccording to National  Cancer 
Institute(NCI) CTCAE v4.03guidelines.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptom s(mild reacti on; infusio n interrupti on not indicated; intervent ion not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/pa racetam ol 325 to 1000 m g at l east 30 minutes before 
additional nivo lumab administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms (moderate reaction required therapy or in fusion interruption but responded
promptly to symptomat ic treatm ent [eg, antihistamines, non-steroi dal anti-inflammatory drugs, 
narcoti cs, corticostero ids, bronchodilators, IV fluids] ; prophylact ic med ications indicated for 
24hours):

diphenhydramine 50 mg IV (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 
1000 mg; remain at bedside and monitor subj ect until  resol ution of symptom s. Corti costeroi d 
and/or bronchodilator therapy  may also be administered as appropriate. If the infusio n is 
interrupted, then restart the infusio n at 50% of the original infusio n rate when symptoms 
resolve; if no further co mplications ensue after 30 minutes, the rate may be increased to 100% 
of the original infusio n rate. Monitor subject closely . If symptom s recur, then no further 
nivolumab will be administered at that visit.
For future infusio ns, the following prophylacti c prem edicat ions are recommended: 
diphenhydramine 50 mg (or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamo l 325 to 1000 mg 
shoul d be administered at least 30 minute s before nivolumab infusio ns. If necessary , 
corticosteroi ds (up to 25 m g ofhydrocorti sone or equivalent) may be used.
For Grade 3 or 4 symp toms (Grade 3: severe reacti on,prolonged [ie, not rapidly responsive to 
symptom atic medicat ion and/or brief interruption of  infusio n],recurrence of symptom s following 
initial improvement, hospitalization indicat ed for other clinical sequelae [eg, renal impairment, 
pulmo nary infiltrates]; Grade 4: life threatening, pressor or ventilatory  support indicated):
Immediatel y discont inue infusio n of nivolumab. Begin an IV infusio n of normal saline and 
treat the subject as follows: Reco mmend bronchodilators, epinephrine 0.2 to 1 mg of a 
1:1000 solution for subcutaneous administration or 0.1 to 0.25 mg of a  1:10,000 solution 
injected slowly for IV administration, and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV with 
methylpredniso lone 100 mg IV (or equivalent), as needed. Subject shoul d be monitored until 
the invest igator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur. Nivolumab will be 
perm anently discont inued. Invest igators should follow their institutional guidelines for the 
treatm ent of anaphylaxis. Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery of the 
symptoms.
In case of late-occurring hypersensit ivity symptoms (eg, appearance of a localized or generalized 
pruri tus within 1 week after treatm ent), symptomat ic treatment may be given (eg, oral 
antihistamine or corticosteroids).

Once subjects reach the survival fo llow-up phase, either in -person visit s or documented telep hone 
calls to assess the subject’s status are acceptable.
For subjects who discont inue study  therapy by proceeding to allogeneic stem  cell transplant, 
docum entati on of acute and chronic GVHD will be capture d on Day 100, at 6months, 1 year, and 
every year thereafter from the date of  stem cell infusio n until the first non-CR after transplant is 
docum ented. Invest igators will make telephone contact with the subject’s 
hematol ogist/oncol ogist/transplant physician to obtain this informat ion if the subject is being 
followed by another physi cian.
Adverse events and laboratory  values will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE versio n 4.03.
The start and stop time of the study  therapy infusions and any interrupti ons or infusio n rate

Baseline Staging 
PCNSL
All PCNSL subjects will undergo gadolinium -enhanced MRI of the brain (and of the spine for 
subjects with spinal symptom s)at the timepoints specified in Table 5.1-1and Table 5.1-2for 
baseline assessment and on study  response assessment purposes. Invest igators may obtain more 
frequent follow-up MRI scans as medically indicated. Local radiologic assessment of tumor 
measurements will be used for clinical management and investigator- assessed clinical endpo ints.
Subjects who are unable (due to existent medical condition, ie, pacemaker or implantable 
cardi overter -defibrillator device) or unwilling to have a brain MRI at baseline are excluded from 
the study (Section 3.3.4 ). Subj ects who becom e unable to undergo MRI imaging after enrollment  
may continue in the study for assessment of OSas long as there is no safet y issue which would 
requi re monitoring by  MRI. 
Study  sites will  retain l ocal access to the imaging results for safet y and efficacy reading purposes. 
The study invest igator will review the local MRI result s as clinically appropriate to ensure that any 
potenti ally emergent clinical situations are addressed in a timely fashio n. Clinically  significant 
radiologic findings or changes fro m baseline scans will be coded as AEs or SAEs according to the

On-study  assessments shoul d include chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and all known sites of disease 
(including CNS and/or spine ) and shoul duse the same imaging method that was used at baseline. 
PCNSL subjects will be evaluated for tumor response by MRI at Week 8 from the first dose and 
continuing for every  8 weeks fo r the first 2 y ears (104 weeks) . PTL subjects will be evaluated for 
tumor response by FDG -PET/CT or PET/MRI at Week8 from the first dose and continuing for 
every 8 week s for the first 6 months (26 weeks), then every 12 weeks for 18 months. After the first 
2 years, tumor assessments are to occur every  24 weeks unt il disease progressi on is docum ented.
Assessment of Overall Tumor Burden and Measurable Disease 
To serially evaluate tumor response to therapy, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor burden 
at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable disease is 
defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesio n. At baselin e, tum or lesions/lymph 
nodes will be categorized as measurable or non -measurable.
Measurable Lesions 
Focal  uptake in nodal  and extranodal  sites that i s in keeping wi th lympho ma, according to the 
distribut ion and/or CT characteristics, is considered involvement with lympho ma, including 
spleen, liver, bone, thy roid, and so on. 
Measured dominant lesions: Upto 6 of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and 
extranodal lesio ns selected to be clearly measurable in 2 diameters. 
Nodes shoul d pref erably  be from disparate regi ons of  the body  and shoul d include, where 
applicable, mediast inal and retroperi tonealareas. A measurable node must have a longest  
diameter (LDi) >1.5 cm. 
Non-nodal  lesions include those in solid organs (eg, liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI 
involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpati on. A measurable extranodal 
lesion must have a LDi > 1.0 cmand may be included in the 6 representative, measured 
lesions ( eg, hepatic nodules).
A sum o f the product of the diameters (SPD) will be calculated for all target lesio ns(CNS and 
non-CNS) and recorded as the baseline SPD. The baseline SPD will be used as reference to 
further characterize any object ive tumor regression in the measurable dimensio n of the disease.
CT Measurements
For subjects staged with CT, up to 6 of the largest target nodes, nodal masses, or other 
lympho matous lesions that are measurable in 2 diam eters (LDi and shortest diameter) shoul d be 
ident ified from different body regions representative of the patient’s overall disease burden and 
include mediast inal and retroperi toneal  disease, if involved. A measurable node m ust have a LDi 
greater than 1.5 cm. Measurable extranodal disease (eg, hepatic nodules) may be included in the 6 
representative, measured lesio ns. For extranodal measurable lesion the LDi must b e greater than 
1.0 cm . All other lesio ns (including nodal, extrano dal, and assessable disease) should be fo llowed 
as non-measured disease (eg, cutaneous, GI, bone, spleen, liver, kidneys, pleural  or pericardial 
effusio ns, ascites) .

Non-Measurable Lesions
Besides small lymph nodes (longest diameter < 10 mm), truly non- measurable lesio ns include: 
leptom eningeal disease, ascites, pleural  or pericardial effusi on, inflammatory  breast disease, 
lymphangit ic involvement of skin or lung, or abdominal masses/abdo minal organom egaly 
ident ified by physical exam that are not mea surable by  reproducible imaging techniques.
Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease andtruly  assessable disease shoul d be 
considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal  masses, and extranodal  sites not 
selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurabilit y but are 
still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected disease 
that would be difficult to follow quant itatively with measurement, including pleural effusi ons, 
ascites, bone lesions, leptom eningeal  disease, abdominal masses, and other l esions that cannot be 
confirmed and followed b y imaging. In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal  sites (eg, GI tract, liver, 
bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediast inum with complete metabolic 
response, but should be no higher than surrounding norm al physiologic uptake (eg , with marrow 
activat ion as a result of chemotherapy  or myel oid growth factors).
All other lesions (or si tes of  disease) includin g non -measurable lymph nodes should be identified 
as non -target l esions and shoul d also be recorded at baseline. Measurem ents are not requi red and 
these lesions shoul d be fo llowed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal progressio n’. 
In addit ion, it is possible to record mult iple non -target lesio ns invo lving the same organ as a single 
item on the CRF ( eg, ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or mult iple liver nodules’) .
Bone Marrow Assessments
Bone marrow assessments should be done only if c linically  indicated in both subjects with PCNSL 
orPTL. The biopsy/aspirate performed within 90 days prior to obtaining informed consent must 
be docum ented at screening or a bone marrow biopsy/aspirate must be perform ed during the 
screening period if clinically  indicated. For PCNSL orPTL subjects with bone marrow 
involvement at screening, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate will be requi red to confirm an 
objective response.
In addit ion to efficacy assessments, addit ional, optional, bone marrow biopsy and aspirate samples 
may be collected and submitted for bio marker studies .
CSF Assessments
CSF cyto logy should be done if clinically indicated. If performed wit hin 90 days prior to obtaining 
inform ed consent they  must be docum ented at screening or a l umbar pun cture m ust be perform ed 
during the screening period. For PCNSL orPTL subjects with CSF involvement at screening, a 
lumbar puncture with CSF collection will be required to confirm an object ive response.

is an object ive, quick, user -friendly and quant ifiable evaluat ion of nine major domains f or subjects 
with brain tumors. The domains include: gait, strength, ataxia, sensati on, visual field, facial 
strength, language, level of consci ousness, behavior and overall . Each dom ain is rated on a scale 
of 0 to 3 where 0 represents normal and 3 represen ts the worst severit y. A given do main should be 
scored non -evaluable if it cannot be accurately  assessed due to preexisting condi tions, co -morbid 
events and/or concurrent medications. The evaluati on is based on direct observat ion/testing 
perform ed during r outine office visits. 
The NANO scale will be completed by the investigator or designated study  physician prior to 
dosing on Day 1 Week 1 and then with each MRI (but must be completed before MRI scan results 
are reviewed with the subject).
5.5 Pharmacokinetic and CSF Biomarker Assessments
Blood samples for PKand immunogenicit y assessment swill be collected inall subjects. Paired 
 blood samples for PK  will also be collected in patients who consent to 
having lumbar punctures performed. Table 5.5-1lists the sampling schedule to be followed for 
routi ne PKand immunogenicit ysamples . Blood s amples shoul d be drawn from asite other than 
the infusio n site (ie, contral ateral  arm) on days of the infusio n. All samples collected predose 
shoul d be taken just prior to nivolumab administratio n, and end -of-infusion (EOI) samples should 
be taken as close to EOI as possible (pref erably 2 m inutes prior to EOI) on the contral ateral  arm 
(ie, the arm  not for the infusi on). All on-treatm ent PK time points are intended to align wi th days 
on which nivolumab is administered . If it is known that a dose is going to be delayed, then the 
predose sample shoul d be collected just prior to the delayed dose. However, if a predose sample 
is collected but the dose is subsequent ly delayed, an addit ional predose sample shoul d not be 
collected. Table 5.5-2lists the sampling schedule to be fo llowed for paired  blood samples. 
For those patients who are on-study  prior to Revised Protocol 04, sampling shoul d begin wit h the 
cycle thepatients are on, according to Table 5.5-2. Further details of blood collect ion, 
collect ion,processing , labeling, handling, stora ge,and shipment of samples will be provi ded in

Outcom esresearch data including health-related qualit y of life (QoL) and patient -reported 
symptom  burden provi de a more complete understanding of the impact of treatment by 
incorporating the patients’ perspective. Treatment -related toxicit ies have been ident ified as a 
significant problem in both PCNSL, where neurotoxicit y has been attributed to cognitive 
dysfunct ion, and in PTL, where patient age has reduced tolerance to aggressive chem otherapies. 
The importance of capturing patient-reported outcom es data has beco me critically important as

symptom  management and maintaining QoL are key metrics for assessing overall treatment 
benefit.
5.7.1 EORTC QLQ- C30 and BN20
The EORTC QLQ -C3068is the most commo nly used quali ty of life instrument in onco logy trials. 
The instrument’s 30 items are divided among 5 functional scales (physical, role, cogni tive, 
emotional, and social), 9symptom  scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomit ing, dyspnea, insomnia, 
appeti te loss, constipat ion, diarrhea, and financial difficult ies), and a global healt h/qualit y of life 
scale. With the except ion of 2items included in the global health/qualit y of life scale, for whic h 
responses range from 1 (Very  poor) to 7 (Excellent), item responses range from 1 (Not at all) to 4 
(Very  much). Reduced cognit ivefunction has been recognized as a significant problem in pat ients 
treated for PCNSL, and previ ous research has supported the validi ty of the cogni tive funct ioning 
scale of the QLQ -C30 in a variet yof populati ons. The EORTC QLQ -BN2069is a validated 
measure of concerns and symptom s specific to b rain neoplasms. The questi onnaire’s 20 i tems are 
divided among mu lti-item scales measuring future uncertaint y (4items), visual disorders (3items), 
motor dysfunct ion (3 items), and communicat ion deficits (3  items),as well as single- item 
measures of problems wit h headaches, seizures, drowsiness, itchy  skin, hair l oss, l ower extremit y 
weakness, and bladder control . Each of the questio nnaire’s items uses a 4-point response scale 
ranging from 1 (Not at all) to 4 (Very  much). Raw scores for the QLQ -C30 and QLQ-BN20 are 
transformed to a 0-100 metric such that higher values indicate better functioning or QoL or a higher 
level o f symptom s. The QLQ -C30 will be administered to all treated subjects in both the PCNSL 
and PTL cohorts , while the QLQ -BN20 will be admini stered to all treated subjects in the PCNSL 
cohort ,during the on -study  and f ollow-up phases as outlined in Sect ion5.1.
5.7.2 EQ-5D 3L
The EQ-5D-3L70is a generic multi-attribute heal th-state cl assificat ion system by which heal th is 
described in 5 dimensi ons: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and 
anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensio n is evaluated using 3 levels: no problems, so me problems, and 
severe probl ems. Responses to these 5 dimensio ns are converted into 1 of 243 unique EQ-5D 
healt h state descriptions, which range between no problems on all 5 dimensio ns (11111) to 
severe/extreme probl ems on all 5 dimensio ns (33333). Using appropriate country -specific value 
weighting algorithms, a respondent’s self-described healt h state can be converted into a utility 
represent ing the so cietal desirabilit y of his/her own healt h. In addition, the EQ-5D includes a visua l 
analogue scale (VAS) all owing a r espondent to rate his/her healt h on a scal e ranging from 0–100 
with 0 being the worst health state imaginable and 100 being the best healt h state imaginable. The 
EQ-5D- 3L will be administered to all treated subjects in both the PCNSL and PTL cohorts during
the on-study , follow-up, and survival fo llow-up phases as outlined in Sect ion 5.1.

anti-drug antibodies (ADA) response to nivolumab may also be performed using a validated 
funct ional cell -based assay . All on-treatm ent time points are intended to align wit h days on which 
study  drug is administered, if dosing occurs on a different day, the immunogenicit y sampling 
shoul d be adjusted accordingly. Selected serum  samples may be analyzed by an exploratory 
method that measures anti-nivolumab for technol ogy explorat ion purposes; exploratory  data will 
not be reported.
In addition, serum  samples designated for PK or biomarker assessments may also be used for 
immunogenicit y analysis if requi red (eg, insufficient volume for complete immunogenicit y 
assessment or to fo llow up on suspected immunogenicit y related AE).
6 ADVERSE EVE NTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condi tion in aclinical invest igation subject administered study  drug and that 
does notnecessarily have a causal  relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unint ended sign (such asan abnorm allaboratory  finding ), symptom , or disease 
temporally  associ ated with the use of study  drug, whether or not considered related to the study 
drug.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
AEs.The ca usal relati onship can be 1of the f ollowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration and 
the AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug 
administration and the AE.
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship.
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more AEs.)
Immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) are AEs consis tent with an immune -mediated 
mechanism or immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg,infect ion 
or tum or progressi on) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an al ternate etiology 
which were exacerbated by the induct ion of autoimmunit y. Informat ion supporting the assessment 
will be co llected on the subject’s CRF .
BMS will be reporting AEs to regulatory  authoriti es and ethics committees according to local 
applicable laws including European Direct ive 2001/20/EC and FDA Code of Federal Regulat ions 
21 CFR Parts 312 and 320.

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose : 
Results in death
Is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at ri sk ofdeath at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe)
Requires inpat ient hospitalizat ion or causes prolo ngation of existing hospi talizat ion (see 
NOTE below)
Results in persistent or significant di sabili ty/incapaci ty
Is a congenital ano maly/birth defect 
Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event[s] that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi talizati on.) Potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.)
Admissio n for administration of anticancer therapy  in the absence of any other SAEs (see 
NOTE below) 
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE .
Although pregnanc y,overdose , cancer ,and potenti al DILI are not always serious by regulatory 
definit ion, these events must be handled as SAE s.(See Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng pregnancies .)
Any component of a study endpo int that is consider ed related to study therapy (eg, death is an 
endpo int, if death occurred due to anaphylaxis, anaphylaxis must be reported) shoul d be reported 
as SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details ).
NOTE : 
The fo llowing hospi talizati onsarenot consi dered SAEs in BMS cl inical studies: 
Avisit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event)
Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent
Admissi ons as pe r protocol  for a pl anned m edical/surgi cal procedure
Routine healt h assessment requiring admissio n for baseline/trending of health status 
(eg,routine co lonoscopy )
Medical/surgical admissio n other than to remedy  ill healt h and planned pri or to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases.

6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Secti ons 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 in the Invest igator Brochure64represent the Reference Safety Informat ion 
to determine expectedness of SAEs for expedited reportin g. Following the subject’s written 
consent to participate in the study , all SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, m ust be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified procedures . All SAEs 
must be collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of the last dose of 
nivolumab . For subjects assigned to treatment and never treated with study  drug, SAEs shoul d be 
collected for 30 days fro m the date of treatment ass ignment. Ifapplicable, SAEs must be collected 
that rel ate to any  later protocol -specified procedure (eg, a fo llow-up bi opsy). 
The investigator mustreport any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or pr otocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report mustbe completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
If the invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a  study 
procedure), the relat ionship mustbe specified in the narrative section o f the SAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related or not related to study  drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS 
(ordesignee) within 24 hours of awareness of the event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report 
Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form  (electroni c or paper forms). The preferred 
method for SAE data reporting collection is through the eCRF. The paper SAE/pregnancy 
surveillance forms are only intended as a back -up option when the eCRF system is not functioning.
In this case, the paper forms are to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) 
transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Conta ctInformat ion list.
SAE Facsimile Number : Refer to Contact Informati on list.
For studi es capturing SAEs through electroni c data capture, el ectronic submissio n is the requi red 
method for reporting. In the event the electroni c system  is unavailable for transmissio n, paper 
forms must be used and submitted immediately. When paper forms are used, the original paper 
forms are to rem ain on site.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy reporting) :Refer to Contact
Inform ation list.
If only limite d informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Foll ow-up 
SAE reports mustinclude the same i nvest igator term[s] initially reported.)

The collect ion of nonseriousAE informat ion should begin at ini tiation of study  drug. Non serious 
AEinformat ion shoul d also be collected from the start of a  placebo lead-in period or other 
observat ional period intended to establish a baseline status for the subjects.
Nonserious AEs shoul d be followed to resol ution or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Section 6.1.1 ). Follow-up is also requi red for nonserious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or d iscont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified nonse rious AEs must be recorded and described on the nonseri ous AE 
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
All nonserious AEs(not only those deemed to be treatm ent-related) shoul d be collected 
continuously during the treatm ent period and for a minimum of 100 days fo llowing discont inuat ion 
of study  treatm ent.
Every  AEmust be assessed by the invest igator with regard to whether it is considered immune -
mediated. For events which are potentially immune -mediated, addit ional inform ation will be 
collected on the subject’s CRF .
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory  test resul t abnormalit ies shoul d be captured on the nonseri ous AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form  electroni c) as appropri ate. Paper form s are only  intended as a back -up 
option when the electronic system  is not functioning .
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE 
Any laboratory test resul tabnormalit y that required the subject to have study drug discontinued 
or interrupted
Any laboratory test resul tabnormalit y that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory  term  woul d be used by the 
reporting invest igator ( eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation ofthe study  drug, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study subject is 
pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of study expos ure, including during at 
approximately 5half-lives after product adm inistrati on, the invest igator m ust immediately notify

Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS . Information on this pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessi veand medically important. All occurrences of overdose must be 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.1.1 for reporting details).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Li ver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d 
occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event. All occurrences of potential DILIs, meet ing 
the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs (see Section 6.1.1 for reporti ng details).
Potenti al drug induced liver injury  is defined as: 
1.AT(ALT or AST) elevation > 3xULN
AND
2.Total  bilirubin > 2xULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase),
AND
3.No other immediately apparent possible causes of AT elevat ion and hyperbilirubinemia, 
including, but not limi ted to, vi ral hepatitis, pre-exist ing chronic or acute liver disease, or the 
administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.
6.7 Other Safety Considerations
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinat ions, electrocardiogram, 
x-ray filming ,any other potenti al safet y assessment required or not required by protocol  should 
also be recorded as a nonserious or serious AE, as appropr iate, and reported accordingly.

7 BLINDED INDEPENDENT CENTRAL REVIEW
A blinded independent central review will be conducted of the images and relevant clinical data in 
this study . The activi ties and processes regarding the independent read will be outlined in the 
CA209 -647 Im aging Review Charter.
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1 Sample Size Determination
The planned sample size for this study  will be approximately  65 treated subjects, placed into 
2cohorts of subjects: PCNSL (N= 45) , and PTL (N= 20) .
In addition,Table 8.1-1summarizes the 95% exact confidence interval (CI)for the target ORRs 
ranging from 28.9% to 60% with sample size of 20 and 45. At observed ORR 28.9% with 
45PCNSL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes thehistorical response rates in of 
14% in recurrent primary  central  nervous system  lymphom a41. At observed ORR ≥ 40% wi th 20 
PTL subjects, the lower bound of the 95% CI excludes the response rate of 14%. 
The sample size for the PCNSL cohort was empirically  determined to support expanded 
assessment of the benefit -risk profile of nivo lumab in PCNSL through observation of less commo n 
safet y events. In parti cular, administrati on of  nivolumab to 45 subj ects provi des 90% probabili ty 
of observing at least 1 occurrence of any AE that would occur with 5% incidence in the populat ion 
from which the sample is d rawn.

8.3.1 Primary Endpoint(s)
The primary  object ive will be measured by the primary  endpo int of BICR- assessed ORR. Itis 
defined as the number of subjects wi th a best overall response (BOR) of CR or PR, based on the 
IPCG Criteria for PCNSL21and Lugano 2014 response evaluat ion for PTL,22divided by the 
number of treated subjects within each cohort. 
The BICR- assessed BOR is defined as the best response designat ion recorded between the date of 
first study drug dose and the date of ini tial objectively  docum ented progressi on per cri teria or the 
date of  subsequent therapy , whichever occurs fi rst.For purposes of analysis, if a subject receives 
one dose and discont inues the study  without assessment or receives subsequent therapy  prior to 
assessment, this subject will be counted in the denominator (as non-responder).
The BICR -assessed object ive response will be further characterized by the DOR, defined as the 
time from first response (CR or PR) to the date of initial objectively documented progression as 
determined using the IPCG Criteria for PCNSL and Lugano 2014 response evaluat ion for PTL, as 
determined by BICR, o r death due to any  cause, whichever occurs first. For subj ects who nei ther 
progress nor die, the DOR will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects 
who start subsequent anticancer therapy  without a  prior reported progression will be censored at 
the last tum or assessments prior to ini tiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy . This endpo int 
will only be evaluated in subjects with object ive response of CR or PR.
The analysis of the primary endpoint in each cohort will occur at l east 6months after last pati ent 
first treatm entineach cohort.
8.3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)
Secondary  endpoints will be analyzed at the same time as the primary  endpoint.
8.3.2.1 Progre ssion Free Survival Based on BICRAssessment
PFS is defined as the time from first dosing date to the date of  the first docum ented progressio n 
using the IPCG Criteria for PCNSL and Lugano 2014 response evaluat ion for PTL, as determined 
by BICR, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported 
progression wi ll be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did not 
progress or die will be censored on the date of their last tum or assessment. Subjects who did not 
have any on study  assessments and did not di e will  be censored on the fi rst dosing date. Subj ects 
who started any subsequent anti-cancer therapy  without a prior reported progression will be 
censored at the last tumor assessment prior to init iation of the subsequent ant i-cancer therapy .

8.4.3 Safety Analyses
The safet y analys is will be performed in all treated subjects. Descript ive statistics of safet y will be 
presented using NCI CTCAE version 4.0 3by treatment group. AEs, drug -related AEs, SAEs, and 
drug-related SAEs will be tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v.4.03 criteria by system 
organ class and preferred term. On-study  lab parameters including hematol ogy, chemistry , liver 
funct ion,and renal funct ion will be summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v.4.03 criteria.
8.4.4 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
The nivolumab concentration -timedata obtained in this study  may be analyzed separately or 
combined wi th data f rom other studi es in the clinical  devel opment programs to de velop or refine 
popul ation PK models. These models may be used to evaluate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic 
covari ates on the PK of nivolumab and to determine measures of individual exposure (such as 
steady -state peak, trough, and time- averaged concentration). In addition, model-determined 
exposures may be used for exposure -response analyses. Results of populati on PK and exposure -
response analyses w ouldbe reported separately.
8.4.6 Outcomes Research Analyses
Analyses will be done by cohort.
8.4.6.1 EORTC QLQ- C30 and QLQ -BN-20
All rando mized subjects who have an assessment at baseline and at least 1 subsequent assessment 
while on treatm ent will be analyzed. Quest ionnaire completion rates at each assessment at each 
timepo int will be estimated for both the QLQ -C30 and the QL Q-BN20 . Scores and post -baseline 
changes in scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the QLQ -BN20 will be summarized at each

10 GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Term Definition
Complete AbstinenceComplete Abstinence is defined as complete avoidance of heterosexual 
intercourse and is an acceptable form of contraception for all study drugs. 
This also means that abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the 
patient. This does not mean periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, pr ofession of abstinence for entry into a clinical trial, 
post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal, which are not accep table 
methods of contraception. Women must co ntinue to have pregnancy tests.
Acceptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception’s must be 
discussed in the event that the subject chooses to forego complete 
abstinence.

APPENDIX 1 METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION
At a minimum, subjects must agree to use one highly effect ive method of  contracepti on as listed 
below:
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
Highly effect ive methods of contraception have a failure rate of < 1% when used consistent ly and 
correctly . WOCBP and female partners of male subjects, who are WOCBP, are expected to use 
one of the highly effective methods of contraception listed below. Male subj ects m ust inform their 
female partners who are WOCBP of the contraceptive requi rements of the protocol  and are 
expected to adhere to using contracepti on with their partner. Contraception methods are as follows:
1)Progestogen only  hormonal contracepti on assoc iated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation.
2)Horm onal methods of contracepti on including oral contraceptive pills containing combined 
estrogen + progesterone, vaginal ring, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs) 
such as Mirena 
3)Nonhorm onal IUDs, such as ParaGard
4)Bilateral tubal occlusio n
5)Vasectomised partner with documented azoospermia 90 days after procedure
Vasectomised partner is a highly effect ive birth control  method provi ded that partner 
is the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participan t and that the vasectomised 
partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success.
6)Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS).
7)Com plete abstinence
Com plete abst inence is defined as the com plete avoi dance of heterosexual intercourse 
(refer to Glo ssary  of Terms)
Com plete abstinence is an acceptable form of contraception for all study  drugs and 
must be used throughout the duration of the study treatment (plus approximately  5 half -
lives o f the invest igational drug plus 30 days).
It is not necessary t o use any  other m ethod of contraception when complete abstinence 
is elected.
Subjects who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy tests, as 
specified in Section 5.1.
Acceptable alternate methods of highly  effective contraception must be discussed in 
the event that the subject chooses to forego complete abstinence.
The reliabilit y of sexual abst inence needs to be evaluated in relat ion to the durati on of 
the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifest yle of the subject.
UNACCEPTABLE METHODS OF CONTRACEPTION
1)Periodic abst inence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods)
2)Withdrawal (co itus interruptus)

Com plete Response (CR): 
Com plete di sappearance of all enhancing abnormalities on gadolinium -enhanced MRI.
No evidence of active ocular lympho ma as defined by absence of cells in thevitreous and 
resol ution of any previ ously  documented retinal  or opti c nerve infiltrates. Chronic changes of 
the retinal pigment epithelium in the setting of a prior retinal or optic nerve infiltrate does not 
precl ude the definit ion of a  C R. Detailed ophth almo logic examinat ion with dilated fundus 
examinat ion, slit-lamp examinat ion and color photography  of the posteri or pole, and lumbar 
puncture for cytology  are requi red only if these studi es were initially positive or became 
positive during treatment and if clinically  indicated by  new symptom s or si gns.
Lumbar puncture for CSF cytology is necessary to confirm cyto logic response observed in the 
ventri cular CSF. 
At the time a CR is determined, the patient should have discont inued corticosteroids for at least 
2weeks. 
Residual lesio ns (other than lesio ns < 10 mm) if presum ed to be non-malignant shoul d be 
further invest igated (eg, by PET scans) before CR can be accepted. 
If there was evidence of PET abnorm ality suspicio us for sy stemic disease then PET has to b e

Repeat CSF cy tology, bone marrow biopsy  and aspi rate, and oph thalmo logic examinat ion 
if involved at baseline 
Unconfirmed CR (CRu): Any patient who fulfills all criteria for CR but continues to require 
corticosteroi d therapy  at any dose shoul d be considered an unconfirmed CR. Subjects with a 
persistent minor abnorm ality on follow-up ophthalmo logic examinat ion (persistent non- malignant 
cells in the vitreous, alteration of the retina/optic nerve that is not consistent with tumor infiltration) 
may be considered a CRu if this abnormalit y is unlikely  to represent ocul ar lympho ma.
Parti al response (PR) requires all o f the following:
A 50% decrease in the contrast -enhancing lesion seen on MRI as compared with baseline 
imaging.
Corti costeroi d dose i s irrelevant to the determinat ion of PR.
Ophthalmo logic examinat ion should show a decrease in the vitreous cell count or re tinal/opti c 
nerve cellular infiltrate but may continue to show persistent malignant or suspicious cells. 
Color photos of the posteri or pol e of the eye should be obtained to docum ent improvement in 
retinal/optic nerve infiltrates.
CSF cytologic examinat ion may be negat ive or continue to show persistent malignant or 
suspicious cells in subjects with a 50% decrease in the primary brain lesio n. 
No new sites of disease. In the setting of primary  leptom eningeal  lympho ma, PR is not 
recogni zed; all subjects shou ld be categori zed as CR, CRu, stable disease, or progressive 
disease.
Stabl e disease (SD) is defined as less than a PR but is not progressive disease (PD).
Progressive disease requi res the fo llowing:
A more than 25% increase in the contrast -enhancing lesion seen on MRI as compared with 
baseline or best response (comparison should be made to the smallest of mult iple lesio ns).
Progression of ocular disease as indicated by an increase in the vitreous cell count or 
progressive ret inal or optic nerve infiltrati on.
Appearance of any new lesion or site of disease (ocul ar, leptomeningeal or systemic) during 
or at the end of therapy .
Relapsed disease (only applicable to subjects with a prior CR, CRu) requires the following:
Appearance of any new lesio n.

*The recommendat ions from Lugano Classificat ion is to use a 5 point scale to assess the metabo lic 
response in PET -CT based response.
Response Evaluation for systemic lesions in PTL : 
CR (Complete Remission)
The designat ion of CR requires all of the fo llowing be m et:
1)Com plete di sappearance of all detectable clinical evidence o f disease .
a)PET-CT-based response: A score of 3 is considered to represent complete metabolic 
response .
b)CT based response: Target node/nodal masses must regress to 1.5 cm in LDi, with no 
extralymphat ic sites of disease
2)Organ invo lvement : Absence of organomegaly 
3)Bone marrow: No evidence of FDG- avid disease in marrow. If there was evidence of 
involvement of bone marrow with lympho ma at screening/baseline and a biopsy was 
perform ed (PTCL), a bone marrow biopsy  will be requi red to confirm CR.
4)The presence of residual symptom s in the absence of detectabl e disease by imaging does not 
precl ude the designat ion ofCR.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designat ion of PR requires all o f the following:
1)PET-CT based response: Score of 4 or 5 , provi ded  reduced uptake compared with base line 
and abse nce of structural progression development on CT Scan.

2)CT based response: 50% regression in SPD of upto 6 measurable nodal  and extranodal 
lesions
3)Splenic and hepat ic nodul es must regress by  50% in length beyo nd norm al.
4)Bone marrow : reduced uptake com pared wi th baseline. If there is evidence of nodal  response 
but persi stent f ocal changes in the m arrow consider further evaluat ion 
SD (Stable Disease)
SD is defined as the fo llowing:
1)PET-CT based response: no metabolic response, score of 4 or 5with no significant changes 
from baseline.
2) CT based response: < 50% decrease fro m baseline, absence of new lesio ns  
3)Bone m arrow: no change from baseline.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
1)PET-CT based response: Score of 4 or 5 with increase in int ensity from baseline or interim 
scan/ or any  new FDG avi d focus consistent wi th malignant lympho ma 
2)CT based response: New node, new or recurrent spleno megaly, progression of exist ing lesio ns  
Response Evaluation for CNS lesions in PTL: 
The IPCG criteria as descri bed in Appendix 3 will be used for PTL pati ents wi th CNS l esions.

APPENDIX 6 TUMOR FLARE
Tumor Flare in CNS tumors :
Tumor flare (TF) : Immunomodulatory agents, such asimmune checkpoint inhibitors, may be
associated withclinical andimaging findings during treatment ,suggestive of progressive disease
(PD) despite evidence ofclinical benefit (tumor flareorpseudo -progression) .1,2This
pheno menonhasbeen well described withcheckpoint blockade therapy insolidtumors,with an 
incidence of 10% in melanoma and 3% in lung cancer.3Furthermore, this has also been reported 
anecdotally inlympho mas.4Pseudoprogression appears as tumor progression or radiographic 
progression wit h target lesio n size increase. Often it may be associated with mixed responses, 
which include good response (i.e., shrinkage) but increased tumor size or even new lesio n 
appeara nce elsewhere. The pati ent m ay or m ay not present wi th deteri oration in clinical 
symptoms. Considering this finding as PDcouldlead to patientsbeing prematurely removed
from atreatment fromwhich theyactually stand to benefit. Therefore it is important to remain 
cognizant of this effect during treatment. 
Few important characteristics observed with TFare outlined below:
Tumor inflammat ion is the intended effect of ant i-tumor immune therapies , so tumor 
flare is consistent with eventual benefit. As it is important not to abandon immunotherapy 
prem aturely , these observat ions have led to development of immune -related response 
criteria.1,4
TFmay be m ore cl inically evident , i.e. lead to early development of symptoms, in CNS 
tumors than in tumors of  other sites due to their intracranial location . 
TF is indist inguishable fro m disease progression (thus so metimes called 
‘pseudoprogression’), and thus presents a majo r clinical challenge .
It is ordinarily not possible to determine whether increased neurol ogic symptom s and/or 
radiographic findings represent tum or progression or transi ent TF. Observation, so metimes 
prolonged, isrequi red to m ake this determinat ion.
In some setti ngs, m oreover, adverse effects of other concomitant treatment (such as RT) 
may be equally as likely. 
Less frequent ly adverse effects of immunotherapy on normal brain t issues may be 
possible.
In other Central Nervous Sy stem trials o f nivolumab (al one or wi th ipilimumab), clinical 
findings of TF have been highly variable, based on the location of the lesio n, including 
confusio n, aphasia, hemiplegia, seizure, etc. Because of this neuro logic heterogeneit y, we have 
used the overall diagnostic t erm “Tum or Flare” in order to capture it system atically in our 
adverse event database.

Treatment strategies during TF :
Corti costeroi ds (e.g. dexamethasone 4- 8 mg/day) are generally fairly effect ive in 
reversing neurologic dysfunct ion, perhaps more effect ive than might be seen with disease 
progression. They may  be tapered as quickly as tolerated (in contrast to systemic IMAEs 
such as pneumo nitis, for which very  slow tapering is advised). If acute or severe 
neuro logic deteri oration, dexamethasone bo lus of 10- 20 m g intravenously  or 
corticosteroi d equivalent, once ,can be considered, fo llowed by a smaller dose for 
maintenance such as 2 -4mg daily, to be rapidly tapered off once neurologic deficit s 
improve.
If symptoms are moderate to severe, delay of immune treatment is appropriate. 
Generalized effects of increased pressure, including midline shift, hydrocephalus, 
obliteration o f sulci, etc. have also been noted, but are non -specific. 
Imaging changes are s ometimes m ore stri king than clinical AEs; if radiographic findings 
are not associated with clinical deterioration, immune treatment need not be delayed. 
Cerebral edema on imaging by itself need not be a criteria for drug discont inuat ion.
Invest igations on potenti al radi ographic features which could assist in discriminat ing TF
from disease progression are in progress.
If surgically accessible, a diagnostic biopsy may  be feasible. 
As al ways, there is concern that a representative sample be obtained. 
A predo minance of necrosis, and inflammat ion is consistent with TF, and very  helpful  in 
allaying the concern generated by  clinical and imaging changes. Unfortunately , of course, 
a biopsy may  confi rm tumor progressi on.
In such cases, we would encourage that the im mune treatment be resumed. 
Every  patient is different ;consultat ion with the Medi cal Monitor and review of the imaging is 
often useful .
